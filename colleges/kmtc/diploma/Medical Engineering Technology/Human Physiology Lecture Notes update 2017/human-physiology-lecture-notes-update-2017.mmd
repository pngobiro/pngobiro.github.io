( $\mu \mathrm{m}=$ micrometer, $1 / 1000 \mathrm{~mm}, 1 / 1,000,000 \mathrm{~m}$ )
- most cells have 3 major subdivisions

b. contains organelles
(1) separation of chemical reactions
(2) specialized for a particular function
c. cytosol is semiliquid, site of chemical reactions
- Organelles (see table Summary of Cytoplasm Components)
- endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
1. interconnected fluid-filled membranous system
2. two types
a. smooth - interconnected tubules
b. rough - interconnected flattened sacs
(1) has ribosomes which help in protein synthesis (cell also has "free" ribosomes)
3. rough $E R$
a. synthesizes proteins and lipids, releases them to ER lumen
(1) some will be secreted from the cell (hormones, enzymes), some will become new membrane for the cell or its organelles, or other protein parts of organelles (2) once in the lumen the protein can be modified (pieces removed, sugars added)
4. smooth ER
a. in most cells it packages and transports products of rough ER (sections pinch off and become transport vesicles, move to Golgi complex)
b. some cells have extensive specialized smooth ER
(1) lipid synthesis (steroid hormone secreting cells)
(2) detoxify harmful substances (liver cells)
(3) store calcium (muscle cells)
- Golgi complex
1. layers of flattened membranous sacs (cisternae)
2. processes ER products into final form
3. sorts and sends products to appropriate place
a. transport vesicles take products to locations in or outside cell, coating made up of proteins that recognize the product and its destination
b. secretory vesicles transport products out of specialized cells, fuses with plasma membrane (secretion, exocytosis)

\section*{- lysosomes}
1. membranous sacs containing hydrolytic enzymes
2. digest cellular debris and other substances (old organelles, bacteria)
a. material from outside cell can be brought in to be digested by lysosome - endocytosis (membrane surrounds substance and vesicle pinches off)
(1) pinocytosis - fluids, "cell drinking"
(2) phagocytosis - large particles, "cell eating"
b. cell can use digested material
- peroxisomes
1. membranous sacs containing oxidative enzymes
a. use oxygen to remove hydrogen from molecules (detoxify wastes and other chemicals like alcohol)
- mitochondria
1. have double membrane
a. inner membrane has folds called cristae (folds increase surface area)
b. matrix is gel inside
2. play a role in apoptosis (programmed cell death)
3. converts energy from food into usable energy for the cell - ATP (adenosine triphosphate)
a. energy in chemical bonds of food molecules can't be used directly
b. ATP $\rightarrow$ ADP $+\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}+$ useful energy
4. three major steps in forming ATP (called cellular respiration)
a. glycolysis
(1) in cytosol
(2) glucose $\rightarrow 2$ pyruvic acid (a series of steps)
(3) yields 2 ATP/glucose (not very efficient by itself)
(4) attach H to carrier molecules
b. citric acid cycle (also called Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle)
(1) pyruvic acid is transported to mitochondrial matrix
(2) pyruvic acid $\rightarrow$ acetyl CoA
(3) acetyl CoA enters citric acid cycle, which is a series of reactions
(4) $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is produced
(5) hydrogen atoms are attached to carrier molecules ( $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; FAD, flavine adenine dinucleotide; become NADH and $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ )
(6) 2 more ATP/original glucose
c. electron transport chain/oxidative phosphorylation
(1) occurs on inner mitochondrial membrane which contains electron carrier molecules (each H contains one electron, moving electrons means moving energy)
(2) NADH and FADH 2 from glycolysis and citric acid cycle enter chain, the electron is removed from each H and passed through the series of electron carriers in the membrane, finally ending up on $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (the final electron acceptor) $(3)$ the energy from the electrons is used to transport $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(lost its electron) across the inner membrane; this creates a concentration gradient - more $\mathrm{H}^{+}$on one side of the membrane than the other - so $\mathrm{H}^{+}$will flow back across the inner membrane
(4) $\mathrm{H}^{+}$can only flow back across at certain points - it flows through channels that contain ATP synthase (the enzyme that makes ATP) which is activated by $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ flowing by
(5) yields 28 ATP/original glucose
(6) steps 3 and 4 are known as the chemiosmotic mechanism (chemical reaction coupled to flow of a substance across a membrane)
(7) because $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is used to make ATP, it is called oxidative phosphorylation
(glycolysis can happen anaerobically - w/o $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ - but this alone is not very efficient)
(8) $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is formed from $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$
(9) passing electrons in steps means energy is released slowly (releasing it all at once would create so much heat it would kill the cell)
5. not all the energy in glucose is used to make ATP (no energy transfer is $100 \%$ efficient)
6. the building blocks of fats and proteins can be used to make ATP - they can be made into intermediate molecules in the citric acid cycle
7. ATP is used for all the cell's energy needs (making and transporting substances, mechanical work like muscle contraction)
- vaults
1. non-membranous, octagonal organelle made of protein
2. probably used to transport molecules from nucleus to other cell locations (mRNA, ribosomes)
3. may help make cancer cells drug resistant
- Cytosol
- $55 \%$ of cell volume
- composition varies in different areas of cell
- involved in several kinds of cell activities

a. chemical reactions involving synthesizing and breaking down small organic molecules
(e.g., sugars, amino acids, fatty acids)
b. provides raw material for structure and function
2. ribosome protein synthesis
a. free ribosomes make enzymes for use in cytosol
3. storage of fat and glycogen (stored form of glucose)
a. inclusions - masses of stored nutrients
b. can be broken down when needed to make ATP
- Cytoskeleton
- complex protein network running through cytosol
1. supports and organizes parts of cell
2. controls movements of cell and within cell
1. microtubules
a. largest of cytoskeletal parts
(1) made mostly of the protein tubulin
b. maintain shape of cell
(1) early in cell development
(2) in asymmetrical cells
c. transport of vesicles
(1) special motor proteins (e.g. kinesin) attach to vesicle and microtubule, pulling vesicle along
d. movement of cilia and flagella
(1) project from surface of cell
(2) cilia are shorter, hairlike, many on a single cell; move substances across surface of cell (respiratory tract, oviduct)
(3) flagella are long, one per human cell; move whole cell (sperm)
(4) both have same basic structure of grouped microtubules; movement is produced when a motor protein (dynein) displaces tubules relative to one another
e. formation of mitotic spindle
(1) formed during mitosis (division of nucleus) and directs movement of chromosomes (DNA)
(2) centrioles (a pair of microtubule groups) assemble the mitotic spindle
2. microfilaments
a. one of smaller elements of cytoskeleton
(1) many made of the protein actin
b. cellular contractile systems
(1) muscle cells
(2) contractile ring that divides a cell - pinches cell together and separates halves

\section*{Chapter $3 \quad$ Plasma Membrane \& Membrane Potential}

\section*{- Basics}
- selectively permeable - controls what gets in and out of cell
- Membrane Structure
1. basic membrane structure is a phospholipid bilayer
a. hydrophilic (water loving) heads are polar, face outward toward water
b. hydrophobic (water fearing) tails are nonpolar, face inward away from water
(1) barrier to diffusion - stops water soluble molecules from passing through
(2) water itself is small enough to get through
c. responsible for membrane fluidity
2. cholesterol
a. between phospholipids
b. contributes to fluidity and stability
3. proteins
a. some span the membrane
(1) selective channels to transport substances across membrane (e.g., ions), opening filled with water, channel is specific
(2) carrier proteins also transport specific molecules across membrane
b. some on one side of membrane
(1) receptors - bind with molecules on outer surface and initiate changes in cell (chemicals in blood only influence cells with the right receptors)
(2) membrane bound enzymes - chemical reactions at inner or outer membrane surface
(3) filamentous meshwork on inner side bind with cytoskeleton to maintain cell shape and for movement
(4) cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) - stick out from outer surface and secure cell to other cells (caherins "zip" cells together in tissues/organs), also cell communication (growth, defense responses), integrins span the membrane and link cytoskeleton to external environment and relay regulatory signals (5) some allow cells to recognize "self" and interact with one another (often glycoproteins)
4. carbohydrates
a. on outer surface, bound to membrane proteins and lipids (glycoproteins, glycolipids)
b. important in recognition of cells of same type and tissue organization
c. involved in tissue growth (cells won't overgrow)
- structure known as fluid mosaic model
- Cell to cell adhesions
- carbohydrates on membrane surface help arrange cells into groups, which are held together in various ways
1. CAMs
2. extracellular matrix (connective tissues)
a. cells may not be joined directly to other cells, but embedded in matrix of carbohydrates and protein fibers
(1) collagen - resists tension (e.g., skin)
(2) elastin - stretch and recoil (e.g., skin, lungs)
(3) fibronectin - holds cells in position (all over body)
b. substances diffuse through, going between blood and tissues
c. important in normal cell functioning
3. specialized junctions
a. desmosomes - cells join at particular spots, found all over body, particularly where stretch occurs (e.g., skin, muscle)
b. tight junctions - impermeable barrier, common in epithelial sheets where they prevent leakage
c. gap junctions - cells linked by protein tunnels, allows small molecules to pass between cells, important in some cells that transmit electrical activity (e.g., cardiac muscle)
- Membrane Transport (see table Methods of Membrane Transport)
- two factors influencing transport - solubility of the substance in lipid, and size of substance
1. small, uncharged or nonpolar molecules move through lipid bilayer (e.g., $\mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, fatty acids)
2. ions and small polar molecules (like glucose) can move through channels or by carrier proteins if the right transporter exists
3. substances too big or without a special protein transporter need special mechanisms to get through the membrane

\section*{- Passive Transport (no ATP used)}
1. diffusion - molecules move down their concentration gradient (greater $\rightarrow$ lesser concentration), charged particles move down electrochemical gradients
a. simple diffusion - substance moves through lipid bilayer or protein channels (e.g., $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, some ions)
b. osmosis - water moves down its concentration gradient
c. facilitated diffusion uses a carrier protein that binds to the molecule to be transported and brings it to the other side of the membrane (e.g., glucose)
2. Filtration - water and solutes forced through membrane by pressure (e.g., in kidneys)
- Active Transport (ATP used)
1. carrier proteins transport substance against its concentration gradient (needs ATP to change conformation)
a. primary active transport - energy from ATP used directly to transport a substance (e.g. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump, in all cells)
b. secondary active transport - driven by gradients set up by primary active transport
(1) in the digestive tract glucose and amino acids are "dragged along" with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ diffusing into cell $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right.$gradient set up by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump)
2. vesicular transport (bulk transport) - large molecules or multimolecular substances enclosed in pieces of membrane
a. endocytosis (pino/phagocytosis)
(1) fuse with lysosomes which break down substance and release products to cell (e.g., bacteria)
(2) vesicle travels to opposite side of cell and releases contents (cells lining capillaries)
b. exocytosis
(1) secretion of large polar molecules like hormones and enzymes
(2) adding components to membrane
- Intercellular communication and signal transduction
- cells must communicate so they can coordinate their activities (maintain homeostasis, control growth and development)
- 3 types of intercellular communication
1. gap junctions
a. small molecules and ions directly exchanged between cells
b. important in spread of electrical signals (cardiac and smooth muscle, very rarely neurons)
2. signal molecules on cell surface allow direct interaction
a. phagocytes (body defense cells) recognize and kill invading cells
3. chemical messengers
a. a specific chemical is made by special cells
(1) acts on target cells, which then respond appropriately
b. 4 types
(1) paracrines - act locally (e.g., histamine in inflammatory response)
(2) neurotransmitters - act locally; nerve cells release them to other nerve cells, muscles, or glands
(3) hormones - acts over long distances, released into blood by endocrine glands
(4) neurohormones - act over long distances, released into blood by special nerve cells (neurosecretory neurons)

\section*{- Pathways of chemical messengers}
1. specialized protein receptors on plasma membrane bind with a particular messenger
a. triggers a sequence of events that control a particular cell activity
b. many possible responses
c. 3 general ways of eliciting a response
(1) opening (most commonly) or closing chemically-gated receptor channels in the membrane (regulates movement of ions in/out of cell)
(2) activating receptor-enzymes
(3) transferring signal to second messenger (an intracellular chemical messenger) which initiates a series of events inside cell
2. channel regulation
a. channel proteins have the ability to change shape and thus open/close (act like gates)
b. receptor binding site is part of the channel, messenger binds $\rightarrow$ channel opens
c. eg., neurotransmitters trigger movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, or both across the membrane, which changes the electrical activity of cell (muscle and nerve cells)
3. tyrosine kinase pathway
a. messenger binds and activates a receptor-enzyme (usually a protein kinase that phosphorylates another protein)
b. typically a cascade is initiated which ultimately activates a particular protein that brings about the response
c. eg., insulin and growth factors
4. second messenger systems (most common pathway)
a. general process
(1) messenger binds to receptor (G-protein-coupled receptor)
(2) enzyme on cytoplasmic side of membrane activated by G-protein
(3) intracellular second messengers are activated, and diffuse through the cell to trigger appropriate response
(4) typically a cascade is initiated and response accomplished by altering structure/function of particular proteins
b. cAMP pathway (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, most common)
(1) messenger binds to receptor
(2) activates G protein which activates adenylyl cyclase (on cytoplasmic side of membrane)
(3) ATP $\rightarrow$ cAMP, which diffuses through cell
(4) cAMP-dependent protein kinase activated, then phosphorylates a particular intracellular protein (this changes the protein's shape/function, bringing about the appropriate response)
(5) can switch cellular processes on or off, eg., heart rate changes, formation of sex hormones in typical female, breakdown of stored glucose in liver, water conservation in kidneys
c. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ pathway
(1) messenger binds to receptor
(2) activates G protein which activates phospholipase C (on cytoplasmic side of membrane)
(3) $\mathrm{PIP}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{DAG}+\mathrm{IP}_{3}$
(phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, diacylglycerol, inositoltriphosphate)
(4) $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ increases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in cytosol (from stores in ER ), $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ diffuses through cell and binds to the protein calmodulin, which in turn activates another protein, bringing about the appropriate response
(5) pathway important in cell movement such as smooth muscle contraction
d. the two major second messenger systems can interact, and there are others
e. very low concentrations of first messengers trigger large responses - one messenger molecule can result in millions of product molecules
f. receptors can be regulated (number, affinity for messenger)

\section*{- Apoptosis}
1. an interesting example of a signal transduction pathway
2. programmed cell death
a. development
b. tissue turnover
c. immune system (infected cells and worn-out phagocytes)
d. old, damaged or mutated cells
3. cell detaches from neighboring cells and shrinks, killed from the inside by caspases, which take apart DNA, cytoskeleton, etc.
a. cells normally receive signals for survival, which block the pathway causing apoptosis
(1) absence of growth factors or detachment from extracellular matrix act as triggers
b. can receive "death signals" that override life pathway
c. problems in pathways likely involved in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and AIDS
d. not enough apoptosis may play role in cancer
e. mitochondria play a role (release cytochrome c which activates caspases)
4. does not trigger an inflammatory response
- Membrane Potential
- separation of charges across a membrane
1. separated charges have the potential to do work - electrical force of attraction can be harnessed
2. measured in millivolts ( mV ) - more charges separated $\rightarrow$ greater potential
3. all plasma membranes have potential
4. due to unequal distribution of a few key ions
- ions involved
1. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$
2. $\mathrm{K}^{+}$
3. $A^{-}$(large anionic intracellular proteins)
- $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump
1. responsible both directly and indirectly for establishing membrane potential
2. directly generates about $20 \%$ of potential
a. actively transports $3 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$out for every $2 \mathrm{~K}^{+}$in
(1) leaves cell slightly negative inside
(2) establishes concentration gradients ( $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$high outside, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$high inside)
(3) passively, $\mathrm{Na}^{+} \rightarrow$ in, $\mathrm{K}^{+} \rightarrow$ out
3. indirectly generates other $80 \%$ of membrane potential
a. membrane is more permeable to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$than to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$(more $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels open)
b. $\mathrm{K}^{+}$will passively flow out, increasing membrane potential
(1) $\mathrm{K}^{+}$flows out until concentration gradient is balance by electrical gradient (negative charges inside attract $\mathrm{K}^{+}$)
c. very little $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$leaks back in (closed channels)
4. leads to resting membrane potential of -70 mV in a typical nerve cell (sign means more negative inside)
- other effects
1. $A^{-}$cannot leave the cell (too large)
a. contributes to negative charges that balance leakage of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$out of cell
2. $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$distribution influenced by membrane potential
a. high outside
b. negative charge inside cell drives $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$out (cells permeable to $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, but most do not actively transport it)
- purpose of membrane potential
1. altering membrane potential results in nerve impulses and muscle contraction
a. may be involved in activity of secretory cells
b. significance in other cells not understood

\section*{Chapter $4 \quad$ Neuronal Physiology}
- Terms
- excitable tissues: capable of producing electrical signals (transient, rapid changes in membrane potential), nerve \& muscle
- resting membrane potential: the membrane potential that exists when no net changes in potential are occurring
- graded potentials: local changes in membrane potential that vary in magnitude (flow of ions)
- action potentials: brief, rapid reversals in membrane potential, which can spread throughout the membrane (flow of ions)
- voltage-gated channels: membrane channels that open or close in response to changes in potential
- polarization: a membrane that has potential is polarized
- depolarization: a decrease in membrane potential (inside becomes more positive)
- triggering event: event that initiates a depolarization (stimulus like light or touch, chemical messenger)
- hyperpolarization: an increase in membrane potential (inside becomes more negative)
- repolarization: return to resting potential after a depolarization
- Graded Potentials
- magnitude of graded potential related to magnitude of triggering event
1. stronger trigger $\rightarrow$ greater magnitude of change in potential
- current flow (movement of charges)
1. when a graded potential occurs, a piece of the membrane (called the active area) has a different potential than the rest of the membrane (which is at resting potential, called the inactive area)
a. current flows between active area and adjacent inactive areas (opposite charges attract)
b. previously inactive areas become active and more current flow occurs
2. spread of graded potential is decremental
a. decreases as it moves along the membrane
b. current leaks into ECF
c. function as signals over short distances
3. usually not an actual reversal of charges - just a reduction in potential (inside becomes less negative than before, small depolarization)
4. important for nerve and muscle cells (e.g., postsynaptic potentials)
- Action Potentials (AP)
- can be transmitted over long distances without losing strength
- Depolarization
1. triggering event causes depolarization to occur relatively slowly until threshold potential is reached (about -50 to -55 mV )
a. once threshold is reached, membrane quickly depolarizes to +30 mV
(1) when triggering event begins depolarization, some of the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels open, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$flows into cell (proteins that make up the channel have charged portions, shape change occurs as those charges interact with charges surrounding the membrane)
(2) this further depolarizes the membrane, causing even more $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels to open
(3) at threshold all the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are open and there is an explosive increase in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$permeability $\left(\mathrm{P} \mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$
(4) at peak depolarization, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels close (the channel is constructed so that the same depolarization that opens them also closes them)
- Repolarization begins
1. as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels close, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels open ( $\mathrm{P} \mathrm{K}^{+}$increases) due to delayed voltage-gated response to the depolarization, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$flows out of cell
2. this restores internal negativity
3. as repolarization progresses...
a. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels resume original conformation (closed but capable of opening)
b. newly opened $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels close
(1) hyperpolarization occurs before channels close (membrane even more negative than at resting potential)
(2) resting potential restored
- AP lasts about 1 millisecond
- ion gradient restored
1. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump restores ion gradients
a. important for long term maintenance of gradient
b. not necessary between APs
(1) ion shifts during AP are not so great that they wipe out concentration gradients, so many APs can occur in succession
- Neurons (nerve cells)
- 3 basic parts
1. cell body
a. houses nucleus and organelles
b. receives signals from other cells (contains receptors for chemical messengers)
2. dendrites
a. projections from cell body
b. increase surface area for receiving signals
3. axon (nerve fiber)
a. single elongated projection
b. conducts APs away from cell body
c. often has collaterals (side branches)
d. axon hillock (part of cell body and first part of axon) is area where APs generated in most neurons
e. ends in branches called axon terminals that release chemical messengers
f. may be less than a mm or more than a $m$
- Propagation of an AP
- Conduction by local current flow (contiguous conduction)
1. AP at axon hillock
a. local current flow between this active area and adjacent inactive area causes new AP
b. AP passed section by section along axon
- Saltatory conduction
1. occurs in myelinated fibers
a. special cells form barrier that is impermeable to ions
(1) wrap around fiber
(2) mostly lipids
(3) formed by oligodendrocytes in central nervous system (CNS), by Schwann cells in peripheral nervous system (PNS)
b. nodes of Ranvier
(1) bare spaces between myelin
(2) contain $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels
2. AP "jumps" from node to node
a. much faster
b. conserves energy
(1) fewer ions move so $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump uses less ATP restoring gradients
- fiber diameter influences speed of propagation
1. larger fiber diameter $\rightarrow$ faster conduction
2. large myelinated fibers found in areas where information must be transmitted quickly (e.g., fibers innervating skeletal muscle)
3. smaller unmyelinated fibers found in areas where speed not critical to function (e.g. fibers innervating digestive tract)
- Refractory period
1. ensures APs propagated in only one direction
2. membrane that just had AP not very sensitive to further stimulation
a. absolute refractory period

- Synapses and neuronal integration
- neuron terminates at...
1. muscle
2. gland
3. another neuron
- Synapse basics
1. junction between axon terminal of one neuron and dendrites or cell body of next neuron
2. most neurons have thousands of synaptic inputs
3. anatomy of a synapse
a. presynaptic neuron
(1) conducts APs toward synapse
(2) ends in swelling called synaptic knob, which contains synaptic vesicles that store a specific neurotransmitter
b. postsynaptic neuron
(1) conducts APs away from synapse
(2) portion at synapse called subsynaptic membrane
c. synaptic cleft
(1) space between pre and postsynaptic neurons
4. generally operates in one direction (changes in membrane potential in presynaptic neuron bring changes in membrane potential of postsynaptic neuron)
5. basic synapse function
a. AP reaches presynaptic neuron axon terminal
b. voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in synaptic knob open
c. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx induces release of neurotransmitter from synaptic vesicles by exocytosis
d. neurotransmitter diffuses across cleft and binds with receptor sites on subsynaptic membrane
e. triggers opening of specific ion channels in subsynaptic membrane (chemically-gated channels)
- Two types of synapses
1. excitatory synapse
a. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels open
b. net movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in
c. results in small depolarization called an EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential), a
kind of graded potential
d. takes many EPSPs to bring membrane to threshold and generate an AP (each one brings membrane closer to threshold)
2. inhibitory synapse
a. opens channels for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$
b. $\mathrm{K}^{+} \rightarrow$ out, or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-} \rightarrow$ in
c. results in small hyperpolarization called an IPSP (inhibitory postsynaptic potential)
d. each IPSP moves membrane further away from threshold
3. a given synapse is either always excitatory or always inhibitory
4. the same neurotransmitter is generally released at a given synapse
(1) some nts are always excitatory
(2) some nts are always inhibitory
(3) some nts produce an IPSP at one synapse and an EPSP at another synapse
- Synaptic delay
1. takes time for signal to cross synapse (. $5-1 \mathrm{msec}$ )
2. the more synapses a signal must cross, the longer the time needed for response to occur (total reaction time)
- Removal of nt from the synaptic cleft
1. as long as the nt is bound to receptor, IPSP or EPSP continues
2. quickly removed from synapse
a. diffuses away from synaptic cleft
b. inactivated by enzymes in subsynaptic membrane
c. actively transported back to presynaptic neuron
- Neurotransmitters and second messenger systems

c. some act like classical nts
d. most are neuromodulators
(1) don't cause EPSPs/IPSPs
(2) cause long term changes in synapse
(3) often use second messenger systems
- Presynaptic inhibition and facilitation
1. a third neuron may influence the effect of one neuron on another
a. probably involves $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
b. can influence inputs from certain neurons while not affecting other inputs
- Convergence and divergence
1. in convergence a single neuron is influenced by many other neurons synapsing on it
2. in divergence a single neuron influences many other neurons
- The various types of influences result in a great deal of complexity and ability to control what information is passed on

\section*{PNS: Afferent Division}
- Basics
- information carried toward CNS
1. from viscera
2. from surface areas
a. somatic sensation - includes somesthetic sensation (skin) and proprioception (muscles, joints, inner ear)
b. special senses - vision, hearing, taste, smell
- perception: our conscious interpretation of the world created by the brain from a pattern of nerve impulses from sensory receptors
- Receptor Physiology
- peripheral ends of afferent neurons have receptors that detect stimuli (changes in internal or external environment)
1. convert stimulus to an AP (transduction)
2. each kind of receptor is specialized to respond to one kind of stimulus (the adequate stimulus)
a. receptor may respond to other stimuli as well, but it will lead to the sensation usually detected by that receptor
3. receptor may be a special cell associated with the peripheral ending of a neuron
- types of receptors (based on what they respond to)
1. photoreceptors - light
2. mechanoreceptors - mechanical stimuli
3. thermoreceptors - temperature
4. osmoreceptors - concentration of body fluids
5. chemoreceptors - chemicals
6. nociceptors (pain receptors) - tissue damage or distortion (intense stimulation of any receptor perceived as pain)
- graded receptor potentials
1. stimulus alters membrane permeability of receptor
a. opens ion channels - main effect is $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$flowing in (depolarization), if summation of depolarizations reaches threshold, AP generated (called a generator potential)
b. if receptor is a separate cell, it releases a chemical messenger that opens chemically-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in the nearby neuron, which generates an AP when threshold reached (called a receptor potential)
c. stronger stimuli $\rightarrow$ greater frequency of APs (frequency code)
d. stronger stimuli often result in stimulation of a larger area $\rightarrow$ more receptors activated (population code)
- adaptation
1. continued stimulation does not result in APs
2. tonic receptors do not adapt or adapt slowly
a. important when continuous information is useful (posture and balance sensed by proprioceptors, nociceptors)
3. phasic receptors adapt quickly
a. useful when more information not necessary (touch)
b. will exhibit an off response - respond again when stimulus removed
4. mechanisms not well known, may be inactivation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels
- somatosensory pathways
1. first-order sensory neuron is an afferent neuron with receptor, synapses with...
2. second-order sensory neuron in spinal cord or medulla, synapses with...
3. third-order sensory neuron - in thalamus, and so on
4. process of sending information through a particular pathway is projection, results in knowledge of type, location and intensity of stimulus
- acuity (discriminative ability)
1. each sensory neuron has a receptive field (area it responds to)
2. greater density of receptors results in greater acuity
3. lateral inhibition also results in greater acuity
a. areas nearest stimulus stimulated to a greater extent, areas farther away stimulated less
b. most strongly stimulated pathway inhibits other pathways via inhibitory neurons in CNS
- Pain
- protective (tissue damage is occurring or about to occur)
- 3 categories of nociceptors
1. mechanical
2. thermal
3. polymodal
- sensitized by prostaglandins (fatty acid derivatives from lipid bilayer, act locally)
- fast pain pathway
1. from mechanical and thermal nociceptors on large, myelinated fibers
2. localized, sharp sensation
- slow pain pathway
1. from polymodal nociceptors on small, unmyelinated $C$ fibers
2. dull, aching, poorly localized sensation
3. activated by chemicals released from damaged tissue(e.g., bradykinin)

\section*{- CNS connections}
1. first-order afferent fibers synapse in spinal cord and release substance $P$ (nt unique to pain fibers)
2. second-order fibers go to reticular formation (increases overall alertness) and somatosensory cortex via thalamus (localizes stimulus)
a. signals passed to hypothalamus and limbic system, emotional and behavioral responses occur
3. abnormal, chronic pain may result from abnormal signaling within pain pathways
- built-in analgesic system
1. neural mechanisms can suppress transmission in pain pathways at the spinal cord (presynaptic inhibition of release of substance $P$ )

2. norepinephrine (NE)
- ANS
- pathways typically have a 2 neuron chain extending from CNS to the innervated organ
1. preganglionic fiber has cell body in CNS, synapses with postganglionic fiber in a ganglion, postganglionic fiber innervates the effector organ
2. sympathetic
a. preganglionic fibers originate in thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord
b. preganglionic fibers are short, synapse in a sympathetic chain ganglion along the spinal cord (release ACh)
(1) some pass through the ganglion and synapse later in collateral ganglion nearer to the innervated organ
c. postganglionic fibers are long, terminate on effector organ (release NE)
3. parasympathetic
a. preganglionic fibers originate in brain stem or sacral spinal cord
b. preganglionic fibers are long, synapse in terminal ganglia in or near effector organs (release ACh)
c. postganglionic fibers are short, end on the effector organ (release ACh)
- fibers releasing ACh called cholinergic fibers, fibers releasing NE called adrenergic fibers
- postganglionic fibers terminate in many swelling called varicosities, which release nt over a large area of the organ (influence whole organs)
- dual innervation
1. most visceral organs innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers
2. generally have opposite effects
3. either can be excitatory or inhibitory depending on which organ
4. both systems usually partially active
a. called sympathetic or parasympathetic tone, or tonic activity
5. when one increases its rate of firing and the other decreases it is called dominance
a. sympathetic dominance results in increase of oxygen/nutrient rich
blood flow to skeletal muscles (vessels dilate), heart beats faster and more forcefully,
blood pressure increases, respiratory airways dilate, glycogen and fat stores broken
down, digestive and urinary activities inhibited, pupils dilate, sweating
b. parasympathetic dominance results in normal resting functions like digestion and urinary function being increased, while inhibiting sympathetic activities
6. allows precise control over body functions
7. exceptions...
a. innervated blood vessels (most arterioles and veins) have only sympathetic fibers (regulated by increasing/decreasing rate from tonic level)
b. most sweat glands have only sympathetic fibers, and postganglionic fibers release

2. inhibition due to presynaptic inhibition
3. each motor neuron influenced by EPSPs and IPSPs from brain and spinal cord
4. subject to conscious and subconscious control (posture, balance, stereotypical movements)
- neuromuscular junction
1. large myelinated fibers branch into many unmyelinated terminals

(2) similar to EPSP, but greater magnitude (more nt involved, larger surface

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
area with more receptors, more ion channels open)
(3) a graded potential, magnitude depends on amount of ACh and duration of binding
f. a large enough EPP triggers AP in muscle fiber membrane surrounding motor end plate (typically one EPP enough)
(1) spreads by local current flow throughout muscle fiber, resulting in muscle contraction
g. an enzyme in motor end plate breaks down ACh to end APs
(1) acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
(2) allows control of movement

\section*{Chapter $8 \quad$ Muscle Physiology}
- Basics
- 3 types of muscle
1. skeletal (striated, voluntary, multinucleate)
a. movement of whole body or parts
2. cardiac (striated, involuntary, one nucleus)
a. pump blood
3. smooth (unstriated, involuntary, one nucleus)
a. movement of substances through hollow organs
- Skeletal muscle
- functional anatomy
1. whole muscle
a. made up of long cells bundled with connective tissue
b. connective tissue extends to form tendons attaching muscle to bone
2. muscle cell (fiber)
a. contains myofibrils (specialized organelles) which are made up of protein filaments (myofilaments)
b. thick filaments
(1) made of myosin molecules, each of which has a head and tail end
(2) heads form cross bridges, have an actin binding site and ATPase site
c. thin filaments
(1) made mostly of actin molecules, each of which has a myosin binding site (cross bridge binding site)
(2) tropomyosin blocks binding sites when cell at rest
(3) troponin holds tropomyosin in place, has $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding site
d. thick and thin filaments arranged into sarcomeres (functional units that contract) this arrangement results in striations
e. plasma membrane also called sarcolemma
(1) forms T tubules, which project into cell (continuous with surface membrane, allowing electrical activity at cell surface to be transmitted throughout cell)
f. sarcoplasmic reticulum is modified smooth ER
(1) network of tubules surrounding myofibrils
(2) ends of each portion expand into sacs called terminal cisternae (a.k.a. lateral sacs, stores $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ )
- Contraction (excitation-contraction coupling and the sliding filament mechanism)
1. EPP at motor end plate results in AP
a. spreads throughout cell surface and $T$ tubules by local current flow
2. triggers release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from terminal cisternae
3. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to troponin, changing its shape so that it moves tropomyosin out of the way of the binding sites
4. cross bridge attachment - myosin heads bind to actin
5. power stroke - myosin had uses energy of ATP to pivot and pull thin filaments toward the center of sarcomere
6. cross bridge detachment - a new ATP molecule binds to myosin head, cross bridge releases
7. "cocking" of the myosin head - ATP $\rightarrow$ ADP $+P_{i}$ by ATPase, myosin head returns to original position (high energy conformation)
8. steps 3-7 repeat until full contraction reached and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ used up (called cross bridge cycling)
a. once AP is over (1-2 msec) $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ no longer released
b. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{ATPase}$ pump transports $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ back into SR
c. troponin and tropomyosin again cover binding sites
d. muscle cell is relaxed
9. other important points
a. during contraction, at any given time, only some cross bridges are attached - as they release others attach so thin filaments don't slide backward
b. latent period is time between AP and contraction
c. contraction and relaxation last about 100 msec
d. contraction of an individual cell is an all-or-none response
- Skeletal muscle mechanics
- gradation of whole muscle tension
1. a single AP to a muscle fiber results in a weak contraction (twitch) - muscle cells work together to produce more force
2. recruiting more motor units $\rightarrow$ more tension (more force, stronger contraction)
a. a motor unit is a motor neuron plus all the fibers it innervates (fibers spread throughout muscle)
b. smaller motor units in muscles needing precise control (eyes, fingers), larger motor units in muscles designed for power (legs)
c. asynchronous recruitment of motor units prevents fatigue - alternate motor units
(e.g., postural muscles, holding a heavy object)
3. influencing tension in each fiber
a. increased frequency of stimulation $\rightarrow$ increased tension
(1) twitch summation occurs when fiber does not relax completely between APs, greater cross bridge cycling from prolonged availability of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
(2) if there is no relaxation between APs, tetanus occurs (a smooth, sustained contraction of maximal strength)
b. length-tension relationship (optimal length $\rightarrow$ increased tension)
(1) maximal force possible at optimal length - myosin cross bridges have maximal access to actin binding sites
c. less fatigue $\rightarrow$ increased tension
d. thicker fibers $\rightarrow$ increased tension
(1) more myofilaments in cell
- types of contraction
1. isotonic
a. tension constant, muscle changes length
(1) concentric contraction - muscle shortens (lifting a load)
(2) eccentric contraction - muscle lengthens (lowering load)
2. isometric
a. tension develops, length stays the same (trying to lift too heavy a load, pushing against a wall)
- muscles accomplish work (force $x$ distance), but most of the energy muscles use (about 75\%) converted to heat
- lever systems
1. muscles provide force to move bones (levers) around joints (fulcrum)
2. depending on construction of system, allows a given effort to move a heavier load, or to move it farther and faster
- Skeletal muscle metabolism
- muscle cells have enough ATP reserves to last 4-6 seconds of strenuous activity
- 3 ways to form ATP
1. creatine phosphate
a. contains high energy phosphate group
$C P+$ ADP $\rightarrow$ creatine + ATP (with enzyme creatine kinase)
b. very fast
c. enough stores to last $15-20 \mathrm{sec}$
2. oxidative phosphorylation
a. in mitochondria, needs $\mathrm{O}_{2}$
(1) fueled by fatty acids (during rest or light exercise, slow) or glucose (during more intense exercise, from blood and glycogen stores)
b. high yield of ATP but relatively slow
c. constant supply of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ facilitated by myoglobin (stores $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, increases $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transfer from blood)
d. good for long term (endurance)
3. anaerobic glycolysis
a. fast but not as efficient as with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, pyruvic acid $\rightarrow$ lactic acid, which contributes to soreness and fatigue
b. good for short term (high intensity)
- fatigue
1. muscle fatigue: muscle no longer responds with same degree of contraction
a. increase in $P_{i}$ from the breakdown of ATP is primary cause (interferes w/power stroke, decreases sensitivity of regulatory proteins to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, decrease amount of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ released)
b. depleted $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels (leaks from cell after periods of intense exercise)
c. depleted glycogen reserves
2. neuromuscular fatigue
a. ACh synthesis too slow to keep up with high intensity exercise
3. psychological fatigue
a. CNS does not activate motor neurons due to pain or tiredness
- oxygen debt
1. oxidative phosphorylation allows restoration of energy reserves
a. breaks down lactic acid, replenishes stores of creatine phosphate and glycogen
b. takes minutes to whole day
- Fiber types
- most muscles have varying percentages of fiber types
1. slow-oxidative
a. small, contract slowly (low ATPase activity)
b. use oxidative phosphorylation (lots of mitochondria, myoglobin, capillaries)
c. good for low intensity endurance, resist fatigue (postural muscles in back and legs)
2. fast-glycolytic
a. large (more myofilaments), contract quickly (lots of force, high ATPase activity)
b. use anaerobic glycolysis (few mitochondria, little myoglobin, lots of glycogen \&
glycolytic enzymes)
c. good for short duration high intensity movement (arms for lifting)
3. fast-oxidative
a. medium sized, contract quickly (lots of force)
b. mostly oxidative phosphorylation, some anaerobic glycolysis (characteristics of slow-ox and fast-gly)
c. good for intermediate activities
- training can lead to changes in fiber type
1. endurance exercise converts fast-glycolytic to fast-oxidative, weight lifting does the opposite
a. changes in amount of mitochondria, blood supply, size, etc.
2. typically cannot convert between slow and fast fibers
a. depends on nerve supply
- Control of skeletal muscle
- 3 levels of input
1. spinal cord (spinal reflexes)
2. corticospinal (pyramidal) motor system
a. from primary motor cortex
b. activity planned by premotor and supplementary motor areas, and cerebellum
c. mainly precise movements, especially of hands/fingers, face
3. multineuronal (extrapyramidal) motor system
a. complex pathways including primary motor cortex, reticular formation, cerebellum, basal nuclei, thalamus, premotor and supplementary motor areas
b. mainly regulation of posture and large muscle groups (subconscious)
- afferent signals
1. necessary for coordinated activity
2. muscle proprioceptors sense changes in length and tension
a. inform brain
b. local spinal reflexes
3. muscle spindles
a. in middle of muscle, monitors muscle length and speed of stretching
b. when whole muscle stretched, afferent fibers sense stretch in spindle fibers (respond with increased AP frequency)
(1) in spinal cord, synapse on alpha motor neuron supplying that muscle, causing stretch reflex (muscle contracts) which resists passive changes in muscle length
c. when whole muscle contracts, gamma motor neurons signal ends of intrafusal fibers to contract (takes up slack so receptors maintain sensitivity to stretch)
4. Golgi tendon organs
a. in tendons, monitor tension
b. when whole muscle contracts, afferent fibers fire in response to the stretch of the tendon (increased APs directly related to amount of tension)
c. can inhibit alpha motor neurons of that muscle to prevent damage
- Smooth muscle
- functional anatomy
1. small cells arranged in sheets
2. thick and thin filaments
a. no troponin
b. tropomyosin does not block binding sites
3. no myofibrils or sarcomeres (no striations)
- contraction
1. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enters mostly from ECF (voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels), then some from sarcoplasmic reticulum
2. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ acts as second messenger, activating myosin kinase, which phosphorylates myosin
3. cross bridge cycling occurs until $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ no longer available (actively pumped back to ECF and SR)
- multiunit smooth muscle
1. groups of cells function independently
2. innervated by ANS, which initiates contractions
3. large blood vessels, large airways, eye, hair follicles
- single-unit smooth muscle (most)
1. cells electrically linked (gap junctions)
2. clusters of cells are self-excitable and pass activity to rest of cells (myogenic activity)
a. no resting potential - cells gradually depolarize with automatic changes in channel permeability
b. ANS controls gradation of contraction by influencing amount of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
- smooth muscle designed for sustained contractions with low energy use and no fatigue
1. a single contraction can be 3 sec long (cross bridge cycling and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ removal slow)
2. uses oxidative phosphorylation
a. ATP use slow
b. can use anaerobic glycolysis if needed
3. can develop tension even when stretched to about 2.5 times resting length (filaments still overlap)
see table Comparison of Muscle Types

\section*{Chapter $9 \quad$ Cardiac Physiology}
- Basics of cardiovascular system and heart
- function of CV system is transport
1. heart is the pump
a. establishes a pressure gradient (flow occurs from greater $\rightarrow$ lesser pressure)
2. blood vessels are passageways
3. blood is the transport medium
- heart is a double pump
1. pulmonary circuit
a. heart $\rightarrow$ lungs and back (at lungs, picks up $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, releases $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ )
b. right side is pump
2. systemic circuit
a. heart $\rightarrow$ body tissues and back (at tissues, picks up $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, releases $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ )
b. left side is pump
- valves prevent backflow of blood
1. $A V$ valves attached by chordae tendinae to papillary muscles so that they open in one direction only
2. semilunar valves are shaped like cups, this structure prevents them from opening backward
- fibrous skeleton
1. provides attachment for valves and muscle
2. separates atria from ventricles (important so they contract at different times)
- heart wall is 3-layered
1. endocardium (epithelial lining)
2. myocardium (muscle)
3. epicardium (thin fibrous connective tissue layer)
- pericardial sac
1. fibrous covering continuous with epicardium
a. anchors heart
b. filled with fluid to prevent friction
- Electrical activity of heart
- autorhythmic cells
1. specialized cells that initiate and conduct APs
2. display pacemaker activity (no resting potential, changes in potential due to voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels)
a. decreased flow of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$out and increased inward flow of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$through "funny" channels results in slow depolarization
b. near threshold, voltage-gated transient $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels open and bring membrane to threshold ( $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flows in)
c. at threshold voltage-gated long-lasting $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels open, more $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flows in (this is the AP)
d. at peak of depolarization, voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels open and repolarization occurs
3. locations
a. SA node (sinoatrial)
(1) right atrium
(2) fastest rate of autorhythmicity, it's the pacemaker of the heart (under usual conditions initiates APs)
(3) interatrial pathway extends to left atrium (spreads AP, atria contract)
(4) internodal pathway extends to next node
b. AV node (atrioventricular)
(1) electrical connection between atria and ventricles
(2) signal slightly delayed (. 1 sec ) to allow atria to finish contracting - more efficient blood pumping
c. AV bundle (bundle of His)
(1) branch into ventricles
d. Purkinje fibers
(1) branch throughout ventricular myocardium (ventricles contract)
- contractile cells
1. APs spread from cell to cell
a. adjacent cells joined by intercalated discs
(1) desmosomes resist mechanical stress
(2) gap junctions allow spread of electrical signals
2. cardiac muscle APs
a. cell depolarized by autorhythmic activity
b. voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels open, $\mathrm{Na}^{+} \rightarrow$ in, cell depolarized to +30 mV
c. at the peak of depolarization, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels close, voltage-gated slow $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels open $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right.$ flows in - results in plateau, the channels are a "slow" version of the longlasting $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in autorhythmic cells)
d. at the end of the plateau, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels close, voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels open ( $\mathrm{K}^{+} \rightarrow$ out, repolarization)
3. excitation-contraction coupling
a. AP travels down $T$ tubules, voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels open,
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} \rightarrow$ in from ECF
b. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx triggers further release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from sarcoplasmic reticulum
c. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds with troponin-tropomyosin complex, cross bridge cycling occurs
d. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ actively pumped back to ECF and SR
e. extent of cross bridge cycling depends on amount of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that enters cytosol (unlike in skeletal muscle, where enough $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for maximum contraction is always released)
4. long contractions due to lots of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from ECF and SR
5. long refractory period
a. due to inactivation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels during plateau
b. tetanus does not occur (no summation)
c. keeps cardiac functioning efficient

\section*{- Cardiac cycle}
- systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation) occur in atria and ventricles - most often refers to ventricles
1. diastole
a. AV valves open
b. blood fills ventricles (amount at end of diastole is called end-diastolic volume, EDV is about 135 ml )
c. atria contract
2. systole
a. ventricles contract, closing AV valves
b. semilunar valves open
c. blood ejected (amount of blood still in ventricles is end-systolic volume, ESV is about 65 ml )
- Cardiac output (CO)
- CO is the volume of blood pumped by each ventricle in one minute (left and right normally equal)
$\mathrm{CO}=$ heart rate (beats $/ \mathrm{min}$ ) $\times$ stroke volume ( $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{beat}$ )
1. typically about 5 liters/min at rest (entire blood volume)
2. can increase to $20-25 \mathrm{l} / \mathrm{min}$
a. difference between CO at rest and maximum CO is cardiac reserve
- factors influencing heart rate (HR)
1. parasympathetic effects (ACh, decrease HR)
a. primarily supplies atria (SA and AV nodes)
b. acts on SA node
(1) increases $\mathrm{PK}^{+}$by slowing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel closure, resulting in hyperpolarization, takes longer to reach threshold
c. also increases $\mathrm{PK}^{+}$at AV node, lengthening delay
d. acts on atrial contractile cells, weakening contraction
(1) shortens the plateau phase, by decreasing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx
e. little effect on strength of ventricular contraction
2. sympathetic effects ( $N E$ and $E$, increase $H R$ )
a. acts on SA node
(1) decreases $\mathrm{PK}^{+}$by speeding up inactivation of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, resulting in
"hypopolarization", threshold reached more quickly
b. reduces delay at AV node, probably by enhancing influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
c. speeds spread of AP throughout nodal system by enhancing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx
- factors influencing stroke volume (SV)
1. intrinsic control
a. resting cardiac muscle is at less than optimal length - stretching fibers by increasing

EDV (increasing venous return) results in a more forceful contraction (increases SV)
b. important to match SV to venous return
(1) automatically equalizes flow through pulmonary and systemic circuits
(blood does not "back up")
2. increasing contractility (increasing SV)
a. sympathetic stimulation increases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx (atria and ventricles) resulting in greater cross bridge cycling and more forceful contraction
(1) also enhances venous return by constricting veins, squeezing more blood toward heart
- Coronary circulation
- heart receives $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and nutrients from coronary arteries branching off the aorta (coronary veins empty into right atrium)
1. most blood flow occurs during diastole
2. uses oxidative phosphorylation
a. uses mostly free fatty acids, but can use glucose
3. during exercise, increased demands for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ met by vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels)
a. adenosine (formed from breaking down ATP) released from muscle cells
(1) during $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ deficit
(2) during increased activity (using more ATP)
(3) induces dilation of vessels (smooth muscle relaxes)
- Homeostatic imbalances
- heart failure (heart can't keep up with demands of body)
1. 2 main reasons
a. damage from heart attack or impaired circulation to cardiac muscle
b. prolonged pumping against increased afterload (stenotic semilunar valve or chronically elevated blood pressure)
2. contractility of heart is decreased
a. SV decreased for a given EDV (Frank-Starling curve shifts down to right)
b. body compensates with increased sympathetic activity and retaining salt and water to expand blood volume and increase EDV
c. eventually body can't compensate
(1) backward failure - blood pools in venous system (congestive heart failure)
(2) forward failure - inadequate supplies to tissues
(3) left-sided failure worse
backward - fluid accumulates in lungs (pulmonary edema), forward - kidney function depressed and they retain even more water and salt
- atherosclerosis and its effects on the heart (called coronary artery disease when it occurs in coronary vessels)
1. complications of disease are leading cause of death in US
2. can lead to myocardial ischemia (insufficient $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to heart), factors causing ischemia:
a. vascular spasm - decreased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ triggers platelet activating factor (PAF) release from vessels, causing spastic constriction, further decreasing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to heart
b. atherosclerotic plaques - accumulation of lipid and overgrown smooth muscle reduce blood flow, in later stages $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ accumulates ("hardening of the arteries")
c. thromboembolism - plaque breaks through lining of blood vessels and platelets form abnormal clots (thrombus) if clot breaks free (embolus) it can block small vessels (complete blockage causes myocardial infarction - heart attack)
3. transient ischemia causes angina pectoris (chest pain)
a. usually during physical or emotional stress
b. may be due to accumulation of lactic acid as heart makes ATP anaerobically
4. risk factors - genetics, obesity, old age, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, lack of exercise, nervous tension, high blood cholesterol levels
5. specific indicators of risk
a. high blood levels of homocysteine (promotes smooth muscle growth and causes oxidation)
b. high blood levels of C-reactive protein (an indicator of inflammation)
6. cholesterol
a. carried in blood as lipoprotein complexes
b. low density lipoproteins (LDL) transport to cells ("bad cholesterol")
c. high density lipoproteins (HDL) transport to liver and some excreted from body ("good cholesterol")
d. cholesterol needed for cell membranes, hormones, bile salts - but high levels of LDL associated with atherosclerosis

\section*{Chapter $10 \quad$ Blood Vessels and Blood Pressure}
- Basics
- exchanges between blood and tissue cells take place through the interstitial fluid
- all organs receive fresh blood
1. amount to each organ adjusted based on need
- the blood is constantly "reconditioned" so its composition is relatively constant
1. reconditioning organs receive a high proportion of cardiac output (digestive system, kidneys)
- organization "vascular tree"
1. arteries (carries blood from heart toward tissues)
2. arterioles (adjusts blood flow to tissues)
3. capillaries (exchanges made)
4. venules (carries blood to veins)
5. veins (carries blood from tissues toward heart)
- flow rate (volume of blood passing through a particular segment of vascular tree per unit time)
1. directly proportional to pressure gradient
2. inversely proportional to resistance (hindrance to flow from friction)
*a. vessel radius - smaller vessels $\rightarrow$ more resistance
b. viscosity of blood - thicker blood $\rightarrow$ more resistance
c. length of vessel - longer vessel $\rightarrow$ more resistance
- Arteries
- fast transport
1. large
- pressure reservoir
1. walls contain endothelial lining surrounded by smooth muscle and connective tissue fibers (collagen and elastin), which allow walls to stretch to contain pumped blood
2. when the heart is relaxing the arteries recoil and keep the blood flowing
- arterial pressure fluctuates
1. blood pressure is the force exerted by blood on vessel walls
a. depends on blood volume and distensibility of vessel
b. systolic pressure is the maximum pressure during systole (should be $<120 \mathrm{mmHg}$ )
c. diastolic pressure is the pressure during diastole ( should be $<80 \mathrm{mmHg}$ )
d. systolic - diastolic = pulse pressure (the pressure felt in arteries near the body surface)
2. mean arterial pressure is the main driving force for blood flow to tissues

MAP $=$ diastolic pressure $+1 / 3$ pulse pressure

\section*{- Arterioles}
- major resistance vessels (small radii)
- radii adjusted by smooth muscle
1. vasoconstriction and vasodilation (narrowing and enlarging)
2. normally partially constricted (vascular tone)
a. myogenic activity
b. sympathetic innervation
- local control of arteriolar radius matches blood flow to tissue needs
1. chemical influences
a. metabolic factors causing vasodilation
(1) decreased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$
(2) increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
(3) increased acid (from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and lactic acid)
(4) increased $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(APs outpacing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump in brain or skeletal muscle)
(5) increased osmolarity (more solutes formed during times of elevated metabolism)
(6) release of adenosine (in cardiac muscle)
(7) release of prostaglandins (not well understood)
b. local metabolic factors probably act by causing release of chemical mediators from endothelial cells (called vasoactive mediators), e.g.,
(1) endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), also known as nitric oxide (NO) inhibits $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx in smooth muscle - vasodilator
(2) endothelin - vasoconstrictor
2. physical influences
a. application of heat (vasodilation) or cold (vasoconstriction)
b. myogenic responses to stretch (vasoactive substances probably contribute)
(1) tone increases in response to increased stretch (resists stretch) important to keep flow to tissues constant as MAP changes (pressure autoregulation)
(2) tone decreases in response to decreased stretch - important in restoring flow to previously deprived tissue (reactive hyperemia)
- extrinsic control of arteriolar radius helps regulate arterial BP
1. sympathetic activity produces generalized vasoconstriction, increasing resistance and BP (don't vasoconstrict brain)
$$\text { MAP }=\text { CO } x \text { total peripheral resistance }$$
a. NE at $\alpha$ receptors causes vasoconstriction
b. $E$ at $\beta_{2}$ receptors causes vasodilation (heart, skeletal muscles)
2. other hormones
a. vasopressin - important in fluid balance, vasoconstrictor
b. angiotensin II - important in fluid balance, vasoconstrictor
3. local control mechanisms can override
- Capillaries
- responsible for exchanges between plasma and interstitial fluid (solute exchange mainly by diffusion)
1. thin-walled, narrow vessels
2. highly branched
3. blood flows slowly through individual vessels
4. lipid soluble substances pass through cells $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$
5. water soluble substances pass through pores (ions, glucose, amino acids)
6. some vesicular transport (hormones)
7. degree of "leakiness" may change due to actin-myosin in capillary cells
- precapillary sphincters
1. rings of smooth muscle can block flow through capillaries in less active tissues
a. sensitive to local metabolic changes
- fluid shifts and bulk flow
1. important in distribution of fluids between plasma and interstitial fluid
a. fluid (not proteins) pushed out through pores at arteriolar end (ultrafiltration)
(1) capillary blood pressure exceeds plasma-colloid osmotic pressure (oncotic pressure - force drawing water toward plasma proteins)
b. fluid reabsorbed at venular end
(1) capillary BP lower than plasma-colloid osmotic pressure
2. and, ultrafiltration occurs in open capillaries, reabsorption in closed capillaries
3. fluid shifts occur as needed
a. loss of blood, shifts to plasma
b. excess fluid in blood, shifts to interstitial fluid
c. keeps plasma volume relatively constant (temporary)
- extra fluid picked up by lymph vessels (initial lymphatics) in capillary beds
1. large valvelike openings allow in fluid and any leaked proteins (lymph)
2. around larger lymph vessels, surrounding smooth muscle pushes fluid to larger and larger vessels, which contain one-way valves
3. skeletal muscles help squeeze lymph through
4. eventually empty into thoracic veins
- edema (accumulation of excess interstitial fluid, reduces exchange between blood and cells)
1. low plasma proteins
a. more fluid filtered out, less reabsorbed
b. kidney or liver disease, diet deficient in protein, burns
2. increased permeability of capillaries
a. loss of proteins

b. still low resistance vessels (large radius)
2. skeletal muscle activity
a. acts as pump
3. valves
a. one-way valves every few centimeters allow flow toward heart only
4. respiratory activity
a. acts as pump due to decreased pressure in thoracic cavity
5. cardiac suction
a. blood "sucked in" as ventricles relax
- Blood Pressure
- MAP is main driving force
1. high enough to get blood to tissues
2. not too high or extra work for heart, increased risk of vascular damage
- short term regulation (seconds)
1. baroreceptor reflex
a. pressure sensors in carotid sinus and aortic arch sense changes in MAP and pulse pressure
(1) rate of firing increases with increasing pressure, decreases with decreasing pressure
b. integrating center is cardiovascular control center in medulla of brain stem
(1) adjusts sympathetic/parasympathetic activity
- long term regulation (minutes to days)
1. adjustments in total blood volume via salt/water balance - urinary system and thirst (volume receptors in left atrium, osmoreceptors in hypothalamus)
- other contributing factors
1. chemoreceptors in carotid and aortic arteries
a. sense low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and high acid
(1) increase respiratory activity but also increase BP (signals CV center)
2. cerebral cortex - hypothalamic pathway influence emotional/behavioral responses
3. exercise
a. may be unidentified "exercise centers"
4. hypothalamic temperature regulation
a. overrides baroreceptor reflex for skin vessels

a. include atherosclerosis, endocrine disorders, nervous system defects
3. primary hypertension causes may include...
a. kidney salt regulation

c. diet low in fruit, vegetables, dairy (low in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ )
d. defects in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pumps
e. abnormal local vasoactive substances
f. excess vasopressin
4. baroreceptors reset at higher level
5. stresses heart and blood vessels
a. congestive heart failure from increased afterload
b. rupture of vessels - stroke, heart attack
c. damage to vessels may cause accumulation of lipids and lead to atherosclerosis
d. kidney failure due to damaged vessels
e. loss of vision from damaged vessels

\section*{- hypotension}
1. BP below $100 / 60$
2. transient
a. standing up - gravity decreases venous return
b. in some people emotional stress decreases sympathetic activity (may be adaptive)
3. when blood flow to tissues inadequate its called circulatory shock
a. many causes
(1) loss of blood volume (hemorrhage, diarrhea)
(2) weakened heart
(3) vasodilation (septic or anaphylactic)

- hemostasis (stopping blood flow)
1. vascular spasm
a. blood flow through a break minimized by vasoconstriction (vascular response and sympathetically induced)
2. formation of platelet plug seals break
a. platelets stick to exposed collagen of damaged connective tissue
(1) platelets release chemicals like ADP and thromboxane $A_{2}$ that cause more platelets to become "sticky" and build up

\section*{Chapter 13 Respiratory System}
- Terminology (different from text)
- pulmonary ventilation: breathing
- external respiration: gas exchange between the blood and alveoli (air sacs)
- gas transport: blood transports gases to tissues (CV system)
- internal respiration: gas exchange between the blood and tissues (CV/tissues)
- cellular respiration: use of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to produce ATP (cells)
- Functions
- obtain $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, eliminate $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
- nonrespiratory functions
1. route for water and heat loss
2. enhance venous return
3. acid-base balance $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$
4. vocalization
5. defense against inhaled invaders
6. sense of smell

- alveoli (air sacs)
1. thin walled and surrounded by capillaries
a. large surface area for gas exchange
b. type I cells - simple squamous epithelium
c. type II cells - secrete surfactant
d. macrophages fight invaders
- pleural sacs
1. each lung is separate
2. intrapleural fluid lubricates surfaces and helps lungs stick to thoracic wall
- Respiratory mechanics
- in ventilation air flows down a pressure gradient
1. 3 important pressures
a. atmospheric pressure ( 760 mmHg at sea level)
b. intra-alveolar a.k.a. intrapulmonary pressure (varies)
c. intrapleural pressure a.k.a. intrathoracic pressure is within the pleural sac (756 mmHg at rest)
2. lungs will always expand to fill the thoracic cavity
a. intrapleural fluid (sticky)

b. volume of thoracic cavity and lungs increases
c. intra-alveolar pressure decreases
d. air flows in
4. expiration

b. volume of thoracic cavity and lungs decreases
c. intra-alveolar pressure increases
d. air flows out
5. forced expiration
a. expiratory muscles contract (abdominal wall muscles and internal intercostals)
- airway resistance
1. adjusted to meet the body's needs
a. parasympathetic stimulation $\rightarrow$ bronchoconstriction $\rightarrow$ increased resistance $\rightarrow$ decreased airflow
b. sympathetic stimulation/epinephrine $\rightarrow$ bronchodilation $\rightarrow$ decreased resistance $\rightarrow$ increased airflow
- matching airflow to blood flow (ventilation-perfusion coupling)
1. local controls act on bronchiolar smooth muscle and on arteriolar smooth muscle
2. bronchioles
a. increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow$ bronchodilation $\rightarrow$ increased airflow
b. decreased $\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow$ bronchoconstriction $\rightarrow$ decreased airflow
3. arterioles
a. decreased $\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow$ vasoconstriction $\rightarrow$ decreased blood flow
b. increased $\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow$ vasodilation $\rightarrow$ increased blood flow
4. simultaneous adjustments mean air and blood not wasted
a. examples:
(1) if blood flow $>$ airflow, increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and decreased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in alveoli, so bronchodilation and vasoconstriction
(2) if airflow > blood flow, decreased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and increased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in alveoli, so bronchoconstriction and vasodilation
- elastic behavior of lungs
1. healthy lungs recoil after stretching and are compliant (easy to inflate)
2. two main factors
a. elastin fibers in lung connective tissue
b. alveolar surface tension
(1) water molecules lining alveoli attract each other, creating surface tension
(2) surfactant decreases surface tension (without it lungs would collapse)
(3) surfactant also increases compliance and reduces work needed to breathe
(4) surfactant may also enhance phagocytosis
3. in healthy lungs breathing requires little energy
a. $3 \%$ of total energy at rest
b. $5 \%$ during exercise
c. up to $30 \%$ at rest with obstructive lung disease
- Gas Exchange
- gases diffuse down partial pressure gradients (pressure exerted by a particular gas in a mixture of gases or dissolved in a body fluid)
1. alveolar $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ is lower than atmospheric $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ and alveolar $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ is higher than atmospheric $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$
a. water vapor in lungs dilutes gases
b. newly inspired air mixes with old air (15\% new air with inspiration)
2. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ requires a smaller gradient for efficient transfer because it is more soluble (usually about equal amounts of $\mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ exchanged)
3. at lungs
a. $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ always higher in alveoli, $\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow$ blood
b. $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ always higher in blood, $\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow$ alveoli
4. at tissues
a. $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ always higher in blood, $\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow$ tissues
b. $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ always higher in tissues, $\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow$ blood
- other factors influence the rate of gas transfer
1. during exercise...
a. more pulmonary capillaries open, increasing surface area for exchanges
b. greater stretching of alveolar membranes increases surface area and thins membrane (decreased distance for diffusion)
2. disease thickens membrane and increases distance for diffusion (pulmonary edema, pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia
- Gas transport
$-\mathrm{O}_{2}$
1. $1.5 \%$ dissolved in blood
2. $98.5 \%$ on hemoglobin $(\mathrm{Hb})$
$\underset{\substack{\text { (reduced } \mathrm{Hb} \text { ) }}}{\mathrm{Hb}}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \quad \leftrightarrow \quad \underset{\text { (oxyhemoglobin) }}{\mathrm{HbO}_{2}}$
3. Hb saturation
a. primary influence is $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$
(1) pulmonary capillaries - increased $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ leads to formation of $\mathrm{HbO}_{2}$ at lungs
(2) systemic capillaries - decreased $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ leads to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation from $\mathrm{HbO}_{2}$ at tissues
b. $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve
(1) plateau portion means that blood can carry nearly maximum amounts of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at varying $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ levels (safety margin on low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ environments)
(2) steep portion means that small decreases in $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ at active tissues allow more
$\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to be released
c. curve shifts to the right in active tissues (more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is released at active tissues at a given $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ )
(1) Bohr effect - increased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$
(2) increased acid (from increased $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and lactic acid)
(3) increased temperature
(4) increased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG), produced inside RBCs in increasing amounts when $\mathrm{HbO}_{2}$ levels below normal
$-\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
1. $10 \%$ dissolved in blood
2. $30 \%$ as $\mathrm{HbCO}_{2}$ (carbaminohemoglobin)
a. removal of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from $\mathrm{HbO}_{2}$ at tissues increases the affinity of Hb for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Haldane effect)
3. $60 \%$ as $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$(bicarbonate, more soluble than $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ )
a. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$
b. can occur in plasma, but more efficient in RBCs because of enzyme carbonic anhydrase
c. $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}-\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$carrier in RBC membrane
(1) $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$out of RBCs at tissues, in at lungs
(2) $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$into RBCs down electrical gradient at tissues, out at lungs (chloride shift)
d. most of the accumulated $\mathrm{H}^{+}$binds to Hb (helps buffer the blood)

5. excrete wastes (urea, uric acid, creatinine) and other materials
6. secrete erythropoietin
7. secrete renin $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right.$balance)
8. converts vitamin $D$ to its active form
- nephron is the functional unit of the kidney
1. arrangement forms cortex and medulla
2. glomerulus
a. tuft of capillaries that filters blood
b. renal artery branches to form afferent and efferent arteriole for each nephron
(1) efferent arteriole divides to form peritubular capillaries (supply renal tissue with blood)
3. tubule
a. glomerular capsule surrounds glomerulus and collects filtrate
b. proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)
c. loop
d. distal convoluted tubule (DCT)
e. collecting duct/tubule - drains fluid from several nephrons to renal pelvis
4. juxtaglomerular apparatus
a. regulates kidney function
b. macula densa - specialized cells of DCT as it passes by glomerulus
c. granular cells (juxtaglomerular cells or JG cells) are specialized smooth muscle cells of arterioles
5. 2 types of nephrons
a. cortical - lie mainly in cortex ( $80 \%$ )
b. juxtamedullary - loops dip to end of medulla (important in urine concentration/conserving water)
(1) vasa recta are blood vessels that run near long loop
- 3 renal processes
1. glomerular filtration
a. about $20 \%$ of plasma entering glomerulus is filtered
b. entire plasma volume filtered 65 times/day
c. nonselective process - everything but cells and plasma proteins are filtered
2. tubular reabsorption
a. selective recovery of filtered substances
3. tubular secretion
a. selective transfer of materials from plasma in peritubular capillaries to filtrate

\section*{- Glomerular Filtration}
- filtered substances pass through highly permeable filtration membrane
1. glomerular capillaries are 100 x more permeable than other capillaries
2. basement membrane (collagen for strength and glycoproteins with a negative charge that repels plasma proteins)
3. inner layer of glomerular capsule
a. podocytes wrap around capillaries and form filtration slits
- glomerular capillary blood pressure forces fluid through filtration membrane
1. higher than in other capillaries
a. diameter of afferent arteriole larger than efferent arteriole, blood dams up and filtration occurs throughout glomerulus
2. glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
a. $\operatorname{GFR}=\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}} \mathrm{x}$ net filtration pressure
( $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}=$ filtration coefficient, collective properties of filtration membrane)
b. autoregulation
(1) allows GFR to remain constant despite changes in BP (vasoconstriction/dilation of afferent arteriole)
(2) myogenic mechanism - arteriolar smooth muscle constricts when stretched, relaxes with decreased pressure
(3) tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism - macula densa detects changes in rate of filtrate flow or osmotic changes and signals granular cells to release vasoactive substances
```
increased flow }->\mathrm{ vasoconstriction }->\mathrm{ decreased GFR
decreased flow }->\mathrm{ vasodilation }->\mathrm{ increased GFR
```
(4) sufficient in MAP $80-180 \mathrm{mmHg}$ range
c. extrinsic sympathetic control
(1) GFR changed based on need (override autoregulation to reg BP)
(2) baroreceptor reflex
decreased plasma volume $\rightarrow$ generalized vasoconstriction, including
afferent arteriole $\rightarrow$ decreased GFR $\rightarrow$ conservation of fluids
increased BP $\rightarrow$ vasodilation $\rightarrow$ increased GFR $\rightarrow$ eliminate more fluids
(3) can alter $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ by closing off part of capillaries and filtration slits
- Tubular Reabsorption
- typically nephrons reabsorb $99 \%$ of the water, $100 \%$ of the sugar, $99.5 \%$ of the salt that is filtered
- different portions of tubule specialize in particular substances
- most substances pass through tubule cells (transepithelial transport)
- can be active or passive
1. if any step is active, reabsorption of that substance is considered active
- $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption
1. occurs via $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$ATPase in the basolateral membrane
a. creates gradients for diffusion
b. tied to reabsorption of other substances (glucose, amino acids, water, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, urea)
c. occurs in PCT and loop - automatically reabsorb most $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$(92\%)
d. DCT and collecting tubule - hormonal control, reabsorption according to need
2. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
a. in response to decreased $\mathrm{NaCl} / \mathrm{dec}$. ECF volume/dec. BP, macula densa signals
granular cells to release renin (an enzyme)
b. angiotensinogen $\rightarrow$ angiotensin I
c. angiotensin I $\rightarrow$ angiotensin II in lungs
(1) vasoconstriction of arterioles
(2) stimulates thirst
(3) stimulates vasopressin release ( $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ reabsorption)
(4) adrenal cortex releases aldosterone - promotes insertion of more $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pumps into cells of DCT and collecting tubule ( $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ follow $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$)
3. atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) inhibits $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption
a. released from atria in response to increased stretch from inc ECF/inc BP
b. decrease $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption $\rightarrow$ decrease ECF and BP
- Glucose and amino acids
1. cotransport systems driven by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pumps in PCT
- Water reabsorption
1. passively reabsorbed throughout most of nephron (not ascending limb of loops)
2. $80 \%$ osmotically follows solute reabsorption (water flows through channels into cells or through leaky tight junctions)
3. $20 \%$ reabsorbed according to need in DCT and collecting tubule (hormonal controlvasopressin)
- urea reabsorption
1. only waste product reabsorbed
2. as $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ reabsorbed in PCT, urea becomes more concentrated and then moves down its concentration gradient ( $50 \%$ reabsorbed)

\section*{- Tubular Secretion}
- enhances removal of some substances
- transepithelial transport (opposite of reabsorption)
- $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion
1. important in acid/base balance
2. actively secreted in PCT, DCT and collecting tubules according to need (inc $\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow$ increased secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$)
3. can be coupled to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption instead of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(basolateral pump in distal nephron)
- $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion
1. reabsorption in PCT is automatic (active)
2. controlled secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in DCT and collecting tubule
a. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{+}$pump creates gradient
b. inc plasma $\mathrm{K}^{+} \rightarrow$ inc aldosterone $\rightarrow$ inc $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion
dec plasma $\mathrm{K}^{+} \rightarrow$ dec aldosterone $\rightarrow$ dec $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion
c. important in maintaining membrane potential
- organic anion and cation secretion
1. special carriers for each in PCT
2. prostaglandins and other chemical messengers
3. other substances like drugs or pollutants
a. liver must convert substance to anionic form
see table Summary of Transport across Proximal and Distal Portions of the Nephron
- Variations in urine solute concentration (controlling amount of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ excreted)
- countercurrent mechanism (medullary countercurrent system)
1. long loops of juxtamedullary nephrons establish a vertical osmotic gradient in interstitial fluid of medulla
2. vasa recta prevent loss of gradient
3. water can be reabsorbed from collecting tubules as it flows through gradient (under control of vasopressin)
- establishing the gradient (countercurrent multiplication) - by loop
1. descending limb permeable to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ but not $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$
2. ascending limb pumps out $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$but is impermeable to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
3. as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is pumped out of ascending limb, water leaves descending limb by diffusion
a. leads to gradient of 300-1200 mosm/L in medulla
b. urea also contributes to gradient
- variable $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ reabsorption
1. filtrate in DCT very dilute
2. without vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone or ADH, from hypothalamus/posterior pituitary) DCT and collecting duct impermeable to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
a. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ not reabsorbed, urine dilute
3. when vasopressin present (released as hypothalamus detects increased osmolarity/decreased $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ) DCT and collecting ducts become permeable to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
a. cAMP second messenger system - results in insertion of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ channels in tubule
b. water reabsorbed as it flows through medullary gradient
- countercurrent exchange in vasa recta
1. medullary gradient does not dissipate because of the construction of the blood supply
2. vasa recta follow loop and exchanges of NaCl and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ occur so that the blood equilibrates with the surrounding interstitial fluid
- Micturition (urination)
- urethra has two sphincter muscles that prevent leaking of urine
1. internal urethral sphincter made of smooth muscle (involuntary)
2. external urethral sphincter made of skeletal muscle (voluntary)
- micturition reflex occurs when stretch receptors in bladder are activated and parasympathetic fibers stimulated
1. occurs at $250-400 \mathrm{ml}$ urine
2. parasympathetic stimulation causes bladder to contract, opening internal sphincter and inhibiting motor neurons to external sphincter
a. we become conscious of having to urinate, but we can temporarily override reflex until it's convenient

\section*{Chapter 16 Digestive System}
- Basics
- function: transfer nutrients, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and electrolytes from food to body
1. food is an energy source and contains basic building blocks of body tissues
- 4 digestive processes
1. motility
a. muscular contractions that move food through digestive tract (propulsive) and mix food
2. secretion
a. digestive juices (enzymes, bile, mucus, hormones)
3. digestion
a. breaking down large molecules into smaller units
4. absorption
a. substances moved from digestive tract to blood or lymph
- major and accessory organs
- layers of digestive tract wall
- intrinsic nerve plexuses
1. network of nerves in digestive tract wall (enteric nervous system)
2. influence all digestive tract activity
a. mainly coordinate activities
3. influenced by extrinsic nerves
- extrinsic nerves (ANS)
1. influences motility and secretion
a. modify activity of intrinsic plexuses
b. act directly on glands and smooth muscle
- receptors and reflexes
1. digestive tract contains
a. chemoreceptors
b. mechanoreceptors
c. osmoreceptors
2. stimulation of receptors initiates reflexes
a. short reflexes - entirely within intrinsic nerves
b. long reflexes - also involve ANS
- gastrointestinal hormones
1. produced in mucosa, released to blood in response to local chemical changes or nerve stimulation
- Mouth
- mastication (chewing)
1. mixes and breaks down food
- saliva produced by salivary glands
1. begins digestion of carbohydrate with salivary amylase
2. moistens food with mucus for easy swallowing
3. lysozyme lyses bacteria
4. produced in response to stimulation from chemoreceptors and pressure receptors in mouth, or seeing/smelling food
- Pharynx and Esophagus
- pathways to stomach
- Stomach
- 3 major functions
1. store food and release to duodenum at the appropriate rate
2. secrete HCl and enzymes to begin protein digestion (continue carbohydrate digestion with salivary enzymes)
3. mix food with gastric secretions to make chyme
- 4 aspects of motility
1. gastric filling
a. plasticity - stomach can stretch without increasing tension
b. receptive relaxation - eating triggers reflex relaxation
2. gastric storage
a. food stored mainly in body of stomach
3. gastric mixing
a. mostly in antrum (thicker muscle layer)
b. peristaltic contractions
4. gastric emptying
a. peristaltic waves push some chyme into duodenum
b. influencing factors (stomach)
(1) amount of chyme - more chyme increases emptying via direct effect on smooth muscle, intrinsic and extrinsic neurons, hormone gastrin
*c. influencing factors (duodenum)
(1) stimuli such as fat, acid, increased osmolarity and distention in duodenum trigger slowing of gastric emptying via neural and hormonal responses
(2) neural response - short and long reflexes (enterogastric reflex)
(3) hormonal response - enterogastrones released to blood act on stomach (secretin, cholecystokinin or CCK, gastric inhibitory peptide or GIP)
- gastric secretions come from gastric pits/gastric glands
1. oxyntic mucosa (body and fundus)
a. surface epithelial cells secrete thick alkaline mucus that protects stomach from acid and digestive enzymes
b. mucous neck cells produce watery, lubricating mucus, also divide rapidly and differentiate into other cell types (entire mucosa replaced every 3 days)
c. parietal cells secrete HCl and intrinsic factor
(1) HCl activates digestive enzymes and produces optimal pH for protein digestion; breaks down connective tissue and muscle; kills bacteria
(2) intrinsic factor allows absorption of vitamin $B_{12}$
d. chief cells secrete pepsinogen (inactive so cells won't be digested), which is converted to protein digestive enzyme pepsin
2. pyloric gland area (antrum)
a. secretes mucus and some pepsinogen (not HCl )
*b. G cells secrete hormone gastrin
(1) stimulates parietal and chief cells
(2) stimulates growth of mucosa in stomach and small intestine
3. control of gastric secretions
a. cephalic phase
(1) thinking about food and eating increases gastric secretion via parasympathetic stimulation
b. gastric phase
(1) protein, distention, caffeine and alcohol initiate both short and long reflexes that trigger gastrin secretion
c. intestinal phase
(1) protein stimulates release of intestinal gastrin (excitatory component) *(2) enterogastric reflex and enterogastrones suppress secretory activity (inhibitory component)
- Small Intestine
- major organ of digestion and absorption
- motility: segmentation
1. mixes chyme and exposes chyme to absorptive surfaces
2. slowly moves chyme forward
3. duodenum segments in response to distention
4. ileum segments in response to gastrin when chyme is in the stomach (gastroileal reflex)
- pancreas secretes digestive enzymes and protective alkaline fluid $\left(\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}\right)$ into duodenum
