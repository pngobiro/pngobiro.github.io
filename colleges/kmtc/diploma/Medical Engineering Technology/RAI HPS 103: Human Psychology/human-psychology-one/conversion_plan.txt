3. **Special Elements Inventory**:
   ```
   Special Elements:
   - Equations: 0
   - Tables: 0
   - Figures: 1 - Line 16 (Studocu QR Code)
   - Code Blocks: 0
   - Complex Lists: Numerous bulleted/numbered lists throughout.

   Critical Sections (requiring special attention):
   - Line 614-619 & 620: Potential duplicate content on Behavior Modification/Token Economy - needs careful handling during transfer.
   - Ensure all list structures (simple, nested) are preserved correctly.
   - Verify heading hierarchy mapping from `\section*{}` to HTML H1/H2 etc.

6. **Cross-Chunk Navigation Planning**:
   ```
   Navigation Structure:
   - Previous/Next Chunk links (Sequential: topic-1 -> topic-2 -> ... -> topic-12)
   - Link from each topic page back to index.html (Table of Contents)
   - Breadcrumb navigation structure (To be implemented if needed, basic Prev/Next/ToC initially)

   Cross-References: (None explicitly identified in MMD, verify during content transfer)
   ```
