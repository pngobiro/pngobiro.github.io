\section*{APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY}

\section*{Concept of psychology}

\section*{Introduction to psychology}

The word psychology literally means, "Study of the soul". It derives from Ancient Greek: " $\psi \cup \chi$ ŋ́" (psyche, meaning "breath", "spirit", or "soul"); and "- $\lambda$ oүía" (-logia, translated as "study of"). Psychology is defined as the scientific study of human behavior and mental processes /The science of behavior and mental processes. Psychology studies WHO and WHAT we are, WHY we act and think in a particular manner and what is our potential as an individual.

\section*{Definition of common terminologies}
(a) Behavior

Any response or activity of an organism.
It can either be simple or complex; overt or covert; conscious or unconscious; voluntary or involuntary; rational or irrational
(b)Mental process

Also known as mental function or cognitive functions
These are all the things that individuals can do with their minds.
These include perception, memory, thinking (such as ideation, imagination, belief, reasoning, etc.), volition, and emotion.
© Attitude
A person's mindset at any given point in time, it does not always remain constant or match behaviour.
(d) Intelligence

One's ability to learn from situation, add knowledge and problem solve.
(e) Personality

A person's pattern of thinking acting or feeling
(f) Cognition
refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought,
g) Intellect

A term used in studies of the human mind, and refers to the ability of the mind to come to correct conclusions about what is true or false,
(h) Consciousness

Awareness of external or internal exsistance

\section*{History of psychology}

The history of psychology as a scholarly study of the mind and behaviour dates back to the Ancient Greeks. Psychology borders on various other fields including, physiology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, sociology, anthropology, as well as philosophy and other components of the humanities.

Psychology was a branch of philosophy until 1879, when psychology developed as an independent scientific discipline in Germany and the United States. Psychology as a selfconscious field of experimental study began in 1879, when Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research in Leipzig Germany. He is regarded as the father of experimental psychology.

Other important early contributors to the field of psychology include Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in the study of memory), William James (the American father of pragmatism), and Ivan Pavlov (father of classical conditioning). Stanley Hall brought scientific pedagogy to the United States from Germany in the early 1880s. John Dewey's educational theory of the 1890s was another hallmark in the development of psychology. In the 1890s, Hugo Münsterberg began writing about the application of psychology to industry, law, and other fields. Lightner Witmer established the first psychological clinic in the 1890s. James McKeen Cattell generated the first program of mental testing in the 1890s. Later in 1900s, psychology became a new independent science that was systematically organized into different schools of thought.

\section*{Perspective of psychology}

\section*{The biological/Neuroscience perspective}

It proposes that behavior is determined by biological factors like genes and hormones

\section*{The psychoanalytic perspective}

Originated with the work of Sigmund Freud. It emphasizes the role of the unconscious mind, early childhood experiences, and interpersonal relationships to explain human behavior and to treat people suffering from mental illnesses.

\section*{Behavioral Perspective:}

It focuses on learned behaviors I.e how behaviors are learned and reinforced. John Watson founded behaviorism in the early 1900's. Watson emphasized the scientific study of observable behaviors. Our behaviors depend on associations we have made in the past (learned) rather than the study of subjective mental process.

\section*{Humanistic Perspective:}

Influenced by the work of humanists Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow.
Emphasizes the role of motivation on thought and behavior.

\section*{Cognitive Perspective:}

Focuses on mental processes such as memory, thinking, problem solving, language and decision-making. (How people understand and think about the world.

\section*{Social cultural Perspective:}

Maintains that behavior and mental processes are shaped not only by prior learning experiences (the behavioral perspective) or intra-psychic forces (for instance, the unconscious) but also by the social or cultural context.

\section*{HUMAN GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT}
- Growth is an increase in size of a living being or any of its parts occurring in process of development
- Human development is a lifelong process of physical, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional growth and change.

\section*{Development is described in three domains}

\section*{Physical Domain:}
- body size, body proportions, appearance, brain development, motor development, perception capacities, physical health.

\section*{Cognitive Domain:}
- Thought processes and intellectual abilities including attention, memory, problem solving, imagination, creativity, academic and everyday knowledge, metacognition, and language.

\section*{Theories of development}

\section*{Psychoanalytical Theories}
- Are those influenced by the work of Sigmund Freud's, who believed in the importance of unconscious mind and childhood experiences.
- Freuds contribution to developmental theory was his proposal that development occurs through a series of psychosexual stages.
- Erik Erikson expanded upon Freud's ideas by proposing an 8 stages theory of psychosocial development.
- His theory focused on conflict that arise at different stages of development and, unlike Freud's theory, Erikson described development throughout the life span.

\section*{Learning Theories}
- Focuses on how the environment impacts behavior. Important learning processes include, classical conditioning, operant conditioning and social learning.
- In each behavior is shaped by the interaction between the individual and the environment

\section*{Cognitive theories}
- Focuses on the development of mental process, skills and abilities.
- Jean Piaget created one of the most famous theories of cognitive development suggesting that children are not passive recipients of information.
- His theory counts for the step and sequence of children's intellectual development.

\section*{FACTORS INFLUENCING GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT}

There are several factors which directly or indirectly influence the growth and development of an organism.

\section*{1) Heredity}
- Heredity is a biological process through which the transmission of physical and social characteristics takes place from parents to off-springs.
- It greatly influences height, weight and structure of the body, color of hair and eye, intelligence, aptitudes and instincts.
(a) Before birth (prenatal)
- Nutritional state of the mother
- Infections affecting the mother like syphilis, German measles
- Irradiations-exposure of mother to strong x-rays during early months of pregnancy
- Mechanical injury to the fetus e.g a fall by the mother.
- Mental health-emotional state of the mother
- Alcohol use-Heavy drinking by pregnant women results in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) (cluster of abnormalities) in children of mothers who drink alcohol heavily during pregnancy.
- Smoking
(b) During Labour and delivery
- Complicated labour leading to fetal distress (brain damage)
- Delivery by unskilled service providers (brain damage)
- Infections during labour \& delivery
(c) Following delivery
- Nutritional status of the child
- Infections
- Customs and taboos prohibiting children from eating certain nutritious foods
- Length of breast feeding
- Emotional support (love, acceptance) lives.

\section*{Hormonal}
- Male hormones controls development in the direction of masculinity and female hormones toward feminist.
- At puberty, these sex hormones promote the development of genital organs.
- Lacking the gonads, individuals of either sex develop without strong sex characteristics.
- Pituitary ("master gland") stimulates other glands like adrenal and gonads. If this gland is over-active in childhood, the muscles and bones grow very rapidly and the individual may become a giant

\section*{2) $\operatorname{sex}$}
- Sex acts as an important factor of growth and development.
- There is difference in growth and development of boys and girls.
- The boys are generally taller and courageous than the girls
- The functions of boys and girls are also different in nature.

\section*{3) Nutrition}
- The human body requires an adequate supply of calories for its normal growth at different phases of development.
- Malnutrition has adverse effect like underweight, stunted growth etc
4) Race
- The racial factor has a great influence on height, weight, color, features and body constitution.
- A child of white race will be white \& tall

\section*{5) Emotions}
- Relationships with significant other persons, mother, father, sibling, peers \& teacher play a vital role in the emotional, social, \& intellectual development of the child.
- If emotional deprivation continues over a period of time, the children may have repeated illness, become emotionally ill, or die at an early age.

\section*{6) Exercise}

Exercises build the strength of the muscle due to better circulation and oxygen supply.

\section*{8)Social economic}
- Children from different socioeconomic levels vary in average body size at all ages.
- The upper level families being always more advanced.

\section*{9)Family size}

The reasons behind this are better nutrition, better facilities, regular meals, sleep, and exercise

Children from different socioeconomic levels vary in average body size at all ages. The upper level families being always more advanced.
- The reasons behind this are better nutrition, better facilities, regular meals, sleep, and exercise

Alcohol
Tobacco
11) Chronic illness

Chronic illnesses and congenital diseases of any type may have effects on growth \& development e.g growth retardation.
12) age

Eldery mothers
Young mothers

\section*{LIFE STAGES/ LIFE SPAN STAGES}

\section*{1.Prenatal Period}

This is the period from conception to birth
Life begins with the meeting of two cells, a sperm and an egg (ovum) in the fallopian tube forming a zygote.
It takes approximately 266 days for zygote to become a fetus ready to be born.

\section*{Phases of prenatal period}
- Pre-natal development is divided into 3

The period of the zygote (Germinal period)
- The period of the embryo
- The period of the fetus

\section*{(a).Period of the zygote (Germinal Period)}

First 2 weeks after conception - This includes
- The creation of zygote.
- The continued cell division and
- The attachment of the zygote to the uterine wall.
- 24 to 36 hours after fertilization-the male (sperm) and the female (egg) Chromosome unite.
- The fertilized ovum, zygote divides into two (2) cells.
- Cell multiplication continues.
- 6-7 days - blastocyst attaches to the wall of uterus.
- 11-14 days - blastocyst invades into uterine wall and becomes implanted in it (implantation).
(b). Embryonic Stage
- 2-8 weeks after conception
- In this stage, the Zygote, become embryo.
- The following developments take place:
- Cell differentiation intensifies
- Life-support system for the embryo develop and
- Organs appear
- Body structures and internal organs develop
- Three (3) layers begin to form in the embryo:
a. Ectoderm: Outermost layer becomes the nervous system, sensory receptors (eyes, ears, nose) and skin parts (nails, hair).
b. Mesoderm: Middle layer becomes circulatory, skeletal, muscular, excretory and reproductive systems).
c. Endoderm: Inner layer develops into the digestive and respiratory systems-lungs

NB: Most of the organs found in a mature human are in place
- This process of organ formation during the first two months of pre-natal development is called organogenesis.
©. Fetal Stage
th
From the 9 wk to 9 months after conception
Growth and development continue dramatically during this period. The details of the developmental process are as follows (Santrock, 2002):
a). 3 months after conception-fetus has become active, moves its arms, legs and head. The genital can now be identified as male or female.
b) 4 months -Growth spurt occurs in the body's lower parts; pre-natal reflexes are stronger
c) 5 months-structures of the skin (finger nails, toe nails) have formed; fetus is more active.
d) 6 months after conception-Eyes and eyelids are completely formed; fine layer of head covers the head; grasping reflex is present and irregular movements occur.
e) 7 months after conception - fetus is about 16 long and weighs 3 pounds.
f) 8 and 9 months after conception - fetus grows longer and gains substantial weight, about 5 pounds.

\section*{2.Neonatal Period (birth -28 days)}

\section*{Survival reflexes:}

O Breathing-repetitive inhalation and expiration
O Eye blink-closing and blinking the eyes
O Papillary reflex-constriction of pupils to bright light and dilation to dark surroundings

O Rooting-turning the head in the direction of touch
O Sucking-sucking on objects placed into the mouth
O Swallowing-stimulation of the palate causes swallowing

\section*{Premitive Reflex}
- Babinski-fanning and then curling the toes when the bottom of the foot it stroked
- Palmer grasping-curling the fingers around the objects that touch the baby's palm

O Moro-loud noise will cause the baby to throw his arms outwards, arch the back and the bring the arms towards each other as if to hold on something.

O Swimming-when immersed in water, will display movements of arms and legs and involuntarily hold its breath

Otepping- when held upright with their feet touching on flat surface, will step as if to walk
- Birth weight: $2.5-3.5 \mathrm{kgs}$
- Height: $45-50 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Head circumference: $35-38 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Communicates by crying
- Develops preference to certain sounds

\section*{3. Infant (1month -1 year.)}

- Begins to acknowledge authority by listening to his mother forbidding him from doing certain things

\section*{4. Toddler (1-3 years)}

This is such an exciting time in the growth of your child! Their first smile, first word, learning to roll over, reaching out to explore their world and many more!

\section*{Language Development}

In our section on 0-12 months we explored the readiness skills your child was born with to learn language. They have spent a considerable amount of time listening to language all around them and are beginning to experiment with their own attempts to see how they can control the world around them. Development happens at different rates for each child, however there are expected ranges and patterns of development that we know children begin to exhibit as language emerges.

\section*{At 18 months:}
- Has about 8-10 meaningful words
- Follows simple commands such as "give me" or "come here"
- Recognizes words for common objects or people
- Is using a variety of sounds when babbling or when imitating words

\section*{At 24 months:}
- Is combining 2 words together into meaningful phrases
- Points to pictures when named in familiar books
- Is acquiring new vocabulary every month
- Is able to identify basic body parts when named

\section*{At 36 months:}
- Has a word for almost everything in their environment.
- Uses most sounds correctly in words and phrases
- Plays with other children, takes turns, engage in back and forth dialogue
- Answers simple wh-questions

\section*{Play Skills}

Play is the avenue through which children learn to use both verbal and nonverbal language, explore social interactions and learn the skills needed to engage with others. Play builds the foundation for a lifetime of learning. A child struggling with play can be a sign of underlying issues including language development, sensory regulation, social-emotional development and even fine and gross motor development! Play is your child's work and the avenue through which we need to teach.

\section*{At 18 months:}
- Imitates adult behavior and routines
- Engages in greetings and salutations (good bye, hello)
- Beginning to engage in pretend play (hugs doll, gives doll a drink)
- Has toy preferences

\section*{At 24 months:}
- Plays alongside other children, actively observes other children playing
- Uses similar looking objects for object needed
- Actively engages in imaginative play with familiar objects
- Shows interest in others and attempts to interact in play

\section*{At 36 months:}
- Understands basic social rules for turn taking, sharing with support
- Actively engages in and initiates pretend play
- Understands and expresses emotions

\section*{Gross Motor Development}

Along with language and play, your child now has access to their world through more independent movement. The development of Gross Motor skills are movements that require whole body movement and are the foundation for their participation in daily play activities. The development of eye-hand coordination skills such as ball skills (throwing, catching, kicking) are important foundational skills to educational tasks as well.

\section*{At 18 months:}
- Climb and stand on a chair
- Walk alone.
- Walk down stairs holding rail or your hand, one step at a time.
- Walk into a large ball as if to kick it

\section*{At 24 months:}
- Walk with more direction to their movements
- Kick a ball forward without losing his/her balance
- Walk up and down stairs alone while holding onto a railing
- Jump and stand on tiptoes

\section*{At 36 months:}
- Jump and/or walk backward
- Begin to pedal a tricycle
- Run without falling
- Play on swings, ladders and other playground equipment with a fair amount of ease

\section*{Fine Motor Development}

As your child begins to dress themselves these skills will impact their ability to open and close buttons, snaps and zippers. Coordination to tie their shoes is built in the early years while they are developing hand-eye coordination and the use of their hands together.

\section*{At 18 months:}
- Point to pictures in books by isolating his/her index finger
- Build a tower using 2 blocks
- Hold a crayon with a full fist and scribble
- Use both hands together to put in/take out/stack objects

\section*{At 24 months:}

\section*{At 36 months:}
- Snip with scissors and start to cut along a line
- Hold crayons with thumb and finger (not fist)
- Paint with movement in the wrist, imitating circular, vertical and horizontal strokes
- Roll, pound, squeeze, and pull clay
- Dress self with supervision

\section*{Feeding Skills}

During this stage your child is beginning to develop likes and dislikes, learning to try new things and is refining their ability to orally handle different types of foods. The term "picky eater" is often heard during this stage of development. There are many reasons why a child may develop a limited repertoire of food they will eat and determining the underlying reason is key in developing an effective therapy program. Oral weakness, sensory integration, oral motor coordination, and anxiety are all possible underlying reasons a child may develop an aversion to feeding.

At 18 months:
- Hold her own cup and drink, with some spilling
- Feed himself using a spoon, with some spilling
- Lips closed during chewing
- Eats a variety of foods from most of the major food groups

At 24 months:
- Chewing with rotary jaw movements
- Transitions from bottle to cup drinking; is in the process of giving up the bottle
- Scooping foods to feed self, with some spills
- Plays and explores foods of varying textures with hands
- Use a fork to eat

At 36 months:
- Will use a fork to feed self
- Wipes mouth with napkin
- Attempts to serve self at table with spills
- Is able to pour liquids from small containers

\section*{5.Pre- school Age (3-6 years)}

Usually around the age of 3 , your child becomes much more coordinated with running or going up and down the stairs. By the end of their preschool years, your child should be able to catch a bounced ball easily, kick a ball forward, and stand on one foot or hop. Three-year-olds are so active that sometimes they find it easier to substitute a
movement for a word. They may run around the room with their arms spread out to indicate flying instead of talking about flying.
- Rapid physical development
- From 3 yrs, child can dress or undress
- Can give his name when asked for it
- Start going to pre school
- Can learn another language

- 6- years-has 20 temporary teeth
- Permanent teeth start to replace temporary teeth
- Start primary school
- Formal learning at school will teach him concentration \& how to adapt to environment outside the home.

\section*{Cognitive development}
- Preschoolers are not logical thinkers.
- They believe what their eyes tell them even if it makes no sense.
- This is called prelogical thinking and is absolutely normal and charming.

\section*{6. School Age 6-12 years}
- Physical development is slow but steady
- Overall co-ordination, balance \& refinement in physical activities increase at this time
- Boys re taller than girls between ages 6 \& 8
- They advance in their mental abilities
- Improvement in problem solving abilities
- There is greater emotional maturity
- Teachers exert a lot of influence on a child \& they serve as role models

\section*{Adolescence}
- The developmental period of transition from childhood to early adulthood-entered at 13 years, ending at 20 years
- Begins with rapid physical changes.
- Pursuit of independence and identity are prominent
- Thought is now more logical, abstract, and idealistic

\section*{Stages of Adolescence}
a. Early Adolescence stage (10-13 years)

During this stage, children often start to grow more quickly. They also begin notice other body changes, including hair growth under the arms and near the genitals, breast development in female and enlargement of the testicles in male. They usually start a year or two earlier in girls than boys, and it can be normal for some changes to start as early as age 8 for females and age 9 for males. Many girls may start their period at around age 12, on average 2-3 years after the onset of breast development.

Early adolescents have concrete, black-and-white thinking. Things are either right or wrong, great or terrible, without much room in between. It is normal at this stage for young people to center their thinking on themselves (called "egocentrism"). As part of this, preteens and early teens are often self-conscious about their appearance and feel as though they are always being judged by their peers.
b. Middle Adolescence Stage (14-17)

Physical changes from puberty continue during middle adolescence. Most males will have started their growth spurt, and puberty-related changes continue. They may have some voice cracking, for example, as their voices lower. Some develop acne. Physical changes may be nearly complete for females, and most girls now have regular periods.

At this age, many teens become interested in romantic and sexual relationships. They may question and explore their sexual identity, which may be stressful if they do not have support from peers, family, or community.
c. Late adolescence (18-21... and beyond)

Late adolescents generally have completed physical development and grown to their full adult height. They usually have more impulse control by now and may be better able to gauge risks and rewards accurately. In comparison to middle adolescents, youth in late adolescence might find themselves thinking:

\section*{Appearance of secondary sex characteristics}

\section*{Secondary sex characteristics in girls}

- They become easily irritated
- Retirement may result in a sense of loss
- They tend to become progressively more dependent on their children for satisfaction of their needs
- They enjoy the company of children, especially grand children

\section*{Death and dying}

\section*{Introduction}
- Death does occur at any stage
- However, old people are more aware of its eminence
- They are less afraid of death than others
- Cultural beliefs influence the way people perceive death and react to dying \& death Elizabeth Kubler-Ross (1969) organized her theory after interviewing dying patientsAccording to her, the dying process consists of five interrelated stages

NB: some people may skip a stage \& other may not go through a given order while others may get stack at a particular stage. For others, the five stages may overlap

\section*{Defination}
- Loss

This is when the other person, possession, body part, familiar environment or sense of self is no longer present?
- Grief

It is when emotional response to a loss manifest in ways unique to an individual, based on personal experiences, cultural expectation and spiritual beliefs.
- Mourning

It is the social expression of grief and the behaviors associate with loss.
- Bereavement

It captures both grief and mourning and includes the emotional response and outward behavior of a person experiencing loss.
- Death is loss of life.

\section*{Stages of death or grieving}

There are five stages that are in an orderly manner but some people do not experience them in that order or length of time. They sometimes move back and forth between the stages.

\section*{Denial}
- Acceptance of facing death is difficult.
- People may react with shock and disbelief
- A person acts as if nothing has happened and refuses to accept the reality
- Shows no understanding of what is happening
- Denial permits hope to exist and it is short lived.

\section*{Anger}
- When denial is no longer successful, the patients experience feelings of anger, rage and envy or resentment
- The person asks the "Why me" question, expresses resistance and sometimes feels intense anger at God, other people or the situation.
- The person is hostile to people assisting him and anything done does not please him.

\section*{Bargaining}
- The patient hopes that death can be delayed
- He may promise God to do many things if allowed to live
- The dying person attempts to negotiate not to die at that time
- This cushions and postpones awareness of the loss by trying to prevent it from happening.
- It involves a deal with God, doctors, nurses.
- The dying or grieving person make promises to self, god or loved ones that they will live or believe differently if they are spared.

\section*{Depression}
- This happen when the person realizes the full impact of the loss
- The defensive mechanism are no longer effective
- The person expresses sadness and anguish and some individuals are overwhelmingly sad, hopeless and lonely.
Crying elicit support of the loved ones and the mental health caregiver, so they should be available for the patient
- They sometimes withdraw from relationships and life and may have suicide attempts. Resolution leads to acceptance.

\section*{Acceptance}
- This stage allows the dying to express their feelings, settle and wait for their death
- The person incorporates the loss into life and finds ways to move forward
- This time the person finds peace and contentment.
- The patient may desire time alone with his thoughts NB: these stages may also apply to the bereaved Some patients may ask to get outside the room This time the patient reviews his past and thinks of the unknown future. Patient need quietness with minimal verbalization. The patient may now talk about his funeral plans. Writing of the will.

> MAIN THEORIES ON ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT DEL LANGUAGE. 3.1 LEARNING THEORIES: WATSON AND SKINNER OPERANT CONDITIONING By the 1920s John B. Watson had left academic psychology and other behaviorists were becoming influential, proposing new forms of learning other than classical conditioning. Perhaps the most important of these was Burrhus Frederic Skinner; Although, for obvious reasons he is more commonly known as B.F. Skinner. Skinner's views were slightly less extreme than those of Watson. Skinner believed that we do have such a thing as a mind, but that it is simply more productive to study observable behavior rather than internal mental events. Skinner believed that the best way to understand behavior is to look at the causes of an action and its consequences. He called this approach operant conditioning. Skinner's theory of operant conditioning was based on the work of Thorndike (1905). Edward Thorndike studied learning
in animals using a puzzle box to propose the theory known as the 'Law of Effect'. BF Skinner: Operant Conditioning Skinner is regarded as the father of Operant Conditioning, but his work was based on Thorndike's law of effect. Skinner introduced a new term into the Law of Effect - Reinforcement. Behavior which is reinforced tends to be repeated (i.e. strengthened); behavior which is not reinforced tends to die out-or be extinguished (i.e. weakened). Skinner (1948) studied operant conditioning by conducting experiments using animals which he placed in a "Skinner Box" which was similar to Thorndike's puzzle box. B.F. Skinner (1938) coined the term operant conditioning; it means roughly changing of behavior by the use of reinforcement which is given after the desired response. Skinner identified three types of responses or operant that can follow behavior. SEC 3 Page 2 of 9 • Neutral operant's: responses from the environment that neither increase nor decrease the probability of a behavior being repeated. - Reinforces: Responses from the environment that increase the probability of a behavior being repeated. Reinforces can be either positive or negative. • Punishers: Response from the environment that decrease the likelihood of a behavior being repeated. Punishment weakens behavior. We can all think of examples of how our own behavior has been affected by reinforces and punishers. As a child you probably tried out a number of behaviors and learnt from their consequences. For example, if when you were younger you tried smoking at school, and the chief consequence was that you got in with the crowd you always wanted to hang out with, you would have been positively reinforced (i.e. rewarded) and would be likely to repeat the behavior. If, however, the main consequence was that you were caught, caned, suspended from school and your parents became involved you would most certainly have been punished, and you would consequently be much less likely to smoke now. Reinforcement (strengthens behavior) Skinner showed how positive reinforcement worked by placing a hungry rat in his Skinner box. The box contained a lever in the side and as the rat moved about the box it would accidentally knock the lever. Immediately it did so a food pellet would drop into a container next to the lever. The rats quickly learned to go straight to the lever after a few times of being put in the box. The consequence of receiving food if they pressed the lever ensured that they would repeat the action again and again. Positive reinforcement strengthens a behavior by providing a consequence an individual finds rewarding. For example, if your teacher gives you $£ 5$ each time you complete your homework (i.e. a reward) you are more likely to repeat this behavior in the future, thus strengthening the behavior of completing your homework. The removal of an unpleasant reinforcer can also strengthen behavior. This is known as negative reinforcement because it is the removal of an adverse SEC 3 Page 3 of 9 stimulus which is 'rewarding' to the animal. Negative reinforcement strengthens behavior because it stops or removes an unpleasant experience. For example, if you do not complete your homework you give your teacher 5.00 you will complete your homework to avoid paying 5.00 , thus strengthening the behavior of completing your homework. Skinner showed how negative reinforcement worked by placing a rat in his Skinner box and then subjecting it to an unpleasant electric current which caused it some discomfort. As the rat moved about the box it would accidentally knock the lever. Immediately it did so the electric current would be switched off. The rats quickly learned to go straight to the lever after a few times of being put in the box. The consequence of escaping the electric current ensured that they would repeat the action again and again. In fact Skinner even taught the rats to avoid the electric current by turning on a light just before the electric current came on. The rats soon learned to press the lever when the light came on because they knew that this would stop the electric current
being switched on. These two learned responses are known as Escape Learning and Avoidance Learning. Punishment (weakens behavior) Punishment is defined as the opposite of reinforcement since it is designed to weaken or eliminate a response rather than increase it. Like reinforcement, punishment can work either by directly applying an unpleasant stimulus like a shock after a response or by removing a potentially rewarding stimulus, for instance, deducting someone's pocket money to punish undesirable behavior. Note: It is not always easy to distinguish between punishment and negative reinforcement. Behavior Modification Behavior modification is a set of therapies / techniques based on operant conditioning (Skinner, 1938, 1953). The main principle comprises changing environmental events that are related to a person's behavior. SEC 3 Page 4 of 9 For example, the reinforcement of desired behaviors and ignoring or punishing undesired ones. This is not as simple as it sounds always reinforcing desired behavior, for example, is basically bribery. There are different types of positive reinforcements. Primary reinforcement is when a reward strengths a behavior by itself. Secondary reinforcement is when something strengthens a behavior because it leads to a primary reinforcer. Examples of behavior modification therapy include token economy and behavior shaping Token Economy The token economy is a system in which targeted behaviors are reinforced with tokens (secondary reinforcers) and are later exchanged for rewards (primary reinforcers). Tokens can be in the form of fake money, buttons, poker chips, stickers, etc. while rewards can range anywhere from snacks to privileges/activities. Token economy has been found to be very effective in managing psychiatric patients. However, the patients can become over reliant on the tokens, making it difficult for them once they leave prisons, hospital etc. Teachers use token economy at primary school by giving young children stickers to reward good behavior. Operant Conditioning in the Classroom Behavior modification therapy is much used in clinical and educational psychology, particularly with people with learning difficulties. In the conventional learning situation it applies largely to issues of class- and student management, rather than to learning content. It is very relevant to shaping skill performance. A simple way of giving positive reinforcement in behavior modification is in providing compliments, approval, encouragement, and affirmation; a ratio of five compliments for every one complaint is generally seen as being the most effective in altering behavior in a desired manner. SEC 3 Page 5 of 9 Operant Conditioning Summary Looking at Skinner's classic studies on pigeons' behavior we can identify some of the major assumptions of behaviorists approach. • Psychology should be seen as a science, to be studied in a scientific manner. Skinner's study of behavior in rats was conducted under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. - Behaviorism is primarily concerned with observable behavior, as opposed to internal events like thinking and emotion. Note that Skinner did not say that the rats learnt to press a lever because they wanted food. He instead concentrated on describing the easily observed behavior that the rats acquired. - The major influence on human behavior is learning from our environment. In the Skinner study, because food followed a particular behavior the rats learned to repeat that behavior, e.g. classical and operant conditioning. - There is little difference between the learning that takes place in humans and that in other animals. Therefore research (e.g. classical conditioning) can be carried out on animals (Pavlov's dogs) as well as on humans (Little Albert). Skinner proposed that the way humans learn behavior is much the same as the way the rats learned to press a lever. So, if your layperson's idea of psychology has always been of people in laboratories wearing white coats and watching hapless rats try to negotiate mazes in order to get to their dinner, then you are probably
thinking of behavioral psychology. Behaviorism and its offshoots tend to be among the most scientific of the psychological perspectives. The emphasis of behavioral psychology is on how we learn to behave in certain ways. We are all constantly learning new behaviors and how to modify our existing behavior. Behavioral psychology is the psychological approach that focuses on how this learning takes place. Critical Evaluation Operant conditioning can be used to explain a wide variety of behavior, from the process of learning, to addiction and language acquisition. It also has practical application (such as token economy) which can be applied in classrooms, prisons and psychiatric hospitals. SEC 3 Page 6 of 9 However, operant conditioning fails to taken into account the role of inherited and cognitive factors in learning, and thus is an incomplete explanation of the learning process in humans and animals. Watson (1878-1958) John Watson was the founder of behaviorist theory. Quite innovatively for the time, he found Freudian-based explanations of behavior too theoretical and disagreed with the eugenic idea of heredity determining how one behaves. Instead, he believed that people's reactions in various situations were determined by how their overall experiences had programmed them to react. In experiments he performed in the early 1900s he showed that he could condition, or train, children to respond to a certain stimulus in a way that was different from what their normal response would be in the absence of such training. For example, one infant named Albert who had previously liked and attempted to pet a white rat was later conditioned by Watson to come to fear it. This was done by producing loud clanging noises whenever the rat was brought into Albert's line of sight; in a few weeks time, the rat alone could induce tears and an attempted flight response by the terrified baby. Because Watson repeatedly stimulated Albert to feel fear when the rat was present, the infant's experiences taught it to be afraid around rats and react accordingly. Albert not only feared rats but had been programmed through the experiment to fear most other white and fuzzy objects as well, from coats to Santa Claus beards. 3.2 COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT THEORIES: Bloom and Brunner. Jerome Bruner, Benjamin Bloom and Jean Piaget are three Theorists that studied cognitive and behavioral development. All three of these Theorists SEC 3 Page 7 of 9 are renown in their field and for their work in education. Jean Piaget's approach is central to the school of cognitive theory known as "cognitive constructivism." Bruner's work put more emphasis on the part played by language development and the extent that other people play in enabling children to learn. Bloom is credited with his work on taxonomy of questioning technique that is used by teachers. Jean Piaget Piaget's view of how children's minds work and develop has been enormously influential, particularly in educational theory. "He is best known for his work in the area of Developmental Psychology." He believed that children moved through certain cognitive stages of development into adulthood. The stages of development arise naturally out of exploration with one's environment. Piaget believed that children learn to accomplish certain tasks only when they were psychologically and developmentally mature enough to do so. According to (Craighead, \& Nemeroff, 2001) Piaget divided the child's path of development into four stages, which began with birth and culminated in the teen years. These stages are: Sensorimotor stage ( $0-2 \mathrm{yrs}$ ) is where the child interacts with the environment by sucking, pushing, grabbing, and shaking things. These interactions help build a cognitive foundation about the world. Preoperational stage (2-7 yrs) is where the child is not able to understand abstract concepts and will need to repeat experiences before they understand the cause and effect connection. Concrete operations (711 yrs) are where the child starts to develop a knowledge base from his experiences. The child also begins to be able to use this knowledge base to make more sophisticated
explanations and predictions. Formal operations (11-15 and up). The child's knowledge base and cognitive is similar to those of an adult. The child's ability to think in the abstract increases dramatically. The main concept of Piaget's theory of cognitive development is that these stages do not vary in order, cannot be skipped, and should not be rushed. This means that before these age's children are not capable (no matter how bright) of understanding things in certain ways, and has been used as the basis for scheduling and developing the school curriculum. Jerome Bruner Bruner believed that children learn best by their social interactions and by someone leading them through their learning experience. According to SEC 3 Page 8 of 9 (McLeod, 2007) Bruner believes that even a very young learner is capable of learning any material so long as the instruction is organized appropriately. He proposed three modes of representation. These modes of representation are the way in which information or knowledge are stored and encoded in memory. The first mode is called Enactive. Enactive involves receiving or registering action based information and storing it in our memory. This involves representing past events through motor responses. It mainly involves knowing how to do something a series of actions that are right for achieving a certain result. One example would be tying one's shoes. The second mode is called Iconic. This is where information is stored in the form of images. This would be a mental picture in the mind's eye. For some people this image is conscious while others say they do not experience it. This may explain why some people find it helpful to have a diagram or illustration to go along with the verbal information. The third mode is called Symbolic and this stage develops last. This is where information is stored in the form of a code or symbol such as language. In addition to his work on learning, Bruner also developed the spiraling approach to curriculum. The idea of the spiral curriculum, is basically that as it develops it should revisit this basic ideas repeatedly, building upon the basic ideas until the student has grasped the full formal symbolic mode of learning. Benjamin Bloom Benjamin Bloom is best known for Bloom's taxonomy. Bloom's taxonomy refers to three learning objectives. These three learning objectives are Cognitive, Affective, and Psychomotor; also known as thinking/head, feeling/heart and doing/hands.. The taxonomy is a concrete assessment tool for educators to use. In later years, according to (Eisner, 200) he further classified them into six educational objectives in which students should engage. His levels of thinking are listed from lowest to highest in terms of complexity. His original taxonomy was first published in 1956 and then revised in 2001. Bloom was interested in providing a useful practical tool that was congruent with what was understood at that time about the features of the higher mental processes. Bloom's contributions to education extended well beyond the taxonomy. He was fundamentally interested in thinking and its development. Comparing Theorists According to (McLeod, 2007) there are obvious similarities and striking differences between Bruner and Piaget. Similarly, both theorists believed SEC 3 Page 9 of 9 that cognitive development occurred through interaction with their environment. While Piaget and Bruner focused on childhood development, Bloom focused his work on learning environments and instructional approaches that relied on student behavioral objectives. He changed the way that educators think about instruction delivery. His main work focused on the incorporation of academic standards and integration of multiple subjects in on lesson. In the field of education and childhood psychology and development there are many similarities and differences between theorists. While Bloom is well respected in the Education field, his focus on research was not on child development but rather on assessment techniques for educators.

Behavior Modification Behavior modification is a set of therapies / techniques based on operant conditioning (Skinner, 1938, 1953). The main principle comprises changing environmental events that are related to a person's behavior. SEC 3 Page 4 of 9 For example, the reinforcement of desired behaviors and ignoring or punishing undesired ones.

\section*{Factors influencing human behavior}

The key factors influencing an individual's attitude in personal as well as social life are.

\section*{Abilities}

Abilities are the traits a person learns from the environment around as well as the traits a person is gifted with by birth. These traits are broadly classified as -
- Intellectual abilities
- Physical abilities
- Self-awareness abilities

In order to understand how these affect a person's behavior, we need to know what these abilities are.
- Intellectual abilities - It personifies a person’s intelligence, verbal and analytical reasoning abilities, memory as well as verbal comprehension.
- Physical abilities - It personifies a person's physical strength, stamina, body coordination as well as motor skills.
- Self-awareness abilities - It symbolizes how a person feels about the task, while a manager's perception of his abilities decides the kind of work that needs to be allotted to an individual.

\section*{Gender}

Research proves that men and women both stand equal in terms of job performance and mental abilities; however, society still emphasizes differences between the two genders. Absenteeism is one area in an organization where differences are found as women are considered to be the primary caregiver for children. A factor that might influence work allocation and evaluation in an organization is the manager's perception and personal values.

\section*{Race \& Culture}

Race \& culture have always exerted an important influence both at the workplace as well as in the society. The common mistakes such as attributing behavior and stereotyping according to individual's race \& culture basically influences an individual's behavior.

\section*{Perception}

Perception is an intellectual process of transforming sensory stimuli into meaningful information. It is the process of interpreting something that we see or hear in our mind and use it later to judge and give a verdict on a situation, person, group, etc.

It can be divided into six types namely -
- Of sound - The ability to receive sound by identifying vibrations.
- Of speech - The competence of interpreting and understanding the sounds of language heard.
- Touch - Identifying objects through patterns of its surface by touching it.
- Taste - The ability to detect flavor of substances by tasting it through sensory organs known as taste buds.
- Other senses - Other senses include balance, acceleration, pain, time, sensation felt in throat and lungs etc.
- Of the social world - It permits people to understand other individuals and groups of their social world

\section*{Attribution}

Attribution is the course of observing behavior followed by determining its cause based on individual's personality or situation.

Attribution framework uses the following three criteria -

Consensus - The extent to which people in the same situation might react similarly.

Distinctiveness - The extent to which a person's behavior can be associated to situations or personality.

Consistency - The frequency measurement of the observed behavior, that is, how often does this behavior occur.

\section*{Attitude}

Attitude is the abstract learnt reaction or say response of a person's entire cognitive process over a time span.

\section*{HEALTHY BEHAVIOURS}

\section*{Maintain a healthy diet}

Research shows that healthy eating contributes greatly to overall health.
Few adults achieve the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables.
The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults eat between 1.5 and 2.5
cups of fruit and 2.5 and 4 cups of vegetables daily, depending on age, gender, and amount of
regular physical activity.

\section*{2. Engage in regular exercise}

Regular physical activity is one of the most important contributors to health and helps to achieve
and maintain a healthy weight while contributing to the health of bones, joints, and muscles. It
can also reduce feelings of anxiety and depression.
Less than half of adults in Michigan engage in recommended physical activity regularly - at
least 150 minutes ( 2.5 hours) of moderate intensity physical activity a week, such as brisk walking,
biking or swimming.
Children and adolescents should get 60 minutes of physical activity per day.

\section*{3. Get an annual physical examination}

Receiving an annual physical is a good way to be proactive about health and wellness.
There are many benefits to having an annual physical exam, including earlier diagnosis and
treatment of existing health issues and prevention of future problems.
Regular physical exams also provide a variety of screenings dependent on age, health and
family history and lifestyle choices.
By getting the right health services, screenings, and treatments, Michiganders increase their
chances for living longer and healthier lives.
4. Avoid all tobacco use and exposure

Tobacco use is the leading cause of premature and preventable death in the United States.

Avoiding all tobacco use, including cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipes and hookahs,
and also eliminating exposure to secondhand smoke, can greatly reduce the risk of developing
heart disease, cancers, pulmonary disease, periodontal disease, asthma and other diseases.

While Michigan has decreased smoking in the population over the last 50 years from 46 percent
to 18 percent, we still have 15,000 annual deaths related to smoking.
Evidence-based practices have demonstrated th
Behavior modification

\section*{Reinforcement}

A commonly used element of behavior modification is positive reinforcement, or a reward system. An example of positive reinforcement is giving a child a hug when she does a good job, or to provide money for good grades. Negative reinforcement, which takes something away to reinforce good behavior, is also an effective tool to modify habits or other behavior. An example of negative reinforcement is when a child decides to get ready for school on time, and his parents subsequently stop nagging him about this issue. The takeaway of nagging reinforces his improved morning routine.

\section*{Punishment}

Behavior modification can also discourage unwanted behavior through punishment, which can also be positive or negative. In this theory, the term positive refers to something added -- such as a consequence. An example is making athletes run extra laps if they are late to practice. Negative punishment is when something is taken away, such as the removal of video games if chores have not been completed. In this example, the negative punishment should encourage this child to do his chores in the future, in order to avoid punishment.

\section*{Applications}

Behavior modification can be an effective technique used in parenting, and also to help manage behavior in children or adults with attention deficit disorder, autism or oppositional defiant disorder

Furthermore, this method can be used to increase desired behaviors in any individual, regardless of functional level. For example, behavior modification has been used successfully in weight management and smoking cessation programs. Behavior modification can also be used to increase productivity within organizations and businesses.

\section*{Motivation Therapy}

There are two common types of motivation therapy. The first is Motivational Enhancement Therapy or MET. The second is Motivational Interviewing or MI. These two forms of therapy are very similar, but they are not the same thing.

Motivational Interviewing is beneficial for people that are struggling with finding the motivation they need to make the positive improvements they need to make in life. It's generally used with people that are struggling with addiction or those that are dealing with medical conditions such as diabetes. However, it can be used for anyone that needs to make changes in their lives for the better or to stop making decisions that involve risky or dangerous behavior.

These challenges require people to make changes to their lives for them to improve. If you struggle with an addiction, you need to change your behavior to overcome it. If you've been diagnosed with diabetes, you need to change your decisions to improve your health.

Motivational Enhancement Therapy is more used specifically with those that are trying to stop using drugs and alcohol. The treatment is brief and doesn't usually last longer than a few sessions.

\section*{How Does Motivational Therapy Work?}

Motivational therapy is typically best when used as the start of other forms of treatment. It helps set the stage for the other treatment that they will be going through. Motivational therapy works by helping people tap into what their internal motivating factors are for making the changes that they need to make in their life.

Many people that struggle with addiction may know that they need to change their decisions. They may even know that life will be better if they do. However, they struggle with actually finding the motivation they need to follow through on making better decisions.

The therapist will work as an interview to ask their patient about what changes they are looking to make. This could be to stop using drugs or alcohol or to start eating healthier to get control of their health issues. The patient will also dive into what their reasons are for wanting to make the change. It goes beyond doing it because a doctor told them to. They need to identify the personal reasons why it matters to them. Being able to make these personal identifications will help them to follow through.

\section*{Token Economy}

A token economy is a form of behavior modification.The primary goal of a token economy is to increase desirable behavior and decrease undesirable behavior. Often token economies are used in institutional settings (such as psychiatric hospitals or correctional facilities) to manage the behavior of individuals who may be aggressive or unpredictable. However, the larger goal of token economies is to teach appropriate behavior and social skills that can be used in one's natural environment.special education (for children with developmental orlearning disabilities, hyperactivity, attention deficit, or behavioral disorders), regular education, colleges, various types of group homes, military divisions, nursing homes, addiction treatment programs, occupational settings, family homes (for marital or parenting difficulties), and hospitals may also use token economies. Token economies can be used individually or in groups.ehavior modification designed to increase desirable behavior and decrease undesirable behavior with the use of tokens. Individuals receive tokens immediately after displaying desirable behavior. The tokens are collected and later exchanged for a meaningful object or privilege.

\section*{PERSONSLITY DEVELOPMENT}

Generally, Personality can be defined as a dynamic and organized set of characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely influences his or her cognitions/thoughts, motivations, and behaviors in various situations. Personality therefore is not what the layman construes it to be i.e. the mere physical disposition; rather it is more comprehensive, encompassing both external and internal sets of characteristics.

\section*{GOALS OF PERSONALITY THEORY}

The chief objective of personality theory is to give a systematic account of the nature and constituents of human nature. This entails an explanation of how
personality grows and develops; how personality energizes behaviour; how personality can be sick and what can be done to restore its health when hurt.

\section*{COMPONENTS OF A STANDARD PERSONALITY THEORY}

A standard personality theorist must cover number of grounds as follows:
- View of human structure A standard personality theory must give its theoretical view on the structure or major components of human nature. For example the id, ego and superego basic mind processes in Freud's theory.
- View of human motivation......it must contain an explanation of people behave the way they do. It must respond to the question: What moves human being into action? What activates human behavior? For example, Adler in his theory cites a desire to overcome inferiority as one force motivating humans into action.

\section*{PSYCHOANALYSIS THEORY VIEW OF PERSONALITY STRUCTURE}

Freud has two perspectives under this component:
- View of topographical structure of human the mind
- The view of basic mind process system Id, Ego and super Ego.
i) Topographical structure of mind

Freud proposes three levels of consciousness at which the human mind operates:
- Conscious level...... This is the part of the mind that holds what you are aware of; materials that are within your immediate memory. You can verbalize about your conscious experience and you can think about it in a

Logical fashion. No mental energy is required to recall this material. This level contains 5-10\% of the materials.
- Pre/subconscious level...contains materials within the preconscious memory. So although materials stored here aren't in the conscious, they can be readily brought into conscious through use of moderate mental energy. This level contains $10-15 \%$ of the materials.
- Unconscious level.... This level according to Freud, houses most of our materials ( $75 \_80 \%$ ). Freud felt that this part of the mind was not directly accessible to awareness. In part, he saw it as a dump box for urges, feelings and ideas that are tied to anxiety, conflict and pain. These are the unacceptable wishes, desires, fantasies and past painful/traumatic experiences. For example, a girl who is defiled may have the experience erased from her memory. These experiences however have not disappeared according to Freud, they are there, buried in the unconscious region of our minds and exerting influence on our actions and our conscious awareness.

One original aspect of Freud personality theory is the view of basic mind process. Freud proposes that the human mind is made of three principle agencies /forces that organize our behaviour namely:
- Ego
- Id
- superego

Id
The id comprises the unorganised part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. The mind of a newborn child is regarded as completely "id-ridden", in the sense that it is a mass of instinctive drives and impulses, and needs immediate satisfaction. The id obeys " pleasure principle", helping man to go for pleasure and to avoid pain. It is the dark,
part of our personality which we call chaos; a cauldron full of seething excitations... id is illogical; not believing in postponement of pleasure but only striving to bring about the satisfaction of the id impulses and basic drives. The id is thus responsible for our basic drives such as food, water, sex, and basic impulses. It is amoral and selfish, without a sense of time, completely illogical, primarily sexual, infantile in its emotional development, and is not able to take "no" for an answer.

The Ego
The word ego is taken directly from Latin, where it is the nominative of the first person singular personal pronoun and is translated as "I myself".

\section*{The Ego}
acts according to the 'reality principle' seeking to please the id's drives in realistic ways that will benefit in the long term rather than bring grief. The Ego comprises that organised part of the personality structure that includes defensive, perceptual, intellectual-cognitive, and executive functions. Conscious awareness resides in the ego. The ego weighs the consequences of actions before allowing an individual to behave. It helps us to organize our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us. The ego is that part of our personality that has been modified by the direct influence of the external world. The ego represents what may be called reason and common sense, in contrast to the id, which contains the passions. In Freud's theory, the ego mediates among the id, the super-ego and the external world. Its task is to find a balance between the demands of the id and super-ego. Its main concern is with the individual's safety. It allows some of the id's desires to be expressed, but only when consequences of these actions are marginal. The ego operates as a traffic cop; checking the id impulses and regulating the needs of the super-ego and ensuring that the individual maintains a healthy balance.

\section*{Super Ego}

The Super-ego aims for perfection hence it obeys the moral principle. The superego is the product of social standards that have been inculcated in us the significance others. The Super-ego punishes misbehavior with feelings of guilt. For example: having extra-marital affairs, killing etc. The Super-ego works in contradiction to the id. The Super-ego helps the individual to strive to act in socially appropriate manner, whereas the id just wants instant self gratification. The Super-ego controls our sense of right and wrong. The Super ego's demands oppose the id's, so the ego has a hard time in reconciling the two. Freud's theory implies that the super-ego is a symbolic internalization of the father figure and cultural regulations. The super-ego tends to stand in opposition to the desires of the id because of their conflicting objectives, and its aggressiveness towards the ego. The super-ego acts as the conscience, maintaining our sense of morality; a sense of what is right or wrong and punishing us with guilt when we fail to keep the moral standards that we have internalized. The super-ego is the influence of authority, religious teaching, schooling and reading. The stricter the authority, the stricter will be the domination of the super-ego over the ego later on - in the form of conscience or perhaps of an unconscious sense of guilt. The ego ideal component of the superego helps us to become the best that we can become.

\section*{VIEW OF PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT}

Freud's position is that personality emerges as the child develops from infancy to adolescence. According to him, human personality develops across five psychosexual stages namely: Oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital stages from ages of 0 to 12 years. By the age of twelve according to Freud, the child is supposed to develop a mature personality. However some children get fixated in one of the developmental stages and this sabotages the evolution of a mature
personality. Such individuals will demonstrate these fixations even in their adult life.

\section*{ALFRED ADLERS THEORY OF PERSONALITY}

\section*{VIEW OF STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY}

Adler believed that we are influenced by our biological drives in most of what we do. Adler adopted the teleological view. According to him every human being has one fundamental goal which is to attain perfection or improved state of life or actualize himself. This striving for perfection is generated in early experience by feelings of inferiority started at birth. According to him we are all engaged in the upward drive and this is the true ground of our personality. Thus according to Adler, the building blocks of personality are our goals, aspirations and ideals.

\section*{. HIS VIEW PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT}

Like Freud Adler believes direction of our personality is influenced by early experience. He believes that active and collaborative effort of both parents is
essential for proper bringing of a child. Their cooperative existence in the home helps children to learn meaning of life, importance of cooperation among fellow human beings and right conception of love and friendship. In his view, mothers have greater role in proper development of child. Adler believes that each child is treated uniquely by his parent depending on order of birth within a family. According to him the youngest child tends to be pampered but he has many role models to learn from to develop competitive orientation to live and grow.

SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY OF DEVELOPMENT
VIEW OF PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT
Relevant behaviours of modeling are acquired through modeling or through observation of others as well as through education as form of direct
experience Behavior that are filled with reward are repeated and those filled with punishment are avoided. Thus to him personality is composed of good and bad habits formed as
we grow. His theory also identifies agencies that contribute to this habit formation in human beings. He focuses on the role of TV, parents and peers in personality development.

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT There are three main influences on personality development that we are going to look at in this lesson. Those are heredity, environment, and situation.

Heredity: This refers to the influences on your personality that you are born with. They are in your genes and there is not much you can do to change these traits. They can include your temperament, which helps to determine how you react to situations and how easygoing you are. In kids, it may affect how well they get along with others. Genetics, of course, also determines how someone looks.

Environment: Our environment is the nurturing aspect of our lives. It is the type of environment in which we live and grow up. Environment would include home, school, work, or other places that you spend a lot of time. Environmental factors also include such things as languages, religion, etc.

Situations: These are the experiences that each individual person goes through. The various things that people experience will leave imprints on and help to develop his or her personality. Everything from divorce, death, trauma, and even happy times fit into the "situations" category of shaping one's personality.

You have most likely at some point in your life heard someone say that people are a "product of their environment." This means their personality has been greatly influenced by the three things we just looked at. They were born with particular traits, and their living situation and any impacting situations they experienced all helped to create who they are.
