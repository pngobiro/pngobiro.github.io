                        <p>In order to understand how these affect a person's behavior, we need to know what these abilities are.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        <p>Research proves that men and women both stand equal in terms of job performance and mental abilities; however, society still emphasizes differences between the two genders. Absenteeism is one area in an organization where differences are found as women are considered to be the primary caregiver for children. A factor that might influence work allocation and evaluation in an organization is the manager's perception and personal values.</p>

                        <p>Research shows that healthy eating contributes greatly to overall health.</p>
                        <p>Few adults achieve the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables.</p>
                        <p>The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults eat between 1.5 and 2.5 cups of fruit and 2.5 and 4 cups of vegetables daily, depending on age, gender, and amount of regular physical activity.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Engage in regular exercise</h3>
                        <p>Regular physical activity is one of the most important contributors to health and helps to achieve and maintain a healthy weight while contributing to the health of bones, joints, and muscles. It can also reduce feelings of anxiety and depression.</p>
                        <p>Less than half of adults in Michigan engage in recommended physical activity regularly - at least 150 minutes ( 2.5 hours) of moderate intensity physical activity a week, such as brisk walking, biking or swimming.</p>
                        <p>Children and adolescents should get 60 minutes of physical activity per day.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Get an annual physical examination</h3>
                        <p>Receiving an annual physical is a good way to be proactive about health and wellness.</p>
                        <p>There are many benefits to having an annual physical exam, including earlier diagnosis and treatment of existing health issues and prevention of future problems.</p>
                        <p>Regular physical exams also provide a variety of screenings dependent on age, health and family history and lifestyle choices.</p>
                        <p>By getting the right health services, screenings, and treatments, Michiganders increase their chances for living longer and healthier lives.</p>

                        <p>Tobacco use is the leading cause of premature and preventable death in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Avoiding all tobacco use, including cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipes and hookahs, and also eliminating exposure to secondhand smoke, can greatly reduce the risk of developing heart disease, cancers, pulmonary disease, periodontal disease, asthma and other diseases.</p>
                        <p>While Michigan has decreased smoking in the population over the last 50 years from 46 percent to 18 percent, we still have 15,000 annual deaths related to smoking.</p>
