                        <p>Adler believed that we are influenced by our biological drives in most of what we do. Adler adopted the teleological view. According to him every human being has one fundamental goal which is to attain perfection or improved state of life or actualize himself. This striving for perfection is generated in early experience by feelings of inferiority started at birth. According to him we are all engaged in the upward drive and this is the true ground of our personality. Thus according to Adler, the building blocks of personality are our goals, aspirations and ideals.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">. HIS VIEW PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT</h3> <!-- Dot kept as per original -->
                        <p>Like Freud Adler believes direction of our personality is influenced by early experience. He believes that active and collaborative effort of both parents is essential for proper bringing of a child. Their cooperative existence in the home helps children to learn meaning of life, importance of cooperation among fellow human beings and right conception of love and friendship. In his view, mothers have greater role in proper development of child. Adler believes that each child is treated uniquely by his parent depending on order of birth within a family. According to him the youngest child tends to be pampered but he has many role models to learn from to develop competitive orientation to live and grow.</p>

                        <p>Relevant behaviours of modeling are acquired through modeling or through observation of others as well as through education as form of direct experience Behavior that are filled with reward are repeated and those filled with punishment are avoided. Thus to him personality is composed of good and bad habits formed as we grow. His theory also identifies agencies that contribute to this habit formation in human beings. He focuses on the role of TV, parents and peers in personality development.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are three main influences on personality development that we are going to look at in this lesson. Those are heredity, environment, and situation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Heredity:</strong> This refers to the influences on your personality that you are born with. They are in your genes and there is not much you can do to change these traits. They can include your temperament, which helps to determine how you react to situations and how easygoing you are. In kids, it may affect how well they get along with others. Genetics, of course, also determines how someone looks.</p>
                        <p><strong>Environment:</strong> Our environment is the nurturing aspect of our lives. It is the type of environment in which we live and grow up. Environment would include home, school, work, or other places that you spend a lot of time. Environmental factors also include such things as languages, religion, etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>Situations:</strong> These are the experiences that each individual person goes through. The various things that people experience will leave imprints on and help to develop his or her personality. Everything from divorce, death, trauma, and even happy times fit into the "situations" category of shaping one's personality.</p>
                        <p>You have most likely at some point in your life heard someone say that people are a "product of their environment." This means their personality has been greatly influenced by the three things we just looked at. They were born with particular traits, and their living situation and any impacting situations they experienced all helped to create who they are.</p>
