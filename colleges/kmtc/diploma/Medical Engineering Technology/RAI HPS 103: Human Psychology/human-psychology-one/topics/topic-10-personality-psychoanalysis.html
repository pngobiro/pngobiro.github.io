                        <p>Generally, Personality can be defined as a dynamic and organized set of characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely influences his or her cognitions/thoughts, motivations, and behaviors in various situations. Personality therefore is not what the layman construes it to be i.e. the mere physical disposition; rather it is more comprehensive, encompassing both external and internal sets of characteristics.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">GOALS OF PERSONALITY THEORY</h3>
                        <p>The chief objective of personality theory is to give a systematic account of the nature and constituents of human nature. This entails an explanation of how personality grows and develops; how personality energizes behaviour; how personality can be sick and what can be done to restore its health when hurt.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">COMPONENTS OF A STANDARD PERSONALITY THEORY</h3>
                        <p>A standard personality theorist must cover number of grounds as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">View of human structure A standard personality theory must give its theoretical view on the structure or major components of human nature.

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Freud has two perspectives under this component:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">View of topographical structure of human the mind</span></li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">i) Topographical structure of mind</h3>
                        <p>Freud proposes three levels of consciousness at which the human mind operates:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Conscious level...... This is the part of the mind that holds what you are aware of; materials that are within your immediate memory. You can verbalize about your conscious experience and you can think about it in a Logical fashion. No mental energy is required to recall this material. This level contains 5-10\% of the materials.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Pre/subconscious level...contains materials within the preconscious memory. So although materials stored here aren't in the conscious, they can be readily brought into conscious through use of moderate mental energy. This level contains $10-15 \%$ of the materials.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Unconscious level.... This level according to Freud, houses most of our materials ( $75 \_80 \%$ ). Freud felt that this part of the mind was not directly accessible to awareness. In part, he saw it as a dump box for urges, feelings and ideas that are tied to anxiety, conflict and pain. These are the unacceptable wishes, desires, fantasies and past painful/traumatic experiences. For example, a girl who is defiled may have the experience erased from her memory. These experiences however have not disappeared according to Freud, they are there, buried in the unconscious region of our minds and exerting influence on our actions and our conscious awareness.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>One original aspect of Freud personality theory is the view of basic mind process. Freud proposes that the human mind is made of three principle agencies /forces that organize our behaviour namely:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Ego</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Id</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">superego</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Id</h3>
                        <p>The id comprises the unorganised part of the personality structure that contains the basic drives. The mind of a newborn child is regarded as completely "id-ridden", in the sense that it is a mass of instinctive drives and impulses, and needs immediate satisfaction. The id obeys " pleasure principle", helping man to go for pleasure and to avoid pain. It is the dark, part of our personality which we call chaos; a cauldron full of seething excitations... id is illogical; not believing in postponement of pleasure but only striving to bring about the satisfaction of the id impulses and basic drives. The id is thus responsible for our basic drives such as food, water, sex, and basic impulses. It is amoral and selfish, without a sense of time, completely illogical, primarily sexual, infantile in its emotional development, and is not able to take "no" for an answer.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Ego</h3>
                        <p>The word ego is taken directly from Latin, where it is the nominative of the first person singular personal pronoun and is translated as "I myself".</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Ego</h3> <!-- Duplicate heading kept as per original -->
                        <p>acts according to the 'reality principle' seeking to please the id's drives in realistic ways that will benefit in the long term rather than bring grief. The Ego comprises that organised part of the personality structure that includes defensive, perceptual, intellectual-cognitive, and executive functions. Conscious awareness resides in the ego. The ego weighs the consequences of actions before allowing an individual to behave. It helps us to organize our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us. The ego is that part of our personality that has been modified by the direct influence of the external world. The ego represents what may be called reason and common sense, in contrast to the id, which contains the passions. In Freud's theory, the ego mediates among the id, the super-ego and the external world. Its task is to find a balance between the demands of the id and super-ego. Its main concern is with the individual's safety. It allows some of the id's desires to be expressed, but only when consequences of these actions are marginal. The ego operates as a traffic cop; checking the id impulses and regulating the needs of the super-ego and ensuring that the individual maintains a healthy balance.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Super Ego</h3>
                        <p>The Super-ego aims for perfection hence it obeys the moral principle. The superego is the product of social standards that have been inculcated in us the significance others. The Super-ego punishes misbehavior with feelings of guilt. For example: having extra-marital affairs, killing etc. The Super-ego works in contradiction to the id. The Super-ego helps the individual to strive to act in socially appropriate manner, whereas the id just wants instant self gratification. The Super-ego controls our sense of right and wrong. The Super ego's demands oppose the id's, so the ego has a hard time in reconciling the two. Freud's theory implies that the super-ego is a symbolic internalization of the father figure and cultural regulations. The super-ego tends to stand in opposition to the desires of the id because of their conflicting objectives, and its aggressiveness towards the ego. The super-ego acts as the conscience, maintaining our sense of morality; a sense of what is right or wrong and punishing us with guilt when we fail to keep the moral standards that we have internalized. The super-ego is the influence of authority, religious teaching, schooling and reading. The stricter the authority, the stricter will be the domination of the super-ego over the ego later on - in the form of conscience or perhaps of an unconscious sense of guilt. The ego ideal component of the superego helps us to become the best that we can become.</p>

                        <p>Freud's position is that personality emerges as the child develops from infancy to adolescence. According to him, human personality develops across five psychosexual stages namely: Oral, anal, phallic, latency and genital stages from ages of 0 to 12 years. By the age of twelve according to Freud, the child is supposed to develop a mature personality. However some children get fixated in one of the developmental stages and this sabotages the evolution of a mature personality. Such individuals will demonstrate these fixations even in their adult life.</p>
