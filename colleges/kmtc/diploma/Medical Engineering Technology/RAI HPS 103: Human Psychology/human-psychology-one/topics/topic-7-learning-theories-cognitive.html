                        <p>3.2 COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT THEORIES: Bloom and Brunner.</p> <!-- Heading kept as per original -->
                        <p>Jerome Bruner, Benjamin Bloom and Jean Piaget are three Theorists that studied cognitive and behavioral development. All three of these Theorists SEC 3 Page 7 of 9 are renown in their field and for their work in education. Jean Piaget's approach is central to the school of cognitive theory known as "cognitive constructivism." Bruner's work put more emphasis on the part played by language development and the extent that other people play in enabling children to learn. Bloom is credited with his work on taxonomy of questioning technique that is used by teachers.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Jean Piaget</h3>
                        <p>Piaget's view of how children's minds work and develop has been enormously influential, particularly in educational theory. "He is best known for his work in the area of Developmental Psychology." He believed that children moved through certain cognitive stages of development into adulthood. The stages of development arise naturally out of exploration with one's environment. Piaget believed that children learn to accomplish certain tasks only when they were psychologically and developmentally mature enough to do so. According to (Craighead, \& Nemeroff, 2001) Piaget divided the child's path of development into four stages, which began with birth and culminated in the teen years. These stages are: Sensorimotor stage ( $0-2 \mathrm{yrs}$ ) is where the child interacts with the environment by sucking, pushing, grabbing, and shaking things. These interactions help build a cognitive foundation about the world. Preoperational stage (2-7 yrs) is where the child is not able to understand abstract concepts and will need to repeat experiences before they understand the cause and effect connection. Concrete operations (711 yrs) are where the child starts to develop a knowledge base from his experiences. The child also begins to be able to use this knowledge base to make more sophisticated explanations and predictions. Formal operations (11-15 and up). The child's knowledge base and cognitive is similar to those of an adult. The child's ability to think in the abstract increases dramatically. The main concept of Piaget's theory of cognitive development is that these stages do not vary in order, cannot be skipped, and should not be rushed. This means that before these age's children are not capable (no matter how bright) of understanding things in certain ways, and has been used as the basis for scheduling and developing the school curriculum.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Jerome Bruner</h3>
                        <p>Bruner believed that children learn best by their social interactions and by someone leading them through their learning experience. According to SEC 3 Page 8 of 9 (McLeod, 2007) Bruner believes that even a very young learner is capable of learning any material so long as the instruction is organized appropriately. He proposed three modes of representation. These modes of representation are the way in which information or knowledge are stored and encoded in memory. The first mode is called Enactive. Enactive involves receiving or registering action based information and storing it in our memory. This involves representing past events through motor responses. It mainly involves knowing how to do something a series of actions that are right for achieving a certain result. One example would be tying one's shoes. The second mode is called Iconic. This is where information is stored in the form of images. This would be a mental picture in the mind's eye. For some people this image is conscious while others say they do not experience it. This may explain why some people find it helpful to have a diagram or illustration to go along with the verbal information. The third mode is called Symbolic and this stage develops last. This is where information is stored in the form of a code or symbol such as language. In addition to his work on learning, Bruner also developed the spiraling approach to curriculum. The idea of the spiral curriculum, is basically that as it develops it should revisit this basic ideas repeatedly, building upon the basic ideas until the student has grasped the full formal symbolic mode of learning.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Benjamin Bloom</h3>
                        <p>Benjamin Bloom is best known for Bloom's taxonomy. Bloom's taxonomy refers to three learning objectives. These three learning objectives are Cognitive, Affective, and Psychomotor; also known as thinking/head, feeling/heart and doing/hands.. The taxonomy is a concrete assessment tool for educators to use. In later years, according to (Eisner, 200) he further classified them into six educational objectives in which students should engage. His levels of thinking are listed from lowest to highest in terms of complexity. His original taxonomy was first published in 1956 and then revised in 2001. Bloom was interested in providing a useful practical tool that was congruent with what was understood at that time about the features of the higher mental processes. Bloom's contributions to education extended well beyond the taxonomy. He was fundamentally interested in thinking and its development.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Comparing Theorists</h3>
                        <p>According to (McLeod, 2007) there are obvious similarities and striking differences between Bruner and Piaget. Similarly, both theorists believed SEC 3 Page 9 of 9 that cognitive development occurred through interaction with their environment. While Piaget and Bruner focused on childhood development, Bloom focused his work on learning environments and instructional approaches that relied on student behavioral objectives. He changed the way that educators think about instruction delivery. His main work focused on the incorporation of academic standards and integration of multiple subjects in on lesson. In the field of education and childhood psychology and development there are many similarities and differences between theorists. While Bloom is well respected in the Education field, his focus on research was not on child development but rather on assessment techniques for educators.</p>
