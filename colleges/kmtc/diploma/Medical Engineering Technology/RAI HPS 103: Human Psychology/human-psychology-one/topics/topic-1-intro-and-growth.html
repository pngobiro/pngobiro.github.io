                        <p>The word psychology literally means, "Study of the soul". It derives from Ancient Greek: " $\psi \cup \chi$ ≈ãÃÅ" (psyche, meaning "breath", "spirit", or "soul"); and "- $\lambda$ o“Ø√≠a" (-logia, translated as "study of"). Psychology is defined as the scientific study of human behavior and mental processes /The science of behavior and mental processes. Psychology studies WHO and WHAT we are, WHY we act and think in a particular manner and what is our potential as an individual.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">History of psychology</h3>
                        <p>The history of psychology as a scholarly study of the mind and behaviour dates back to the Ancient Greeks. Psychology borders on various other fields including, physiology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, sociology, anthropology, as well as philosophy and other components of the humanities.</p>
                        <p>Psychology was a branch of philosophy until 1879, when psychology developed as an independent scientific discipline in Germany and the United States. Psychology as a selfconscious field of experimental study began in 1879, when Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research in Leipzig Germany. He is regarded as the father of experimental psychology.</p>
                        <p>Other important early contributors to the field of psychology include Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in the study of memory), William James (the American father of pragmatism), and Ivan Pavlov (father of classical conditioning). Stanley Hall brought scientific pedagogy to the United States from Germany in the early 1880s. John Dewey's educational theory of the 1890s was another hallmark in the development of psychology. In the 1890s, Hugo M√ºnsterberg began writing about the application of psychology to industry, law, and other fields. Lightner Witmer established the first psychological clinic in the 1890s. James McKeen Cattell generated the first program of mental testing in the 1890s. Later in 1900s, psychology became a new independent science that was systematically organized into different schools of thought.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Perspective of psychology</h3>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">The biological/Neuroscience perspective</h4>
                        <p>It proposes that behavior is determined by biological factors like genes and hormones</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">The psychoanalytic perspective</h4>
                        <p>Originated with the work of Sigmund Freud. It emphasizes the role of the unconscious mind, early childhood experiences, and interpersonal relationships to explain human behavior and to treat people suffering from mental illnesses.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Behavioral Perspective:</h4>
                        <p>It focuses on learned behaviors I.e how behaviors are learned and reinforced. John Watson founded behaviorism in the early 1900's. Watson emphasized the scientific study of observable behaviors. Our behaviors depend on associations we have made in the past (learned) rather than the study of subjective mental process.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Humanistic Perspective:</h4>
                        <p>Influenced by the work of humanists Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow.</p>
                        <p>Emphasizes the role of motivation on thought and behavior.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Cognitive Perspective:</h4>
                        <p>Focuses on mental processes such as memory, thinking, problem solving, language and decision-making. (How people understand and think about the world.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Social cultural Perspective:</h4>
                        <p>Maintains that behavior and mental processes are shaped not only by prior learning experiences (the behavioral perspective) or intra-psychic forces (for instance, the unconscious) but also by the social or cultural context.</p>
