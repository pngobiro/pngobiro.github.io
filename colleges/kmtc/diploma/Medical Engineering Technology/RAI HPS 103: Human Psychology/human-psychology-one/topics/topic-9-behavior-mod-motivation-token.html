                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reinforcement</h3>
                        <p>A commonly used element of behavior modification is positive reinforcement, or a reward system. An example of positive reinforcement is giving a child a hug when she does a good job, or to provide money for good grades. Negative reinforcement, which takes something away to reinforce good behavior, is also an effective tool to modify habits or other behavior. An example of negative reinforcement is when a child decides to get ready for school on time, and his parents subsequently stop nagging him about this issue. The takeaway of nagging reinforces his improved morning routine.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Punishment</h3>
                        <p>Behavior modification can also discourage unwanted behavior through punishment, which can also be positive or negative. In this theory, the term positive refers to something added -- such as a consequence. An example is making athletes run extra laps if they are late to practice. Negative punishment is when something is taken away, such as the removal of video games if chores have not been completed. In this example, the negative punishment should encourage this child to do his chores in the future, in order to avoid punishment.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Applications</h3>
                        <p>Behavior modification can be an effective technique used in parenting, and also to help manage behavior in children or adults with attention deficit disorder, autism or oppositional defiant disorder</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, this method can be used to increase desired behaviors in any individual, regardless of functional level. For example, behavior modification has been used successfully in weight management and smoking cessation programs. Behavior modification can also be used to increase productivity within organizations and businesses.</p>

                        <p>There are two common types of motivation therapy. The first is Motivational Enhancement Therapy or MET. The second is Motivational Interviewing or MI. These two forms of therapy are very similar, but they are not the same thing.</p>
                        <p>Motivational Interviewing is beneficial for people that are struggling with finding the motivation they need to make the positive improvements they need to make in life. It's generally used with people that are struggling with addiction or those that are dealing with medical conditions such as diabetes. However, it can be used for anyone that needs to make changes in their lives for the better or to stop making decisions that involve risky or dangerous behavior.</p>
                        <p>These challenges require people to make changes to their lives for them to improve. If you struggle with an addiction, you need to change your behavior to overcome it. If you've been diagnosed with diabetes, you need to change your decisions to improve your health.</p>
                        <p>Motivational Enhancement Therapy is more used specifically with those that are trying to stop using drugs and alcohol. The treatment is brief and doesn't usually last longer than a few sessions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How Does Motivational Therapy Work?</h3>
                        <p>Motivational therapy is typically best when used as the start of other forms of treatment. It helps set the stage for the other treatment that they will be going through. Motivational therapy works by helping people tap into what their internal motivating factors are for making the changes that they need to make in their life.</p>
                        <p>Many people that struggle with addiction may know that they need to change their decisions. They may even know that life will be better if they do. However, they struggle with actually finding the motivation they need to follow through on making better decisions.</p>
                        <p>The therapist will work as an interview to ask their patient about what changes they are looking to make. This could be to stop using drugs or alcohol or to start eating healthier to get control of their health issues. The patient will also dive into what their reasons are for wanting to make the change. It goes beyond doing it because a doctor told them to. They need to identify the personal reasons why it matters to them. Being able to make these personal identifications will help them to follow through.</p>

                        <p>A token economy is a form of behavior modification.The primary goal of a token economy is to increase desirable behavior and decrease undesirable behavior. Often token economies are used in institutional settings (such as psychiatric hospitals or correctional facilities) to manage the behavior of individuals who may be aggressive or unpredictable. However, the larger goal of token economies is to teach appropriate behavior and social skills that can be used in one's natural environment.special education (for children with developmental orlearning disabilities, hyperactivity, attention deficit, or behavioral disorders), regular education, colleges, various types of group homes, military divisions, nursing homes, addiction treatment programs, occupational settings, family homes (for marital or parenting difficulties), and hospitals may also use token economies. Token economies can be used individually or in groups.ehavior modification designed to increase desirable behavior and decrease undesirable behavior with the use of tokens. Individuals receive tokens immediately after displaying desirable behavior. The tokens are collected and later exchanged for a meaningful object or privilege.</p> <!-- 'ehavior' typo kept as per original -->
