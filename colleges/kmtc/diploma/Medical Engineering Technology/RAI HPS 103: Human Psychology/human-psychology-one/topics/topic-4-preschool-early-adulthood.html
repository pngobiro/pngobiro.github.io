                        <p>Usually around the age of 3 , your child becomes much more coordinated with running or going up and down the stairs. By the end of their preschool years, your child should be able to catch a bounced ball easily, kick a ball forward, and stand on one foot or hop. Three-year-olds are so active that sometimes they find it easier to substitute a movement for a word. They may run around the room with their arms spread out to indicate flying instead of talking about flying.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">a. Early Adolescence stage (10-13 years)</h4>
                        <p>During this stage, children often start to grow more quickly. They also begin notice other body changes, including hair growth under the arms and near the genitals, breast development in female and enlargement of the testicles in male. They usually start a year or two earlier in girls than boys, and it can be normal for some changes to start as early as age 8 for females and age 9 for males. Many girls may start their period at around age 12, on average 2-3 years after the onset of breast development.</p>
                        <p>Early adolescents have concrete, black-and-white thinking. Things are either right or wrong, great or terrible, without much room in between. It is normal at this stage for young people to center their thinking on themselves (called "egocentrism"). As part of this, preteens and early teens are often self-conscious about their appearance and feel as though they are always being judged by their peers.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">b. Middle Adolescence Stage (14-17)</h4>
                        <p>Physical changes from puberty continue during middle adolescence. Most males will have started their growth spurt, and puberty-related changes continue. They may have some voice cracking, for example, as their voices lower. Some develop acne. Physical changes may be nearly complete for females, and most girls now have regular periods.</p>
                        <p>At this age, many teens become interested in romantic and sexual relationships. They may question and explore their sexual identity, which may be stressful if they do not have support from peers, family, or community.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">c. Late adolescence (18-21... and beyond)</h4>
                        <p>Late adolescents generally have completed physical development and grown to their full adult height. They usually have more impulse control by now and may be better able to gauge risks and rewards accurately. In comparison to middle adolescents, youth in late adolescence might find themselves thinking:</p>
