                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">THE LINK BETWEEN FOOD, NUTRITION AND HIV/AIDS</h3>
                        <p>Nutrition and HIV/AIDS are strongly interrelated. Malnutrition can both contribute to and result from the progression of HIV. This relationship between malnutrition and HIV/AIDS creates a vicious cycle: HIV weakens the immune system, which in turn leads to more infections (See Figure 10 below). Infections increase energy needs and at the same time cause anorexia, as indicated in Table 2. Heightened infections (in number and severity) lead to loss of appetite, resulting in inadequate food intake, and eventually malnutrition. Malnourished persons are at greater risk of infections, creating more vulnerability to HIV, and so the cycle continues.</p>
