                        <p>Both subsystems use humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity to perform their functions.</p>
                        <p>In humans, the blood-brain barrier, blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and fluid-brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuro-immune system, which protects the brain.</p>
                        <p>These physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered. If the immune system encounters a pathogen, for instance, a bacterium, virus, or parasite, it mounts a so-called immune response.</p>

That is why with some diseases, such as chickenpox, you only get it once as the body has a chickenpox antibody stored, ready and waiting to destroy it next time it arrives. This is called immunity.

This response is more general and nonspecific. If the pathogen manages to dodge the innate immune system, adaptive or acquired immunity kicks in.</p>

                        <p>Immunization introduces antigens or weakened pathogens to a person in such a way that the individual does not become sick but still produces antibodies. Because the body saves copies of the antibodies, it is protected if the threat should reappear later in life.</p>
                        <p>A primary infection is like a race between the pathogen and the immune system. The pathogen bypasses barrier defenses and starts multiplying in the host's body. During the first 4 to 5 days, the innate immune response will partially control, but not stop, pathogen growth.</p>
                        <p>As the adaptive immune response gears up, however, it will begin to clear the pathogen from the body, while at the same time becoming stronger and stronger. When following antibody responses in patients with a particular disease such as a virus, this clearance is referred to as seroconversion (sero- = "serum").</p>
                        <p>Seroconversionis the reciprocal relationship between virus levels in the blood and antibody levels. As the antibody levels rise, the virus levels decline, and this is a sign that the immune response is being at least partially effective (partially, because in many diseases, seroconversion does not necessarily mean a patient is getting well).</p>
                        <p>An excellent example of this is sero-conversion during HIV disease (see fig 2.2 below). Notice that antibodies are made early in this disease, and the increase in anti-HIV antibodies correlates with a decrease in detectable virus in the blood. Although these antibodies are an important marker for diagnosing the disease, they are not sufficient to completely clear the virus.</p>
                        <p>Several years later, the vast majority of these individuals, if untreated, will lose their entire adaptive immune response, including the ability to make antibodies, during the final stages of AIDS.</p>
                        <p>Seroconversion show the rise of anti-HIV antibody levels and the associated decline in measurable virus levels which happens during the first several months of HIV disease. Unfortunately, this antibody response is ineffective at controlling the disease, as seen by the progression of the disease towards AIDS, in which all adaptive immune responses are compromised.</p>

                        <p>There are individuals with HIV immunity which have really challenged scientists for over a decade. The question is how is it that the immune systems of some seem impervious to a virus that kills 2 million people around the globe each year?</p>
                        <p>Researchers have focused on a few proteins that may hold the key to this puzzle as well as offer the potential for new HIV treatments. These are;</p>
                        <ol type="i" style="padding-left: 2rem;">
                            <li>CCR5,</li>
                            <li>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)</li>
                            <li>Cystatin</li>
                            <li>CD4</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">i. CCR5;</h4>
                        <p>A new study at the University of Southern California showed that mice with a mutation in the gene that encodes CCR5 have immunity to HIV. Their work provides "proof of concept for a new approach to HIV treatment." CCR5 is a protein found on the surface of human immune-system cells. Essentially, they work as a lock that HIV opens in order to enter the cells. In this study, researchers took mice already infected with HIV and injected them with stem cells containing a specific mutation in the CCR5 gene. They found the injected cells were able to fight and destroy HIV, and the mice were able to fight off other infections, too. Because stem cells reproduce indefinitely, these mutant stem cells could provide a permanent supply of HIV-resistant immune cells, according to the researchers. This procedure that was developed in collaboration with scientists at biotech company Sangamo BioSciences is currently being tested in humans in Phase 1 clinical trials. It was inspired by a 2009 New England Journal of Medicine case report that described a patient with both HIV and leukemia. After undergoing a bone marrow transplant from a donor with the CCR5 mutation - known as the CCR5-delta 32 mutation - the patient became HIV-free and no longer required anti-AIDS drugs.</p>
                        <p>This mutation in CCR5 is therefore associated with natural immunity to HIV in about 10 percent of Caucasian people. Scientists suspect that its commonness comes from being spared by deadly plagues in the distant past. However, there is disagreement over which disease or diseases influenced the mutation over time. Much research has shown that the mutation may have given some people immunity to the waves of bubonic plague that swept through Europe during the 12th through 15th centuries. But University of Berkeley researchers suggest smallpox is a likely cause for the mutation's spread. In a 2003 report in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, the scientists explained that smallpox was around far longer than the plague and killed far more people. And smallpox especially affected younger children, who were not yet old enough to reproduce.</p>
                        <p>In a 2006 study, Johns Hopkins University researchers found that the mutation reduced infection by the hepatitis B virus, as well. They concluded that "a diverse group of infectious disease, rather than a single, deadly pathogen," may have been the driving force behind the mutation's prevalence.</p>
                        <p>N/B: Because the CCR5 mutation does not provide HIV immunity in all populations, researchers have looked at other proteins that may bestow a natural advantage in fighting off the virus. These include;</p>
                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">ii. Cystatin;</h4>
                        <p>this is a protein that was found by researchers in 2008 at the University of Manitoba, studied Kenyan women who were still HIV-free after working as prostitutes for at least three years. The scientists found increased levels of cystatin, which is known to interfere with the ability of HIV to reproduce.</p>
                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">iii. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA);</h4>
                        <p>Studies of Zambians have found the influence of the protein or human leukocyte antigen (HLA). It is also called "elite controllers" - these are people whose cells are able to effectively attack and destroy HIV due to these HLA. They may never experience symptoms even though they are infected with the virus.</p>
                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">iv. CD4.;</h4>
                        <p>this is another protein that as with CCR5, HIV must interact with it in order to enter person's immune cells, and some say it may make a better drug target than CCR5.</p>
                        <p>Recently Peter Kwong, a scientist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, led a team that investigated a protein produced by people immune to HIV that binds to HIV and to CD4. The researchers concluded that fully understanding how this protein binds to both the virus and the human cells could lead to the creation of an HIV vaccine. "The CCR5 binding site is only revealed to the virus after it binds to CD4," Kwong said. "So although CCR5 is an extremely good drug target, the CD4 site is much better because it must always be accessible for HIV to get into the cell."</p>
