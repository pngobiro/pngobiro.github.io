                            <li><strong>Men who have sex withmen (MSM).</strong> Gay or bisexual MSM are most severely affected population. This is because they have sex on the anus which is prone to tearing due to lack of lubrication thus increasing the risk of HIV transmission<br>
                            In order to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS there is need for them to use condoms and lubrications such as ky jelly every time they have sex.Also get to know their HIV status often.</li>
