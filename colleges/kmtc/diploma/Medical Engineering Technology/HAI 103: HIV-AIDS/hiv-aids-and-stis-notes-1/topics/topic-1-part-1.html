                        <p>When and where the HIV virus first emerged is probably going to remain a mystery for many years to come. While several theories have been put forward, there is no conclusive single agreement on the origin of HIV/AIDS. Some of the mostly acknowledge theories about the origin of HIV include the following</p>

                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">1. Mysterious origin theory</h4>
                        <p>Tries to account for the seemingly mysterious origin of HIV by locating it out of this world. Suggest that viral materials was carried in the tail gases of a comet passing close to the earth and its material was deposited, subsequently infecting nearby sate in people. Although one or two famous astronomers have been linked to this theory, in the popular press, these scientists deny the possibility of this extraterrestrial phenomena and any personal connection to the theory. 1</p>

                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">2. Religious theories (God's wrath and witch craft)</h4>
                        <p>Certain segments of the population have openly stated that AIDS is God's wrath since the scripture condemn the homosexual practice in which AIDS was 1st observed in western world Rather than its being considered a visitation from God; many Africans believe that AIDS is any caused by another supernatural power-witchcraft and they use anti-witchcraft rituals and objects to counteract the infection.</p>

                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">3. Monkey origin theories</h4>
                        <p>HIV is a lentivirus called simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The research done claimed that chimpanzees were the source of HIV 1, and that the virus had at some point crossed species from chimps to humans. How HIV crossed species is explained by theories such as</p>

                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">4. Conspiracy theories</h4>
                        <p>Americans believed HIV was manufactured as part of a biological warfare programme, designed to wipe out large numbers of black and homosexual people</p>

                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">5. The calculation theory</h4>
                        <p>The latest in the origin of HIV. Opponents of SIV-human transmission remain unimpressed by the evidence in the monkey theories and argue that viral sequencing of HIV strains indicate that HIV has been around probably for hundreds of years</p>
                        <p>In 2000 when a team of scientist using computer technology to study the structure of HIV calculated the rate at which the virus mutates for the HIV viral sub-types to have a common ancestors. This process revealed HIV originated around 1930 in rural areas of central Africa, where the virus may have been present for many years in isolated communities</p>
                        <p>The virus probably did not spread because members of these rural communities had limited contact with people from other areas. But in 1960s and 1970s, political upheaval, wars, drought, and famine forced many people from these rural areas to migrate to cities to find jobs. During this time, the incidence of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection, accelerated and quickly spread throughout Africa.</p>
                        <p>What caused the rapid spread of the HIV epidemic in the latter half of the 20th century: There are a number of factors that may have contributed to the sudden global spread of HIV in the latter half of the 20th century and they include</p>

                        <p><strong>History in USA:</strong></p>
                        <p>HIV virus began to emerge in the United States in the 1980s, the HIV epidemic has frequently been linked to gay, bisexual and men who have sex with men(MSM).The 1st official report on the virus was published by center for disease control(CDC) in 1981 and detailed a case of 5 young gay men who were hospitalized with serious infections later the New York times reported 41 homosexual had been diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma and 8 had died less than 24 months after dx made.</p>

                        <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 1.5rem;">HIV history in Kenya</h4>
                        <p>In Kenya, the first HIV case was recorded in 1984.</p>
                        <p>It began between 1983 and 1985 when 26 cases of Aids were reported in Kenya. Sex workers were the first group affected. A study from 1985 reported a HIV prevalence of <span class="math-inline">$59\%$</span> amongst a group of sex workers in Nairobi.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>HIV continues to be a major global public health issue, having claimed almost 33 million lives so far. However, with increasing access to effective HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care, including for opportunistic infections, HIV infection has become a manageable chronic health condition, enabling people living with HIV to lead long and healthy lives.</p>
                        <p>There were an estimated 38.0 million people living with HIV at the end of 2019.</p>
                        <p>As a result of concerted international efforts to respond to HIV, coverage of services has been steadily increasing. In 2019, <span class="math-inline">$68\%$</span> of adults and <span class="math-inline">$53\%$</span> of children living with HIV globally were receiving lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART).</p>
                        <p>A great majority (85%) of pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV also received ART, which not only protects their health, but also ensures prevention of HIV transmission to their newborns.</p>
                        <p>At the end of 2019, an estimated <span class="math-inline">$81\%$</span> of people living with HIV knew their status. <span class="math-inline">$67\%$</span> were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) and <span class="math-inline">$59\%$</span> had achieved suppression of the HIV virus with no risk of infecting others; about 27 million adolescent boys and men in east and southern Africa had received prevention services including VMMC.</p>
                        <p>By June 2020, 26 million people were accessing antiretroviral therapy, marking a <span class="math-inline">$2.4\%$</span> increase from an estimate of 25.4 million at the end of 2019. By comparison, treatment coverage increased by an estimated 4.8% between January and June of 2019.</p>
                        <p>The number of new people starting treatment is far below expectation due to the reduction in HIV-testing and treatment initiation and ARV disruptions that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. By end 2020, testing and treatment rates showed steady but variable recovery.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, between 2000 and 2019, new HIV infections fell by 39% and HIV-related deaths fell by <span class="math-inline">$51\%$</span>, with 15.3 million lives saved due to ART. This achievement was the result of great efforts by national HIV programmes supported by civil society and international development partners.</p>
                        <p>But success has been variable by region, country and population. However, not everyone is able to access HIV testing, treatment and care. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, reduction of new infections and deaths had plateaued; global 90/90/90 targets for 2020 are at risk of being missed unless rapid action is taken.</p>
                        <p>Due to gaps in HIV services, 690000 people died from HIV-related causes in 2019 and 1.7 million people were newly infected.</p>
                        <p>To reach the new proposed global 95/95/95 targets, (95% of the total population should be tested, <span class="math-inline">$95\%$</span> of those diagnosed positive should receive treatment and <span class="math-inline">$95\%$</span> of those receiving treatment should achieve viral suppression), we will need to redouble our efforts to avoid the worst-case scenario of a half million excess deaths in Sub Saharan Africa, increasing HIV infections due to HIV service disruptions during COVID-19, and the slowing public health response to HIV.</p>
                        <p>Interventions will need to focus on the populations left-behind: Key population groups and their sexual partners accounted for over <span class="math-inline">$62\%$</span> of all new HIV infections globally among the age group 15-49 years in 2019. In eastern European and central Asia, Asia and the Pacific, western and central Europe, and North America, and the Middle East and North Africa, these groups accounted for over 95% of new HIV infections in each of these regions.</p>
                        <p>WHO defines key populations as people in populations who are at increased HIV risk in all countries and regions. Key populations include: men who have sex with men; people who inject drugs; people in prisons and other closed settings; sex workers and their clients; and transgender people.</p>
                        <p>Increased HIV vulnerability is often associated with legal and social factors, which increases exposure to risk situations and creates barriers to accessing effective, quality and affordable HIV prevention, testing and treatment services. Prioritizing key populations in the HIV response with appropriate interventions would have the biggest impact on the epidemic and reduce new infections.</p>
                        <p>In addition, given their life circumstances, a range of other populations may be particularly vulnerable, and at increased risk of HIV infection, such as adolescent girls and young women in southern and eastern Africa and indigenous peoples in some communities.</p>
                        <p>Over two thirds of all people living with HIV live in the WHO African Region (25.7 million). While HIV is prevalent among the general population in this region, an increasing number of new infections occur among key population groups.</p>

                        <p>In Kenya women were more likely to be infected(8.4%) than men (5.4%).In particular young women aged 15-24 years are 4 times more likely to be infected than young men in the same age group( <span class="math-inline">$5.6\%$</span> vs <span class="math-inline">$1.4\%$</span> ). An estimated <span class="math-inline">$6.7\%$</span> adult in rural areas are infected with HIV compared to estimated <span class="math-inline">$8.4\%$</span> in urban areas</p>
                        <p>Uncircumcised men are 3 times more likely to be infected with HIV than circumcised men( <span class="math-inline">$13.2\%$</span> vs <span class="math-inline">$3.9\%$</span> )respectively. <span class="math-inline">$80-90\%$</span> of infections are in the <span class="math-inline">$15-49$</span> years age group, while 5 10% occurs in children less than 5 years old.</p>

                        <p>Our immune system is essential for our survival. Without an immune system, our bodies would be open to attack from bacteria, viruses, parasites, and more. It is our immune system that keeps us healthy as we drift through a sea of pathogens.</p>
                        <p>The immune system protects the body against disease or other potentially damaging foreign bodies. When functioning properly, the immune system identifies and attacks a variety of threats, including viruses, bacteria and parasites, while distinguishing them from the body's own healthy tissue. It is a vast network of cells and tissues that are constantly on the lookout for invaders, and once an enemy is spotted, a complex attack is mounted.</p>
                        <p>The immune system is spread throughout the body and involves many types of cells, organs, proteins, and tissues. Crucially, it can distinguish our tissue from foreign tissue - self from nonself. Dead and faulty cells are recognized and cleared away by the immune system.</p>
                        <p>The body's immune system is mainly the lymphatic system which consists of a collection of barriers, cells, and soluble proteins that interact and communicate with each other in extraordinarily complex ways as indicated in the fig 2.1 below;</p>
                        <p>These organs and tissue of the immune system includes; the bone marrow, spleen, thymus and lymph nodes. The spleen is the largest lymphatic organ in the body contains white blood cells that fight infection or disease. The thymus is where T-cells mature. T-cells help destroy infected or cancerous cells. Lymph nodes produce and store cells that fight infection and disease. Lymphocytes and leukocytes are small white blood cells that play a large role in defending the body against disease. The two types of lymphocytes are B-cells and T-cells.Leukocytes are white blood cells that identify and eliminate pathogens.</p>

                        <p>The modern model of immune function is organized into three phases based on the timing of their effects. The three temporal phases consist of the following:</p>

                            <li>Barrier defenses such as the skin and mucous membranes, which act instantaneously to prevent pathogenic invasion into the body tissues</li>
                            <li>The rapid but nonspecific innate immune response, which consists of a variety of specialized cells and soluble factors</li>
                            <li>The slower but more specific and effective adaptive immune response, which involves many cell types and soluble factors, but is primarily controlled by white blood cells (leukocytes) known as lymphocytes, which help control immune responses. These cells can be divided into three classes based on function:
                                <ol type="a" style="padding-left: 2rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                    <li>Phagocytic cells, which ingest pathogens to destroy them</li>
                                    <li>Lymphocytes, which specifically coordinate the activities of adaptive immunity</li>
                                    <li>Cells containing cytoplasmic granules, which help mediate immune responses against parasites and intracellular pathogens such as viruses.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>All the cells of the immune response as well as of the blood arise by differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells.Lymphocytes are the primary cells of adaptive immune responses its two basic types are; B Cells, T Cells. There are two other types of lymphocytes namely; Plasma Cells, and Natural Killer Cells.</p>

                        <p>B cells and T cells are found in many parts of the body, circulating in the bloodstream and lymph, and residing in secondary lymphoid organs, including the spleen and lymph nodes. The human body contains approximately 1012 lymphocytes.</p>

                        <p>B cells are immune cells that function primarily by producing antibodies. An antibody is any of the group of proteins that binds specifically to pathogen-associated molecules known as antigens. An antigen is a chemical structure on the surface of a pathogen that binds to T or B lymphocyte antigen receptors. Once activated by binding to antigen, B cells differentiate into cells that secrete a soluble form of their surface antibodies. These activated B cells are known as plasma cells.</p>

                        <p>Another type of lymphocyte of importance is the plasma cell. A plasma cell is a B cell that has differentiated in response to antigen binding, and has thereby gained the ability to secrete soluble antibodies. These cells differ in morphology from standard <span class="math-inline">$B$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$T$</span> cells in that they contain a large amount of cytoplasm packed with the protein-synthesizing machinery known as rough endoplasmic reticulum.</p>

A natural killer cell (NK) is a circulating blood cell that contains cytotoxic (cell-killing) granules in its extensive cytoplasm. It shares thismechanism with the cytotoxic T cells of the adaptive immune response. NK cells are among the body's first lines of defenseagainst viruses and certain types of cancer.</p>
