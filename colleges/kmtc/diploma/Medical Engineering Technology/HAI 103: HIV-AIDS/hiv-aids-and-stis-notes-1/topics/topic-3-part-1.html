                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The so-called ABC of HIV Prevention was developed by governments and their partners as the key approaching the fight against HIV/AIDS. The ABC messages standing for Abstain from sex, Be faithful to one partner and use a Condom, have been accepted and applied globally and are the dominant prevention messages.</p>
                        <p>The approach consists of mutually reinforcing messages encouraging behaviour change with regards to sexual activities and should not be seen as stand alone package in HIV prevention programming. The messages are targeting the overall population and particularly sexual active age groups, both adults and youth.</p>
                        <p><strong>Abstain from sex:</strong> The core message in the A is to stay abstinent until marriage. Abstinence is the most effective means of protection against both pregnancy and HIV. With sex being the primary cause of HIV transmission , it is unlikely for a person to contract the disease if he or she does not have sex.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">However, A of prevention appears not to be widely practiced - even though young people have positive attitudes towards the idea itself. The almost constant teenage pregnancy rates of about 19-20% of 15-19 year old girls between 1998 and 2002 are also a clear indicator that young people indeed are having sex.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Be faithful to one partner:</strong> The message contained in B is to be faithful to a mutually faithful and uninfected partner and reduce the number of sexual partners if possible to one. This is a rather complex concept since it requires commitment, honest y and trust among partners, without those this prevention strategy does not work. It is difficult to know for sure if your partner is being faithful, and it is clear that many partners are not. This is also true for youth, who are in an experimental stage sexually and emotionally.</p>
                        <p><strong>Condom use:</strong> Consistent and correct use of condoms during intercourse can greatly reduce the chances of acquiring or transmitting HIV. Consistent use means using a condom each act of intercourse Correct use means that you should use anew condom every time you have sexual intercourse</p>
                        <p>Never use the same condom twice Put a condom before any contact is made between the penis and any part of your partners body Leave a space at the tip Withdraw immediately after ejaculation Condoms is not totally safe because it has some weakness which includes; Bursting Leaking Slipping off inside the woman-which exposes both male and female to hiv virus</p>
                        <p>In addition, the application of the C message is challenged by social norms and gender relations making it difficult for girls and women to negotiate condom use. Also, insecurities about the effectiveness of condoms have begun to undermine the status of condoms as a tool for HIVprevention among young people. Having experienced that condoms do not provide <span class="math-inline">$100\%$</span> protection from HIV-prevention if not used correctly or taken off early, some people don't feel secure even when condoms are being used.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Surveys undertaken in different parts suggest that there are instances of young girls having unprotected sex in exchange for much-needed material support to the girls and their families including money for school fees, transportation and groceries or for luxury goods such as cell phones, toiletries etc. Poverty and inequality contribute to the rising numbers of young girls and boys having unprotected sex with partners that are much older, also popularly known as sugar daddies or sugar mummies</span></li>
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Considering that studies demonstrate a strong correlation between high incidence of HIV and the age difference between partners, the sugar daddy phenomenon places young girls at high risk with regards to HIV. Older men are more likely to be infected with HIV than younger men, posing a greater risk of transmission to their younger partners.</span></li>
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Giving 'gifts' or money to the girls may also make men feel as being in power and having the right to control the terms of the relationship. Also for women who find themselves in an abusive relationship or who are economically or otherwise dependent on a partner it is often difficult to negotiate sex and condom use. As a consequence,they are at high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.</span></li>
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Based on these communication messages and as part of the overall ABC approach, the Government together with its partners and young people concerned developed and adapted a variety of programmes in education, awareness-raising and life skills training. These programmes are going hand in hand with the ABC messages and are all geared towards encouraging behaviour change with regards to sexual activities aiming to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>D - Delaying:</strong> Youth who begin sexual activity early appear more likely to have sex with highrisk partners or multiple partners and are less likely to use condoms. Thus early sexual debut can place adolescents at increased risk of unintended pregnancy, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections. Positive relationships with parents, teachers, and spiritual beliefs decrease the likelihood of early sex, while engaging in other hazardous behaviours and having friends who are sexually active can be considered as risk factors.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Therefore, encouraging youth to start engaging in sexual activities only when getting married or being mature enough to take responsible decisions need to go hand in hand with revisiting the important function parents, teachers and influential community members have as role models. Delaying is an important, practicable prevention message reflecting and responding to the realities of many youth and therefore needs to be added to the so-called ABC of HIV prevention.</span></li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Key facts</strong> Medical male circumcision reduces the risk of femaleto-male sexual transmission of HIV by approximately 60%. Since 2007, WHO and UNAIDS have recommended voluntary medical male circumcision as an additional important strategy for HIV prevention, particularly in settings with high HIV prevalence and low levels of male circumcision, where the public health benefits will be maximized. Fourteen countries in eastern and southern Africa with this profile have initiated programmes to expand male circumcision.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Medical male circumcision offers excellent value for money in such settings. It saves costs by averting new HIV infections and reducing the number of people needing HIV treatment and care. A one-time intervention, medical male circumcision provides men life-long partial protection against HIV as well as other sexually transmitted infections. It should always be considered as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package of services and be used in conjunction with other methods of prevention, such as female and male condoms.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Male circumcision is surgical removal of the foreskin - the retractable fold of tissue that covers the head of the penis. The inner aspect of the foreskin is highly susceptible to HIV infections. Trained health professionals can safely remove the foreskin of infants, adolescents and adults (medical male circumcision).</p>
                        <p><strong>Compelling evidence for recommendations</strong> In 2007, WHO and UNAIDS issued recommendations on medical male circumcision as an additional HIV prevention strategy based on strong and consistent scientific evidence. Three randomized controlled trials undertaken in Kisumu, Kenya, Rakai District, Uganda, and Orange Farm, South Africa have shown that medical male circumcision reduces the risk of sexual transmission of HIV from women to men by approximately 60%.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">The most recent data from Uganda show that in the five years since the Uganda trial was completed, high effectiveness has been maintained among the men who were circumcised, with a <span class="math-inline">$73\%$</span> protective effect against HIV infection.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>What are the benefits of Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision?</strong> Medical male circumcision is a one-time health intervention that provides men with lifelong partial protectionn against HIV. Apart from reducing HIV infection, male circumcision decreases the risk of urinary tract infections; reduces risk of sexually transmitted diseases in men; protects against cancer of the penis and prevents inflammation of the glands and foreskin altogether.</p>

Men's health is as much about women's health when it comes to sexually transmitted diseases.</span></li>
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Most recently, results from a 5-year follow up study in Uganda showed that men who chose surgical VMMC were 70% less likely to be infected with HIV than men who were not circumcised.

                        <ol style="padding-left: 2rem;">
                            <li>A circumcised man is up to <span class="math-inline">$60\%$</span> less likely to get infected with HIV.</li>
                            <li>It does not affect the size of your penis.</li>
                            <li>There is some pain, but not much.</li>
                            <li>After VMMC, you can do most things after just 2 or 3 days.</li>
                            <li>There is no proven effect on sexual pleasure.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>How male circumcision protects you against HIV:</strong> Before circumcision: The inside of the foreskin is soft and moist and is more likely to get a tiny tear or sore that allows HIV to enter the body more easily. The foreskin itself contains many 'target cells' that allow HIV to enter the body easily.</p>

Men can be circumcised at any age. While many men in Kenya have already undergone the procedure, only 10% of Luo men in Nyanza are circumcised today.</li>
                            <li><strong>Why should men get circumcised?</strong> VMMC can provide protection against HIV infection. A circumcised man is up to <span class="math-inline">$60\%$</span> less likely to get infected with HIV than an uncircumcised man.</li>
                            <li><strong>What are other benefits of VMMC?</strong> VMMC reduces the man's chances of getting other infections like syphilis and herpes. VMMC also gives some protection against penile cancer in men and cervical cancer in women.</li>
                            <li><strong>How does being circumcised protect men from HIV?</strong> The inside of the foreskin is soft and moist and is more likely to get a tiny tear or sore that allows HIV to enter the body more easily. The foreskin itself contains many 'target cells' that allow HIV to enter the body easily. After circumcision, the skin on the head of the penis becomes thicker and is less likely to tear</li>
                            <li><strong>Why is it important to know your HIV status prior to VMMC?</strong> Someone considering VMMC should know their HIV status in order to get the health benefits that VMMC provides. Clients who decline the test but still want to get circumcised must be respected for their decision. VMMC is not recommended for HIV positive men.</li>
                            <li><strong>How is VMMC done?</strong> The procedure takes a short time. An injection is given at the base of the penis to make it go numb, so that no pain is felt while the foreskin is cut off. The wound is then stitched, cleaned and bandaged</li>
                            <li><strong>What happens after the operation?</strong> The man rests a short while, and then goes home. After 3 days the bandage is removed. He cannot have sex for the next 6 weeks. For the next 7 days, it is important to keep the wound clean, and avoid heavy exercise.<br>
                            - After 7 days, the man needs to return to the health facility for a check-up. If men experience any complications after surgery (like prolonged pain or bleeding), they should seek assistance at the clinic</li>
                            <li><strong>Does VMMC affect sexual intercourse?</strong> Yes, because men cannot have sexual intercourse for 6 weeks after VMMC. The wound needs enough time to heal properly. VMMC does not affect sexual performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Why should I talk to my partner about VMMC?</strong> VMMC has many benefits for both partners and both need to understand the procedure. It is best to openly discuss why you want VMMC. You can also visit a counselor or health worker together to discuss the matter</li>

                        <p>PEP is for emergency situations only. It should not be used as a substitute for safe sex or new sterile needles.</p>
                        <p>If you're frequently exposed to HIV -- through your partner or shared needles, for example talk with your doctor about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) instead. PEP uses higher doses of more drugs than PrEP.</p>
                        <p><strong>Timing</strong> You have to start PEP within 72 hours of possible exposure. After that, the treatment won't work. If you think you may have been exposed to HIV, get medical attention as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Pep should be discouraged after 72 hrs of exposure as there is no benefit(ensure early referral to nearest centre offering PEP if there are no local services. Pre-exsisting medical condition and any current medications being used by an exposed individual. Choice of an efficacious simplified regimen preferably in a fixed dose combination whenever possible to increase adherence by reducing number of pills and frequency of dosing. Provide on going counselling due to adherence and adverse reaction</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> pep may be considered following RTA where there has been exposure to other peoples blood ; among police and prison staff who may be injured in the course of their work and in discordant couples following condom accident.</p>

                        <p>Of particular high risk are deep injuries,those involving hollow neddles with visible blood and those involving patients with high viral loads (recent HIV infection,late stage HIV disease. Note;the transmission of HIV is probably significantly higher in rape because of trauma forceful penetration. Other factors that increase transmission risk include disease status of rapists(risk increase with viral load) and presence of STI'S in the source or the person assulted.In high prevalence population rapists should be assumed to be HIV-positive unless proven otherwise.</p>

                        <p>A known source should be tested for hiv; if the source person is not willing to be tested he/she should not be coerced into having the test Discarded sharps/neddles should not be tested The exposed person should not receive ARVS drugs without being tested.However where immediate testing is not feasible,rx should be delayed since hiv testing can be carried out the following day or soon thereafter</p>

                        <p><strong>How It Works</strong> The idea behind PEP is that the same drugs that treat HIV can help you fight the virus as it tries to infect you. That involves a combination of two or three drugs called antiretrovirals. The process is called antiretroviral therapy, or ART. The medications help keep HIV from making copies of itself. You'll take them once or twice a day for 28 days:</p>
