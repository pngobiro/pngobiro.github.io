                        <p>Is also called attachment. During this step, viralgp 120 binds to the CD4 receptor and CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptor on host cell surface. Post attachment inhibitor can be used to slow down this process.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Fusion</h3>
                        <p>The HIV envelope and the CD4 cells fuse hence allowing the HIV virus to enter the CD4 cell. Fusion inhibitor acts as this process.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Reverse transcription</h3>
                        <p>Inside the CD4 cellViral RNA is reverse transcribed into viral DNA .This process is mediated by the enzymes reverse transcriptase (RT).This allows the HIV to enter the CD4 cell nucleus and combine with the cells genetic material. This enzymes has no proof-reading function, and therefore the process is error prone and responsible for rapid development of drugs resistant mutation.</p>
                        <p>Inhibitors involved at this stage include non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Integration</h3>
                        <p>Inside the CD4 nucleus, HIV releases integrase enzyme and uses it to integrate its viral DNA into the DNA of the host cell.This is the step that establishes replication competent virus in the body and makes HIV incurable even with effective ART. Intergrase inhibitor can slow down this process.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">5. Replication</h3>
                        <p>Once integrated into the CD4 cell DNA, HIV begins to use the machinery of the CD4 cell to make long chains of HIV proteins which produce more HIV viruses.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">6. Assembly</h3>
                        <p>New HIV proteins and HIV RNA move to the surface of the cell and assemble into immature non-infectious HIV.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7. Budding</h3>
                        <p>Newly formed immature HIV pushes itself out of the host CD4 cells and release the protease enzyme. This enzyme breaks up the long protein chains in the immature virus, creating mature infectious viruses which are then released to the bloodstream.</p>
                        <p>The protease inhibitor slows down this process.</p>

                        <p>Gender-based violence has become common place in almost all societies. Violence has many faces. Within the household this can include battering by an intimate partner, marital rape, and sexual abuse.</p>
                        <p>Violence outside the home can include rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and assault.</p>
                        <p>Various social, cultural, and religious norms produce and reinforce gender inequality and the stereotypical gender roles that underpin gender-based violence. Gender-based violence is a key factor in increasing risk of contracting HIV.</p>
                        <p>Violence increases vulnerability to HIV infection in several ways. Sexual violence can result in 'direct transmission' of HIV which can be the result of forced or coercive sexual intercourse with an HIV infected partner. The biological risk of transmission in a violent sexual encounter is determined by the type of sexual exposure</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Intimate partner violence and HIV</h3>
                        <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is domestic violence caused by a spouse, common-law partner, or dating partner within an intimate relationship. It includes physical violence such as punching or kicking, sexual violence such as rape or the use of manipulation to pressure someone into sex, and emotional and verbal abuse, such as financial abuse and belittling, threatening, and controlling behavior</p>
                        <p>There is a close link between intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV. IPV can increase risk of HIV by limiting a person's ability to negotiate safer sex and safer drug use and because the short- and long-term effects from IPV may lead people to engage in higher risk behaviors. IPV is common among people living with HIV, in part because IPV and HIV disproportionately affect some of the same populations. People living with HIV may experience more severe or more prolonged IPV than people who are HIV-negative and experiencing IPV. People living with HIV may be particularly vulnerable to IPV when they disclose their HIV status to their partner. Intimate partner violence can lead to poorer HIV care outcomes. HIV service providers can play a role in helping to prevent or respond to IPV. Likewise, those working with people who experience IPV can play a role in helping to prevent HIV and encouraging testing and treatment.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Drug abuse and HIV/AIDS</h3>
                        <p>Direct risk of HIV exposure occurs in the form of contaminated needles and drug injection supplies. When needles are shared among drug users, traces of blood may be transferred between individuals as well. <span class="math-inline">$10\%$</span> of new HIV infections are related to drug abuse</p>
                        <p>In addition to increasing the risk of HIV exposure, drug abuse may negatively affect HIV treatment and maintenance. For instance, chronic alcohol use weakens the immune system. Weakened immune system promotes replication of the virus and increases the occurrence of Ols (opportunistic infections)</p>
                        <p>Using drugs affects your brain, alters judgment and lowers inhibitions. When someone is high, he/she is likely to make poor decisions that put them at risk of contracting HIV such as</p>

                        <p>Following HIV infection there is initial rapid rise in viral load, which may be associated with flue like symptoms(primary hiv infection). A vigorous immune response occurs within weeks of infection, with production of both antibodies and cellular mediated response.</p>
                        <p>Thus antibodies to HIV can be detected within 2 week of infection. The immune response inhibits HIV replication with the results that the viral load declines and stabilizes within the first 6-12 months after infection. Thereafter the patient remains asymptomatic for an average 6-10 years in the majority of patients, before the ongoing immune destruction begin to manifest in symptomatic HIV related disease</p>
                        <p>At the time of initial infection with HIV, patient have large number of susceptible CD4+ Tlymphocytes and no HIV specific response. Thus, there is rapid HIV replication that causes rapid destruction of CD4+ T lymphocytes over the first weeks and months after infection. Through the induction of HIV specific immune response, there is stabilization of CD4 cells level and containment of viral replication, which is marked by a very slow decline of CD4+ T-cells over 610 years. Eventually in the absence of effective arvs CD4 cell level decline further culminating in progressive immune deficiency accompanied by the development of HIV associated complication(e.g.OIS,malignancies )</p>
                        <p>While immunologic decline after primary infection usually occur slowly over many years, it is worth noting that many patients will not be diagnosed until late in the course of infection, when symptoms are present and CD4 count is low.</p>
