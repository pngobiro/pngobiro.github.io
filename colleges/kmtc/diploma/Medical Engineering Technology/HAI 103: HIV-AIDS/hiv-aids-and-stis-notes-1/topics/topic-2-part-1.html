                        <p>Currently ,there are 5 classes of drugs active against HIV.ARV agents act by interfering with important functions in the viral life-cycle.</p>

                            <li><strong>Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)</strong><br>They work by prematurely terminating DNA chain formation as the enzyme reverse transcriptase copies viral RNA into DNA.Examples are Abacavir, or ABC (Ziagen) ‚Ä¢ Didanosine, or ddl (Videx) ‚Ä¢ Emtricitabine, or FTC (Emtriva) ‚Ä¢ Lamivudine, or 3TC (Epivir) ‚Ä¢ Stavudine, or d4T (Zerit) ‚Ä¢ Tenofovir, or TDF (Viread) ‚Ä¢ Zidovudine, or AZT or ZDV (Retrovir)</li>
                            <li><strong>Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)</strong><br>Inhibit the formation of viral DNA from viral RNA by tightly binding to the reverse trascriptaseenzyme.Example are ‚Ä¢ Delavirdine (Rescriptor) ‚Ä¢ Efavirenz (Sustiva) ‚Ä¢ Etravirine (Intelence) ‚Ä¢ Nevirapine (Viramune) ‚Ä¢ Rilpivirine (Edurant)</li>
                            <li><strong>Protease Inhibitors (PIs)</strong><br>They bind to the viral protease enzyme and block the formation of viral proteins. ‚Ä¢ Atazanavir, or ATV (Reyataz) ‚Ä¢ Darunavir, or DRV (Prezista) ‚Ä¢ Fosamprenavir, or FPV (Lexiva) ‚Ä¢ Indinavir, or IDV (Crixivan) ‚Ä¢ Lopinavir + ritonavir, or LPV/r (Kaletra) ‚Ä¢ Nelfinavir, or NFV (Viracept) ‚Ä¢ Ritonavir, or RTV (Norvir) ‚Ä¢ Saquinavir, or SQV (Invirase) ‚Ä¢ Tipranavir, or TPV (Aptivus)<br>
                            - Cobicistat (Tybost) is a drug that helps atazanavir and darunavir work better, but it can cause life-threatening kidney problems if you take it with certain other medicines. - Atazanavir + cobicistat, or ATV/COBI (Evotaz) ‚Ä¢ Darunavir + cobicistat, or DRV/COBI (Prezcobix)</li>
                            <li><strong>Entryinhibitors;</strong><br>they prevent entry of the virus into the host cell i.e CD4.Example include enfuvirtide CCR5 antagonist Maraviroc</li>
                            <li><strong>Integrase strand transfer inhibitors(INSTI);</strong><br>they block the integrase enzyme which incorporates/integrates pro viral DNA into the host cell DNA.Exampleare;Raltegravir, Elvitegravir,Dolutegravir</li>
