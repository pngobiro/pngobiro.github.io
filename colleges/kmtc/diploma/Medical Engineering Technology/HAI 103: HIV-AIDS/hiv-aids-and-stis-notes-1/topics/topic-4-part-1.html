                        <p>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) - or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) - are generally acquired by sexual contact. The organisms (bacteria, viruses or parasites) that cause sexually transmitted diseases may pass from person to person in blood, semen, or vaginal and other bodily fluids. Sometimes these infections can be transmitted non-sexually, such as from mother to infant during pregnancy or childbirth, or through blood transfusions or shared needles.</p>
                        <p>STDs don't always cause symptoms. It's possible to contract sexually transmitted diseases from people who seem perfectly healthy and may not even know they have an infection.</p>

                        <p>Trichomoniasis is a common STI caused by a microscopic, one-celled parasite called Trichomonasvaginalis. This organism spreads during sexual intercourse with someone who already has the infection.</p>
                        <p>The organism usually infects the urinary tract in men, but often causes no symptoms. Trichomoniasis typically infects the vagina in women. When trichomoniasis causes symptoms, they may appear within five to 28 days of exposure and range from mild irritation to severe inflammation.</p>
                        <p>Signs and symptoms may include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Genital herpes symptoms</h3>
                        <p>Genital herpes is a highly contagious STI caused by a type of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that enters your body through small breaks in your skin or mucous membranes. Most people with HSV never know they have it, because they have no signs or symptoms or the signs and symptoms are so mild they go unnoticed.</p>
                        <p>When signs and symptoms are noticeable, the first episode is generally the worst. Some people never have a second episode. Others, however, can have recurrent episodes for decades.</p>
                        <p>When present, genital herpes signs and symptoms may include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Small red bumps, blisters (vesicles) or open sores (ulcers) in the genital and anal areas and areas nearby</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Ulcers can make urination painful. You may also have pain and tenderness in your genital area until the infection clears. During an initial episode, you may have flu-like signs and symptoms, such as a headache, muscle aches and fever, as well as swollen lymph nodes in your groin.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, the infection can be active and contagious even when sores aren't present.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and genital warts symptoms</h3>
                        <p>HPV infection is one of the most common types of STIs. Some forms of HPV put women at high risk of cervical cancer. Other forms cause genital warts. HPV usually has no signs or symptoms. The signs and symptoms of genital warts include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Small, flesh-colored or gray swellings in your genital area</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Often, however, genital warts cause no symptoms. Genital warts may be as small as 1 millimeter in diameter or may multiply into large clusters. Warts can also develop in the mouth or throat of a person who has had oral sex with an infected person.</p>

                        <p>Some people never develop signs or symptoms. But for those who do, signs and symptoms may occur several weeks after exposure and may include:</p>

                        <p>If you have been diagnosed with syphilis you should also test for HIV. Having an STI, including syphilis, can increase your risk of getting HIV. This is because having an STI, especially one that causes sores, makes it easier for HIV to get into your body and cause an infection.</p>
                        <p>People living with HIV can also be more likely to get syphilis. This is especially the case for people who aren't on treatment or who have a lower CD4 count. You're more vulnerable to infections, like syphilis, if your immune system is weaker. Syphilis may also progress more quickly in people living with HIV, so if you're living with HIV and think there's a chance you might have syphilis it's important to get tested and treated early on</p>
                        <p>People living with HIV can contract other sexually transmitted infection due to their weakened immune system. The STDs can therefore come in as opportunistic infections.</p>
