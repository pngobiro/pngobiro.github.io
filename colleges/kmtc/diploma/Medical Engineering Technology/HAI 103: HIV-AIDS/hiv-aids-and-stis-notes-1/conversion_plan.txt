3. **Special Elements Inventory**:
   ```
   Special Elements:
   - Equations: Present (e.g., Lines 34, 41, 112, 153, 155, 157, 191, 201, 209, 213, 217, 277, 278, 279, 289, 290, 316, 404, 468, 517, 993, 995, 1032, 1034, 1178) - Requires MathJax
   - Tables: 0
   - Figures: 7 (Lines 17, 222, 223, 228, 229, 239, 325) - Need download & local paths
   - Code Blocks: 0
   - Complex Lists: Present (Bulleted, Numbered, Roman numerals, Checkmarks) - Need HTML conversion

   Critical Sections (requiring special attention):
   - Lines 222-229: Multiple small images, likely part of a larger figure or layout element. Need careful placement.
   - Mathematical notation needs careful checking with MathJax rendering.
   - Lists using non-standard markers (e.g., $\checkmark$) need appropriate HTML/CSS.

5. **Repeat Section 4 for Each Chunk** (Placeholders added above)

6. **Cross-Chunk Navigation Planning**:
   ```
   Navigation Structure:
   - Previous/Next Chunk links (Implement sequentially: chunk1 -> chunk2 -> ... -> chunk8)
   - Table of Contents link (../index.html)
   - Breadcrumb navigation structure (e.g., Home > Topic 1 > Part 1) - To be implemented.
   - Progress indicator (e.g., "Part X of Y") - To be implemented.

   Cross-References:
   - (Scan MMD for explicit cross-references like "See section X" - None obvious in initial scan, verify during content transfer)
   ```

7. **Issues & Resolutions Log**:
   ```
   - [CHUNK/SECTION] [DESCRIPTION] - [STATUS]
