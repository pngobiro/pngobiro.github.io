\section*{UNIT 2: FORCE AND ENERGY}

\section*{FORCE}

\section*{Definition}

Force is the push or pull on an object with mass that causes it to change its velocity (to accelerate). Force represents as a vector, which means it has both magnitude and direction.

In equations, force is usually denoted by the symbol F. An example is an equation from Newton's second law:
$\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{mxa}$
Where $\mathrm{F}=$ force, $\mathrm{m}=$ mass, and $\mathrm{a}=$ acceleration.

\section*{Units of Force}

The SI unit of force is the Newton (N). Other units of force include the dyne, kilogram-force (kilopond), poundal, and pound-force.

A force of 1 newton is that force which when applied to a mass of 1 kilogram gives an acceleration of one meter per second squared.
$1 \mathrm{~N}=1 \mathrm{Kg} \mathrm{M} . \mathrm{Sec}^{2}$

\section*{WORK}

\section*{Definition}

Work is a measure of energy transfer that occurs when an object is moved over a distance by an external force at least part of which is applied in the direction of the displacement. If the force is constant, work may be computed by multiplying the length of the path by the component of the force acting along the path.

Work $=$ force x distance
Work done on a body is accomplished not only by a displacement of the body as a whole from one place to another but also, for example, by compressing a gas, by rotating a shaft, and even by causing invisible motions of the particles within a body by an external magnetic force.

No work, as understood in this context, is done unless the object is displaced in some way and there is a component of the force along the path over which the object is moved. Holding a heavy object stationary does not transfer energy to it, because there is no displacement. Holding the end of a rope on which a heavy object is being swung around at constant speed in a circle does not

transfer energy to the object, because the force is toward the center of the circle at a right angle to the displacement. No work is done in either case.

The mathematical expression for work depends upon the particular circumstances. Work done in compressing a gas at constant temperature may be expressed as the product of pressure times the change in volume. Work done by a torque in rotating a shaft may be expressed as the product of the torque times the angular displacement

Work done on a body is equal to the increase in the energy of the body, for work transfers energy to the body. If, however, the applied force is opposite to the motion of the object, the work is considered to be negative, implying that energy is taken from the object.

The units in which work is expressed are the same as those for energy, for example, in the meter-kilogram-second system, joule (newton-meter); in the centimeter-gram-second system, erg (dyne-centimeter); and in the English system, foot-pound.
$1 \mathrm{erg}=10^{-7} \mathrm{j}$
One erg is the work done when a force of one 1 dyne $\left(10^{-7} \mathrm{~J}\right)$ moves over a distance of 1 cm .

\section*{ENERGY}

\section*{Definition}

Energy is the capacity for doing work. It may exist in potential, kinetic, thermal, electrical, chemical, nuclear, or other various forms. There are, moreover, heat and work-i.e., energy in the process of transfer from one body to another. After it has been transferred, energy is always designated according to its nature. Hence, heat transferred may become thermal energy, while work done may manifest itself in the form of mechanical energy.

All forms of energy are associated with motion. For example, any given body has kinetic energy if it is in motion. A tensioned device such as a bow or spring, though at rest, has the potential for creating motion; it contains potential energy because of its configuration. Similarly, nuclear energy is potential energy because it results from the configuration of subatomic particles in the nucleus of an atom.

Energy can be neither created nor destroyed but only changed from one form to another. This principle is known as the conservation of energy or the first law of thermodynamics. For example, when a box slides down a hill, the potential energy that the box has from being located high up on the slope is converted to kinetic energy, energy of motion. As the box slows to a stop through friction, the kinetic energy from the box's motion is converted to thermal energy that heats the box and the slope.

Energy can be converted from one form to another in various other ways. Usable mechanical or electrical energy is, for instance, produced by many kinds of devices, including fuel-burning heat engines, generators, batteries, fuel cells, and magneto hydrodynamic systems.

In the International System of Units (SI), energy is measured in joules.
One joule is equal to the work done by a one-newton force acting over a one-meter distance.

\section*{POWER}

\section*{Definition}

Power is the rate of doing work or of transferring heat, i.e. the amount of energy transferred or converted per unit time. Having no direction, it is a scalar quantity.

In the International System of Units, the unit of power is the joule per second (J/s), known as the watt (W) in honor of James Watt, the eighteenth-century developer of the condenser steam engine. Another common and traditional measure is horsepower (comparing to the power of a horse); 1 horsepower equals about 745.7 watts.

Being the rate of work, the equation for power can be written as:
Power $=$ work/time

As a physical concept, power requires both a change in the physical system and a specified time in which the change occurs. This is distinct from the concept of work, which is measured only in terms of a net change in the state of the physical system. The same amount of work is done when carrying a load up a flight of stairs whether the person carrying it walks or runs, but more power is needed for running because the work is done in a shorter amount of time.

The output power of an electric motor is the product of the torque that the motor generates and the angular velocity of its output shaft. The power involved in moving a ground vehicle is the product of the traction force on the wheels and the velocity of the vehicle. The power of a jetpropelled vehicle is the product of the engine thrust and the velocity of the vehicle. The rate at which a light bulb converts electrical energy into light and heat is measured in watts-the higher the wattage, the more power, or equivalently the more electrical energy is used per unit time.

Equation of power
Power, as a function of time, is the rate (i.e. derivative) at which work is done, so can be expressed by this equation:

\section*{P}

Where $P$ is power, $W$ is work, and $t$ is time. Because work is a force $\mathbf{F}$ applied over a distance $\mathbf{x}$, W

For a constant force, power can be rewritten as:
Electrical power

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

The instantaneous electrical power $P$ delivered to a component is given by
$\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{t})=\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{t}) \mathrm{x} \mathrm{V}(\mathrm{t})$
Where
$P(t)$ is the instantaneous power, measured in watts (joules per second)
$V(t)$ is the potential difference (or voltage drop) across the component, measured in volts
$I(t)$ is the current through it, measured in amperes
If the component is a resistor with time-invariant voltage to current ratio, then:
$\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{I} . \mathrm{V}=\mathrm{I}^{2} . \mathrm{R}=\mathrm{V}^{2} / \mathrm{R}$
Where
$\mathrm{R}=\mathrm{V} / \mathrm{I}$
R is the resistance, measured in ohms.
OHMS LAW
The law states that the direct current flowing in a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference between its ends. It is usually formulated as $V=I R$, where $V$ is the potential difference, or voltage, $I$ is the current, and $R$ is the resistance of the conductor.

\section*{HEAT}

Heat, energy that is transferred from one body to another as the result of a difference in temperature. If two bodies at different temperatures are brought together, energy is transferredi.e., heat flows-from the hotter body to the colder. The effect of this transfer of energy usually, but not always, is an increase in the temperature of the colder body and a decrease in the temperature of the hotter body. A substance may absorb heat without an increase in temperature by changing from one physical state (or phase) to another, as from a solid to a liquid (melting), from a solid to a vapour (sublimation), from a liquid to a vapour (boiling), or from one solid form to another (usually called a crystalline transition). The important distinction between heat and temperature (heat being a form of energy and temperature a measure of the amount of that energy present in a body) was clarified during the 18th and 19th centuries.

Heat As A Form Of Energy
Because all of the many forms of energy, including heat, can be converted into work, amounts of energy are expressed in units of work, such as joules, foot-pounds, kilowatt-hours, or calories. Exact relationships exist between the amounts of heat added to or removed from a body and the
magnitude of the effects on the state of the body. The two units of heat most commonly used are the calorie and the British thermal unit (BTU).

The calorie (or gram-calorie) is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from $14.5^{\circ}$ to $15.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

The BTU is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one pound of water from $63^{\circ}$ to $64^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. One BTU is approximately 252 calories.

Both definitions specify that the temperature changes are to be measured at a constant pressure of one atmosphere, because the amounts of energy involved depend in part on pressure. The calorie used in measuring the energy content of foods is the large calorie, or kilogram-calorie, equal to 1,000 gram-calories.

The amount of energy required to raise a unit mass of a substance through a specified temperature interval is called the heat capacity, or the specific heat, of that substance. The quantity of energy necessary to raise the temperature of a body one degree varies depending upon the restraints imposed. If heat is added to a gas confined at constant volume, the amount of heat needed to cause a one-degree temperature rise is less than if the heat is added to the same gas free to expand (as in a cylinder fitted with a movable piston) and so do work. In the first case, all the energy goes into raising the temperature of the gas, but in the second case, the energy not only contributes to the temperature increase of the gas but also provides the energy necessary for the work done by the gas on the piston. Consequently, the specific heat of a substance depends on these conditions. The most commonly determined specific heats are the specific heat at constant volume and the specific heat at constant pressure.

It is incorrect to speak of the heat in a body, because heat is restricted to energy being transferred. Energy stored in a body is not heat (nor is it work, as work is also energy in transit). It is customary, however, to speak of sensible and latent heat.

The latent heat, also called the heat of vaporization, is the amount of energy necessary to change a liquid to a vapour at constant temperature and pressure. The energy required to melt a solid to a liquid is called the heat of fusion, and the heat of sublimation is the energy necessary to change a solid directly to a vapour, these changes also taking place under conditions of constant temperature and pressure.

\section*{Modes of heat transfer}
1. the transfer of heat by conduction in solids or fluids at rest
2. the transfer of heat by convection in liquids or gases in a state of motion, combining conduction with fluid flow
3. The transfer of heat by radiation, which takes place with no material carrier.
