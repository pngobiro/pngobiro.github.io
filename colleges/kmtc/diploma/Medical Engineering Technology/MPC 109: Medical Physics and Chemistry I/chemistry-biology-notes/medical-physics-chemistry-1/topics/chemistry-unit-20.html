                        <p><strong>Electrochemistry</strong> is defined as the branch of chemistry that examines the phenomena resulting from combined chemical and electrical effects. In other words, it is the study of production of electricity from energy released during spontaneous chemical reactions and the use of electrical energy to bring about non-spontaneous chemical transformations.</p>
                        <p>Many metals e.g. sodium hydroxide, chlorine, fluorine and many other chemicals are produced by electrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are used on a large scale in various instruments and devices.</p>
                        <p>Reminder: A redox reaction is a reaction which involves a change in oxidation state of one or more elements. When a substance loses its electron, its oxidation state increases, thus it is oxidized. When a substance gains an electron, its oxidation state decreases thus being reduced.</p>

                        <p>There are two types of cells i.e. galvanic cells and electrolytic cells</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Galvanic (voltaic) cells</h3>
                        <p>These are electrochemical cells which contain a spontaneous reaction, and always have a positive voltage. They are the basis for the batteries that fuel modern society.</p>
                        <p>A voltaic cell consists of two compartments called half-cells. The half-cell where oxidation occurs is called <strong>anode</strong>. The other half-cell where reduction occurs is called <strong>cathode</strong>. The Electrons in voltaic cells flow from the negative electrode to the positive electrode, which flows from anode to cathode.</p>

                        <p><strong>Electrolysis</strong> is the process of driving a reaction in a non-spontaneous direction by using an electric current i.e. a chemical compound e.g. lead (II) bromide is decomposed using electricity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Electrolyte</strong> is an ionic compound which conducts electric current in molten or aqueous solution, being decomposed in the process. Can be classified into non-electrolytes (organic liquids or solutions e.g. alcohols, pure water, sugar solution, molten sulphur), weak electrolytes (weak acids and alkalis e.g. ammonia solution, limewater) and strong electrolytes (strong acids, alkalis and salt solutions e.g. aqueous sulphuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, copper (II) sulphate solution).</p>
                        <p>NB: Molten/aqueous ionic compounds conduct electricity because ions free to move. In solid state, these ions are held in fixed position within the crystal lattice. Hence solid ionic compounds do not conduct electricity. When molten binary compound is electrolyzed, metal is formed on cathode while nonmetal is formed on anode.</p>
                        <p><strong>Electrode</strong> is a rod or plate where electricity enters or leaves electrolyte during electrolysis. Reactions occur at electrodes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Conductors</strong> are compounds that allow electric current to pass through them. Examples are metals, aqueous solution of acids, bases and salts etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>Insulators</strong> are compounds that do not allow electric current to pass through them. Examples are pure water, urea, sugar etc.</p>
