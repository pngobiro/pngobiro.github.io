                        <p>Gases exert pressure on any surface with which they come in contact since gas molecules are constantly in motion.</p>
                        <p>A classic demonstration of atmospheric pressure: how are we able to drink a liquid through a straw?</p>
                        <p>a drinking straw works by decreasing the air pressure inside the straw (when we such thro it), the atmospheric pressure acting on the surface of the liquid which is now greater than that in the straw forces the liquid to rise up in the straw.</p>
                        <p>The diagram illustrates this concept.</p>

                        <p>Pressure can be defined as force per unit area. F/A. It is one of the most readily measureable properties of a gas.</p>
                        <p>Force is rate of change of momentum: <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{mv}) / \mathrm{dt}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa). <span class="math-inline">$1 \mathrm{~Pa}=1 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$</span> where N (Newton) is the S.I. unit of force.

                        <p>All gases exhibit similar physical properties even if their chemical properties differ widely. These properties can be summarized in a few simple laws. The variables set are pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T in Kelvin) and number of molecules (n in moles) i.e. keep one (or two) of the variables constant and vary the others.</p>

                                This investigates the pressure and volume relationship of a gas sample. The volume of a fixed amount of an ideal gas varies inversely with pressure at a constant temperature. A bicycle pump is a good example of Boyle's law. As the volume of the air trapped in the pump is reduced, its pressure goes up, and air is forced into the tire.<br>
                                This law can be expressed as a mathematical expression as <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{P} \propto \frac{1}{V}$</span>. The symbol <span class="math-inline">$\propto$</span> means proportional to. We can change the symbol to an equals sign and write <span class="math-inline">$P = k_{1} \times \frac{1}{V}$</span>.

                                This investigates the temperature and volume relationship of a gas sample. At constant pressure, the volume of a gas sample expands when heated and contracts when cooled. Therefore, Charles' law states that, the volume of a fixed amount of gas maintained at a constant pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. An ideal application for this gas law is the hot air balloon.<br>
                                This law can be expressed as a mathematical expression as <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{V} \propto \mathrm{T}$</span>.

                                An ideal gas is a hypothetical gas whose pressure-volume-temperature behavior can be completely accounted for the ideal gas equation. An ideal gas obeys all of the gas laws under all conditions, does not condense into a liquid when cooled. This gas law brings together the gas properties using the gas laws we have discussed above.<br>
                                Boyle's law: <span class="math-inline">$P \propto \frac{1}{V}$</span><br>

                                Avogadro's law: <span class="math-inline">$V \propto n$</span><br>
                                These are combined to form a single main equation expressing the behavior of gases as <span class="math-inline">$V \propto \frac{nT}{P}$</span>. We can then change the <span class="math-inline">$\propto$</span> symbol to an equals sign and write <span class="math-inline">$V = R \frac{nT}{P}$</span>.<br>
