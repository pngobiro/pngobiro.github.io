                        <p>All substances are made from atoms. There are just over one hundred different types of atom, called elements. Atoms can join together in millions of different combinations to make all the substances on Earth and beyond. Structure of the atom</p>

                        <p>Every atom is made of a nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by electrons. Protons and electrons are oppositely charged. Neutrons have no charge. This means the nucleus of an atom is always positively charged. An atom has a neutral overall charge because it has the same number of electrons as protons. Protons and neutrons have the same mass and accounts for nearly all of the mass of the atom. Electrons have such a small mass that this can usually be taken as zero. The atomic number (also called the proton number) is the number of protons in an atom. The mass number (also called the nucleon number) is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom.</p>
                        <p>This information can be given simply in the form:</p>

                        <p>The number of neutrons in an atom can vary within small limits.

                        <p>The electronic structure of an atom is a description of how the electrons are arranged. It can be shown as numbers or as a diagram.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Working out the number of electrons</h3>
                        <p>Atoms are electrically neutral, and the 'positivity' of the protons is balanced by the 'negativity' of the electrons. It follows that in a neutral atom:</p>
                        <p>number of electrons = number of protons</p>
                        <p>So, if an oxygen atom (atomic number <span class="math-inline">$=8$</span>) has 8 protons, it must also have 8 electrons; if a chlorine atom (atomic number <span class="math-inline">$=17$</span>) has 17 protons, it must also have 17 electrons.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The arrangement of the electrons</h3>
                        <p>The electrons are found at considerable distances from the nucleus in a series of levels called energy levels. Each energy level (or shell) can only hold a certain number of electrons. The first level (nearest the nucleus) will only hold 2 electrons, the second holds 8, and the third also seems to be full when it has 8 electrons. The pattern gets more complicated after the third level. (Find out more relating to the arrangement of electrons after the <span class="math-inline">$3^{\text {rd }}$</span> level)</p>
                        <p>These levels can be thought of as getting progressively further from the nucleus. Electrons will always go into the lowest possible energy level (nearest the nucleus) - provided there is space.</p>

                        <p>When atoms are excited they emit light of certain wavelengths which correspond to different colors. The emitted light can be observed as a series of colored lines with dark spaces in between; this series of colored lines is called a line or atomic spectra. Each element produces a unique set of spectral lines. Since no two elements emit the same spectral lines, elements can be identified by their line spectrum.</p>
