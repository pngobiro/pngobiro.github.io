Such reduction techniques find an important place in the preparation of certain alcohols that are less available than the corresponding carbonyl compounds. What we must note here is that Sodium borohydride, NaBH<sub>4</sub>, does not reduce carbon-carbon double bonds, not even those conjugated with carbonyl groups.</span></li>
