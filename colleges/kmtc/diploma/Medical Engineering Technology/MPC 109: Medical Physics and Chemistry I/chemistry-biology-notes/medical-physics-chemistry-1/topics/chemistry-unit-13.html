                        <p>A solution is a homogenous mixture of two or more substances i.e. components are uniformly mixed. When a solute is dissolved in a solvent, a solution is formed. The solute is the substance present in a smaller amount, and the solvent is the substance present in a larger amount. A solution may be gaseous (air), solid (alloy) or liquid (seawater).</p>
                        <p>For the purposes of this course, we shall discuss aqueous solutions in which the solute initially is a liquid or a solid and the solvent is water. All solutes that dissolve in water fit into two categories: electrolytes and nonelectrolytes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Electrolytes</strong> is a substance that when dissolved in water, results in a solution that can conduct electricity. Whereas <strong>nonelectrolyte</strong> does not conduct electricity when dissolved in water. E.g. NaCl is an electrolyte since it conducts electricity. Electrodes connected to a light bulb are immersed in in a beaker of the solution is a method used to distinguish between electrolytes and nonelectrolytes. The brightness of the light bulb helps distinguish between strong and weak electrolytes. Strong electrolytes include sodium chloride, potassium iodide, and calcium nitrate. The human body contains many strong and weak electrolytes. Acids and bases are also electrolytes e.g. HCl and <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$</span> are strong electrolytes. These acids are said to ionize completely in water i.e. forms ions of the compound.</p>
                        <p>Although water is electronically neutral, it has a positive region (hydrogen atoms) and a negative region (oxygen atoms) therefore making it an effective solvent for ionic compounds.</p>

                        <p>In most cases, you will hear a solution referred to as dilute or concentrated. E.g. concentrated and dilute orange juice. A dilute solution is one that contains a relatively small amount of the solute in a given volume of solvent. A concentrated solution on the other hand contains a relatively large amount of the solute in the same volume of solvent.</p>
                        <p>In the laboratory and also in everyday use, the concentration of various solutions can be expressed/represented in many different ways. The most common concentration units are as below:</p>
