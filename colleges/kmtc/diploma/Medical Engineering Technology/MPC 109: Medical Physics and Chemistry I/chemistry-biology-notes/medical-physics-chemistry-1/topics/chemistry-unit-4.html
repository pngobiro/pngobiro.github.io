                        <p>This can be done in one of the two ways. Namely:</p>

                        <p>Balance the following equation</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\mathrm{CH}_{4(\mathrm{g})}+\mathrm{O}_{2_{(\mathrm{g})}} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2_{(\mathrm{g})}}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(\mathrm{g})}$$</div>
                        <p>Start by assigning generic coefficients i.e.</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\mathrm{aCH}_{4(\mathrm{g})}+\mathrm{bO}_{2(\mathrm{g})} \rightarrow \mathrm{cCO}_{2(\mathrm{g})}+\mathrm{dH}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(\mathrm{l})}$$</div>
                        <p>From this, a set of mathematical equations can be derived since the number of each element should be equal on each side of the equation e.g.</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\begin{aligned}
                         a &= c \\
                         4 a &= 2 d \\
                         2 b &= 2 c+d
                         \end{aligned}$$</div>
                        <p>If we choose the solution where <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{a}=1$</span> we then get that <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{c}=1$</span> also.

If <span class="math-inline">$c=1$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$d=2$</span>, then, by the last equation, <span class="math-inline">$b=2$</span>. If we replace the generic/alphabet coefficients with the integers got from the calculation, we then get a balanced equation as below.</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\mathrm{CH}_{4(\mathrm{g})}+2 \mathrm{O}_{2(\mathrm{g})} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2(\mathrm{g})}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(\mathrm{g})}$$</div>

                        <p>It is the quantitative study of chemical reactions. It is the use of balanced chemical equations to calculate amounts of reactants and products. When two chemicals react with each other, we want to know how many atoms or molecules of each are used so that a formula of the product can be used. Mole - it is the counting unit (SI measure of quantity) used to indicate the number of atoms, ions, molecules or formula units present in a particular chemical sample.</p>
                        <p>Avogadro's number - One mole of each and every substance contains the same amount of particles. To make this easier, a convenient unit of matter that contains a known number of particles has been defined i.e. 1 mole= <span class="math-inline">$6.022 \times 10^{23}$</span> particles. This is commonly known as the Avogadro's number. Molar mass - this is the mass of one mole of a given substance. The units for molar mass are grams/mole. The molar mass of atoms of any element is equal to the atomic mass in grams.</p>
                        <p>E.g. 1 mole of sodium weighs 22.99 g.</p>
                        <p>In molecules (containing more than one elements in the chemical formula), the term molecular mass is used instead of atomic mass. To determine the molecular mass of a molecule, the atomic masses of the elements making up the molecule are added up.</p>
                        <p>E.g. <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{CCl}_{4}=1 \mathrm{C}$</span> atomic mass 12.001 g</p>
                        <p>4 Cl atomic mass <span class="math-inline">$4(35.4527 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol})$</span></p>
                        <p>Total <span class="math-inline">$=153.81 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, 1 mole of <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{CCl}_{4}=153.81 \mathrm{~g}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>To determine the number of moles of a given substance, the amount of that substance (given in grams) is divided by the molar mass of (measured in <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mol}$</span>) as shown in the formula below.</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{\operatorname{mass}(g)}{\text { molar mass }(\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mol})}=(\mathrm{g})\left(\frac{\mathrm{mol}}{\mathrm{~g}}\right)=\mathrm{mol}$$</div>
