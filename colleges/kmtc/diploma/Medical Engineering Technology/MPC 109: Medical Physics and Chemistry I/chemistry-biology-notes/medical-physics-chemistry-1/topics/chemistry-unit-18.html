                        <p><strong>Thermodynamics</strong> is the study of heat, and how heat can be interconverted into other energy forms.</p>
                        <p>In thermodynamics the <strong>system</strong> is a specific part of the universe that is being studied, often the system is a chemical reaction. The <strong>surroundings</strong> are all parts of the universe that are not the system, typically everything outside the test tube.</p>
                        <p>An <strong>open system</strong> can exchange both energy and matter with its surroundings. An active volcano is an example of an open system.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>closed system</strong> can exchange energy but not matter. A sealed greenhouse is a closed system.</p>
                        <p>An <strong>isolated system</strong> can exchange neither energy nor matter. A sealed thermos bottle is an isolated system.</p>
                        <p><strong>Thermochemistry</strong> is a branch of thermodynamics and is the study of how energy in the form of heat is involved in chemical change.</p>
                        <p><strong>Heat</strong> is defined as the energy that flows into or out of a reaction because of a difference in temperature between the thermodynamic system and its surroundings. Or heat is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies that are at different temperatures.</p>
                        <p>The heat content of a body will depend on its temperature, its mass, and the material it is made of. Temperature is NOT the same as heat.</p>

                        <p><strong>Temperature</strong> measures the degree of hotness or coldness i.e. how hot or how cold.</p>
                        <p><strong>Energy</strong> can simply be defined as ability to do work. E.g. light energy from sunlight makes plants to grow. Energy in food allows us to perform normal bodily functions. It is measured in different units e.g. kilowatts in measuring electrical energy, calories in food. In measuring energy associated with most chemical processes, energy is expressed in terms of joules. The food energy unit, Calorie, is equal to 1 kcal. One calorie is the energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of pure water by one degree Celsius (<span class="math-inline">$1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</span>). In addition, 4.18 joules = 1 calorie.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Energy takes many forms such as mechanical, thermal, radiant, chemical, electrical, or gravitational. These are categorized into two broad classes:</p>
                        <p><strong>kinetic energy</strong>, energy associated with motion, and <strong>potential energy</strong>, energy associated with position.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Potential energy</h3>
                        <p>It is energy stored up and is ready to be used/converted in future. E.g. fossil fuels have potential energy which can be converted to other forms of energy.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Kinetic energy</h3>
                        <p>This is energy in motion. The more kinetic energy a body has, the faster it moves. Objects at rest have no kinetic energy.</p>
                        <p>Energy (heat) flows between the reaction and surroundings to establish temperature equality or thermal equilibrium. Heat flows from a region of higher temperature to one of lower temperature.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Enthalpy</h3>
                        <p>Enthalpy refers to a state function used to describe the heat changes that occur in a reaction under constant pressure. In chemical reactions, heat can either be absorbed or released. This flow of heat is referred to as enthalpy change.</p>
                        <p>Reactions that release heat are termed as <strong>exothermic</strong>, they have negative values of <span class="math-inline">$\Delta \mathrm{H}$</span> e.g. freezing or condensation.</p>
                        <p>Reactions that absorb heat are termed as <strong>endothermic</strong>, they have positive values of <span class="math-inline">$\Delta \mathrm{H}$</span> e.g. melting or vaporization.</p>
                        <p>The heat notation in a thermochemical equation:</p>
                        <p>The symbol <span class="math-inline">$\Delta H$</span> is used to denote heat changes. A thermochemical equation is a chemical equation with the <span class="math-inline">$\Delta \mathrm{H}$</span> for the reaction included.</p>

                        <p>As earlier mentioned, temperature refers to the degree of hotness or coldness of an object and is measured by a thermometer. Temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy per particle in a substance. E.g. for gases how fast the gas particles are bouncing to and fro or for liquids how fast particles slide and jiggle past one another and for solids, how fast particles move as they vibrate and jiggle in place</p>
                        <p>The higher the temperature of a substance, the faster the motion of its molecules.</p>
                        <p>Temperature is measured using a variety of temperature scales. The most commonly used are described in the next two sections.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">1. The Celsius Scale (<span class="math-inline">${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</span>)</h4>

                        <p>This scale has absolute zero as the zero point on its scale. The size of the degree is the same as a Celsius degree.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Heat can transfer (move) in 3 ways i.e. conduction, convection and radiation.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Conduction</h3>
                        <p>It is most obvious in solids. Conduction occurs when heat energy travels through a body, passing from particle to particle as they vibrate against each other. When a solid heats up, its particles gain kinetic energy and increase the energy with which they vibrate. A good conductor must have particles which are close enough together to collide with sufficient force for energy to be transferred. Metals are all good conductors of heat especially copper, aluminium and silver, because they have "free" (metallic bonding) electrons which are easily able to transfer heat energy. All liquids (except mercury) and gases are very poor conductors of heat. Some materials are poor conductors of heat are referred to as insulators e.g. wood, plastics</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Convection</h3>
                        <p>It is the transfer of heat by the movement of the heated particles themselves. This can only take place in liquids and gases because in solids the particles are not able to move from their fixed positions. When a liquid or gas is heated, it expands and becomes less dense. The lighter liquid or gas rises allowing a flow of cooler material to take its place. This in turn becomes heated and so a current is set up. Heat will continue to be transferred through the available space in this way until it is evenly distributed.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Radiation</h3>
                        <p>It is the way we receive heat energy from the sun. It does not require a medium for its transmission (i.e. it can travel through empty space) and is in the form of electromagnetic energy waves which travel in the same way as light or radio waves.</p>
                        <p>When these energy waves fall on a body, the energy may be: absorbed, transmitted or reflected.</p>
                        <p>When radiant energy is absorbed the body will rise in temperature. A rack of clothes left in front of a radiant heater will continue to absorb heat until it reaches ignition temperature. Black and dull surfaces absorb (and radiate) heat much more efficiently than white shiny surface.</p>
                        <p>Radiant energy is transmitted through clear materials such as glass. The glass does not heat up. Radiant heat from the sun may be concentrated by means of a magnifying glass, sufficient to ignite flammable material.</p>
                        <p>Shiny, silver surfaces will reflect radiant energy and not heat up. This is the reason for the silver coating on a fire-fighter's jacket.</p>

                        <p>There are 3 laws of motion attributed to Isaac Newton known as newton laws. They explain how forces make objects move. When a force act on an object, it may cause change in the way the object moves. The change can be in terms of speed or change in direction.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">1. First law of motion</h4>
                        <p>It states that an object will stay still or move along at a steady pace unless a force acts on it. E.g. a rocket on a Launchpad remain in place because there is no force acting on it to make it move.</p>

                        <p>E.g. when the rocket engine fires up, the force it produces lifts the rocket off the Launchpad and into the air.</p>

                        <p>It states that when a force acts on an object, the object pulls or pushes back. This reaction is equal to original force but in the opposite direction.</p>
