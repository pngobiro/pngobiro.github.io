                        <p><strong>Nature of the solute and solvent</strong> - The amount of solute that dissolves depends on what type of solute it is. While only 1 gram of lead (II) chloride can be dissolved in 100 grams of water at room temperature, 200 grams of zinc chloride can be dissolved. This means that a greater amount of zinc chloride can be dissolved in the same amount of water than lead II chloride.</p>
                        <p><strong>Temperature</strong> -- Generally, an increase in the temperature of the solution increases the solubility of a solid solute. For example, a greater amount of sugar will dissolve in warm water than in cold water. A few solid solutes, however, are less soluble in warmer solutions. For all gases, solubility decreases as the temperature of the solution rises. An example of this is Soda. The solubility of the carbon dioxide gas decreases when a soda is warm, making the soda flat.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pressure</strong> -- For solid and liquid solutes, changes in pressure have practically no effect on solubility. For gaseous solutes, an increase in pressure increases solubility and a decrease in pressure decreases solubility. Example: When the cap on a bottle of soda pop is removed, pressure is released, and the gaseous solute bubbles out of solution. This escape of a gas from solution is called effervescence.</p>

                        <p>A mixture of metal ions in a solution can be separated by precipitation with anions such as <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{Br}^{-}, \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}, \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}, \mathrm{S}^{2-}, \mathrm{CrO}_{4}^{2-}, \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}, \mathrm{OH}^{-}$</span> etc. When a metal ion or a group of metal ions form insoluble salts with a particular anion, they can be separated from others by precipitation. We can also separate the anions by precipitating them with appropriate metal ions. There are no definite dividing lines between insoluble salts, sparingly soluble, and soluble salts, but concentrations of their saturated solutions are small, medium, and large. Solubility products are usually listed for insoluble and sparingly soluble salts, but they are not given for soluble salts. Solubility products for soluble salts are very large.</p>

                        <p>An eutectic is a melting composition of minimum two or more components, each of which melts and freezes congruently. During the crystallization phase, a mixture of the components is formed, hence acting as a single component. The components freeze to an intimate mixture of crystals and melt simultaneously without separation. Eutectics can be mixtures of organic and/or inorganic compounds. Hence, eutectics can be made as either organic-organic, inorganic-inorganic or organic-inorganic mixtures. This gives room for a wide variety of combinations that can be tailored for specific applications.</p>
