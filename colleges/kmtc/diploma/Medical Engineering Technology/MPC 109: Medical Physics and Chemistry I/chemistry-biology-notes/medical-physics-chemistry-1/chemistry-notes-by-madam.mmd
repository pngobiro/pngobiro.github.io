\section*{UNIT 1: INTRODUCTION TO PHYSICAL SCIENCE}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of this unit, the learner should be able to;
1. Define the various terms as relates to physical science
2. Outline the structure of atoms for various elements

\subsection*{1.1 Definitions}
- Physical Science: the study of the physical world, the natural world
- Chemistry: the study of the composition, properties and transformations of matter.
- Matter: anything that occupies space and has mass.
- Elements: basic building blocks of all other forms of matter.
- Atoms: small particles derived from one the elements. All matter can be described in terms of the interactions of atoms with each other.
- Molecules (compounds): combination of two or more atoms. Most common form for atoms.

\subsection*{1.2 Atomic Structure}

All substances are made from atoms. There are just over one hundred different types of atom, called elements. Atoms can join together in millions of different combinations to make all the substances on Earth and beyond. Structure of the atom
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-012.jpg?height=529&width=798&top_left_y=283&top_left_x=260)

Every atom is made of a nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by electrons. Protons and electrons are oppositely charged. Neutrons have no charge. This means the nucleus of an atom is always positively charged. An atom has a neutral overall charge because it has the same number of electrons as protons. Protons and neutrons have the same mass and accounts for nearly all of the mass of the atom. Electrons have such a small mass that this can usually be taken as zero. The atomic number (also called the proton number) is the number of protons in an atom. The mass number (also called the nucleon number) is the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom.
This information can be given simply in the form:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-012.jpg?height=182&width=399&top_left_y=1660&top_left_x=234)

Atomic Number (Z) The \# of protons
Mass Number (A) [The \# of protons] + [the \# of neutrons]
The number of neutrons in an atom can vary within small limits. For example, there are three kinds of carbon atom ${ }^{12} \mathrm{C},{ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ and ${ }^{14} \mathrm{C}$. They all have the same number of protons, but the number of neutrons varies.
protons Neutrons mass number
carbon-12 6 6
$\begin{array}{llll}\text { carbon-13 } & 6 & 7 & 13\end{array}$
$\begin{array}{cccc}\text { carbon-14 } 6 & 8\end{array}$
These different atoms of carbon are called isotopes. The fact that they have varying numbers of neutrons makes no difference whatsoever to the chemical reactions of the carbon.
Isotopes are atoms which have the same atomic number but different mass numbers. They have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.
E.g. 2 Isotopes of chlorine
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline e & s & s & \\
\hline $${ }_{17}^{35} \mathrm{Cl}$$ & 17 & 17 & $$\begin{aligned}
& 35-17= \\
& 18
\end{aligned}$$ \\
\hline ${ }_{17}^{37} \mathrm{Cl}$ & 17 & 17 & $$\begin{aligned}
& 37-17= \\
& 20
\end{aligned}$$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The negatively charged electron is attracted to the positively charged nucleus by a Coulombic attraction. The protons and neutrons are held together in the nucleus by the strong nuclear force. These two forces hold the atom together.

\subsection*{1.3 Electronic Configuration}

The electronic structure of an atom is a description of how the electrons are arranged. It can be shown as numbers or as a diagram.
Working out the number of electrons

Atoms are electrically neutral, and the 'positivity' of the protons is balanced by the 'negativity' of the electrons. It follows that in a neutral atom:
number of electrons = number of protons
So, if an oxygen atom (atomic number $=8$ ) has 8 protons, it must also have 8 electrons; if a chlorine atom (atomic number $=17$ ) has 17 protons, it must also have 17 electrons.

\section*{The arrangement of the electrons}

The electrons are found at considerable distances from the nucleus in a series of levels called energy levels. Each energy level (or shell) can only hold a certain number of electrons. The first level (nearest the nucleus) will only hold 2 electrons, the second holds 8 , and the third also seems to be full when it has 8 electrons. The pattern gets more complicated after the third level. (Find out more relating to the arrangement of electrons after the $3^{\text {rd }}$ level)
These levels can be thought of as getting progressively further from the nucleus. Electrons will always go into the lowest possible energy level (nearest the nucleus) - provided there is space.

\section*{To work out the electronic arrangement of an atom}
- Look up the atomic number in the Periodic Table - making sure that you choose the right number if two numbers are given. The atomic number will always be the smaller one.
- This tells you the number of protons, and hence the number of electrons.
- Arrange the electrons in levels, always filling up an inner level before you go to an outer one.

\section*{E.g. to find the electronic arrangement in chlorine}
- The Periodic Table gives you the atomic number of 17.
- Therefore there are 17 protons and 17 electrons.
- The arrangement of the electrons will be 2, 8, 7 (i.e. 2 in the first level, 8 in the second, and 7 in the third).

After this the pattern alters as you enter the transition series in the Periodic Table.

Two important generalizations
If you look at the patterns in this table:
- The number of electrons in the outer level is the same as the group number. (Except with helium which has only 2 electrons. The noble gases are also usually called group 0 - not group 8.) This pattern extends throughout the Periodic Table for the main groups (i.e. not including the transition elements).

So if you know that barium is in group 2, it has 2 electrons in its outer level; iodine (group 7) has 7 electrons in its outer level; lead (group 4) has 4 electrons in its outer level.
- Noble gases have full outer levels meaning they are stable elements.

Electron configuration diagram for lithium
Take lithium for example. The diagram shows each energy shell as a circle around the nucleus, with each electron represented by a dot. In the exam, do not worry about coloring in the electrons. Just make them clear and ensure they are in the right place. Sometimes you will be asked to use a cross rather than a dot.

The electronic configuration for lithium is written as 2.1 (showing that lithium atoms have three electrons, two in the first shell and one in the second shell).
The table describes the electronic structures of four more elements.

\subsection*{1.4 Atomic Spectra}

When atoms are excited they emit light of certain wavelengths which correspond to different colors. The emitted light can be observed as a series of colored lines with dark spaces in between; this series of colored lines is called a line or atomic spectra. Each element produces a unique set of spectral lines. Since no two elements emit the same spectral lines, elements can be identified by their line spectrum.

\section*{UNIT 2: PERIODIC TABLE}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of this unit, the learner should be able to;
1. Explain the trends in the periodic table
2. Outline the physical and chemical properties of elements in the periodic table

\subsection*{2.1 INTRODUCTION TO PERIODIC PROPERTIES}

Elements are presented in ascending order i.e. increasing atomic number and organized by period (row) and group (column), with the period corresponding to the principle energy level (left to right), and the group relating to the extent the subshells are filled. The periodic table consists of seven rows called periods, and 18 columns called groups or families.

\subsection*{2.2 Physical and chemical properties of elements}

The properties of the elements within a period vary across the periodic table in predictable ways, while the elements within a group have similar properties. The properties of an atom relate directly to the number of electrons in various orbitals, and the periodic table is much like a road map among those orbitals such that chemical properties can be deduced by the position of an element on the table. The electrons in the outermost shell are especially important because they can engage in the sharing and exchange that is responsible for chemical reactions i.e. they determine the element's valence. Using periodic trends, the periodic table can help predict the properties of various elements and the relations between properties. The properties of an atom depend ultimately on the number of electrons in the various orbitals, and on the nuclear charge which determines the compactness of the orbitals.

Physical properties are the characteristics can be observed without changing the substance into another substance. Physical properties of matter are usually those that can be observed using our senses. The observations usually consist of some type of numerical measurement. Examples of Physical properties include Color, Freezing point, Boiling point, Melting point, Density and Smell. E.g. the melting point of water is $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (temperature at which the solid for of the element or compound is at equilibrium with the liquid form) whereas its boiling point is a $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (temperature at which the liquid form of an element or compound is at equilibrium, with the gaseous form)
Chemical properties are the characteristics that determine how it will react with other substances or change from one substance to another. Chemical properties, or characteristics, which are exhibited as one substance and then chemically transformed into another. Chemical properties are only observable during a chemical reaction. Reactions and changes to substances can be brought about by Burning, Rusting, Heating, Exploding and Tarnishing.
For purposes of our course, our concentration will be on the first 20 elements of the periodic table as highlighted in an earlier section of this unit.

\subsection*{2.3 CHEMICAL PROPERTIES/REACTIONS}

A lithium atom has two electrons orbiting in an inner shell and only one electron orbiting in its outer shell. The outer shell is incomplete, and therefore unstable. Li atoms readily give up one electron to form positively charged, $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$ions. These ions have the same stable electron configuration as the noble gas helium.
All Group 1 atoms can lose one electron to form positively charged ions (cations). For example, potassium atoms do this to form ions with the same electron configuration as the noble gas argon.
Group 2 atoms lose two electrons to form positively charged ions. For example, magnesium atoms form $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ions. These have the same electron configuration as the noble gas neon.
Most elements in Group 3 lose three electrons to form 3+ ions. Boron, however, shows little tendency to form ions. It obtains a noble gas structure by sharing electrons with other atoms. This is called covalent bonding. Elements in Groups 15, 16 and 17, find it easier to gain electrons than lose them. For example, oxygen atoms gain two electrons to form $\mathrm{O}^{2}$ ions. These ions are negatively charged (anions). These have the same electron configuration as the noble gas neon.

Elements in Group 14 could lose four, or gain four electrons to achieve a noble gas structure. In fact, if they are going to form ions, Group 14 elements form positive ions. Carbon and silicon form covalent bonds. Carbon's millions of organic compounds are all based on shared electrons in covalent bonds.

Many elements can form covalent bonds depending on the circumstances. For example, the bonding in water, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, is mainly covalent; and while chlorine is bonded to sodium ionically in sodium chloride, it bonds to carbon covalently in carbon tetrachloride.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-022.jpg?height=543&width=1451&top_left_y=300&top_left_x=256)

A chemical property describes the tendency of a substance to transform into a new substance. During this transformation, atoms rearrange themselves into new configurations. For instance, we have mentioned above that atoms in group/family 1 lose an electron to form positively charged ions, cations. In conclusion, a physical change imposes a new set of conditions on the same material while a chemical change forms a new material with its own unique set of physical properties. E.g. a physical to demonstrate physical properties, water can be subjected to extremely low temperatures that it forms ice i.e. liquid to solid. To demonstrate a chemical change, hydrogen ions can combine with an oxygen ion to form an entirely new substance i.e. water.

\section*{Sample questions}
3. Melting a piece of gold would be? Physical change
4. Tarnishing a piece of silver would be? Chemical change

\section*{Elements vs. Compounds} An element is a material made of only one kind of atom. E.g. pure gold is made up of only gold atoms.
A compound is a substance consisting of atoms of different elements. E.g. Sodium Chloride NaCl, Ammonia $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and water $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Compounds have properties uniquely different from the elements from which they are made. A chemical formula is used to show the proportion by which elements combine to form a compound.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Compounds are named starting with the element farthest to the left in the periodic table and for the element to the right, a suffix -ide is added. However, some compounds have several possible combinations e.g. Carbon can react with oxygen to CO or CO 2 . In such a situation, a prefix is added to both compounds to eliminate ambiguity i.e. carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Example 2, hydrogen can react with oxygen to form H 2 O or H 2 O 2 i.e. dihydrogen monoxide or dihydrogen dioxide. However in such a situation, common names are used to describe the compounds i.e. water and hydrogen peroxide.

\section*{Sample question}
1. What is the name of the compound with the formula $\mathrm{CBr}_{4}$ ? Carbon tetrabromide

\section*{UNIT 3: STRUCTURE AND BONDING Unit objectives}

By the end of this unit, the learner should be able to:
1. List the types of bonds
2. Draw the structures of simple molecules

\subsection*{3.1 Introduction to Structure and Bonding}

There are three main properties of chemical bonds that must be considered —namely, their strength, length, and polarity. The polarity of a bond is the distribution of electrical charge over the atoms joined by the bond. The strength of a bond is the measure of energy required to break it i.e. to separate the bonded atoms. The length of a bond s the distance between the centers of two covalently bonded atoms. It is determined by the number of bonded electrons.

Atoms bond together through their electrons. The electrons that participate in chemical bonding are the ones in the outermost shell of an atom. These electrons are referred to as valence electrons. E.g. sodium, Na , atomic number 11, has only one valence electron. The number of valence electrons and how they behave in an atom (whether lost or gained) determines the ion charge.

Chemical bonds form when two atoms approach each other and the attractive forces are greater than the repulsive forces. Other factors involved in bond formation other than attraction and repulsive forces include; interatomic distance, shapes of orbitals in atoms and molecules, the number of valence electrons available in the bonding atoms and the relative energies of the orbitals involved in bond formation.

\subsection*{3.2 Types of Bonds}

There are three types of strong/primary bonds:
$\checkmark$ Ionic
$\checkmark$ Covalent
$\checkmark$ Metallic
Some substances contain either a combination of a covalent and an ionic bond or an intermediate (in-between).
Other weak/secondary bonds include dipole-dipole interaction, hydrogen bonding, and London dispersion forces.

\section*{1. Ionic bonding}

It is an electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions. One or more electrons are transferred from the outer shell of one atom to the outer shell of another atom. The charge of an ion depends on the number of electrons the atom needed to loose or gain to achieve a full outer shell. The overall charge of a compound formed through ionic bonds must be zero.
Properties of ionic compounds
i) High melting and boiling points because of strong attractive forces between ions in the lattice (an organized crystalline structure of ions that are packed together when an ionic compound is formed). The stronger the bonds, the higher the boiling point.
ii) Conduct electricity when molten (liquefied/heated) or dissolved in water.

Example: What is the chemical formula for a compound made of aluminum ions, $\mathrm{Al}^{3+}$, and oxygen ions, $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ ? $\mathbf{A l}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{3}}$
What is the chemical formula for a compound made of magnesium ions, $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, and oxygen ions, $\mathrm{O}^{2-?} \mathbf{~ M g O}$.
The chemical formula shows the ratio by which atoms combine.

\section*{2. Covalent bonding}

It is the type of electrical attraction in which atoms are held together by their mutual attraction for shared electrons or it is the electrostatic attraction between a pair of electrons and positively charged nuclei.
There are two electrons (1 pair of electrons) within a single covalent bond. A covalent bond is represented using a straight line. E.g. F-F The number of covalent bonds an atom can form equals its number of unpaired valence electrons.

\section*{Multiple covalent bonds}
$\checkmark$ Single bond: One shared electron pair with one electron from each atom.
$\checkmark$ Double bond: Two shared electron pairs with two electrons from each atom. $=$
$\checkmark$ Triple bond: Three shared electron pairs with three electrons from each atom. $\equiv$

The more pairs of electrons there are in a covalent bond; the shorter the bond length and the stronger the bond.

\section*{3. Metallic bond}

It is the sharing of electrons between many atoms of a metal element. Atoms in a metal compound share a big pool of valence electrons between many metal atoms. This pool of valance electrons is known as a sea of electrons or delocalized electrons. Metallic bonding provides metals with a unique set of properties. Metals are malleable (substance can be shaped) and ductile (stretched into thin wires, such as those used for electricity) and good conductors of heat and electricity. They are also able to conduct electricity, which means that electrons can move freely through them.

\subsection*{3.3 Vanderwalls forces}

Even when two atoms that are near one another will not bind, they will still attract one another. This phenomenon is known as the Vanderwaals interaction. The Vanderwaals forces cause a force between the two atoms. This force becomes stronger, as the atoms come closer together. However, when the two atoms draw too near each other a rejecting force will take action, as a consequence of the exceeding rejection between the negatively charged electrons of both atoms. As a result, a certain distance will develop between the two atoms, which is commonly known as the Vanderwaals
radius. Through comparison of Vanderwaals radiuses of several different pairs of atoms, we have developed a system of Vanderwaals radiuses, through which we can predict the Vanderwaals radius between two atoms, through addition.

\section*{Phases of matter}
- Solid Matter (ice) - attraction between particles is strong enough to hold all the particles together in a fixed 3D arrangement (particles can only vibrate)
- Liquid Matter (water) - attraction between particles is not as strong and it takes on a fluid character by taking the shape of its container (particles slip past each other and bounce around
- Gaseous Matter (vapor) - attraction between particles can no longer hold them together and will fill whatever space is available (particles move very fast)

\section*{Density}
- A measure of the compactness of a solid, liquid, or gas
- The amount of matter per unit volume:
- Density = Mass / Volume
- Grams / Cubic Centimeter or Kilograms / Cubic Meter
- Which is usually more dense:
- Solid
- Liquid
- Gas

\section*{UNIT 4: CHEMICAL EQUATIONS}

Unit objectives
By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Write chemical formulae of various compounds
2. Balance chemical equations

\subsection*{4.1 Writing Chemical Formulae of Compounds}

A chemical equation is a written representation of a chemical reaction, showing the reactants and products, their physical states, and the direction in which the reaction proceeds.
Writing chemical formulae of compounds
During a chemical reaction, one or more compounds are formed as a result of the rearrangement of atoms i.e. reactants to form products. This means that one or more substances undergo a chemical change to produce new substances.

Reactant Products
A chemical change occurs when a substance's composition changes.
Indicators of chemical change
i) Change in temperature
ii) Change in color
iii) Noticeable odor (especially after the reaction has begun)
iv) Formation of a precipitate
v) Formation of bubbles

Types of chemical reactions
1) Precipitation/double-replacement reaction

It is a reaction that occurs when aqueous solutions of anions and cations combine to form a compound that is insoluble. The insoluble solid is known as a precipitate and the remaining liquid a supernate.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
2) Acid-base reaction

It occurs when an acid and a base are mixed. An acid produces the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in solution whereas a base is a substance that produces $\mathrm{OH}^{+}$ions in a solution. A typical acid-base reaction will produce an ionic compound called a salt and water.
3) Oxidation-reduction (redox reactions)

It occurs when the oxidation number of atoms involved in the reaction are changed (increase/decrease). In oxidation, the atom's number is increased i.e. electrons are lost. Reduction is the decrease in an atom's oxidation number i.e. electrons are gained. The atom undergoing oxidation is called the reducing agent (gains electrons) and the atom undergoing reduction is the oxidizing agent (losses electrons)
OIL RIG (oxidation is loss of electrons, reduction is gain of electrons).
LEO GER (loss of electrons is oxidation, gain of electrons is reduction).
4) Combustion reaction

It is a type of redox reaction in which a fuel reacts with an oxidizing agent, resulting in the release of energy as heat. Such reactions are exothermic (heat is given off during a reaction). And endothermic reaction is one in which heat is absorbed.
5) Synthesis reactions

Occurs when one or more compounds combines to form a complex compound.
6) Decomposition reactions

Opposite of synthesis. It occurs when a more complex compound breaks down to form multiple simple compounds.
7) Single replacement reactions

A type of redox reaction in which an element in a compound is replaced by another element.

\section*{Law of mass conservation}

The law of mass conservation dictates that no atoms are gained or lost during any reaction. In other words, matter cannot be created or destroyed,
only changed. Therefore, the number of atoms appearing before the arrow should always be equal to the number of atoms appearing after the arrow. This knowledge is used in balancing chemical reactions.
A chemical equation is a shorthand way of indicating what is going on in a chemical reaction.

Writing a balanced equation.
Word equations
In most chemical equations, phase symbols are used to denote the state of matter the substances in the equation are e.g. (g) for gaseous state, (s) for solid state, (aq) for aqueous/water solution state and (I) for liquid state.

\subsection*{4.2 BaLANCING Chemical equations}

It is guided by the law of mass conservation i.e. an equation is balanced when the number of atoms of each type present is the same on both sides of the equation.
This can be done in one of the two ways. Namely:
- By observation to assign appropriate coefficients to the compounds involved in a given reaction.
- By using a mathematical method whereby a set of mathematical equations are derived for each element from assigned generic coefficients denoted in alphabets. E.g.
Balance the following equation
$$\mathrm{CH}_{4(\vartheta)}+\mathrm{O}_{2_{(\xi)}} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2_{(\xi)}}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(\xi)}$$

Start by assigning generic coefficients i.e.
$$\mathrm{aCH}_{4(9)}+\mathrm{bO}_{2(a)} \rightarrow \mathrm{cCO}_{2(a)}+\mathrm{dH}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(\mathfrak{l}}$$

From this, a set of mathematical equations can be derived since the number of each element should be equal on each side of the equation e.g.
$$\begin{aligned}
& a=c \\
& 4 a=2 d \\
& 2 b=2 c+d
\end{aligned}$$

If we choose the solution where $\mathrm{a}=1$ we then get that $\mathrm{c}=1$ also. If $\mathrm{a}=1$ then, by the second equation, we get that $d$ is equal to 2 . If $c=1$ and $d=2$, then, by the last equation, $b=2$. If we replace the generic/alphabet coefficients with the integers got from the calculation, we then get a balanced equation as below.
$$\mathrm{CH}_{4(9)}+2 \mathrm{O}_{2(9)} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2(9)}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(9}$$

Importance of a balanced chemical equation
1. To determine how much (moles and grams) of products can be made from a known amount of reactants.
2. To determine how much reactants (moles and grams) will be used to make a known amount of products.

\subsection*{4.3 StOichiometry}

It is the quantitative study of chemical reactions. It is the use of balanced chemical equations to calculate amounts of reactants and products. When two chemicals react with each other, we want to know how many atoms or molecules of each are used so that a formula of the product can be used. Mole - it is the counting unit (SI measure of quantity) used to indicate the number of atoms, ions, molecules or formula units present in a particular chemical sample.
Avogadro's number - One mole of each and every substance contains the same amount of particles. To make this easier, a convenient unit of matter that contains a known number of particles has been defined i.e. 1 mole= $6.022 \times 10{ }^{23}$ particles. This is commonly known as the Avogadro's number. Molar mass - this is the mass of one mole of a given substance. The units for molar mass are grams/mole. The molar mass of atoms of any element is equal to the atomic mass in grams.
E.g. 1 mole of sodium weighs 22.99 g .

In molecules (containing more than one elements in the chemical formula), the term molecular mass is used instead of atomic mass. To determine the molecular mass of a molecule, the atomic masses of the elements making up the molecule are added up.
E.g. $\mathrm{CCl}_{4}=1 \mathrm{C}$ atomic mass 12.001 g

4 Cl atomic mass $4(35.4527 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol})$
Total $=153.81 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$.
Therefore, 1 mole of $\mathrm{CCl}_{4}=153.81 \mathrm{~g}$.
To determine the number of moles of a given substance, the amount of that substance (given in grams) is divided by the molar mass of (measured in $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mol}$ ) as shown in the formula below.
$$\frac{\operatorname{mass}(g)}{\text { molar mass }(\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mol})}=(\mathrm{g})\left(\frac{\mathrm{mol}}{\mathrm{~g}}\right)=\mathrm{mol}$$

\section*{Factors affecting reaction rates of chemical reactions}

The reaction rate is the speed at which reactants form products. It is affected by
i) Temperature

Increase in temperature increases rate of reaction. This is due to the increase in kinetic energy which increases the force of colliding molecules such that they are able to easily break the bonds and form new products.
ii) Concentration

Reaction rates increase with concentration as the number of reacting molecules increases therefore increasing the likelihood of collision to form the products.
iii) Catalysts

A catalyst lowers the activation energy (minimum amount of energy that reactant molecules must gain in order to transform to products) which allows for a reaction to take place at a quicker rate.

\section*{UNIT 5: REDOX REACTIONS}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Define various terms as relates to redox reaction
2. List the types of reactions
3. Calculate and determine possible redox reactions

\subsection*{5.1 Definition of Terms}

Oxidation - loss of electrons from atoms of a substance
$\mathrm{Ex}-\mathrm{Na} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-}$
Sodium is oxidized
Reduction - gain of electrons by atoms of a substance
$$\mathrm{Ex}-\mathrm{Cl}_{2}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$$

Chlorine is reduced

Reduced

Oxidizing agent - substance that oxidizes another substance
Reducing agent - substance that reduces another substance by losing electrons

Examples of redox chemistry:
- Silver tarnishing
- Hydrogen peroxide on a wound
- Photography
- Chlorine bleach to whiten laundry

\section*{Oxidation numbers/Oxidation states}

Oxidation number/oxidation state - number of electrons lost or gained by the atom when it forms ions; written with a "+" or "-"sign before the number
In the description of redox reactions, we said that they involve a net change in the atomic/ionic charge (oxidation number changes).

\section*{Rules of assigning oxidation numbers}
1. The oxidation number of an atom is zero in a neutral substance that contains atoms of only one element. Thus, the atoms in $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{O}_{3}, \mathrm{P}_{4}, \mathrm{~S}_{8}$, and aluminum metal all have an oxidation number of 0 .
2. The oxidation number of simple ions is equal to the charge on the ion. The oxidation number of sodium in the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion is +1 , for example, and the oxidation number of chlorine in the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ion is -1 .
3. The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1 when it is combined with a nonmetal as in $\mathrm{CH}_{4}, \mathrm{NH}_{3}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and HCl .
4. The oxidation number of hydrogen is -1 when it is combined with a metal as in. $\mathrm{LiH}, \mathrm{NaH}, \mathrm{CaH}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$.
5. The metals in Group IA form compounds (such as $\mathrm{Li}_{3} \mathrm{~N}$ and $\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ ) in which the metal atom has an oxidation number of +1 .
6. The elements in Group IIA form compounds (such as $\mathrm{Mg}_{3} \mathrm{~N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ ) in which the metal atom has a +2 oxidation number.
7. Oxygen usually has an oxidation number of -2. Exceptions include molecules and polyatomic ions that contain $\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{O}$ bonds, such as $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{O}_{3}$, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$.
8. The elements in Group VIIA often form compounds (such as $\mathrm{AlF}_{3}, \mathrm{HCl}$, and $\mathrm{ZnBr}_{2}$ ) in which the nonmetal has a - 1 oxidation number.
9. The sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is zero e.g. the sum of the oxidation number of all atoms in a molecule e.g. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}=0$. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}: 2(+1)+(-2)=0$
10. The sum of the oxidation numbers in a polyatomic/complex ion is equal to the charge on the ion. The oxidation number of the sulfur atom in the $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$ ion must be +6 , for example, because the sum of the oxidation numbers of the atoms in this ion must equal -2 .
$\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}:(+6)+4(-2)=-2$
11. Elements toward the bottom left corner of the periodic table are more likely to have positive oxidation numbers than those toward the upper right corner of the table. Sulfur has a positive oxidation number in $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$, for example, because it is below oxygen in the periodic table.
$\mathrm{SO}_{2}:(+4)+2(-2)=0$

\section*{The 7 diatomic elements}

Diatomic molecules consist of two atoms bonded together. In contrast, monatomic elements consist of single atoms (e.g., Ar, He). Many compounds are diatomic, such as $\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{NaCl}$, and KBr . There are seven diatomic elements. They are: Hydrogen $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}\right)$, Nitrogen $\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}\right)$, Oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, Fluorine ( $\mathrm{F}_{2}$ ), Chlorine ( $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ ), lodine ( $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ ), Bromine ( $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ ). For ease of remembrance, you say Have No Fear of Ice Cold Beer.

\section*{Common acids}

An acid is that which donates protons/hydrogen ions in a chemical species. An acid accepts electrons i.e. oxidizing agent.
The most common acids include, acetic acid $\left(\mathrm{HC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, hydrochloric acid $(\mathrm{HCL})$, Sulphuric acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)$, nitric acid $\left(\mathrm{HNO}_{3}\right)$, carbonic acid $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$, phosphoric acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)$

\section*{Sample questions for redox reactions}

\section*{What is the oxidation state of chromium in $\mathrm{Cr}^{2+}$ ?}

The oxidation number of monoatomic ions is simply, the charge on the ion. E.g. $\mathrm{Cr}^{2+}$, its oxidation state is +2 (remember to indicate the + sign in front of it).

\section*{What is the oxidation state of chromium in $\mathrm{CrCl}_{3}$ ?}

The oxidation number of a neutral compound is $0 . \mathrm{E} . g^{\mathrm{g}} \mathrm{CrCl}_{3}$. So if we were to find the oxidation state of one of the ions making up the compound, like let's say chromium, the equation would be:
$\mathrm{n}+3(-1)=0$
N.B: chlorine has an oxidation state of -1 from the rules we noted as it is an element in group VII.
And on calculation, the value for $n$ would be +3 .
You will realize that assigning the appropriate + or - sign is important to get the correct value.
What is the oxidation state of chromium in $\mathrm{Cr}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{6} 6^{3+}\right.$ (hexaaquachromium (III) ion)?

This is an ion and so the sum of the oxidation states is equal to the charge on the ion. There is a short-cut for working out oxidation states in complex ions like this where the metal atom is surrounded by electrically neutral molecules like water or ammonia.
The sum of the oxidation states in the attached neutral molecule must be zero. That means that you can ignore them when you do the sum. This would be essentially the same as an unattached chromium ion, $\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}$. The oxidation state is +3 .

\section*{What is the oxidation state of chromium in the dichromate ion, $\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7^{2}}$ ?}

The oxidation state of the oxygen is -2 , and the sum of the oxidation states is equal to the charge on the ion. Don't forget that there are 2 chromium atoms present.
$2 n+7(-2)=-2$
$\mathrm{n}=+6$

\section*{What is the oxidation state of copper in CuSO4?}

The compound contains copper ions and sulphate ions, $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$. To make an electrically neutral compound, the copper must be present as a $2+$ ion. The oxidation state is therefore +2 .

\section*{Using oxidation states}

\section*{1. In naming compounds}

You will have come across names like iron (II) sulphate and iron (III) chloride. The (II) and (III) are the oxidation states of the iron in the two compounds: +2 and +3 respectively. That tells you that they contain $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ions. This can also be extended to the negative ion. Iron (II) sulphate is $\mathrm{FeSO}_{4}$. There is also a compound $\mathrm{FeSO}_{3}$ with the old name of iron (II) sulphite. The modern names reflect the oxidation states of the sulphur in the two compounds.
The sulphate ion is $\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$. The oxidation state of the sulphur is +6 . The ion is more properly called the sulphate $(\mathrm{VI})$ ion.
The sulphite ion is $\mathrm{SO}_{3}{ }^{2-}$. The oxidation state of the sulphur is +4 . This ion is more properly called the sulphate (IV) ion. The 'ate' ending simply shows that the sulphur is in a negative ion.
So $\mathrm{FeSO}_{4}$ is properly called iron (II) sulphate (VI), and $\mathrm{FeSO}_{3}$ is iron (II)
sulphate (IV). In fact, because of the easy confusion between these names, the old names sulphate and sulphite.

3. to determine if a reaction is a redox reaction

\section*{4. to balance chemical equations}

When balancing redox reactions, make sure that the number of electrons lost by the reducing agent equals the number of electrons gained by the oxidizing agent.

Two methods can be used in balancing redox reactions
$\checkmark$ Oxidation number method
In this
- Assign oxidation numbers to all elements in the reaction
- From the changes in O.N., identify the oxidized and reduced species
- Compute the number of electrons lost in the oxidation and gained in the reduction from the O.N. changes
- Multiply one or both of these numbers by appropriate factors to make the electrons lost equal the electrons gained, and use the factors as balancing coefficients
- Complete the balancing by inspection, adding states of matter
e.g.
a) $\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Al}_{2}\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)_{3}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{H}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$
b) $\mathrm{PbS}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{PbO}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{SO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$

Special redox reactions
*Metal reducing another metal.
Write the half-reactions:
$\mathrm{Zn} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{+2}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \quad$ oxidation
$\mathrm{Cu}^{+2}+2 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}$ reduction
The more active the metal, the more easily the metal loses electrons (oxidizes). Electrons flow from the oxidized metal to the reduced metal. Example: Use an arrow to indicate the direction of electron flow in these pairs:
1. $\mathrm{Fe} / \mathrm{Cu}$
2. $\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{Ca}$
3. $\mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{Na}$

Reduction is the gain of electrons.
Reduction potential - the tendency of an object to gain electrons.

\section*{UNIT 6: INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. List the classes of organic compounds and the characteristics of carbon
2. Calculate and determine the empirical and molecular formulae of carbon compounds
3. Give the IUPAC name for various organic compounds Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the study of carbon compounds with the exception of simple compounds e.g. carbonates $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }^{2-}\right)$, carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ and carbon monoxide (CO). Carbon can form more compounds than any other element because carbon atoms are able to form single, double and triple carbon-carbon bonds, but also to link up with each other in chains and ring structures.

\subsection*{6.1 Classes of organic compounds}

They are distinguished according to the functional group they contain. A functional group is a group of atoms that is largely responsible for the chemical behavior of the parent molecule
- Hydrocarbons - These include alkanes, with the general molecular formula $\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n+2}$ where n is an integer; alkenes, represented by $\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n}$; alkynes, represented by $\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n-2}$; and arenes e.g. propane, propene, propyne.
- Halogen substituted alkanes, alkenes and arenes - these include alkyl halides and aryl halides
- Oxygen containing organic compounds - may be divided into two main types: those that contain at least one C-O bond, which include alcohols, phenols (derivatives of benzene), and ethers, and those that contain a carbonyl group ( $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ ), which include aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids e.g. propanone

- Carboxylic acid derivatives - compounds in which the OH of the $-\mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{H}$ functional group is replaced by either an alkoxy (-OR) group, producing an ester, or by an amido (-NRR', where R and $\mathrm{R}^{\prime}$ can be H and/or alkyl groups), forming an amide.
- Nitrogen containing organic compounds - they include amines; nitriles, which have a $\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{N}$ bond; and nitro compounds, which contain the $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ group. The table below show the different classes of organic compounds.

$\checkmark$ Secondary functional groups are given in alphabetical order, with their position along the chain at the beginning of the name. In addition, numbers are used to give the positions of groups or bonds along the chain.

\subsection*{6.2 Characteristics of Carbon}
- It is a member of group 14 on the periodic table, it is nonmetallic and tetravalent i.e. the four electrons are available to form covalent bonds (single, double and triple). These long covalent bonds are strong and stable. This allows carbon to form an infinite number of compounds.
- It is a solid and sublimes at $3,642^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (it has the highest sublimation point of all the elements).
- It exists in different forms i.e. it has several allotropes presenting a wide range of physical properties. E.g. diamond is the hardest naturally occurring substance, is transparent, an electrical insulator and thermal conductor while graphite is one of the softest substances known, is opaque, a good lubricant, a good conductor of electricity and a thermal insulator.
- Carbon has an affinity for bonding with other small atoms including other carbon atoms.
- At standard temperature and pressure, it resists oxidation; it does not react with sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, chlorine, or any alkali metals.
- At higher temperatures, carbon will react with oxygen to give carbon oxides, and metals to give metal carbides.
- It has two stable naturally occurring isotopes: carbon-12 and carbon13. Carbon 12 is the most abundant.

\section*{Calculations of empirical and molecular formulae of carbon} COMPOUNDS

The empirical formula of a compound is defined as the formula that shows the simplest ratio of elements present in the compound, but not the actual numbers of atoms found in the molecule. The ratios are denoted by subscripts next to the element symbols. The most common approach to determining a compound's chemical formula is to first measure the masses of its constituent elements.

\section*{Example}

Glucose has a molecular formula of $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}$. It contains 2 moles of hydrogen for every mole of carbon and oxygen. The empirical formula for glucose is $\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.
The molecular formula of ribose is $\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{10} \mathrm{O}_{5}$, which can be reduced to the empirical formula $\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

\section*{How to determine empirical formula}
1. Begin with the number of grams of each element, which you usually find in an experiment or have given in a problem.
2. To make the calculation easier, assume the total mass of a sample is 100 grams, so you can work with simple percentages. In other words, set the mass of each element equal to its percent. The total should be 100 percent. (assume mass of sample of compound is 100 g )
3. Convert the grams into moles i.e. use the molar mass you get by adding up the atomic weight of the elements from the_periodic table to convert the mass of each element into moles. (determine \# of moles of each element in the compound)
4. Find the mole ratios i.e. divide each mole value by the small number of moles you obtained from your calculation.
5. Round each number you get to the nearest whole number. The whole numbers are the mole ratio of elements in the compound, which are the subscript numbers that follow the element symbol in the chemical formula.
Sometimes determining the whole number ratio is tricky and you'll need to use trial and error to get the correct value. For values close to x.5, you'll
multiply each value by the same factor to obtain the smallest whole number multiple. For example, if you get 1.5 for a solution, multiply each number in the problem by 2 to make the 1.5 into 3 .

If you get a value of 1.25 , multiply each value by 4 to turn the 1.25 into 5 . Consider a sample of compound determined to contain 1.71 g C and 0.287 g $H$. The corresponding numbers of atoms (in moles) are:
$1.71 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{C} x^{\frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} C}{12.01 \mathrm{~g} C}}=0.142 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}$
$0.287 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{H}^{\frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{H}}{1.005 \mathrm{gH}}}=0.284 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{H}$

Thus, we can accurately represent this compound with the formula C 0.142 H 0.248 . Of course, per accepted convention, formulas contain wholenumber subscripts, which can be achieved by dividing each subscript by the smaller subscript: i.e. $\frac{0.248}{0.142}=2$

Therefore, the empirical formula of the compound is thus $\mathrm{CH}_{2}$.
NB: this may or may not be the compound's molecular formula (discussed below).

The empirical formula can also be derived from percent composition

\section*{For example}

The bacterial fermentation of grain to produce ethanol forms a gas with a percent composition of $27.29 \% \mathrm{C}$ and $72.71 \% \mathrm{O}$.
what is the empirical formula for this gas?
At all times, the scale of percentage (derived from the Latin phrase per centum meaning by 100) is 100 . This make calculation more convenient to calculate the mass of elements present in a sample weighing 100 g .

Therefore this sample produces 27.29 grams carbon and 72.71 grams oxygen.

Calculate the number of moles of each atom i.e.
$27.29 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{C}\left(\left(^{\frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}}{12.01 \mathrm{~g}}}\right)=2.272 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}\right.$
$72.71 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{C}\left(\left(^{\frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}}{16.0 \mathrm{~g}}}\right)=4.544 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}\right.$

To determine the tentative empirical formula, divide each of the molar masses by the lesser of the two.
$\frac{4.544 g O}{2.272}=2$
$\frac{2.272 c}{2.272}=1$

Therefore, the tentative empirical formula is $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

\subsection*{6.3 CALCULATION OF MOLECULAR FORMULA FROM EMPIRICAL FORMULA}

Note that the empirical formula gives only the relative numbers of atoms in a substance in the smallest possible ratio while the molecular formula gives the absolute/actual number of atoms of each kind present per molecule. Calculation of molecular formula from empirical formula involves multiplying the subscripts in the empirical formula by a number of formula units ( $n$ ). $n$ is derived from comparing the molecular mass of a given compound (usually provided in a problem) with its empirical formula mass. i.e.
```
molecular mass
empririacl formula mass }=\textrm{n}\mathrm{ (number of formula units)
```

\section*{Example 1}

Calculate the molecular formula of caffeine, a compound found in coffee, tea, and cola drinks that has a marked stimulatory effect on mammals. The chemical analysis of caffeine shows that it
contains $49.18 \%$ carbon, $5.39 \%$ hydrogen, $28.65 \%$ nitrogen, and $16.68 \%$ oxygen by mass, and its experimentally determined molar mass is 196 $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mol}$.
Step 1 Determine the empirical formula of caffeine. Begin by dividing the mass of each element in 100.0 g of caffeine ( 49.18 g of carbon, 5.39 g of hydrogen, 28.65 g of nitrogen, 16.68 g of oxygen) by its molar mass. This gives the number of moles of each element in 100 g of caffeine.
$$\begin{array}{rlr}
\text { moles } C & =49.18 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{C} \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}}{12.011 \mathrm{gC}} & =4.095 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C} \\
\text { moles } H & =5.93 \mathrm{~g} H \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{H}}{1.0079 \mathrm{gH}} & =5.35 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{H} \\
\text { moles } N & =28.65 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~N} \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{H}}{14.0067 \mathrm{gH}} & =2.045 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{~N} \\
\text { moles } O & =16.68 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{O} \frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{C}}{15.9994 \mathrm{gO}} & =1.043 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{O}
\end{array}$$

Then obtain the relative number of atoms of each element present in the least amount i.e.
$$o: \frac{1.043}{1.043}=1.000 \quad C: \frac{4.095}{1.043}=3.926 \quad H: \frac{5.35}{1.043}=5.13 \quad N: \frac{2.045}{1.043}=1.960$$

Round to the nearest integer to get the empirical formula as $\mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ To determine the number of formula units ( n ) to multiply the subscripts of the empirical formula with to get the molecular formula, divide the measured molar mass of caffeine ( $196 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$ ) with the calculated empirical formula mass (calculated by adding the atomic masses of the individual elements) as below
$$\frac{196 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}}{97.096 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{C}_{4} H_{5} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}=2.02 \approx 2 C_{4} H_{5} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$

So the molecular formula for caffeine is $\left(\mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right) 2=\mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{10} \mathrm{~N}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{2}$

\section*{SAMPLE QUESTIONS}
1. Caffeine has the following percent composition: carbon $49.48 \%$, hydrogen $5.19 \%$, oxygen $16.48 \%$ and nitrogen $28.85 \%$. Its molecular weight is $194.19 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}$. What is its molecular formula?
The empirical formula:
Carbon: $49.98 \mathrm{~g} \div 12.011 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}=4.16$
Hydrogen: $5.19 \mathrm{~g} \div 1.008 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}=5.15$
Nitrogen: $28.85 \mathrm{~g} \div 14.007 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}=2.06$
Oxygen: $16.48 \mathrm{~g} \div 15.999 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}=1.03$
Carbon: $4.16 \div 1.03=4.04=4$
Hydrogen: $5.15 \div 1.03=5$
Nitrogen: $2.06 \div 1.03=2$
Oxygen: $1.03 \div 1.03=1$
The empirical formula is therefore, $\mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.
The molecular formula
$\frac{\text { molecular mass }}{\text { empririacl formula mass }}=\mathrm{n}$ (number of formula units) $=^{\frac{194.19 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}}{97.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}}}=2$ (approx.)

The molecular formula is therefore, $\mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{10} \mathrm{~N}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{2}$
2. What are the empirical and molecular formulas for a compound with $86.88 \%$ carbon and $13.12 \%$ hydrogen and a molecular weight of about 345 ?

4. Many compounds have the empirical formula of CH 2 O . Here are the molecular weights of three:
1) 30.0

\section*{UNIT 7: HOMOLOGOUS SERIES}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Define the term homologous series
2. Determine the characteristics of homologous series
3. Draw the structure of functional groups
4. Identify the types of isomerism

\subsection*{7.1 Definition}

A homologous series is a group of organic chemical compounds that have a similar structure but only differing from each other by the number of $\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ units in the main/longest carbon chain.

\subsection*{7.2 Characteristics of a homologous series}
i) All members of the series can be represented by a general formula. The table below shows the common types of hydrocarbons and their general formula.

Alkanes
$\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{n}} \mathrm{H}_{2 \mathrm{n}+2}$
Alkenes
$\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n}$
Alkynes
$\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n-2}$
Halogen substituted alkanes, alkenes and arenes e.g. $\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n+1} \mathrm{Br}$ bromoalkene
Alcohols (oxygen containing organic compounds) $\quad \mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n+1} \mathrm{OH}$
Aldehydes (oxygen containing organic compounds)

Amines (nitrogen containing organic compounds)
Amides (carboxylic acid derivatives)
$\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n} \mathrm{O}_{2}$

Nitriles
$\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{n}} \mathrm{H}_{2 \mathrm{n}+1} \mathrm{NH}_{2}$
* n represents the number of carbon atoms in the chain.
* Note that in some cases the minimum value of the number of carbons in the chain $(n)$ is greater than $1(n>1)$. For example, ethene ( 2 carbons) is the smallest alkene and ethanenitrile ( 2 carbons) is the smallest nitrile
ii) All members of a series can be prepared by the same general methods.
iii) Organic compounds that are part of the same homologous series generally have similar chemical properties as each other, due to the presence of the same functional group in the molecules of all compounds in the series.
Even though members of the same homologous series generally have similar chemical properties there may still be trends through the group (e.g. as reactivity and rates of reaction vary with parameters such as molecular weights).
iv) Physical properties of homologous show a gradual change in the series with the increase in molecular weight due to the progression of sizes. E.g. the boiling point of ethane is higher than that of methane because the molecules of ethane have more Van der

Waals forces (intermolecular forces) with neighbouring molecules than is for methane.

\subsection*{7.3 Structure and bonding of functional groups}

As mentioned earlier, functional groups are structural units within organic compounds that are defined by specific bonding arrangements between specific atoms. Most of them are composed of the elements from the upper right hand portion of the periodic table i.e. C, H, N, O, S or Halogens (elements in group VII of the periodic table). Importance of functional groups
$\checkmark$ They determine the chemical behaviour of a given compound.
$\checkmark$ They also play an important role in organic compound nomenclature Atoms of a functional group are linked together and the rest of the compound by covalent bonds. The structural features $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}, \mathrm{OH}$, $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$, and Con are the functional groups of alkenes, alkynes, carbonyl compounds, alcohols, amines, and nitriles, respectively. The skeletal formulae of select functional groups are as shown below:

\section*{Functional group}

\hline Alkene & Unsaturated hydrocarbon i.e there is one or more carbon carbon double bond along the main C chain. \\
\hline Alkyne & Unsaturated hydrocarbon i.e. $\mathrm{RC} \equiv \mathrm{CR}$ there is a triple carbon bond along the main C chain. \\
\hline Ether & Contains an oxygen atom bonded to two hydrocarbon groups. \\
\hline Nitrile & Have a triple bond between R-C $\equiv \mathrm{N}$ C and N . \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

NB: the ' $R$ ' group is a symbol commonly used to indicate a C chain without specifying the exact length, especially when we are interested in something that is occurring specifically at one location on the molecule (in this case, the functional groups in organic compounds).
$R_{1}$ is written to indicate that $R$ and $R_{1}$ may not necessarily be the same.

\subsection*{7.4 Types of isomerism}

Structural isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different
structural formula, i.e. their atoms are bonded in different ways. They differ in physical properties, e.g. boiling points. For example, ethyl alcohol and dimethyl ether have the same molecular formula of $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6} \mathrm{O}$ by they differ in structural formula as given below:

Butane ------ Methylpropane
The naming system explained on page 20-21 is known as the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) system. The IUPAC names to distinguish between structural isomers of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and halogenoalkanes containing up to six carbon atoms are required.

Types of structural isomerism
1. Chain or skeletal isomerism

Compounds having the same molecular formula but different structures of their carbon chain are called chain isomers.
2. Functional isomerism

Compounds having same molecular formula but different position of their functional groups. E.g. 1-butene, 2-butene.
3. Functional isomerism

Compounds having same molecular formula but different functional groups. E.g. $\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{6} \mathrm{O}$ (propanone and propanal).
4. Metamerism

Compounds having same molecular formula but different alkyl groups attached same multivalent central atom.

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Define the term hydrocarbon and list the types of hydrocarbons
2. Give the nomenclature of various hydrocarbons
3. State the chemical reactions of hydrocarbons

\subsection*{8.1 Definition of Terms}

Hydrocarbons: a compound of hydrogen and carbon, such as any of those which are the chief components of petroleum and natural gas

\subsection*{8.2 Types of hydrocarbons}
1. Alkanes- with general formula $\mathrm{CnH}(2 \mathrm{n}+2)$ where n is the no. Of carbon atoms. These contain only single bonds or what u call as sigma bonds.
During their nomenclature suffix "ane" is used. These are called *Saturated* hydrocarbons.
2. Alkenes- with general formula $\mathrm{CnH}(2 n)$. These contain atleast 1 double bond i.e. one sigma and a pi bond. Suffix "ene".
3. Alkynes- with general formula $\mathrm{CnH}(2 \mathrm{n}-2)$. Contain atleast one triple bond i.e one sigma and 2 pi bonds. Suffix "yne"
1.3 nomenclature of hydrocarbons

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has established rules to systematize the naming of hydrocarbon molecules. A brief summary of those rules is presented here.
1. Straight-chain hydrocarbon molecules that contain only singly-bonded carbons are called alkanes. When naming these molecules, the final syllable in their name is "ane."
2. Straight-chain hydrocarbon molecules that contain at least one doublybonded carbon are called alkenes. When naming these molecules, the final syllable in their name is "ene."
3. Straight-chain hydrocarbon molecules that contain at least one triplybonded carbon are called alkynes. When naming these molecules, the final syllable in their name is "yne."
4. Prefixes are attached to the last syllable to indicate the number of carbons in the hydrocarbon chain. The IUPAC prefixes for the first twelve carbon chain lengths are:
\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
meth eth & prop & but & pent & hex \\
7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12
\end{tabular}
hept oct non dec undec dodec
5. Alkenes and alkynes with hydrocarbon chain lengths of four or greater require a numbering scheme to the chain to designate the location of the multiple bond. The rules regarding this numbering scheme are:
a. The numbering system begins at the end of the molecule nearest the location of the multiple bond.
b. The number in the name is assigned relative to the carbon in the chain where the multiple bond begins.
c. A number is included for each multiple bond in the chain. The numbers are separated by commas.
d. A dash connects the number locations to the hydrocarbon name.
e. Prefixes are added to the "ene" or "yne" final syllable when more than 1 multiple bond is present. The first few prefixes for these are:
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8
\end{tabular}

di tri tetr pent hex hept oct
6. For ring hydrocarbons (excluding aromatics such as benzene), attach "cyclo" as the first syllable.

Examples
hexane 1-butene

2-pentyne 1,3-cyclohexadiene

\subsection*{8.4 Chemical reactions of hydrocarbons}

Hydrocarbons are compounds that only contain carbon and hydrogen. Hydrocarbons can be classified further by the type of bonds they contain. If a hydrocarbon contains only single bonds, it is an alkane. If it contains one or more carbon-carbon double bonds, it is classified as an alkene. If it contains one or more triple bonds between two carbon atoms, it is an alkyne. If it contains a benzene ring, it is considered aromatic. (If it does not contain a benzene ring, it is aliphatic. Therefore, alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes are all aliphatic hydrocarbons.) These types of compounds react in different ways, so it is possible to distinguish between them using experimental tests.

\section*{Combustion}

All hydrocarbons will burn in the presence of oxygen (in the air). This reaction is called combustion, and the products of this reaction are water and carbon dioxide gas. Here is an example of a combustion reaction:
$\mathrm{C} 3 \mathrm{H} 8(\mathrm{~g})+5 \mathrm{O} 2(\mathrm{~g})$
$3 \mathrm{CO} 2(\mathrm{~g})+4 \mathrm{H} 2 \mathrm{O}$
(g) + heat

Combustion reactions also give off a great deal of heat. Because of this, many hydrocarbons are used as fuels. Some examples are methane (natural gas), propane, butane, and octane. If there is not an excess of oxygen present during the combustion, then undesirable products are also formed. Carbon monoxide (CO) is an example of an undesirable product of incomplete combustion. This compound is toxic.

\section*{Halogenation}

All hydrocarbons can be halogenated under certain conditions. Alkanes are very unreactive, but they can be brominated or chlorinated in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light. This is a substitution reaction in which a hydrogen is removed from the alkane and a halogen ( Br or Cl ) takes its place. The halogen atom can substitute at any site on the molecule. Furthermore, the halogenated products can react further to give di-substituted or trisubstituted products (and so on). This reaction is therefore not at all selective, and mixtures of many products will result.

Alkenes and alkynes are much more reactive than alkanes. They will react readily with Br 2 or Cl 2 , and ultraviolet light is not needed for the reaction. This reaction is an addition reaction - the halogen atoms will add at the site of the double bond only. Therefore, this reaction is selective- only one product will result.

Aromatic compounds are not very reactive. They will not react with Br 2 or Cl 2 under normal conditions. If the aromatic compound has an alkyl substituent, however, the alkyl group can be halogenated in the presence of UV light. The benzene ring will not react under these conditions.

\section*{H2 UV light}
$\mathrm{CH} 3+\mathrm{Br} 2 \mathrm{CH} 3+\mathrm{HBr}$
or heat

In this experiment, the bromination of several compounds will be attempted. A solution containing bromine will be added to the compounds being tested. The bromine has an orange or brown color. If this color disappears, it means that the bromine is getting used up and therefore the compound is reacting with the bromine. Thus, disappearance of the orange color corresponds to a positive reaction.

Oxidation
Another reaction that alkenes undergo is oxidation. When a purple solution of the oxidizing agent KMnO 4 is added to an alkene, the alkene is oxidized to a diol and the KMnO 4 is converted to brown MnO 2 . Thus, if the purple color changes to brown in this reaction, it is a positive reaction. The diol produced has two adjacent alcohol groups.

Alkanes and aromatic compounds do not react with potassium permanganate

\section*{UNIT 9: ALCOHOLS (ALKANOLS)}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit the learner should be able to:
1. Define some terms as used in alcohols
2. Describe methods of alcohol preparations
3. State the chemical properties of alcohol
4. Highlight the uses of alcohol

\subsection*{9.1 Definitions of Terms}

Alcohols are compounds in which one or more hydrogen atoms in an alkane have been replaced by an -OH group. For example:

Alcohols fall into different classes depending on how the -OH group is positioned on the chain of carbon atoms.

\subsection*{9.2 Methods of Preparation}

There are various methods and ways to prepare alcohols in industries and laboratories. Let's learn about these one-by-one below.
1) Hydrolysis of Alkyl Halides

This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The method is not a very effective one. This is because it has as olefins as by-products. ion.
R-X $+\mathrm{KOHaq} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{OH}$
2) Oxymercuration and Demercuration of Alkanes

Alkenes react with mercuric acetate in presence of H 2 O and tetrahydrofuran to give alkyl mercury compounds. This is one of the most common types of methods to prepare alcohols.
3) Preparation of Alcohols from Grignard Reagent

We can obtain the three types of monohydric alcohols (primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols) by using Grignard reagents and carbonyl compounds. The addition of RMgX on carbonyl compounds, along with hydrolysis gives

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
us alcohols. The Grignard reagent is basically an organometallic compound. Let us look at this reaction in greater detail as it is a very important reaction.
When we allow a solution of an alkyl halide in dry ethyl ether, (C2H5)O to stand overturnings of metallic magnesium, we witness a vigorous reaction. We can see that the solution turns cloud and begins to boil. The magnesium metal gradually disappears. The resulting solution is the Grignard reagent. $\mathrm{CH} 3 \mathrm{I}+\mathrm{Mg} \quad \mathrm{CH} 3 \mathrm{MgI}$
$\mathrm{H} 3 \mathrm{CH} 2 \mathrm{Br}+\mathrm{Mg}$
Ethyl bromide
CH 3 CH 2 MgBr
Ethylmagnesium bromide
The Grignard reagent has the general formula R MgX, and the general name alkyl magnesium halide.
4) Reduction of Carbonyl Compounds

We can also get alcohols by the reduction of aldehydes and ketones. We can reduce aldehydes to primary alcohols and ketones to secondary alcohols. This process can take place by the catalytic hydrogenation or by the use of chemical reducing agents like lithium aluminium hydride, LiAlH4. Such reduction techniques find an important place in the preparation of certain alcohols that are less available than the corresponding carbonyl compounds. What we must note here is that Sodium borohydride, NaBH 4 , does not reduce carbon-carbon double bonds, not even those conjugated with carbonyl groups.
5) Reduction of Acids to Alcohols

Lithium aluminium hydride, LiAlH4, is one of the few reagents that can reduce an acid to an alcohol.
$4 \mathrm{RCOOH}+3 \mathrm{LiAlH} 4 \rightarrow 4 \mathrm{RCH} 2 \mathrm{OH} \quad$ loalcohol
Because of the excellent yields it gives, LiAlH4 is a common ingredient in the laboratory for the reduction of not only acids but many other classes of compounds.
6) Other Methods of Preparation of Alcohols
- By the Action of Nitrous Acid on Primary Amines
$\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH} 2+\mathrm{HNO} 2 \rightarrow \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{N} 2+\mathrm{H} 2 \mathrm{O}$
However, under similar conditions, CH 3 NH 2 gives $\mathrm{CH} 3-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{N}=\mathrm{O}$ or CH 3 OCH 3
$\mathrm{CH} 3 \mathrm{NH} 2+2 \mathrm{HNO} 2 \rightarrow \mathrm{CH} 3-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{N}=\mathrm{O}+2 \mathrm{H} 2 \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{N} 2$
$\mathrm{OR} 2 \mathrm{CH} 3 \mathrm{NH} 2+2 \mathrm{HNO} 2 \rightarrow \mathrm{CH} 3 \mathrm{OCH} 3+2 \mathrm{~N} 2+3 \mathrm{H} 2 \mathrm{O}$
- By Fermentation

Fermentation is the slow decomposition of complex organic compounds into simpler organic compounds by the activity of enzymes. Enzymes are complex, nitrogenous (proteins), non-living macromolecules of high molecular weight. We usually get these enzymes from living organisms. This process is usually followed by the evolution of gases like CO2 \& CH4. They release a lot of energy and are exothermic in nature. The alcoholic fermentation involves the conversion of sugar into ethyl alcohol by yeast.

\subsection*{9.3 Chemical Reactions of Alcohols}

Alcohols are versatile organic compounds since they undergo a wide variety of transformations - the majority of which are either oxidation or reduction type reactions.
Normally: Oxidation is a loss of electrons; Reduction is a gain of electrons. But in organic terms:
Oxidation: loss of H 2 ; addition of O or O 2 ; addition of X 2 (halogens).
Reduction: addition of H 2 or H -; loss of O or O 2 ; loss of X 2 .
(Neither an oxidation nor reduction: Addition or loss of $\mathrm{H}+, \mathrm{H} 2 \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{HX}$ ).

\subsection*{9.4 Uses of Alcohols}
1. Used as an ingredient in alcoholic beverages e.g. wine and beer
2. Used to produce methylated spirit (meth)

Methylated spirit is ethanol mixed with small amounts of methanol, which is poisonous, making it unfit for consumption. Methylated spirit is combustible so it can be used in lamps and stoves, especially those made for camping. Methylated spirit is used to remove ink from non-porous surfaces. E.g. removing permanent ink from various kinds of surfaces, such as metals and

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
plastics. Methylated spirit is used as a component of household cleaning products, usually glass cleaners.
3. Used as a fuel

Ethanol burns cleanly to form carbon dioxide and water. Using ethanol as fuel does not contribute much to pollution. Ethanol is usually mixed with gasoline to produce 'gasohol', which is about 10-20\% ethanol. Using ethanol as a fuel reduces our reliance on natural fossil fuels such as petrol. 4. Used as a solvent

Ethanol is commonly used as an organic solvent to dissolve organic compounds which are insoluble in water. E.g. used in cosmetics such as perfumes; used in medicines such as disinfectants; used in toiletries such as after-shave lotions. Advantages of ethanol as a solvent is that it is volatile, colourless and has a relatively high boiling point of $78^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. It is also miscible in both water and other organic solvents.

\section*{UNIT 10: CARBONYL COMPOUNDS}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Identify structures of carbonyl compounds and their reactions
2. State the methods of preparing carbonyl compounds

\subsection*{10.1 Definition of Carbonyl}

Carbonyl compounds are molecules containing the carbonyl group, $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$. They include the carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acid derivatives (e.g. esters, amides). The simplest carbonyl compounds are aldehydes and ketones. A ketone has two alkyl (aryl) groups bonded to the carbonyl carbon whereas an aldehyde has one alkyl (aryl) group and one hydrogen atom bonded to the carbonyl carbon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-068.jpg?height=110&width=383&top_left_y=1341&top_left_x=269)

<smiles>[R]C([R])=O</smiles>

NB: An alkyl group is derived from an alkane i.e. it is an alkane with a hydrogen atom missing from its chain. The smallest alkyl group is methyl $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)$ group derived from methane $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{4}\right)$. An aryl group is derived from benzene which contains an aromatic ring. A hydrogen atom is missing from the compound allowing it to get attached to a carbon chain. For the purposes of this course, we shall ignore the aryl group.
Ketones are named by replacing the -e ending of the alkyl name with -one (alkane to alkanone).
E.g.
<smiles>CCC(C)=O</smiles>
old IUPAC names in blue: new IUPAC names in green:

2 -bulanone

<smiles>CC(C)C(C)(C)C(C)C</smiles>
2.4dimethyl 3 pentianome

2,4-dimethyperian-3one

Aldehydes has to be at the end of a chain, and while naming, it is carbon number 1 . They are named by replacing -e with -al (alkane to alkanal).

\section*{$\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CHO}$ \\ pent-2 2 enal}
E.g.

The wide spread usage of carbonyl compounds means many common names are entrenched in their everyday use. E.g. acetone for propanone, formaldehyde for methanal.
Three of the four bases which comprise DNA i.e. guanine, thymine and cytosine contain carbonyl groups.

\section*{Properties of aldehydes and ketones}

\section*{Physical properties}
- They are polar molecules because the $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ bond has a dipole moment (there is a separation of charge).
- They have lower boiling points than alcohols of similar molecular weights but higher than those of alkenes of similar molecular weight.
- They have considerable solubility in water.

\section*{Chemical properties}

The reactions of the carbonyl group fall into three main categories
1. Reactions with acids
2. Addition reactions
3. Oxidation reactions

\section*{Preparation of aldehydes and ketones}

Ketones and aldehydes can be prepared through many reactions. Below are examples of some of the ways to prepare aldehydes and ketones.

\section*{Hydration of alkynes}

This can be achieved with Markonikov (acid and mercury (II) catalyzed reaction)

\section*{From alcohols}

Secondary alcohols are readily oxidized to ketones by $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$. Aldehydes are made from the oxidation of primary alcohols.
In Biochemistry you'll learn that the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde is the $1^{\text {st }}$ step in the liver's processing of ingested alcohol. Aldehydes are chemically reactive. E.g. acetaldehyde can react with proteins of the body and is fairly toxic accounting for some of the side effects of excessive drinking.

\section*{UNIT 11: CARBOXYLIC ACIDS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of this unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Name carboxylic acids and derivatives
2. State the methods of preparing carboxylic acids and their chemical reactions

\subsection*{11.1 Introduction}

The general molecular formula of this series can be represented as $\mathrm{CnH}_{2} \mathrm{nO}_{2}$. The carboxylic acids contain both the carbonyl group ( $\mathrm{C}=0$ ) and hydroxyl group ( -OH ). In this section we shall try to understand the ways that carboxylic acids, which possess the - COOH functional group, are similar to and different from alcohols, which have the - OH group, and aldehydes and ketones, which have $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ bonds. Many carboxylic acids have trivial names and are often referred to as 'fatty acids' which refers to the naturally occurring straight chain saturated and unsaturated aliphatic acids. E.g. palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic and linoleic acids.

The simplest carboxylic acids are methanoic/formic acid $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{2} \mathrm{H}\right)$ and ethanoic/acetic $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{H}\right)$ acid.
Physical properties of carboxylic acids
$\checkmark$ They have substantially higher melting and boiling points relative to alcohols, aldehydes or ketones.
$\checkmark$ They are soluble in water

\subsection*{11.2 Chemical properties of carboxylic acids}
i) Acidic behaviour

Ethanoic acid is a weak acid that is slightly ionized in dilute solution.
Presence of hydrogen ions $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$gives the solution acidic behavior and therefore:

It turns blue litmus red
Forms a salt when reacted with a base.

It liberates carbon dioxide to form carbonate.
ii) Reaction with chlorine

In the presence of light, ethanoic acid reacts with $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ to form monochloroethanoic acid and hydrogen chloride gas.

Sunlight
$\mathrm{Cl}_{\text {(g) }}+\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}_{(1)} \rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{ClCOOH}_{(1)}+\mathrm{HCL}_{(g)}$
iii) Esterification

When carboxylic acids react with alcohols in the presence of an acid, an ester is formed. This process is referred to as esterification. Water is produced in the reaction. The reaction can be generally represented as below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-072.jpg?height=198&width=1316&top_left_y=1099&top_left_x=266)

\subsection*{11.3 Preparation of carboxylic acids}

They can be prepared by application of several methods.
E.g. By oxidation of aldehydes or alcohols
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-072.jpg?height=169&width=1058&top_left_y=1566&top_left_x=290)

Alcohol $\rightarrow$ aldehyde $\rightarrow$ carboxylic acid
A large number of oxidizing agents are used for these conversions e.g. potassium permanganate, $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ and potassium dichromate, $\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}$.

\section*{Carboxylic acid derivatives}

The combination of other functional groups with carbonyl group leads to the formation of
carboxylic acid derivatives. They include acyl chlorides, anhydrides, esters and acid amides.

\section*{UNIT 12: ALKYL HALIDES}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of this unit, the learner should be able to:
1. state the nomenclature of the halides
2. identify the methods of preparing alkyl halides and their chemical reactions

\subsection*{12.1 Nomenclature of alkyl halides}

Also known as halogenalkanes. Alkyl halides are derived from alkanes by exchanging hydrogen for halogen (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Depending on the degree of substitution at the carbon atom carrying the halogen, alkyl halides are classified into primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl halides. In primary alkyl halides, the carbon which carries the halogen is only attached to one other alkyl group.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-073.jpg?height=388&width=1183&top_left_y=1362&top_left_x=273)

X represents the halogen ( $\mathrm{F}, \mathrm{Cl}, \mathrm{Br}$ or I ). The name of the halogen is followed by the name of the alkane, for example, iodomethane and chloromethane. If an alkyl halide contains more than one halogen, the halogen names are noted in alphabetical order, such as 1-chloro-2-iodobutane.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-074.jpg?height=58&width=638&top_left_y=269&top_left_x=575)

\section*{UNIT 13: SOLUTIONS AND CONCENTRATIONS Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Define terms as used in solutions and concentrations
2. Outline on the steps of preparing various solutions and their concentrations

\subsection*{13.1 Definition of terms}

Solute - this is a substance that dissolves in a solvent
Solvent - a substance which dissolves another to form a solution. For example, in a sugar and water solution, water is the solvent; sugar is the solute.
Solution - A mixture of two or more pure substances. In a solution one pure substance is dissolved in another pure substance homogenously. For example, in a sugar and water solution, the solution has the same concentration throughout, i.e. It is homogenous.
Mole - it is a unit of mass (like a "dozen" to a baker) used by chemists. This term refers to a large number of elementary particles (atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, etc) of any substance. 1 mole is $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ molecules of that substance. (Avogadro's number).M

\subsection*{13.2 Preparation of Solutions}

A solution is a homogenous mixture of two or more substances i.e.
components are uniformly mixed. When a solute is dissolved in a solvent, a solution is formed. The solute is the substance present in a smaller amount, and the solvent is the substance present in a larger amount. A solution may be gaseous (air), solid (alloy) or liquid (seawater).
For the purposes of this course, we shall discuss aqueous solutions in which the solute initially is a liquid or a solid and the solvent is water. All solutes
that dissolve in water fit into two categories: electrolytes and nonelectrolytes.
Electrolytes is a substance that when dissolved in water, results in a solution that can conduct electricity. Whereas nonelectrolyte does not conduct electricity when dissolved in water. E.g. NaCl is an electrolyte since it conducts electricity. Electrodes connected to a light bulb are immersed in in a beaker of the solution is a method used to distinguish between electrolytes and nonelectrolytes. The brightness of the light bulb helps distinguish between strong and weak electrolytes. Strong electrolytes include sodium chloride, potassium iodide, and calcium nitrate. The human body contains many strong and weak electrolytes. Acids and bases are also electrolytes e.g. HCl and $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ are strong electrolytes. These acids are said to ionize completely in water i.e. forms ions of the compound.
Although water is electronically neutral, it has a positive region (hydrogen atoms) and a negative region (oxygen atoms) therefore making it an effective solvent for ionic compounds.

\section*{Types of Solutes}
$\checkmark$ Soluble/Hydrophilic molecules - molecules that contain polar groups that can form hydrogen bond with water are said to be soluble in water.
$\checkmark$ Insoluble/Hydrophobic molecules - non-polar molecules that do not dissolve in water e.g. oils
$\checkmark$ Slightly soluble/Amphipathic molecules - are molecules that contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts.

\section*{Types of solutions}

Solutions can be categorized depending on:
i) Original states of the solution components i.e. gas, liquid or solid.

Gas + gas = gas (air)
Gas + liquid $=$ liquid $\left(\right.$ soda water $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right.$ in water) $)$
Gas + solid $=$ solid ( $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas in palladium)
Liquid + liquid $=$ liquid (ethanol in water)

Solid + liquid $=$ liquid $(\mathrm{NaCl}$ in water $)$
Solid + solid $=$ solid (Brass ( $\mathrm{Zn} / \mathrm{Cu}$ )). But for the purposes of this course, we shall only concentrate on solutions that involve at least one liquid.
ii) Capacity to dissolve a solute

In this category, there are three types i.e.
a) Unsaturated - this contains less solute than it has the capacity to dissolve.
b) Saturated - contains the maximum amount of a solute that will dissolve in a given solvent at a specific temperature.
c) Super-saturated - it contains more solute than is present in a saturated solution. It not stable and in time will come out of a supersaturated solution as crystals.

NB: Crystallization is the process in which dissolved solute comes out of a solution and forms crystals.

\section*{Concentration of solutions}

This refers to the amount of solute present in a given amount of solvent, or a given amount of solution. It can be expressed as,

Concentration $=\frac{\text { amount of solute }}{\text { amount of solution }}$.

In most cases, you will hear a solution referred to as dilute or concentrated. E.g. concentrated and dilute orange juice. A dilute solution is one that contains a relatively small amount of the solute in a given volume of solvent. A concentrated solution on the other hand contains a relatively large amount of the solute in the same volume of solvent.

In the laboratory and also in everyday use, the concentration of various solutions can be expressed/represented in many different ways. The most common concentration units are as below:
1. Mass percent/parts per hundred/percent by mass (\%)
(Mass of solute/mass of solution) X 100
2. Molarity - This refers to the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. It is expressed as M or molar. The volume of solution in calculating molarity must always be in liters.
To calculate molarity, the following equation is used
Molarity $(M)=\frac{\text { moles of solute }}{\text { liters of solution }}$
Moles of solute/liter of solution $=\mathrm{mol} . / \mathrm{L}$ or M .
Examples
a) If 5 liters of water is added to two moles of glucose to make a solution, the concentration (molarity) is said to be 0.4 M
$M=\frac{m o l}{L}, x=\frac{2}{5}$, so, $\mathrm{x}=0.4 \mathrm{M}$ or 0.4 molar
b) What is the molarity of 600 ml of potassium iodide solution that contains 5.50 moles of the solute?
$M=\frac{m o l}{L}, x=\frac{5.5}{0.6}$, so, $\mathrm{x}=9.16 \mathrm{M}$ or 9.16 molar
c) Laundry bleach used in many households is a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite ( NaClO ). How many moles of solute are present in 1.5 L of 0.70 M NaClO ?
$M=\frac{\text { mol }}{L}, 0.7=\frac{x}{1.5}$, so, $\mathrm{x}=1.05 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{NaClO}$
Additional concentration units/expressions are as shown in the table below:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ Expression } & Symbol & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ Definition } \\
\hline Molarity & M, c & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Moles (gram molecular weights) of solute in 1 liter \\

\hline Molality & m & Moles of solute in 1000 gm of solvent. \\
\hline Normality & N & \begin{tabular}{l}

\hline Mole Fraction & x & \begin{tabular}{l}

\end{tabular}

\subsection*{13.3 Colligative properties of solutions}

A colligative property is a property of a solution that depends upon the number of solute particles and not upon their identity (or properties of solutions that depend on the number of the solute particles, and not on the nature/identity/type of solute particles).

The four important colligative properties of solutions are as below. There is a direct relationship between the concentration of a solution (number of solute particles) and the effect recorded in regard to the colligative properties.
i) Vapor-pressure lowering - The vapor pressure of a solvent in a solution is always lower than the vapor pressure of the pure solvent.
ii) Boiling-point elevation - this refers to the difference between the boiling point of a solution and the boiling point of the pure solvent.
iii) Freezing-point depression - this refers to the difference in temperature between the freezing point of a solution and the freezing point of the pure solvent.
iv) Osmotic pressure - osmosis is the process by which solvent molecules move through membrane from more solvent (lower concentration) into side with less solvent (higher concentration).

\subsection*{13.4 SOLUBILITY}

It is referred to as the maximum amount of solute that will dissolve in a given quantity of solvent at a specific temperature and pressure. As mentioned earlier, substances may be classified as either soluble, insoluble or slightly soluble. Solubility is used to predict whether a precipitate will form when one compound is added to a solution. Below is a table showing some solubility rules commonly applied in chemistry

\section*{Soluble compounds}

ions ( $\mathrm{Li}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Rb}^{+}, \mathrm{Cs}^{+}$) and ammonium ion $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\right)$

Nitrates $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right)$, acetates $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}\right)$,

\section*{Soluble exceptions}

Compounds containing alkali metal ions and the ammonium ion e.g. NaOH Compounds containing alkali metal ions and the $\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ ion.

\section*{Factors affecting solubility}
i) Nature of solute and solvent/molecular structure

Polar and ionic solutes are soluble in polar solvents while nonpolar solutes are soluble in nonpolar solvents. "Like dissolves like".

\section*{ii) Temperature}
E.g. In ionic solids, solubility increases as temperature increases and the solubility of gases decreases as temperature increases e.g. warm soda goes flat.
iii) Pressure

For solids/liquids, change in temperature does not change solubility. In gases however, increase in pressure leads to increase in solubility. (Henry's Law).

\section*{UNIT 14: GASES}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of this unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Define gas laws
2. State the application of Graham's law of diffusion to nutrition and dietetics

\subsection*{14.1 Definition of terms}

1 atm - this is the standard atmospheric pressure which is equal to 760 mmHg or 760 torr.
Kelvin
Absolute zero - this is the lowest attainable temperature i.e. $-273^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ on the Celsius scale or 0 K on the Kelvin temperature scale.
Ideal gas is defined in which interactions between molecules are nonexistent and volume occupied by molecules is zero.
Elements that exist as gases include 5 of the diatomic molecules i.e. $\mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{~N}_{2}$, $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{~F}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, the oxygen allotrope ozone ( $\mathrm{O}_{3}$ ) and the group 8A monoatomic gases (collectively referred to as noble gases) i.e. He (Helium), Ne (Neon), Ar (Argon), Kr (Krypton), Xe (Xenon) and Rn (Radon).
Several compounds also exist as gases in room temperature e.g. methane, carbon IV oxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen sulfide etc.

\section*{Physical properties of gases}
1. Gases are always miscible
2. Gases assume the volume and shape of the containers
3. Gases are the most compressible of the states of matter
4. Gases will mix evenly and completely when confined to the same container
5. Gases have much lower densities than liquids and solids

\section*{Pressure of a Gas}

Gases exert pressure on any surface with which they come in contact since gas molecules are constantly in motion.
A classic demonstration of atmospheric pressure: how are we able to drink a liquid through a straw?
a drinking straw works by decreasing the air pressure inside the straw (when we such thro it), the atmospheric pressure acting on the surface of the liquid which is now greater than that in the straw forces the liquid to rise up in the straw.
The diagram illustrates this concept.

Pressure can be defined as force per unit area. F/A. It is one of the most readily measureable properties of a gas.
Force is rate of change of momentum: $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{mv}) / \mathrm{dt}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-083.jpg?height=264&width=649&top_left_y=1337&top_left_x=299)

The SI unit of pressure is the pascal ( Pa ). 1
$\mathrm{Pa}=1 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ where N (Newton) is the S.I. unit of force. E.g. Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the earth's atmosphere and is about 100,000 Pa which is measured using a barometer.

\subsection*{14.2 The Gas Laws}

All gases exhibit similar physical properties even if their chemical properties differ widely. These properties can be summarized in a few simple laws. The variables set are pressure ( P ), volume ( V ), temperature ( T in Kelvin) and number of molecules ( n in moles) i.e. keep one (or two) of the variables constant and vary the others.
i) Boyle's law

This investigates the pressure and volume relationship of a gas sample. The volume of a fixed amount of an ideal gas varies inversely with pressure at a
constant temperature. A bicycle pump is a good example of Boyle's law. As the volume of the air trapped in the pump is reduced, its pressure goes up, and air is forced into the tire.
This law can be expressed as a mathematical expression as $\mathrm{P} \alpha^{\frac{1}{V}}$. The symbol $\alpha$ means proportional to. We can change the symbol to an equals sign and write $P=k_{1} \times^{\frac{1}{V}}$. Where $k_{1}$ is the proportionality constant. On rearranging the equation, we can now express Boyle's law as $\mathrm{PV}=\mathrm{k}_{1}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-084.jpg?height=903&width=1034&top_left_y=882&top_left_x=253)
ii) Charles' law

This investigates the temperature and volume relationship of a gas sample. At constant pressure, the volume of a gas sample expands when heated and contracts when cooled. Therefore, Charles' law states that, the volume of a fixed amount of gas maintained at a constant pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. An ideal application for this gas law is the hot air balloon.
This law can be expressed as a mathematical expression as $\mathrm{V} \alpha \mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{T}}$. The symbol $\alpha$ means proportional to. We can change the symbol to an equals sign and
write $V=k_{2} \times T$. Where $k_{2}$ is the proportionality constant. On rearranging the equation, we can now express Charles' law as $\frac{V}{T}=\mathrm{k}_{2}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-085.jpg?height=548&width=1166&top_left_y=539&top_left_x=241)

\section*{iii) Avogadro's law}

This investigates the volume and amount relationship of a gas sample. It states that, at constant pressure and temperature, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas present.
This law can be expressed as a mathematical expression as $V \alpha n$. The symbol $\alpha$ means proportional to. We can change the symbol to an equals sign and write $V=k_{3} \times n$. Where $k_{3}$ is the proportionality constant. On rearranging the equation, we can now express Avogadro's law as $\frac{v}{n}=\mathrm{k}_{3}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-085.jpg?height=524&width=1182&top_left_y=1836&top_left_x=233)
iv) Ideal gas law

An ideal gas is a hypothetical gas whose pressure-volume-temperature behavior can be completely accounted for the ideal gas equation. An ideal gas obeys all of the gas laws under all conditions, dose not condense into a liquid when cooled. This gas law brings together the gas properties using the gas laws we have discussed above.
Boyle's law: Pa ${ }^{\frac{1}{V}}$
Charles' law: $\mathrm{V}_{\alpha} \mathrm{T}$
Avogadro's law: Van
These are combined to form a single main equation expressing the behavior of gases as
$\mathrm{V}_{\alpha}{ }^{\frac{n T}{P}}$. We can then change the $\alpha$ symbol to an equals sign and write $\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{R}^{\frac{n T}{P}}$.
on rearranging the equation, it is then expressed as $P V=n R T$.
Application: How much gas is required to fill a basketball or a light bulb?

\section*{UNIT 15: KINETIC THEORY OF GASES}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. State the ideal gas laws and their application
2. Explain the application of kinetic theory and temperature in food preparation

\subsection*{15.1 Assumptions of kinetic theory of gases}

Kinetic energy is the type of energy expended by a moving object, or energy of motion. Kinetic theory of gases makes several central assumptions. They are
a. A gas is composed of molecules that are separated from each other by distances far greater than their own dimensions.
b. B. gas molecules are in constant motion in random directions and they frequently collide with one another.
c. Gas molecules exert neither attractive nor repulsive forces on one another.
d. The average kinetic energy of molecules is proportional to the temperature of the gas in kelvin.

\section*{UNIT 16: SOLUBILITY}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. State the factors affecting solubility of substances
2. Draw and explain on solubility curves
3. Determine the precipitation of some salts
4. Identify eutectic mixtures
5. Explain on fractional distillation of known substances

The solubility of a solute is: the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a certain amount of solvent or solution at a certain temperature.

\subsection*{16.1 FACTORS AFFECTING SOLUBILITY} Nature of the solute and solvent - The amount of solute that dissolves depends on what type of solute it is. While only 1 gram of lead (II) chloride can be dissolved in 100 grams of water aXDt room temperature, 200 grams of zinc chloride can be dissolved. This means that a greater amount of zinc chloride can be dissolved in the same amount of water than lead II chloride. Temperature -- Generally, an increase in the temperature of the solution increases the solubility of a solid solute. For example, a greater amount of sugar will dissolve in warm water than in cold water. A few solid solutes, however, are less soluble in warmer solutions. For all gases, solubility decreases as the temperature of the solution rises. An example of this is Soda. The solubility of the carbon dioxide gas decreases when a soda is warm, making the soda flat.
Pressure -- For solid and liquid solutes, changes in pressure have practically no effect on solubility. For gaseous solutes, an increase in pressure increases solubility and a decrease in pressure decreases solubility. Example: When the cap on a bottle of soda pop is removed, pressure is released, and the gaseous solute bubbles out of solution. This escape of a gas from solution is called effervescence.

\subsection*{16.2 Solubility Curves}

A solubility curve is a data based graph comparing the amount of solute that will dissolve in a given amount of solvent at various temperatures. The most typical solubility curves are graphed based solid and gaseous solutes dissolved in 100 grams of water.

\subsection*{16.3 Precipitation of salts}

A mixture of metal ions in a solution can be separated by precipitation with anions such as $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{Cl}-, \mathrm{Br}-\mathrm{Br}-$, $\mathrm{SO} 2-4 \mathrm{SO} 42-, \mathrm{CO} 2-3 \mathrm{CO} 32-$, $\mathrm{S} 2-\mathrm{S} 2-$, Cr2O2-4Cr2O42-, PO2-4PO42-, OH-OH- etc. When a metal ion or a group of metal ions form insoluble salts with a particular anion, they can be separated from others by precipitation. We can also separate the anions by precipitating them with appropriate metal ions. There are no definite dividing lines between insoluble salts, sparingly soluble, and soluble salts, but concentrations of their saturated solutions are small, medium, and large. Solubility products are usually listed for insoluble and sparingly soluble salts, but they are not given for soluble salts. Solubility products for soluble salts are very large.
What type of salts are usually soluble, sparingly soluble and insoluble? The following are some general guidelines, but these are not precise laws.
- All nitrates are soluble. The singly charged large NO-3NO3-ions form salts with high solubilities. So do ClO-4ClO4-, ClO-3ClO3-, NO-2NO2-, HCOO-HCOO-, and CH3COO-CH3COO-.
- All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble except those of $\mathrm{Ag}+\mathrm{Ag}+, \mathrm{Hg} 2+2 \mathrm{Hg} 22+$, and $\mathrm{Pb} 2+\mathrm{Pb} 2+$. CaF2CaF2, BaF2BaF2, and PbF2PbF2 are also insoluble.
- All sulfates are soluble, except those of $\mathrm{Ba} 2+\mathrm{Ba} 2+, \mathrm{Sr} 2+\mathrm{Sr} 2+$, and $\mathrm{Pb} 2+\mathrm{Pb} 2+$. The doubly charged sulfates are usually less soluble than halides and nitrates.
- Most singly charge cations $\mathrm{K}+\mathrm{K}+, \mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{Na}+, \mathrm{NH}+4 \mathrm{NH} 4+$ form soluble salts. However, K3Co(NO2)6K3Co(NO2)6 and
(NH4)3Co(NO2)6(NH4)3Co(NO2)6 are insoluble

\subsection*{16.4 Eutectic mixtures}

An eutectic is a melting composition of minimum two or more components, each of which melts and freezes congruently. During the crystallization
phase, a mixture of the components is formed, hence acting as a single component. The components freeze to an intimate mixture of crystals and melt simultaneously without separation. Eutectics can be mixtures of organic and/or inorganic compounds. Hence, eutectics can be made as either organic-organic, inorganic-inorganic or organic-inorganic mixtures. This gives room for a wide variety of combinations that can be tailored for specific applications.

\subsection*{16.5 Fractional CRystallization}

A process by which a chemical compound is separated into components by crystallization. In fractional crystallization the compound is mixed with a solvent, heated, and then gradually cooled so that, as each of its constituent components crystallizes, it can be removed in its pure form from the solution.

\subsection*{16.6 Distribution coefficients}

Distribution coefficient is an empirically dimensionless property that describes how a chemical substance distributes itself between two phases. The media can be gases such as air, liquids such as water or olive oil, or complex mixtures such as blood or other tissues

\section*{UNIT 17: SOLUTIONS}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit the learner should be able to:
1. List the types of solutions
2. Describe the methods of expressing the composition of mixtures
3. Explain the colligate properties of solutions
4. Identify the ideal and non ideal solutions
5. State the properties of different solutions

A solution is defined a homogenous mixture which mainly comprises of two components namely solute and solvent. For example, salt and sugar is a good illustration of a solution. A solution can be categorized into several components.

\subsection*{17.1 TYPES OF SOLUTIONS}

Depending upon the dissolution of the solute in the solvent, solutions can be categorized into supersaturated, unsaturated and saturated solutions.
- A supersaturated solution comprises of a large amount of solute at a temperature wherein it will be reduced as a result the extra solute will crystallize quickly.
- An unsaturated solution is a solution in which solvent is capable of dissolving any more solute at given temperature.
- A saturated solution can be defined as a solution in which solvent is not capable of dissolving any more solute at given temperature.
Homogenous and Heterogenous Solutions
Homogeneous solutions are solutions with uniform composition and properties throughout the solution. For example a cup of coffee, perfume, cough syrup, a solution of salt or sugar in water etc.

Heterogeneous solutions are solutions with non-uniform composition and properties throughout the solution. A solution of oil and water, water and chalk powder and solution of water and sand

\subsection*{17.2 Methods of expressing composition of mixtures}

\subsection*{17.3 Colligative properties}

A colligative property is a property of a solution that depends upon the number of solute particles and not upon their identity (or properties of solutions that depend on the number of the solute particles, and not on the nature/identity/type of solute particles).
The four important colligative properties of solutions are as below. There is a direct relationship between the concentration of a solution (number of solute particles) and the effect recorded in regard to the colligative properties.
i) Vapor-pressure lowering - The vapor pressure of a solvent in a solution is always lower than the vapor pressure of the pure solvent.
ii) Boiling-point elevation - this refers to the difference between the boiling point of a solution and the boiling point of the pure solvent.
iii) Freezing-point depression - this refers to the difference in temperature between the freezing point of a solution and the freezing point of the pure solvent.
iv) Osmotic pressure - osmosis is the process by which solvent molecules move through membrane from more solvent (lower concentration) into side with less solvent (higher concentration).

\subsection*{17.4 IDEAL AND NON-IDEAL SOLUTIONS}

Ideal Solutions: The solutions which obey Raoult's Law at every range of concentration and at all temperatures are Ideal Solutions. We can obtain ideal solutions by mixing two ideal components that are, solute and a solvent having similar molecular size and structure.

Non-ideal solutions: The solutions which don't obey Raoult's law at every range of concentration and at all temperatures are Non-Ideal Solutions. Nonideal solutions deviate from ideal solutions and are also known as Non-Ideal Solutions.

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF NON-IDEAL SOLUTIONS}
- Non-ideal solutions showing positive deviation from Raoult's Law
- Non-ideal solutions showing negative deviation from Raoult's Law

\section*{UNIT 18: THERMOCHEMISTRY}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. State the enthalpy changes in chemical reactions
2. State the laws of energy conservation
3. Discuss the types of heat in reactions
4. List the factors affecting rates of chemical reactions

\subsection*{18.1 Definition of terms}

Thermodynamics is the study of heat, and how heat can be interconverted into other energy forms.
In thermodynamics the system is a specific part of the universe that is being studied, often the system is a chemical reaction. The surroundings are all parts of the universe that are not the system, typically everything outside the test tube.
An open system can exchange both energy and matter with its surroundings. An active volcano is an example of an open system.
A closed system can exchange energy but not matter. A sealed greenhouse is a closed system.
An isolated system can exchange neither energy nor matter. A sealed thermos bottle is an isolated system.
Thermochemistry is a branch of thermodynamics and is the study of how energy in the form of heat is involved in chemical change.
Heat is defined as the energy that flows into or out of a reaction because of a difference in temperature between the thermodynamic system and its surroundings. Or heat is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies that are at different temperatures.

The heat content of a body will depend on its temperature, its mass, and the material it is made of. Temperature is NOT the same as heat.

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Temperature measures the degree of hotness or coldness i.e. how hot or how cold.

Energy can simply be defined as ability to do work. E.g. light energy from sunlight makes plants to grow. Energy in food allows us to perform normal bodily functions. It is measured in different units e.g. kilowatts in measuring electrical energy, calories in food. In measuring energy associated with most chemical processes, energy is expressed in terms of joules. The food energy unit, Calorie, is equal to 1 kcal . One calorie is the energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of pure water by one degree Celsius ( $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). In addition, 4.18 joules $=1$ calorie.

\subsection*{18.2 FORMS OF ENERGY}

Energy takes many forms such as mechanical, thermal, radiant, chemical, electrical, or gravitational. These are categorized into two broad classes:
kinetic energy, energy associated with motion, and potential energy, energy associated with position.

\section*{Potential energy}

It is energy stored up and is ready to be used/converted in future. E.g. fossil fuels have potential energy which can be converted to other forms of energy. Kinetic energy
This is energy in motion. The more kinetic energy a body has, the faster it moves. Objects at rest have no kinetic energy.

Energy (heat) flows between the reaction and surroundings to establish temperature equality or thermal equilibrium. Heat flows from a region of higher temperature to one of lower temperature.

\section*{Enthalpy}

Enthalpy refers to a state function used to describe the heat changes that occur in a reaction under constant pressure. In chemical reactions, heat can either be absorbed or released. This flow of heat is referred to as enthalpy change.

Reactions that release heat are termed as exothermic, they have negative values of $\Delta \mathrm{H}$ e.g. freezing or condensation.
Reactions that absorb heat are termed as endothermic, they have positive values of $\Delta \mathrm{H}$ e.g. melting or vaporization.

The heat notation in a thermochemical equation
The symbol $\Delta H$ is used to denote heat changes. A thermochemical equation is a chemical equation with the $\Delta \mathrm{H}$ for the reaction included.
E.g.
$\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{NO}_{3}(\mathrm{~s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{NH}_{4}+(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}(\mathrm{aq}) \quad \Delta \mathrm{H}=+28.1 \mathrm{~kJ}$ (endothermic reaction)

\section*{Measuring temperature}

As earlier mentioned, temperature refers to the degree of hotness or coldness of an object and is measured by a thermometer. Temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy per particle in a substance. E.g. for gases how fast the gas particles are bouncing to and fro or for liquids how fast particles slide and jiggle past one another and for solids, how fast particles move as they vibrate and jiggle in place

The higher the temperature of a substance, the faster the motion of its molecules.

Temperature is measured using a variety of temperature scales. The most commonly used are described in the next two sections.
1. The Celsius Scale $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$

This scale puts the freezing point of water at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the boiling point of water at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The temperatures in between are divided up into 100 units (degrees).

The disadvantages of this scale are:
There may be temperatures below $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
The pressures and volumes of gases do not change in proportion to Celsius temperature.
2. The Kelvin Scale (K)

This scale has absolute zero as the zero point on its scale. The size of the degree is the same as a Celsius degree.
Advantages:
There are no negative temperatures
Pressures and volumes of gases will change in proportion to Kelvin temperature.

Absolute zero is 273 degrees below $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
To convert from Celsius degrees to Kelvin degrees: add 273.
To convert from Kelvin degrees to Celsius degrees: subtract 273.

For example:
\begin{tabular}{llll}
K & 0 & 273 & 373 \\
${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ & -273 & 0 & 100
\end{tabular}
3. Fahrenheit scale

This scale sets the freezing point of water at $32{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ to $212^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ for boiling point of water.

\subsection*{18.3 TYPES OF THERMOMETERS USED IN MEASURING TEMPERATURE}

Thermometers measure temperature by expansion or contraction of a liquid (mercury or colored alcohol). There are many different types of thermometer used for measuring temperature e.g. mercury, alcohol, infra-red, bi-metallic strip, thermocouple, electrical resistance, brightness thermometer etc.

\subsection*{18.4 Heat transfer}

Heat can transfer (move) in 3 ways i.e. conduction, convection and radiation.

\section*{Conduction}

It is most obvious in solids. Conduction occurs when heat energy travels_ through a body, passing from particle to particle as they vibrate against each other. When a solid heats up, its particles gain kinetic energy and increase the energy with which they vibrate. A good conductor must have particles which are close enough together to collide with sufficient force for energy to be transferred. Metals are all good conductors of heat especially copper, aluminium and silver, because they have "free" (metallic bonding) electrons which are easily able to transfer heat energy. All liquids (except mercury) and gases are very poor conductors of heat. Some materials are poor conductors of heat are referred to as insulators e.g. wood, plastics

\section*{Convection}

It is the transfer of heat by the movement of the heated particles themselves. This can only take place in liquids and gases because in solids the particles are not able to move from their fixed positions. When a liquid or

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
gas is heated, it expands and becomes less dense. The lighter liquid or gas rises allowing a flow of cooler material to take its place. This in turn becomes heated and so a current is set up. Heat will continue to be transferred through the available space in this way until it is evenly distributed.

\section*{Radiation}

It is the way we receive heat energy from the sun. It does not require a medium for its transmission (i.e. it can travel through empty space) and is in the form of electromagnetic energy waves which travel in the same way as light or radio waves.
When these energy waves fall on a body, the energy may be: absorbed, transmitted or reflected.
When radiant energy is absorbed the body will rise in temperature. A rack of clothes left in front of a radiant heater will continue to absorb heat until it reaches ignition temperature. Black and dull surfaces absorb (and radiate) heat much more efficiently than white shiny surface.

Radiant energy is transmitted through clear materials such as glass. The glass does not heat up. Radiant heat from the sun may be concentrated by means of a magnifying glass, sufficient to ignite flammable material.
Shiny, silver surfaces will reflect radiant energy and not heat up. This is the reason for the silver coating on a fire-fighter's jacket.

\section*{Newton's laws of motion}

There are 3 laws of motion attributed to Isaac Newton known as newton laws. They explain how forces make objects move. When a force act on an object, it may cause change in the way the object moves. The change can be in terms of speed or change in direction.
1. First law of motion

It states that an object will stay still or move along at a steady pace unless a force acts on it. E.g. a rocket on a Launchpad remain in place because there is no force acting on it to make it move.
2. Second law of motion

It states that when a force acts on an object it makes the object to change its speed or to move in a different direction.
E.g. when the rocket engine fires up, the force it produces lifts the rocket off the Launchpad and into the air.
3. Third law of motion

It states that when a force acts on an object, the object pulls or pushes back. This reaction is equal to original force but in the opposite direction.

\section*{UNIT 19: CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Define chemical equilibrium
2. Identify the types of chemical equilibria
3. Explain on Le-Charteliers principle

Many chemical reactions do not go to completion but instead attain a state of chemical equilibrium.
Chemical equilibrium: it is state in which the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal and the concentrations of the reactants and products remain constant.
It is a dynamic process where the conversions of reactants to products and products to reactants are still going on, although there is no net change in the number of reactant and product molecules.

Since, in a system at equilibrium, both the forward and reverse reactions are being carried out, we write its equation with a double arrow.

Consider the generalized reaction
$\mathrm{aA}+\mathrm{bB} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{cC}+\mathrm{dD}$. Meaning, the rate of forward reaction= rate of backward reaction.

\subsection*{19.1 TYpes of Chemical equilibrium}

There are two types of chemical equilibrium
a) Homogenous equilibrium

This is when in an equilibrium reaction, all the reactants and the products are present in the same phase.
b) Heterogeneous equilibrium

This is when in an equilibrium reaction, all the reactants and the products are present in two or more than two phases.

\subsection*{19.2 FACTORS THAT AFFECT CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM} This is summarized by Le Chatelier's Principle which states that if a system at equilibrium is disturbed by a change in temperature, pressure or the concentration of one of the components, the system will shift its equilibrium position so as to counteract the disturbance.

\section*{1. Changes in Concentration}

Adding a reactant or product, the equilibria shifts away from the increase in order to consume part of the added substance.
On the other hand, removing a reactant or product, the equilibria shifts toward the decrease to replace part of the removed species.

\section*{2. Changes in Volume and Pressure}

Since the pressure of gases is related directly to the concentration by PV $=\mathrm{n}$ (Boyle's law), changing the pressure by increasing/decreasing the volume of a container will disturb an equilibrium system.
If $P$ increases ( $V$ decreases), the system shifts to the side with a smaller number of gas molecules (this effectively reestablishes equilibrium by decreasing the pressure).
On the other hand, if $P$ decreases ( $V$ increases), the system shifts to the side with a greater number of gas molecules.

\section*{3. Changes in Temperature}

Heat can be considered a reactant in an endothermic reaction and a product in an exothermic reaction. Therefore, changes in temperature will alter the equilibrium of these reactions.
4. Catalysts

Catalysts lower the activation energy for a reaction, so a catalyst decreases the amount of time taken to reach equilibrium for both the forward and reverse reactions.
The catalyst therefore does not affect the equilibrium concentrations of reactants and products in the equilibrium mixture.

\section*{UNIT 20: ELECTROCHEMISTRY}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Differentiate between conduction and conductivity
2. Discuss on the ionic equilibrium in electrochemistry
3. State on the solubility of products and common ion effects
4. Explain the application of electrolysis

Electrochemistry is defined as the branch of chemistry that examines the phenomena resulting from combined chemical and electrical effects. In other words, it is the study of production of electricity from energy released during spontaneous chemical reactions and the use of electrical energy to bring about non-spontaneous chemical transformations.
Many metals e.g. sodium hydroxide, chlorine, fluorine and many other chemicals are produced by electrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are used on a large scale in various instruments and devices.
Reminder: A redox reaction is a reaction which involves a change in oxidation state of one or more elements. When a substance loses its electron, its oxidation state increases, thus it is oxidized. When a substance gains an electron, its oxidation state decreases thus being reduced.

\subsection*{20.1 TYPES OF ELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS}

They typically consist of two electronic conductors (electrodes) and an ionic conductor (electrolyte).
There are two types of cells i.e. galvanic cells and electrolytic cells
1. Galvanic (voltaic) cells

These are electrochemical cells which contain a spontaneous reaction, and always have a positive voltage. They are the basis for the batteries that fuel modern society.

A voltaic cell consists of two compartments called half-cells. The half-cell where oxidation occurs is called anode. The other half-cell where reduction occurs is called cathode. The Electrons in voltaic cells flow from the negative electrode to the positive electrode, which flows from anode to cathode.

\section*{Hint: Red Cat and An Ox}

Reduction Cathode and Anode Oxidation is a helpful way to remember which reaction occurs on which half-cell.
2. Electrolytic cells

In electrolytic cells, electrical energy is used to drive nonspontaneous redox reaction.

The redox reaction is spontaneous and is responsible for the production of electrical energy.
The two half-cells are set up in different containers, being connected through the salt bridge or porous energy into chemical energy.

The electrons are supplied by the species getting oxidized. They move from anode to the cathode in the external circuit. the cathode is reduction. The external battery supplies the electrons. They enter through the cathode and come out through the anode.
The two cells are as shown in the diagram below.

\section*{Electrolysis, Conduction and conductivity}

Electrolysis is the process of driving a reaction in a non-spontaneous direction by using an electric current i.e. a chemical compound e.g. lead (II) bromide is decomposed using electricity.

Electrolyte is an ionic compound which conducts electric current in molten or aqueous solution, being decomposed in the process. Can be classified into non-electrolytes (organic liquids or solutions e.g. alcohols, pure water, sugar solution, molten sulphur), weak electrolytes (weak acids and alkalis e.g. ammonia solution, limewater) and strong electrolytes (strong acids, alkalis and salt solutions e.g. aqueous sulphuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, copper (II) sulphate solution).
NB: Molten/aqueous ionic compounds conduct electricity because ions free to move. In solid state, these ions are held in fixed position within the crystal lattice. Hence solid ionic compounds do not conduct electricity. When molten binary compound is electrolyzed, metal is formed on cathode while nonmetal is formed on anode.

Electrode is a rod or plate where electricity enters or leaves electrolyte during electrolysis.
Reactions occur at electrodes.
Conductors are compounds that allow electric current to pass through them. Examples are metals, aqueous solution of acids, bases and salts etc.
Insulators are compounds that do not allow electric current to pass through them. Examples are pure water, urea, sugar etc.

\section*{Anode}
- Positive electrode connected to positive terminal of direct current source.
- Oxidation occurs here.
- Anode loses negative charge as electrons flow towards the battery, leaving anode positively charged.
- This causes anion to discharge its electrons here to replace lost electrons and also, negative charge are attracted to positive charge.

\section*{Cathode}
- Negative electrode connected to negative terminal of direct current source.
- Reduction occurs here.
- Cathode gains negative charge as electrons flow from the battery towards the cathode, making cathode negatively charged.
- This causes cation to be attracted and gains electrons to be an atom.

\section*{Anion}
- Negative ion
- Attracted to anode (+ve electrode).

\section*{Cation}
- Positive ion
- Attracted to cathode (-ve electrode).

\section*{Example}

\section*{Electrolysis of molten $\mathrm{PbBr}_{2}$}

\section*{UNIT 21: INTRODUCTION TO PHYSICS}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Discuss on surface and colloidal chemistry
2. Differentiate between adsorptions and colloids

\subsection*{21.1 Surface chemistry}

Surface Chemistry is the branch of chemistry which deals with the phenomenon that occurs on the surfaces or interfaces e.g. corrosion, catalysis, crystallization, and adsorption, colloids (emulsions and gels). For the purposes of the course, we shall discuss colloids, adsorptions and catalysis.

\section*{Colloids}

Colloids or Colloidal solutions, represent an intermediate kind of a mixture between true solution and suspension. The colloidal state appears homogenous to the naked eye or even an ordinary microscope (due to particles being invisible).
Colloidal particles do not settle down under gravity.

\section*{Adsorption}

Adsorption is the accumulation of molecular species at the surface rather than in the bulk of a solid or liquid is termed as adsorption. The molecular species accumulates at the surface is termed as adsorbate and the material on the surface of which the adsorption takes place is called adsorbent, e.g.
(ii) $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ gases are adsorbed on the surface of charcoal.
(iii) Silica gels adsorb water molecules from air

Difference between adsorption and absorption

\section*{Adsorption}

\section*{Absorption}

It involves uniform distribution of the molecular species throughout the bulk
surface

It is a surface phenomenon

It is rapid in the beginning

It occurs throughout the body of material

It occurs at a uniform rate

\section*{Catalysis}

Catalyst is a chemical substance which can change the rate of reaction without being used up in that reaction and this process is known as catalysis. A catalyst may be positive (i.e., increases rate of reaction) or negative (i.e., decreases rate of reaction).

Types of catalysis
(a) Homogeneous catalysis

In this catalysis, and the catalyst reactants are in the same physical state [phase], e.g.
$$2 \mathrm{SO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \xrightarrow{\mathrm{NO}(\mathrm{~g})} 2 \mathrm{SO}_{3}(\mathrm{~g})$$
(b) Heterogeneous catalysis

In heterogeneous catalysis, catalyst is present in a different phase than that of reactants, e.g.
$$2 \mathrm{KClO}_{3}(\mathrm{~s}) \xrightarrow{\mathrm{MnO}_{2}} 2 \mathrm{KCl}(\mathrm{~s})+3 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})$$
(c) Autocatalysis

When one of the product of a reaction acts as catalyst, the process is called autocatalysis.

\section*{Characteristics of Catalysts}
- The catalyst remains unchanged in mass and chemical composition.
- In case of reversible reactions, the catalyst does not influence the composition of reaction mixture at equilibrium. It only helps to attain the equilibrium quickly.

\section*{UNIT 22: UNITS AND MEASUREMENTS}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. State the basic units of measurement
2. Highlight for the application of dimensional analysis

\section*{22.1 bASIC UNITS OF MEASUREMENT}

The comparison of any physical quantity with its standard unit is called measurement.

Physical quantities refers to all the quantities in terms of which laws of physics are described, and whose measurement is necessary are called physical quantities e.g. length, time, mass, temperature, electric current etc.

A Unit is a definite amount of a physical quantity is taken as its standard unit. The standard unit should be easily reproducible, internationally accepted.
Fundamental units are those physical quantities which are independent to each other are called fundamental quantities and their units are called fundamental units.

\end{tabular}

\section*{Systems of Units}

A system of units is the complete set of units, both fundamental and derived, for all kinds of physical quantities. The common system of units which is used in mechanics are given below:
1. CGS (centimeter, gram, second) System In this system, the unit of length is centimeters, the unit of mass is gram and the unit of time is second.
2. FPS (foot, pound, second) System In this system, the unit of length is foot, the unit of mass is pound and the unit of time is second.

\section*{Dimensions}

Dimensions of any physical quantity are those powers which are raised on fundamental units to express its unit. The expression which shows how and which of the base quantities represent the dimensions of a physical quantity, is called the dimensional formula. E.g. Area $\left(m^{2}\right)$, volume $\left(m^{3}\right)$, density ( $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ ).

\section*{UNIT 23: FLUID MECHANICS}

\section*{Unit Objectives}

By the end of this unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Define the term pressure
2. State hydrostatic principles
3. Identify various types of valves

\subsection*{23.1 Definition of Pressure:}

Pressure is a force exerted by the substance per unit area on another substance.

\subsection*{23.2 Hydrostatic PRINCIPLES}

The difference between the pressures of two different points within a liquid in equilibrium is proportional to the density of the liquid, $\rho \rho$, the gravity acceleration module, gg , and the differences in the heights of the points considered hh. Mathematically, we have
$\Delta P=P B-P A=\rho g h . \Delta P=P B-P A=\rho g h$.

Pressure on a submerged object. When an object is submerged in a fluid, in addition to atmospheric pressure POPO, the liquid also puts pressure on the walls of this object, which increases with depth. In the figure, a green cylinder is submerged in a liquid. Note that the forces on the sides of the cylinder cancel each other out, but the pressure at the top ( $\mathrm{Pt}=\mathrm{P} 0+\rho g y a \mathrm{Pt}=\mathrm{PO}+\rho g y a$ ) is less than the pressure at the bottom $(\mathrm{Pb}=\mathrm{PO} 0+\rho \mathrm{gybPb}=\mathrm{P} 0+\rho g y b)$. With this, there is a resulting hydrostatic force pushing out the cylinder. Depending on the weight, the cylinder may float or sink. The distribution of pressure in a fluid is due to:
1. The existence of a gravitational field
2. An acceleration of the fluid by external forces (non-gravitational)
3. A combination of both causes.

Importantly, for the air, as the density is very low, we can ignore the pressure variation with height when this variation is of the order of a few meters.

\subsection*{23.3 Types of valves}

\section*{Ball Valve}

Ball valve is a quarter turn operated valve. The closure member is a spherical plug with a through hole. When the valve is in open state, the through hole is in-line with the fluid flow and hence, the fluid passes through it. The valve is closed by rotating the globe by 90 Deg. such that the hole now becomes perpendicular to the flow and hence, stops the flow.
The seat is usually circumferential, made up of soft materials to offer a tight shutoff. The seat can be made either out of plastic or metals. Ball valves are not recommended to be used in a partially open condition. Due to misalignment between the flow direction and opening of the plug, large pressure drop takes place in partially open condition.
Due to above specified challenges, ball valves are mostly used in shutoff applications. Ball valves are commonly used in steam, water, oil, gas, air, corrosive fluids. They can handle slurries and dusty dry fluids. Ball valves are not used with abrasive and fibrous materials as it poses risk of damage to the seat and plug surface.

\section*{Gate Valve}

Gate valve is a sliding type of valve. In gate valves, the closing member is a metal gate. The gate slides down to close the valve. In fully open conditions, the flow area is equal to the area of the pipe and hence, there is negligible pressure drop across the valve.
Gate valve should ideally be used as on-off valve. It is not advisable to use them as throttling valves because in partly open conditions, erosion of gate might take place. In partially open conditions, due to vibrations, valve is exposed to quick wear and tear. Also, during closing and opening, there is
considerable amount of friction and hence, opening and closing these vales quickly and frequently is not possible.
These valves find their use in petrochemical industry due to the fact that they can work with metal-metal sealing.

Plug Valve
Similar to ball valves, plug valves are also quarter turn type of valves. This valve consists of a plug which can be either cylindrical or conical in shape. The plug has a through slit which remains in-line with the flow in the open condition. When the plug is turned by 90 Deg., this slit becomes perpendicular to flow and the valve gets closed.
Plug valves are well suited to handle fluids with suspended solids, slurries etc.

Plug valves are primarily used for on-off applications. When used for throttling purpose, the pressure drop through the valve is higher because of misalignment between flow direction and the direction of the opening (slit).

\section*{Butterfly Valve}

Butterfly valves are most simple yet versatile valves. They are quarter turn operated valves which are commonly used in multiple industries for varied applications. Quarter turn operation ensures quick operating of the valve. In the open condition there is minimum obstruction to the fluid flow through the valve as the flow passes around the disc aerodynamically. This results in very less pressure drop through the valve.
Due to its unique mode of operation, the valve can be actuated easily without requiring high torques and wear and tear. Due to lack of friction, use of bulky actuators can be avoided. Another advantage offered by butterfly valve is their compact size. The valve is quite compact, resembling a metal disc. This makes their installation very easy. They can be used to handle slurries and fluids with suspended solids as there are no cavities for deposition of solid particles inside the valve body.
Globe ValveGlobe Valve

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Globe valve is a linear motion type of valves and is typically used in both onoff and throttling applications. In globe valves, the flow of the fluid through valve follows an S-path. Due to this, the flow direction changes twice which results in higher pressure drops. Due to other advantages offered by them, they are widely used in applications where pressure drop through the valve is not a controlling factor.

These valves are generally not used beyond sizes larger than NPS 12 (DN 300) as enormous forces are exerted on the stem to open or close the valve under fluid pressures. Globe valves require high pressures on the seat to keep it closed when the fluid exerts pressure from the bottom of the disc.

They are used for both on-off and throttling applications but special types of trims are required for throttling applications where large pressure drops are involved. These valves can be used in three configurations, depending upon the applications-
a. Tee pattern
b. Angle Pattern
c. Wye Pattern

When the disc is removed from the stem and allowed to rest on its own weight, globe valves can be used as non-return valves. Machining of seats is easier and cheaper compared to other types of valves.
Pinch Valve
Pinch valves consist of a plastic tube/sleeve which is made up of reinforced elastomers. The sealing/ closing action is achieved by throttling or pinching this sleeve/tube. Pinch valves are best suited for handling slurries and fluids having suspended solids. Pinch valves offer many benefits over the other types of valves. They can be used for handling corrosive fluids as there is no contact between the fluid carried and the actual valve mechanism. Once suitable sleeve material is selected, this valve can work with a variety of
fluids. As fluid being carried does not come in contact with the metal parts, these valves can be used for food grade applications also.
Generally, pinch valves are suitable for low pressure applications. When used with abrasive slurries, they should be used as on-off valves; if used for throttling purposes, the sleeve will get worn out.
Working of Disc Check Valve - Spring Loaded Disc Check Valves
Disc check valves, also called as non-return valves allow the flow to pass through them in only one direction and stop the flow in reverse direction.
Because of this unique directional property, disc check valves are essentially used for some critical applications in the steam systems.
There are four major types of disc check valves as follows-
1. Lift Check Valve- Lift check valves work simply on the principle of gravity. When the fluid comes in the forward direction, the disc gets lifted from the seat against the gravitational force by the force of incoming fluid. The valve thus allows fluid to pass in this direction. When the fluid comes in opposite direction, it supports the force of gravity and the disc remains on the seat, keeping the valve closed.
Tight shutoff can be difficult to achieve in case back pressures are low. The valve will leak the fluid in such situations.
2. Swing Check Valve- In this kind of check valve, the disc or the closing element swings around a point to which it is hinged. When the fluid comes in the forward direction, the disc swings in an open position allowing the fluid to pass. When the fluid flow comes in the opposite direction, the disc swings and rests on the seat to lose it.
3. Spring loaded Check Valves- In this kind of check valves, tight shut-off it provided using a spring. The spring holds back the disc on the seat. Even in the forward flow condition, the fluid should exert some pressure, called cracking pressure in order to open the disc against the spring pressure.
4. Diaphragm Type Check Valve- This kind of check valves uses diaphragms arranged in such a way that that open to allow the flow only in forward

direction. When flow comes from the reverse direction, the diaphragms remain closed.

\section*{UNIT 24: PROPERTIES OF MATTER}

\section*{Unit Objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Explain elasticity of materials
2. Describe the surface tension of various substances

\subsection*{24.1 Elasticity}

Elasticity is the ability of a deformed material body to return to its original shape and size when the forces causing the deformation are removed. A body with this ability is said to behave (or respond) elastically. To a greater or lesser extent, most solid materials exhibit elastic behavior, but there is a limit to the magnitude of the force and the accompanying deformation within which elastic recovery is possible for any given material. This limit, called the elastic limit, is the maximum stress or force per unit area within a solid material that can arise before the onset of permanent deformation. Stresses beyond the elastic limit cause a material to yield or flow. For such materials the elastic limit marks the end of elastic behaviour and the beginning of plastic behaviour. For most brittle materials, stresses beyond the elastic limit result in fracture with almost no plastic deformation.

\subsection*{24.2 Surface tension}

Surface tension is a physical property equal to the amount of force per unit area necessary to expand the surface of a liquid. It is the tendency of a fluid surface to occupy the smallest possible surface area. Surface tension is a principal factor in capillary action. The addition of substances called surfactants can reduce the surface tension of a liquid. For example, adding detergent to water decreases its surface tension. While pepper sprinkled on water floats, pepper sprinkled on water with detergent will sink.

Surface tension forces are due to intermolecular forces between the liquid's molecules at the liquid's outer boundaries. The units of surface tension are either energy per unit area or force per unit length.

\section*{Examples of Surface Tension}

Surface tension allows some insects and other small animals, which are denser than water, to walk across its surface without sinking.
1. The rounded shape of water droplets on a surface is due to surface tension.
2. Tears of wine form rivulets on the glass of an alcoholic beverage (not just wine) due to the interaction between the different surface tension values of ethanol and water and the faster evaporation of alcohol compared with water.
3. Oil and water separate because of the tension between two dissimilar liquids. In this case, the term is "interface tension", but it is simply a type of surface tension between two liquids.

\section*{UNIT 25: STATICS}

\section*{Unit objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. State factors affecting equilibrium
2. Explain on the application of static forces

Statics: in physics, the subdivision of mechanics that is concerned with the forces that act on bodies at rest under equilibrium conditions. Statics assumes that the bodies with which it deals are perfectly rigid. It also holds that the sum of all the forces acting on a body at rest has to be zero (i.e., the forces involved balance one another) and that there must be no tendency for the forces to turn the body about any axis. These three conditions are independent of one another, and their expression in mathematical form comprises the equations of equilibrium.

\section*{25. 1 Factors affecting equilibrium}

\section*{To ensure equilibrium:}
1. The forces acting on a structure must balance,
2. Net torque acting on the structure should be zero.

\subsection*{25.2 Application of static forces}
1. Muscle and Joints
- It is helpful to view muscles as a simple machines and draw them as free body diagrams.
- In muscles, the input force is often much greater than the output force.
- Very large forces are also created in the joints. Because muscles can contract but not expand beyond their resting length, joints and muscles often exert forces that act in opposite directions, and thus subtract

\section*{2. Arches and Domes}
- Arches and domes are structures that exhibit structural strength and can span large areas with no intermediate supports.
- Arches span large areas by resolving forces into compressive stresses and eliminating tensile stresses.
- The most common true arch configurations are the fixed arch, the twohinged arch, and the three-hinged arch.
- A dome is basically an arch that has been rotated around its central vertical axis.
- Domes are basically arches that have been rotated on their vertical axis, and have the same capabilities and properties of arches.
- Domes can be divided into two kinds, simple and compound.

\section*{3. Simple Machines}
- A simple machine is a device that changes the direction of a force or augments a force; simple machines fall into six categories.
- The six classifications of simple machines were established by renaissance scientists; they are as follows: lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, wedge and screw.
- Simple machines can be joined with other devices to create a more complicated machine. These building blocks are used to explain how machines work.
- The force output by a simple machine can exceed the force that was put into the machine.
- A simple machine has an applied force that works against a load force. If there are no frictional losses, the work done on the load is equal to the work done by the applied force. This allows an increase in the output force at the cost of a proportional decrease in distance moved by the load.
- The ratio of the output force to the input force is the mechanical advantage of the machine. If the machine does not absorb energy, its mechanical advantage can be calculated from the machine's geometry. For instance, the mechanical advantage of a lever is equal to the ratio of its lever arms.
- Simple machines which do not experience frictional losses are called ideal machines. For these ideal machines, the power in (rate of energy input) in equal to the power out (rate of energy output): Pin=PoutPin=Pout.

Lever: The amount of force produced by a machine can not be greater than the amount of force put into it.

\section*{UNIT 26: HEAT \\ Unit Objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Defines used in heat
2. Determine the various temperature scales and type of thermometers
3. Outline the methods of determining heat capacity
4. Explain the application of heat capacities and heat transfer

\subsection*{26.1 Definition of terms}

Temperature
Temperature is defined as a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample of matter, expressed in terms of units or degrees designated on a standard scale.

Temperature scales and types of thermometers
Types of thermometers
A wide variety of thermometers can be used to measure temperature, ranging from liquid-in-glass thermometers to different types of gas thermometers.

Constant volume thermometer
A constant-volume thermometer uses the known properties of gases to allow for the accurate measurement of temperature. A gas is sealed and kept at a constant volume. As the temperature changes, the volume or pressure of the gas will change, as well. The amount of pressure required to maintain a constant volume of the gas indicates change in temperature. Constantvolume gas thermometers are often used to calibrate other types of thermometers.

It is made of a bulb that is filled with the gas and attached to a mercury manometer, which measures pressure. The manometer is connected to a
piece of flexible tubing, and both are partially filled with mercury. The mercury level in the manometer is fixed, while the mercury level in the tube, or reservoir, moves up or down depending on changes in pressure.

Fig: Constant-volume thermometer

There are a few factors that could cause errors in the thermometer's readings, such as the air in the tube not heating properly or the air not being an ideal gas. However, constant-volume gas thermometers are popular with scientists because they cover a wide range of temperatures and tend to be very accurate, even in a variety of conditions. Hydrogen or helium are the gases commonly used in the constant-volume thermometer.

\section*{Mercury in glass thermometer}

It consists of mercury in a glass tube. Calibrated marks on the tube allow the temperature to be read by the length of the mercury within the tube which varies according to the heat given to it. To increase its sensitivity, there is usually a bulb of mercury at the end of the thermometer which contains most of the mercury; expansion and contraction of this volume of mercury is then amplified in the much narrower bore of the tube. The space above the mercury may be filled with nitrogen or it may be a vacuum.

Fig: Liquid-in-glass thermometer.

\section*{Resistance thermometer}

The thermometer consists of a sensor whose electrical resistance is highly temperature dependent and changes with temperature in a predictable way. Platinum is most commonly used as a sensor, but semiconducting materials such as thermistors may also be used. In a platinum resistance thermometer, a platinum wire of high purity is located near the tip of a closed protective tube, to make a probe which can be inserted in the measurement environment.

Fig: The resistance thermometer

\section*{Thermoelectric thermometer}

Also called the thermocouple thermometer. Two wires of dissimilar materials are connected to form a circuit with two junctions. The two junctions are maintained at different temperatures. An electric current flows in the circuit as heat is absorbed at one of the junctions and rejected at the other. The direction of the current depends on the materials making the thermocouple. The voltage generated is directly proportional to the temperature gradient between the junctions and can hence be utilized for measuring temperatures.

Fig: The thermoelectric thermometer, the thermocouple.

\subsection*{26.2 The thermodynamic scale}

One of the difficulties in the accurate measurement of temperature is that the various types of thermometers e.g., mercury-in-glass, platinum resistance, thermoelectric and so on give different readings when used to measure the same temperature because the value obtained depends on the properties of the substances used in the thermometer.

To overcome this challenge, an absolute scale called the thermodynamic scale which is independent of the properties of any substance used in thermometers was devised. The thermodynamic scale is based on the early observation that Gases expand when heated and contract when cooled. If pressure remains constant, the volume of a fixed mass of gas increases or decreases by of its volume for every degree ( 0 C rise or fall in temperature. Thus the volume of a gas decreases with decrease in temperature until at 2730 C it will be zero. This temperature is referred to as absolute zero (OK). This is the lowest temperature at which a gas can exist. In practice however, gases liquefy long before they reach $-273^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Methods of determining heat capacity}

Specific heat capacity
When a body is heated, its temperature rises. The amount of heat given to a body is directly proportional to the mass of the body and the temperature rise.
i.e. $\mathrm{Q} \propto \mathrm{M} \Delta \mathrm{T} \Rightarrow \mathrm{Q}=\mathrm{MCT}$ where C is a constant dependent on the material of the body.

Hence $C=Q / M \Delta T$
If $\mathrm{M}=1 \mathrm{Kg}$ and $\Delta \mathrm{T}=1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(1 \mathrm{~K})$ then $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{Q}$.
$C$ is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. C is the specific heat of the substance.

Where electrical energy is used to raise the temperature of a body whose specific heat is known, such electrical energy is converted to heat energy which is demonstrated through the rise of temperature of the body.
i.e. $\mathrm{VIt}=\mathrm{MC} \Delta \mathrm{T}$
where $\mathrm{V}=$ Voltage
$I=$ current in amperes
$\mathrm{t}=$ time in seconds

\subsection*{26.3 Calculations involving heat capacities}

The following data was obtained from an experiment used to determine the specific heat capacity of copper by the electrical method.

Mass of copper block $=200 \mathrm{~g}$
Initial temperature of the block $=22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
Ammeter reading $=0.5 \mathrm{~A}$
Voltmeter reading $=3.0 \mathrm{~V}$
Final temperature of the block $=30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
Time of heating $=7$ minutes .
Use the data to calculate the specific heat capacity of copper.
What is the significance of this value?
Solution
Electrical energy spent $=$ VIt
where $\mathrm{V}=$ Voltage
$I=$ current in amperes
$\mathrm{t}=$ time in seconds
Heat gained by the metal block $=\mathrm{Q}=\mathrm{MC} \Delta \mathrm{T}$

Assuming that there is no heat loss to the surrounding
$\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{VII} / \mathrm{M} \Delta \mathrm{T}=(3.0 \times 0.5 \times(7 \times 60)) /(0.200 \times 8)=393.75$
$\therefore$ Specific heat capacity $=394 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kgK}$
The significance of this value is that to raise the temperature of 1 kg of copper by $1 \mathrm{~K}, 394$ Joules of heat energy is required.

\section*{Exercise}
1. A $0.250-\mathrm{kg}$ block of a pure material is heated from $20.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $65.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ by the addition of 4.35 kJ of energy. Calculate its specific heat and identify the substance of which it is most likely composed.
2. What is meant by the specific heat capacity of a substance? Give a brief account of how the specific heat capacity of a metal block a few cm in linear dimensions may be determined.

\section*{Latent heat}

Melting is a process in which a solid is converted into a liquid at constant temperature. On the other hand, boiling is a process in which a liquid is converted to vapour at constant temperature. When a substance is undergoing change of phase (e.g. from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas), energy is required for this process. When a substance is changing from solid state to liquid state, the heat absorbed in the process is called the latent heat of fusion of the substance.

\subsection*{26.4 Application of heat capacities and latent heat Steaming Food}

The specific latent heat of vaporization for water is large. Plates filled with food are able to absorb heat from the hot steam. The condensation of steam at the base of the plate releases a large quantity of heat and thus enables food such as cakes, fish, eggs and others to be steamed.

\section*{Cooling drinks with cold water and ice}

A glass of hot water can be cooled faster by adding cold water or ice into it. During the melting of ice, a large quantity of specific latent heat is absorbed from the drink and this causes the drink towards a temperature that approaches the melting limit of ice. Ice absorbs a large quantity of latent heat during the process of melting.

\section*{Extinguishing fire by using boiling water}

Water that is quickly boiled will become steam which is able to absorb a larger quantity of latent heat from the fire.

\section*{Melting Ice on the road by using Salt}

It is known that the specific latent heat of fusion of salt is higher than of ice. Therefore, when salt is put on the road - having a thick layer of ice, salt will require more heat energy and absorb energy from the ice. Therefore, Ice will melt.

\section*{Heat transfers}

Heat can be transferred from one place to another by three methods: conduction in solids, convection of fluids (liquids or gases), and radiation through anything that will allow radiation to pass. The method used to transfer heat is usually the one that is the most efficient. If there is a temperature difference in a system, heat will always move from higher to lower temperatures.

\section*{UNIT 27: DYNAMICS}

\section*{Unit Objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. State and explain Newton's law of motion
2. Explain on inertia and momentum

Dynamics is the branch of applied mathematics concerned with the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion,

\subsection*{27.1 Inertia}

The property of an object by virtue of which it cannot change its state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line its own, is called inertia. Inertia is a measure of mass of a body. Greater the mass of a body greater will be its inertia or vice-versa.

Inertia is of three types:
(i) Inertia of Rest- When a bus or train starts to move suddenly, the passengers sitting in it falls backward due to inertia of rest.
(ii) Inertia of Motion -When a moving bus or train stops suddenly, the passengers sitting in it jerks in forward direction due to inertia of motion.
(iii) Inertia of Direction- We can protect yourself from rain by an umbrella because rain drops cannot change its direction its own due to inertia of direction.

\section*{Force}

Force is a push or pull which changes or tries to change the state of rest, the state of uniform motion, size or shape of a body.

Force is a vector, having both magnitude and direction
Its SI unit is newton ( N )
Forces can be categorized into two types:
(i) Contact Forces -Frictional force, tensional force, spring force, normal force, etc are the contact forces.
(ii) Action at a Distance Forces- Electrostatic force, gravitational force, magnetic force, etc are action at a distance forces.

\section*{Linear Momentum}

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

The total amount of motion present in a body is called its momentum. Linear momentum of a body is equal to the product of its mass and velocity. It is denoted by p .

Linear momentum $\mathrm{p}=\mathrm{mu}$.
Its S 1 unit is $\mathrm{kg}-\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ and dimensional formula is [MLT-1].
It is a vector quantity and its direction is in the direction of velocity of the body.

\subsection*{27.2 Newton’s Laws of Motion \\ 1. Newton's First Law of Motion}

A body continues to be in its state of rest or in uniform motion along a straight line unless an external force is applied on it.

This law is also called law of inertia.

\section*{Examples}
i) If a moving vehicle suddenly stops then the passengers inside the vehicle bend outward.

\section*{2. Newton's Second Law of Motion}

Newton's second law is the relation between acceleration and net force
"Acceleration of the objects is directly proportional to the net or resultant force acting on it and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.
$\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{m} \times \mathrm{a}$
Acceleration, in physics, is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time. The SI unit for acceleration is metre per second squared (m $\mathrm{s}-2)$.

\section*{. Examples}
(i) It is easier for a strong adult to push a full shopping cart than it is for a baby to push the same cart. (This is depending on the net force acting on the object).
(ii) It is easier for a person to push an empty shopping cart than a full one (This is depending on the mass of the object).

\section*{Worked Example 1:}

Let us consider the problem: A 15 kg object moving to the west with an acceleration of $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} 2$. What is the net force acting on an object?

Substituting the values in the above given formula,
Net Force $($ Fnet $)=15 \times 10=150 \mathrm{~N}$ Therefore, the value of Net force $=150 \mathrm{~N}$
A softball has a mass of 1.5 kg and hits the catcher's glove with a force of 30 N ? What is the acceleration of the softball?

\section*{Solution:}

Substituting the values in the above given formula, Acceleration $=30 / 1.5=$ $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} 2$ Therefore, the value of Acceleration is $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} 2$

Question 3: Consider the problem on that on the object having initial mass of 4 kg . Two forces are acting on the object. Force F1 equal to 10 Newton and another force F2 equal to 4 Newton's. Direction of F2 is opposite to the direction of F1. Suppose that mass of the object decreases from 4 kg to 2 kg when forces are applied to the object. Calculate the acceleration of the object.

\section*{Solution:}

Now here the resultant force acting on the object is

\section*{F1}
$-\mathrm{F} 2=10-4=6 \mathrm{~N}$

Resultant force direction is same as the direction of the F1.
Resultant force $=(\mathrm{m} 2-\mathrm{ml}) \mathrm{a}$
Therefore,
$a=62$
$\mathrm{a}=3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec} 2$

\section*{3. Newton's Third Law of Motion}

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and both acts on two different bodies

Mathematically F12 = - F21
Examples
(i) Swimming becomes possible because of third law of motion.
(ii) Jumping of a man from a boat onto the bank of a river.
(iii) Jerk is produced in a gun when bullet is fired from it.

\section*{UNIT 28: LIGHT}

\section*{Unit Objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. State the properties of light
2. Highlight the interference and diffraction of light
3. Explain on the polarization of light

Light is electromagnetic radiation that has properties of waves. The electromagnetic spectrum can be divided into several bands based on the wavelength. Visible light represents a narrow group of wavelengths between about 380 nm and 730 nm
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-140.jpg?height=949&width=1324&top_left_y=1065&top_left_x=238)

Our eyes interpret these wavelengths as different colors. If only a single wavelength or limited range of wavelengths are present and enter our eyes, they are interpreted as a certain color. If a single wavelength is present we say that we have monochromatic light. If all wavelengths of visible light are
present, our eyes interpret this as white light. If no wavelengths in the visible range are present, we interpret this as dark.

\subsection*{28.1 Properties of light}
1. Light travels in straight line.
2. It is made of electric and magnetic vectors that oscillate mutually perpendicular.
3. Direction of wave propagation is perpendicular to both electric and magnetic vectors.
4. It is made of photons. These photons have rest mass zero and they travel with a speed of $3 \times 10^{\wedge} 8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
5. It does not need material medium for propagation.
6. It is transverse in nature.
7. It shows the phenomena of reflection, refraction, diffraction and polarisation.
8. Light rays carry no charge and hence they don't deviate in electric and magnetic fields.
9. Energy possessed by each photon is $E=h f$ where $h$ is Plank's constant ( $6.6 \times 10^{\wedge}-34 \mathrm{Js}$ ) and f is frequency.
10. On passing through prism it separates into constituent colours and what we obtain is called spectrum ( VIBGYOR).
Interaction of Light with Matter
Velocity of Light and Refractive Index
The energy of light is related to its frequency and velocity as follows:
$\mathrm{E}=\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{w}}=\mathrm{hC} / \mathrm{\&}$

Where $\mathrm{E}=$ energy
$\mathrm{h}=$ Planck's constant, $6.62517 \times 10-27 \mathrm{erg} / \mathrm{sec}$
, = frequency
$\mathrm{C}=$ velocity of light $=2.99793 \times 1010 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{sec}$
\& = wavelength

The velocity of light, C , in a vacuum is $2.99793 \times 1010 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{sec}$. Light cannot travel faster than this, but if it travels through a substance, its velocity will decrease. Note that from the equation given above-
$C=\ldots$
The frequency of vibration, , , remains constant when the light passes through a substance. Thus, if the velocity, C, is reduced on passage through a substance, the wavelength, $\&$, must also decrease.

We here define refractive index, $n$, of a material or substance as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum, C , to the speed of light in a material through which it passes, Cm.
$\mathrm{n}=\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{Cm}$
Note that the value of refractive index will always be greater than 1.0, since Cm can never be greater than C . In general, Cm depends on the density of the material, with Cm decreasing with increasing density. Thus, higher density materials will have higher refractive indices.

The refractive index of any material depends on the wavelength of light because different wavelengths are interfered with to different extents by the atoms that make up the material. In general refractive index varies linearly with wavelength.

Materials can be divided into 2 classes based on how the velocity of light of a particular wavelength varies in the material.
1. Materials whose refractive index not depend on the direction that the light travels are called isotropic materials. In these materials the velocity of light does not depend on the direction that the light travels. Isotropic

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
materials have a single, constant refractive index for each wavelength. Minerals that crystallize in the isometric system, by virtue of their symmetry, are isotropic. Similarly, glass, gases, most liquids and amorphous solids are isotropic.
2. Materials whose refractive index does depend on the direction that the light travels are called anisotropic materials. These types of materials will have a range of refractive indices between two extreme values for each wavelength. Anisotropic materials can be further divided into two subclasses, although the reasoning behind these subdivisions will become clear in a later lecture.
a. Minerals that crystallize in the tetragonal and hexagonal crystal systems (as well as some plastics) are uniaxial and are characterized by 2 extreme refractive indices for each wavelength.
b. Minerals that crystallize in the triclinic, monoclinic, and orthorhombic crystal systems are biaxial and are characterized by 3 refractive indices, one of which is intermediate between the other two.

Air, since it is a gas, is isotropic. The refractive index of air is usually taken as 1.0 , although its true value is 1.0003 .

\subsection*{28.2 Reflection and Refraction of Light}

When light strikes an interface between two substances with different refractive indices, two things occur. An incident ray of light striking the interface at an angle, i , measured between a line perpendicular to the interface and the propagation direction of the incident ray, will be reflected off the interface at the same angle, i. In other words the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.

If the second substance is transparent to light, then a ray of light will enter the substance with different refractive index, and will be refracted, or bent,
at an angle $r$, the angle of refraction. The angle of refraction is dependent on the angle of incidence and the refractive index of the materials on either side of the interface according to Snell's Law:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-144.jpg?height=478&width=545&top_left_y=582&top_left_x=256)
$\mathrm{ni} \sin (\mathrm{i})=\mathrm{nr} \sin (\mathrm{r})$
Note that if the angle of incidence is 0 (i.e. the light enters perpendicular to the interface) that some of the light will be reflected directly back, and the refracted ray will continue along the same path. This can be seen from Snell's law, since $\sin (0 o)=0$, making $\sin (r)=0$, and resulting in $r=0$.

There is also an angle, ic, called the critical angle for total internal reflection where the refracted ray travels along the interface between the two substances.

This occurs when the angle $r=90$ o. In this case, applying Snell's law:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-144.jpg?height=481&width=556&top_left_y=1798&top_left_x=248)
$n i \sin (i c)=n r \sin (90 \mathrm{o})=n r \quad[$ since $\sin (90 \mathrm{o})=1]$
$\sin (i c)=n r / n i$

\section*{Dispersion of Light}

The fact that refractive indices differ for each wavelength of light produces an effect called dispersion. This can be seen by shining a beam of white light into a triangular prism made of glass. White light entering such a prism will be refracted in the prism by different angles depending on the wavelength of the light.

The refractive index for longer wavelengths (red) are lower than those for shorter wavelengths (violet). This results in the a greater angle of refraction for the longer wavelengths than for the shorter wavelengths. (Shown here are the paths taken for a wavelength of 800 nm , angle r800 and for a wavelength of 300 nm , angle r300 ). When the light exits from the other side of the prism, we see the different wavelengths dispersed to show the different colors of the spectrum.

\section*{Absorption of Light}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-145.jpg?height=409&width=743&top_left_y=1408&top_left_x=650)

When light enters a transparent material some of its energy is dissipated as heat energy, and it thus loss some of its intensity. When this absorption of energy occurs selectively for different wavelengths of light, they light that gets transmitted through the material will show only those wavelengths of light that are not absorbed. The transmitted wavelengths will then be seen as color, called the absorption color of the material.

For example, if we measure the intensity of light, lo, for each wavelength before it is transmitted through a material, and measure the intensity, I, for
each wavelength after it has passed through the material, and plot $1 / / 0$ versus wavelength we obtain the absorption curve for that material as shown here. The absorption curve (continuous line) for the material in this example shows that the light exiting the material will have a yellow-green color, called the absorption color. An opaque substance would have an absorption curve such as that labeled "Dark", i.e. no wavelengths would be transmitted.

Sunlight, on passing through the atmosphere has absorption curve as shown, thus we see it as white light, since all wavelengths are present.

\subsection*{28.3 Polarization of Light}

Normal light vibrates equally in all direction perpendicular to its path of propagation. If the light is constrained to vibrate in only on plane, however, we say that it is plane polarized light. The direction that the light vibrates is called the vibration direction, which for now will be perpendicular to the direction. There are two common ways that light can become polarized.
- The first involves reflection off of a non-metallic surface, such as glass or paint. An unpolarized beam of light, vibrating in all directions perpendicular to its path strikes such a surface and is reflected. The reflected beam will be polarized with vibration directions parallel to the reflecting surface (perpendicular to the page as indicated by the open circles on the ray path). If some of this light also enters the material and is refracted at an angle 900 to the path of the reflected ray, it too will become partially polarized, with vibration directions again perpendicular to the path of the refracted ray, but in the plane perpendicular to the direction of vibration in the reflected ray (the plane of the paper, as shown in the drawing).

- Polarization can also be achieved by passing the light through a substance that absorbs light vibrating in all directions except one. Anisotropic crystals have this property in certain directions, called privileged directions, and we will discuss these properties when we discuss uniaxial and biaxial crystals. Crystals were used to produce polarized light in microscopes built before about 1950. The device used to make polarized light in modern microscopes is a Polaroid, a trade name for a plastic film made by the Polaroid Corporation. A Polaroid consists of long-chain organic molecules that are aligned in one direction and placed in a plastic sheet. They are placed close enough to form a closely spaced linear grid, that allows the passage of light vibrating only in the same direction as the grid. Light vibrating in all other directions is absorbed. Such a device is also called a polarizer.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-147.jpg?height=554&width=1307&top_left_y=1837&top_left_x=252)

If a beam on non-polarized light encounters a polarizer, only light vibrating parallel to the polarizing direction of the polarizer will be allowed to pass. The light coming out on the other side will then be plane polarized, and will be vibrating parallel to the polarizing direction of the polarizer. If another polarizer with its polarization direction oriented perpendicular to the first polarizer is placed in front of the beam of now polarized light, then no light will penetrate the second polarizer. In this case we say that the light has been extinguished.

Polaroid sunglasses use these same principles. For example, incoming solar radiation is reflected off of the surface of the ocean or the painted hood of your car. Reflected light coming off of either of these surfaces will be polarized such that the vibration directions are parallel to the reflected surface, or approximately horizontal (as in the first method of polarization discussed above). Polaroid sunglasses contain polarizers with the polarization direction oriented vertically. Wearing such glasses will cut out all of the horizontally polarized light reflecting off the water surface or hood of your car.

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Outline the types of optical instrument's
2. Highlight on the powers of lens
3. Explain on the working principles of the microscope

\subsection*{29.1 Types Optical Instruments \\ The Magnifying Glass}

A magnifying glass is a convex lens that lets the observer see a larger image of the object being observed.

\section*{Key Points}
- The magnification of a magnifying glass depends upon where it is placed between the user's eye and the object being viewed and upon the total distance between eye and object.
- The magnifying power is the ratio of the sizes of the images formed on the user's retina with and without the lens.
- $\quad$ The highest magnifying power is obtained by putting the lens very close to the eye and moving both the eye and the lens together to obtain the best focus
- lens: an object, usually made of glass, that focuses or defocuses the light that passes through it
- diopter: a unit of measure of the power of a lens or mirror, equal to the reciprocal of its focal length in meters. Myopia is diagnosed and measured in diopters
- convex: curved or bowed outward like the outside of a bowl or sphere or circle

A magnifying glass is a convex lens that lets the observer see a larger image of the object under observation. The lens is usually mounted in a frame with a handle, as shown below.

The magnification of a magnifying glass depends upon where it is placed between the user's eye and the object being viewed and upon the total distance between eye and object.

The magnifying power is the ratio of the sizes of the images formed on the user's retina with and without the lens.

The highest magnifying power is obtained by putting the lens very close to the eye and moving both the eye and the lens together to obtain the best focus. When the lens is used this way, the magnifying power can be found with the following equation:
$M P 0=14 \cdot \Phi+1$
where $\Phi$
$=$ optical power. When the magnifying glass is held close to the object and the eye is moved away, the magnifying power is approximated by:
$\mathrm{MPO}=14 . \Phi$
Typical magnifying glasses have a focal length of 25 cm and an optical power of four diopters. This type of glass would be sold as a $2 x$ magnifier, but a typical observer would see about one to two times magnification depending on the lens position.

The earliest evidence of a magnifying device was Aristophanes's "lens" from 424 BC, a glass globe filled with water. (Seneca wrote that it could be used to read letters "no matter how small or dim.") Roger Bacon described the properties of magnifying glasses in the 13th century, and eyeglasses were also developed in 13th-century Italy.

\section*{The Camera}

Cameras are optical devices that allow a user to record an image of an object, either on photo paper or digitally.
- Cameras work very similarly to how the human eye works. The iris is similar to the lens; the pupil is similar to the aperture; and the eyelid is similar to the shutter.
- Cameras are a modern evolution of the camera obscura. The camera obscura was a device used to project images.
- The most important part of a camera is the lens, which allows the image to be magnified and focused. This can be done manually on some cameras and automatically on newer cameras.
- Movie cameras work by taking many pictures each second and then showing each image in order very quickly to give the effect that the pictures are moving. This is where the name "movie" comes from.

Key Terms
- shutter speed: The duration of time for which the shutter of a camera remains open when exposing photographic film or other photosensitive material to light for the purpose of recording an image

\section*{What is a Camera?}

A camera is a device that allows you to record images, either on film or digitally. Cameras can record images as well as movies; movies themselves got their name from moving pictures. The word camera comes from the Latin phrase camera obscura, which means "dark chamber. " The camera obscura was an early instrument for projecting images from slides. The camera that you use today is an evolution of the camera obscura.

A camera is usually comprised of an opening, or aperture, that allows light to enter into a hollow area and a surface that records the light at the other end. In the 20th century, these images would be stored on photographic paper that then had to be developed, but now most cameras store images digitally.

\section*{How does a Camera Work?}

Cameras have a lot of components that allow them to work. Let's look at them one at a time.

\section*{The Lens}

The camera lens allows the light to enter into the camera and is typically convex. There are many types of lenses that can be used, each for a different type of photography. There are lenses for close-ups, for sports, for architecture, and for portraits.

The two major features of a lens are focal length and aperture. The focal length determines the magnification of the image, and the aperture controls the light intensity. The f-number on a camera controls the shutter speed. This is the speed at which the shutter, which acts as its "eyelid," opens and closes. The larger the aperture, the smaller the f-number must be in order to get the shutter opened and closed fully. The time it takes to open and close

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
the shutter is called the exposure. shows an example of two lenses of the same size but with different apertures.

\section*{Focus}

Some cameras have a fixed focus, and only objects of a certain size at a certain distance from the camera will be in focus. Other cameras allow you to manually or automatically adjust the focus. shows a picture taken with a camera with manual focus; this allows the user to determine which objects will be in focus and which will not. The range of distance within which objects appear sharp and clear is called the depth of field.

\section*{Exposure}

The aperture controls the intensity of the light entering the camera, and the shutter controls the exposure - the amount of time that the light is allowed into the camera.

\section*{Shutter}

The shutter is what opens and closes to allow light through the aperture. The speed at which it opens and closes is called the f-number. For a larger aperture, the f-number is generally small for a quick shutter speed. For a smaller aperture, the f-number is larger, allowing for a slower shutter speed. The Compound Microscope

A compound microscope is made of two convex lenses; the first, the ocular lens, is close to the eye, and the second is the objective lens.

\section*{Key Points}
- A compound microscope uses multiple lenses to create an enlarged image that is easier for a human eye to see; this is due to the fact that the final image is farther away from the observer, and therefore the eye is more relaxed when viewing the image.
- The object is placed just beyond to focal length of the objective lens. An enlarged image is then captured by the objective lens, which acts as the object for the ocular lens. The ocular lens is closer to the new image than its focal length, causing it to act as a magnifying glass.
- $\quad$ Since the final image is just a multiple of the size of the first image, the final magnification is a product of both magnifications from each lens.

\section*{Key Terms}
- Chromatic aberration: an optical aberration, in which an image has colored fringes, caused by differential refraction of light of different wavelengths

A compound microscope uses multiple lenses to magnify an image for an observer. It is made of two convex lenses: the first, the ocular lens, is close to the eye; the second is the objective lens.

Compound microscopes are much larger, heavier and more expensive than simple microscopes because of the multiple lenses. The advantages of these microscopes, due to the multiple lenses, are the reduced chromatic aberrations and exchangeable objective lenses to adjust magnification.
shows a diagram of a compound microscope made from two convex lenses. The first lens is called the objective lens and is closest to the object being observed. The distance between the object and the objective lens is slightly longer than the focal length, f0. The objective lens creates an enlarged image of the object, which then acts as the object for the second lens. The second or ocular lens is the eyepiece. The distance between the objective lens and the ocular lens is slightly shorter than the focal length of the ocular lens, fe. This causes the ocular lens to act as a magnifying glass to the first image and makes it even larger. Because the final image is inverted, it is farther away from the observer's eye and thus much easier to view.

Diagram of a Compound Microscope: This diagram shows the setup of mirrors that allow for the magnification of images.

Since each lens produces a magnification that multiplies the height of the image, the total magnification is a product of the individual magnifications. The equation for calculating this is as follows:
$\mathrm{m}=\mathrm{mome}$
where m is total magnification, mo is objective lens magnification, me is ocular lens magnification.

\section*{The Telescope}

The telescope aids in observation of remote objects by collecting electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light.

\section*{Key Points}
- Until the invention of silver-backed mirrors, refractive mirrors were the standard for use in telescopes. This was because of the highly corrosive nature of the metals used in older mirrors. Since then, reflective mirrors have replaced refractive mirrors in astronomy.
- There are three main types of optical telescopes: refractive, reflective, and catadioptric.
- Refractive telescopes, such as the one invented by Galileo, use an objective lens and an eyepiece. The image is focused at the focal point and allows the observer to see a brighter, larger image than they would with their own eye.
- Reflective telescopes use curved mirrors that reflect light to form an image. Sometimes a secondary mirror redirects the image to an eyepiece. Other times the image is recorded by a sensor and observed on a computer screen.
- $\quad$ Catadioptric telescopes combine mirrors and lenses to form an image. This system has a greater degree of error correction than other types of telescopes. The combination of reflective and refractive elements allows for each element to correct the errors made by the other.

- Chromatic aberration: an optical aberration, in which an image has colored fringes, caused by differential refraction of light of different wavelengths
- Spherical aberration: a type of lens aberration that causes blurriness, particularly away from the center of the lens
- Achromatic: free from color; transmitting light without color-related distortion

The telescope aids in observation of remote objects by collecting electromagnetic radiation, such as x-rays, visible light, infrared, and submillimeter rays. The first telescopes were invented in the Netherlands in the 1600s and used glass lenses. Shortly after, people began to build them using mirrors and called them reflecting telescopes.

\section*{History}

The first telescope was a refracting telescope made by spectacle makers in the Netherlands in 1608. In 1610, Galileo made his own improved design. After the refracting telescope was invented, people began to explore the idea of a telescope that used mirrors. The potential advantages of using mirrors instead of lenses were a reduction in spherical aberrations and the elimination of chromatic aberrations. In 1668, Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope. With the invention of achromatic lenses in 1733, color aberrations were partially corrected, and shorter, more functional refracting telescopes could be constructed. Reflecting telescopes were not practical because of the highly corrosive metals used to make mirrors until the introduction of silver-coated glass mirrors in 1857.

\section*{Types of Telescopes}

Schematic of Keplerian Refracting Telescope: All refracting telescopes use the same principles. The combination of an objective lens 1 and some type of eyepiece 2 is used to gather more light than the human eye is able to collect on its own, focus it 5 , and present the viewer with a brighter, clearer, and magnified virtual image 6.

The figure above is a diagram of a refracting telescope. The objective lens (at point 1) and the eyepiece (point 2) gather more light than a human eye can collect by itself. The image is focused at point 5 , and the observer is shown a brighter, magnified virtual image at point 6 . The objective lens refracts, or bends, light. This causes the parallel rays to converge at a focal point, and those that are not parallel converge on a focal plane.

\section*{Reflecting Telescopes}

Reflecting telescopes, such as the one shown in, use either one or a combination of curved mirrors that reflect light to form an image. They allow an observer to view objects that have very large diameters and are the primary type of telescope used in astronomy. The object being observed is reflected by a curved primary mirror onto the focal plane. (The distance from the mirror to the focal plane is called the focal length. ) A sensor could be located here to record the image, or a secondary mirror could be added to redirect the light to an eyepiece.

\section*{Catadioptric Telescopes}

Catadioptric telescopes, such as the one shown in, combine mirrors and lenses to form an image. This system has a greater degree of error correction than other types of telescopes. The combination of reflective and refractive elements allows for each element to correct the errors made by the other.

\section*{X-Ray Diffraction}

The principle of diffraction is applied to record interference on a subatomic level in the study of x-ray crystallography.

Key Points
- Diffraction is what happens when waves encounter irregularities on a surface or object and are caused to interfere with each other, either constructively or destructively.
- The Bragg law pertains to applying the laws of diffraction to crystallography in order to obtain precise images of the lattice structures in atoms.
- The x-ray diffractometer is the machine used to scan the object by shooting a wave at it and recording the interference it encounters.
- Most XRDs are equipped with a Soller slit, which acts like a polarizer for the incident beam. It makes sure that the incident beam being recorded is perfectly parallel to the object being analyzed.
- Constructive interference: Occurs when waves interfere with each other crest to crest and the waves are exactly in phase with each other.
- Crystallography: The experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in solids.
- destructive interference: Occurs when waves interfere with each other crest to trough (peak to valley) and are exactly out of phase with each other.

X-ray diffraction was discovered by Max von Laue, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1914 for his mathematical evaluation of observed x-ray diffraction patterns.

Diffraction is the irregularities caused when waves encounter an object. You have most likely observed the effects of diffraction when looking at the bottom of a CD or DVD. The rainbow pattern that appears is a result of the light being interfered by the pits and lands on the disc that hold the data. shows this effect. Diffraction can happen to any type of wave, not just visible light waves.

\section*{Bragg Diffraction}

In x-ray crystallography, the term for diffraction is Bragg diffraction, which is the scattering of waves from a crystalline structure. William Lawrence Bragg formulated the equation for Bragg's law, which relates wavelength to the angle of incidence and lattice spacing. Refer to for a diagram of the following equation: $\mathrm{n} \lambda=2 \mathrm{~d} \sin (\theta)$
- $n$ - numeric constant known as the order of the diffracted beam
- $\lambda$ - wavelength
- d - distance between lattice planes
- $\quad \theta$ - angle of diffracted wave

The waves will experience either constructive interference or destructive interference. Similarly, the x-ray beam that is diffracted off a crystal will have some parts that have stronger energy, and others that lose energy. This depends on the wavelength and the lattice spacing.

\section*{The X-ray Diffractometer}

The XRD machine uses copper metal as the element for the x-ray source. Diffraction patterns are recorded over an extended period of time, so it is very important that the beam intensity remains constant. Film used to be

used to record the data, but that was inconvenient because it had to be replaced often. Now the XRD machines are equipped with semiconductor detectors. These XRD machines record images in two ways, either continuous scans or step scanning. In continuous scans, the detector moves in circular motions around the object, while a beam of x-ray is constantly shot at the detector. Pulses of energy are plotted with respect to diffraction angle. The step scan method is the more popular method. It is much more efficient than continuous scans. In this method, the detector collects data at a single fixed angle at a time. To ensure that the incident beam is continuous, XRD machines are equipped with a Soller slit. This acts like polarized sunglasses by organizing random x-ray beams into a stack of neatly arranged waves parallel to the plane of the detector.

\section*{X-Ray Imaging and CT Scans}

Radiography uses x-rays to view material that cannot be seen by the human eye by identifying areas of different density and composition.

\section*{Key Points}
- Radiography uses x-rays to take pictures of materials with in an object that can not be seen. They shoot x-ray beams through the object, and collect the rays on film or a detector on the other side. Some of the rays are absorbed into the denser materials, and this is how the image is produced.
- X-ray radiographs take images of all the materials within an object superimposed on each other.
- The traditional, superimposed images can be helpful for a number of applications, but CT scans enable the observer to see just the desired sections of a material.
- Modern CT scans can even take all the slices, or layers, and arrange them into a three-dimensional representation of the object.

Key Terms
- radiography: The use of X-rays to view a non-uniformly composed material such as the human body.
- tomography: Imaging by sections or sectioning.
- superimposed: Positioned on or above something else, especially in layers

\section*{Overview}

X-ray imaging, or radiography, used x-rays to view material within the body that cannot be seen by the human eye by identifying areas of different density and composition. CT Scans use the assistance of a computer to take this information, and generate 3 dimensional images.

\section*{X-ray Imaging}

X-ray radiographs are produced by projecting a beam of X-rays toward an object, in medical cases, a part of the human body. Depending on the physical properties of the object (density and composition), some of the X rays can be partially absorbed. The portion of the rays that are not absorbed then pass through the object and are recorded by either film or a detector, like in a camera. This provides the observer with a 2 dimensional representation of all the components of that object superimposed on each other, shows an image of a human elbow.

\section*{CT Scans}

Although generally these scans are shown as in, the information recorded can be used to create a 3 dimensional image of the area, shows a three dimensional image of a brain that was made by compiling CT Scans.

\section*{Specialty Microscopes and Contrast}

Microscopes are instruments that let the human eye see objects that would otherwise be too small.

\section*{Key Points}
- For better resolution, it is important that there is a lot of contrast between the image and the background.
- Microscopes are classified by what interacts with the object, such as light or electrons. They are also classified by whether they take images by scanning a little at a time or by taking images of the entire object at once.
- Some common types of specialty microscopes are scanning electron micrscopes (SEM), transmission electron microscopes (TEM), both of which are electron microscopes, and atomic force microscopes (ATM) which is a scanning probe microscope.
- Contrast: A difference in lightness, brightness and/or hue between two colors that makes them more or less distinguishable

Microscopes are instruments that let the human eye see objects that would otherwise be too small. There are many types of microscopes: optical microscopes, transmission electron microscopes, scanning electron microscopes and scanning probe microscopes.

Classes of Microscopes

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

One way to group microscopes is based on how the image is generated through the microscope. Here are three ways we can classify microscopes:
1. Light or Photon - optical microscopes
2. Electrons - electron microscopes
3. Probe - scanning probe microscopes.

Microscopes can also be classified based on whether they analyze the sample by scanning a point at a time (scanning electron microscopes), or by analyzing the entire sample at once (transmission electron microscopes).

\section*{Types of Microscopes}
- In optical microscopes, the better the contrast between the image and the surface it is being viewed on, the better the resolution will be to the viewer. There are many illumination techniques to generate improved contrast. These techniques include "dark field" and "bright field." With the dark field technique the light is scattered by the object and the image appears to the observer on a dark background. With the bright field technique the object is illuminated from below to increase the contrast in the image seen by viewers.
- Transmission Electron Microscope: The TEM passes electrons through the sample, and allows people to see objects that are normally not seen by the naked eye. A beam of electrons is transmitted through an ultra thin specimen, interacting with the specimen as it passes through. This interaction forms an image that is magnified and focused onto an imaging device.
- Scanning Electron Microscopes: Referred to as SEM, these microscopes look at the surface of objects by scanning them with a fine electron beam. The electron beam of the microscope interacts with the electrons in the sample and produces signals that can be detected and have information about the topography and composition.
- Atomic Force Microscopy: The AFM is a scanning probe type of microscopy with very high resolution and is one of the foremost tools for imaging at the nanoscale. The mechanical probe feels the surface with a cantilever with a sharp tip. The deflection of the tip is then measured using a laser spot that is reflected from the surface of the cantilever.

\section*{Limits of Resolution and Circular Apertures'}

In optical imaging, there is a fundamental limit to the resolution of any optical system that is due to diffraction.

\section*{Key Points}
- Since effects of diffraction become most prominent for waves whose wavelength is roughly similar to the dimensions of the diffracting objects, the wavelength of the imaging beam sets a fundamental limit on the resolution of any optical system.
- The Abbe diffraction limit for a microscope is given as $d=\lambda 2(n \sin \theta)$
- Since the diffraction limit is proportional to wavelength, to increase the resolution, shorter wavelengths can be used such as UV and X-ray microscopes.

\section*{Key Terms}
- Diffraction: The bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle.
- Nanostructure: Any manufactured structure having a scale between molecular and microscopic.
- Aperture: The diameter of the aperture that restricts the width of the light path through the whole system. For a telescope, this is the diameter of the objective lens (e.g., a telescope may have a 100 cm aperture).

The resolution of an optical imaging system (e.g., a microscope, telescope, or camera) can be limited by factors such as imperfections in the lenses or misalignment. However, there is a fundamental maximum to the resolution of any optical system that is due to diffraction (a wave nature of light). An optical system with the ability to produce images with angular resolution as good as the instrument's theoretical limit is said to be diffraction limited.

For telescopes with circular apertures, the size of the smallest feature in an image that is diffraction limited is the size of the Airy disc, as shown in. As one decreases the size of the aperture in a lens, diffraction increases and the
ring features from diffraction become more prominent. Similarly, when imaged objects get smaller, features from diffraction begin to blur the boundary of the object. Since effects of diffraction become most prominent for waves whose wavelength is roughly similar to the dimensions of the diffracting objects, the wavelength of the imaging beam sets a fundamental limit on the resolution of any optical system.

The Abbe Diffraction Limit for a Microscope
The observation of sub-wavelength structures with microscopes is difficult because of the Abbe diffraction limit. In 1873, Ernst Abbe found that light, with wavelength $\lambda$, traveling in a medium with refractive index $n$, cannot be converged to a spot with a radius less than:
$d=\lambda 2(n \sin \theta)$

The denominator nsin $\theta$
is called the numerical aperture and can reach about 1.4 in modern optics, hence the Abbe limit is roughly $d=\lambda / 2$. With green light around 500 nm , the

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Abbe limit is 250 nm which is large compared to most nanostructures, or biological cells with sizes on the order of $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ and internal organelles which are much smaller. Using a 500 nm beam, you cannot (in principle) resolve any features with size less than around 250 nm .

\section*{Improving Resolution}

To increase the resolution, shorter wavelengths can be used such as UV and X-ray microscopes. These techniques offer better resolution but are expensive, suffer from lack of contrast in biological samples and may damage the sample. There are techniques for producing images that appear to have higher resolution than allowed by simple use of diffraction-limited optics. Although these techniques improve some aspect of resolution, they generally involve an enormous increase in cost and complexity. Usually the technique is only appropriate for a small subset of imaging problems.

\section*{Aberrations}

An aberration, or distortion, is a failure of rays to converge at one focus because of limitations or defects in a lens or mirror.

\section*{Key Points}
- There are many types of aberrations, including chromatic, spherical, comatic, astigmatism, and barrel distortion.
- Chromatic aberrations occur due to the fact that lenses have different refractive indexes for different wavelengths, and therefore colors. These aberrations occur right on the edges of images between light and dark areas of the picture.
- Mirrors do not have chromatic aberrations because they do not rely on the index of refraction, but rather the index of reflection, which is independent of wavelength.
- Comatic aberrations are due to imperfections in lenses and cause the point source to be off-center. This can cause images to appear pear-shaped, or cause images to have tails, as with comets.

Key Terms
- Distortion: (optics) an aberration that causes magnification to change over the field of view.
- Refraction: Changing of a light ray's direction when it passes through variations in matter.
- Aberration: The convergence to different foci, by a lens or mirror, of rays of light emanating from one and the same point, or the deviation of such rays from a single focus; a defect in a focusing mechanism that prevents the intended focal point.

\section*{The Basics of Aberrations}

An aberration is the failure of rays to converge at one focus because of limitations or defects in a lens or mirror. Basically, an aberration is a distortion of an image due to the fact that lenses will never behave exactly according to the way they were modeled. Types of aberrations vary due to the size, material composition, or thickness of a lens, or the position of an object.

\section*{Chromatic Aberration}

A chromatic aberration, also called achromatism or chromatic distortion, is a distortion of colors. This aberration happens when the lens fails to focus all the colors on the same convergence point. This happens because lenses have a different index of refraction for different wavelengths of light. The refractive index decreases with increasing wavelength. These aberrations or distortions occur on the edges of color boundaries between bright and dark areas of an image. Since the index of refraction of lenses depends on color or wavelength, images are produced at different places and with different magnifications for different colors. shows chromatic aberration for a single convex lens. Since violet rays have a higher refractive index than red, they are bent more and focused closed to the lens, shows a two-lens system using a diverging lens to partially correct for this, but it is nearly impossible to do so completely.

The law of reflection is independent of wavelength, and therefore mirrors do not have this problem. This is why it is advantageous to use mirrors in telescopes and other optical systems.

\section*{Comatic Aberration}

A comatic aberration, or coma, occurs when the object is off-center. Different parts of a lens of a mirror do not refract or reflect the image to the same
point, as shown in. They can also be result of an imperfection in the lens or other component and result in off- axis point sources. These aberrations can cause objects to appear pear-shaped. They can also cause stars to appear distorted or appear to have tails, as with comets.

\section*{Other Aberrations}

Spherical aberrations are a form of aberration where rays converging from the outer edges of a lens converge to a focus closer to the lens, and rays closer to the axis focus further. Astigmatisms are also a form of aberration in the lenses of the eyes where rays that propagate in two perpendicular planes have different foci. This can eventually cause a monochromatic image to distort vertically or horizontally. Another aberration or distortion is a barrel distortion where image magnification decreases with the distance from the optical axis. The apparent effect is that of an image which has been mapped around a sphere, like in a fisheye lens.

\section*{UNIT 30: ELECTRICITY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM}

\section*{Unit Objectives}

By the end of the unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Define the term magnetism
2. Explain on the magnetization and demagnetization
3. Describe current electricity and electromagnetism
4. State the application of electromagnetism
5. Discuss AC and DC theory and electrochemistry

\subsection*{30.1 MAGNETISM}
- Magnetism is one aspect of the combined electromagnetic force.
- It refers to physical phenomena arising from the force caused by magnets, objects that produce fields that attract or repel other objects.
- Magnets have two poles called North and South.
- Similar (like) magnetic poles repel. Unlike magnetic poles attract. A magnet attracts a piece of iron. The most important of the two properties of attraction and repulsion is repulsion. The only way to tell if an object is magnetized is to see if it repels another magnetized object.
- The strength and direction of a magnetic field is represented by magnetic field lines. Field lines by convention go from North to South. A magnetic field is three-dimensional, although this is not often seen on a drawing of magnetic field lines.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-174.jpg?height=670&width=1155&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=233)

Magnetic fields
A magnet creates a magnetic field around it. You cannot see a magnetic field, but you can observe its effects. A force is exerted on a magnetic material brought into a magnetic field. The force is a non-contact force because the magnet and the material do not have to touch each other
- The field lines come out of the north pole and go into the south pole
- The field lines are more concentrated at the poles

The magnetic field is strongest at the poles, where the field lines are most concentrated.

Field lines also show what happens to the magnetic fields of two magnets during attraction or repulsion.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-174.jpg?height=586&width=1888&top_left_y=1859&top_left_x=235)

173 of 183

Field lines do not lead from one magnet to the other when the magnets repel each other

\subsection*{30.2 MAGNetization and demagnetization Magnetization}

The method of developing the properties of a magnet in a magnetic substance is known as magnetization. A magnetic substance like a piece of iron can be magnetized by electric current or by touching with a magnet. We know about the method of preparing an electromagnet and now we will discuss about the method of preparing a magnet by direct contact.

When an electric current flows in a wire, it creates a magnetic field around the wire. This effect can be used to make an electromagnet. A simple electromagnet comprises a length of wire turned into a coil and connected to a battery or power supply.

\section*{Demagnetization}

The method of removing of the magnetic properties of a magnet is known as demagnetization. It can be done by the following methods:
1. Hitting a magnet heavily by hammer.
2. Heating a magnet at high temperature.
3. Placing two magnets with same poles facing each other.

\subsection*{30.3 Current electricity}

If the two requirements of an electric circuit are met, then charge will flow through the external circuit. It is said that there is a current - a flow of charge. Using the word current in this context is to simply use it to say that something is happening in the wires - charge is moving. Yet current is a physical quantity that can be measured and expressed numerically. As a physical quantity, current is the rate at which charge flows past a point on a
circuit. As depicted in the diagram below, the current in a circuit can be determined if the quantity of charge Q passing through a cross section of a wire in a time $t$ can be measured. The current is simply the ratio of the quantity of charge and time.

The magnetic field of an electromagnet
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-176.jpg?height=779&width=1153&top_left_y=624&top_left_x=261)

The magnetic field around an electromagnet is just the same as the one around a bar magnet. It can, however, be reversed by reversing the current (turning the battery around).

\subsection*{30.4 APPLICATION OF ELECTROMAGNETISM Household appliances}

Electromagnetism serves as a basic principle of working for many of the home appliances in household applications. These applications include lighting, kitchen appliances, air conditioning systems, etc.
- The most dominant use of power in homes as well as commercial buildings is lighting systems. These lighting systems used numerous fluorescent lighting fixtures. Ballasts used in the fluorescent lamps use electromagnetism principle so that at the time of turn ON of the light it produces a high voltage.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-177.jpg?height=882&width=1315&top_left_y=340&top_left_x=237)

\section*{Industrial Applications}

Almost all of the instruments or devices used in industries are based on the electromagnetism. Materials used in constructing such devices include iron, cobalt, nickel, etc which naturally responds to the magnetic fields.

Starting from small control instruments to the large power equipments, the electromagnetism is used at least at one stage of their working.
- Generators and motors dominate in most of the industries which are the primary power source and driving systems respectively. Generators convert the mechanical to electrical energy whereas the motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy.
- Generators supply the electrical energy in the time of mains power interruption and most of the cases, these are driven by the IC engines. There are different classes of motors which are employed in industries. These are used for cranes, hoists, lifts, conveyor

Magnetic Levitation Trains
This is the modern technology of transportation systems that use the concept of electromagnetism. These are called as high speed trains which use powerful electromagnets to develop the speed.

\section*{Communication System}

It is the process of transmitting information from a source to a receiver. This transmission of energy over long distances is carried out through electromagnetic waves at high frequencies. These waves are also called as microwaves or high frequency radio waves.
Suppose in case of mobile phones, sound energy is converted into electromagnetic energy. By using radio transmitters, this electromagnetic energy is transferred to the receiver. At the receiver these electromagnetic waves are again transformed back into sound energy.

\section*{Medical System}

Nowadays electromagnetic fields play a key role in advanced medical equipments such as hyperthermia treatments for cancer, implants and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

RF range frequencies are mostly used in medical applications. In MRI scans, sophisticated equipment works based on the electromagnetism can scan minute details of the human body.

\subsection*{30.5 AC Theory}

Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction, in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction. These currents typically alternate at higher frequencies than those used in power transmission.

\subsection*{30.6 DC THEORY}

The fundamental relationship between voltage, current and resistance in an electrical or electronic circuit is called Ohm's Law. A constant voltage source is called a DC Voltage with a voltage that varies periodically with time is called an AC voltage

\subsection*{30.7 ELECTROCHEMISTRY}

Electrochemistry is the study of chemical processes that cause electrons to move. This movement of electrons is called electricity, which can be generated by movements of electrons from one element to another in a
reaction known as an oxidation-reduction ("redox") reaction. A redox reaction is a reaction that involves a change in oxidation state of one or more elements. When a substance loses an electron, its oxidation state increases; thus, it is oxidized. When a substance gains an electron, its oxidation state decreases, thus being reduced. For example, for the redox reaction

Oxidation is the loss of electrons, whereas reduction refers to the acquisition of electrons, as illustrated in the respective reactions above. The species being oxidized is also known as the reducing agent or reductant, and the species being reduced is called the oxidizing agent or oxidant. In this case, H 2 is being oxidized (and is the reducing agent), while F 2 is being reduced (and is the oxidizing agent).

\section*{UNIT 31: CHARGED PARTICLES}

\section*{Unit Objectives}

By the end of the, unit, the learner should be able to:
1. Identify electric field on charged particles and thermionic emissions
2. State the use of C.R.O and photoelectric effects
3. Explain the production of X-rays and radioactivity

\subsection*{31.1 Electric field on charged particles}

An electric field is a region where a charged particle (such as an electron or proton) experiences a force (an electrical force) without being touched.

If the charged particle is free to move, it will accelerate in the direction of the unbalanced force.

To represent an electric field, we draw electric field lines.

The arrow heads show the direction in which a positively
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_07_1f98a5dfdc5fc3f1e696g-181.jpg?height=508&width=428&top_left_y=1107&top_left_x=1529) charged particle (such as a proton) would accelerate if it was placed in the electric field.

A negatively charged particle (such as an electron) would accelerate in the opposite direction to the arrow heads

\subsection*{31.2 Thermionic emissions}

The process by which free electrons are emitted from the surface of a metal when external heat energy is applied is called thermionic emission.

Thermionic emission occurs in metals that are heated to a very high temperature. In other words, thermionic emission occurs, when large amount
of external energy in the form of heat is supplied to the free electrons in the metals.

\subsection*{31.3 Use of C.R.O}
- Measure short time interval: A CRO can be used to measure time interval between the pulses in a signal which are displayed on the screen. By counting the units of separation of the pulses and multiplying it with the set time/div reading of the knob, one can precisely state the time interval.
- Measure potential difference (as a voltmeter): A CRO provides infinite (practically very high) input impedance just a usual voltmeter while measuring the potential difference. The only difference between them is that the CRO utilizes its screen to display the nature of the voltage being measured, which enables the user to observe the characteristics of the signal.
- Current measurement: Voltage measurements can be used to calculate current flow through a device or through any portion of a circuit. From Ohm's Law:
- Examination of Waveform: Once, the corresponding signal has been measured and displayed, it can be analyzed to obtain its various parameters such as peak-peak voltage, this period etc.
- Measurement of phase: When sine-wave signals of different frequencies are input to the horizontal and vertical amplifiers a stationary pattern is formed on the CRT when the ratio of the two frequencies is an intergral fraction such as $1 / 2,2 / 3,4 / 3,1 / 5$, etc. These stationary patterns are known as Lissajous figures and can be used for comparison measurement of frequencies.
- Measurement of frequency: Frequency can be calculated by simply taking the inverse of the time period of the signal obtained

\subsection*{31.4 Photoelectric effects}

Under the right circumstances light can be used to push electrons, freeing them from the surface of a solid. This process is called the photoelectric effect (or photoelectric emission or photoemission), a material that can exhibit this phenomena is said to be photoemissive, and the ejected electrons are called photoelectrons; but there is nothing that would distinguish them from other electrons.

\subsection*{31.5 Production of X-rays}

X-rays are produced due to sudden deceleration of fast-moving electrons when they collide and interact with the target anode. In this process of deceleration, more than $99 \%$ of the electron energy is converted into heat and less than $1 \%$ of energy is converted into $x$-rays.

\subsection*{31.6 RADIOACTIVITY}

As its name implies, radioactivity is the act of emitting radiation spontaneously. This is done by an atomic nucleus that, for some reason, is unstable; it "wants" to give up some energy in order to shift to a more stable configuration. Radioactivity is a physical, not a biological, phenomenon. Simply stated, the radioactivity of a sample can be measured by counting how many atoms are spontaneously decaying each second.
