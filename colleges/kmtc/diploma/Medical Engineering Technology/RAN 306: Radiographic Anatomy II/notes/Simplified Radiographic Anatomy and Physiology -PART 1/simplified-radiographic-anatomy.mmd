Radiographic anatomy and physiology: involves the study of anatomical structure of human body and its basic physiological mechanisms through the application of medical imaging.
Medical imaging: is the technique and process of creating visual representation of the internal components of a human body for clinical analysis and medical intervention.

\section*{Types of medical imaging modalities:}
1. X-ray radiography
2. Fluoroscopy
3. Computed Tomography scan (CT scan)
4. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
5. Ultrasound (US)
6. Nuclear medicine (isotope scan)
7. Positron Emission Tomography scan (PET scan)

\section*{X-ray Radiography}

It is an imaging technique using X-rays to view the internal structure of an object. X-rays: are high energy, nonvisible and ionizing electromagnetic radiation with short wavelength that can penetrate body parts, during exposure, to produce a radiographic image (Figure 1.1).

Figure 1.1 X-ray imaging

Radiographic Image: is a two dimensional representation of a three dimensional structure, therefore it is made up of multiple overlying structures (Figure 1.2).

Figure 1.2 AP radiographic imaging of the hand

Radio-opaque structures: are internal structures of high density. They will absorb the X-ray beam more than other structures, leading to high attenuation of X-ray beam, (e.g. bones and metals). (Figure 1.3)

Radio-lucent structures: are internal structures of low density. They will absorb the Xray beam less than other structures, leading to low attenuation of X-ray beam, (e.g. soft tissues and air). (Figure 1.4)

Bones will appear as white structures because they highly attenuate X-ray beam.
Soft tissues will appear as grey structures because they minimally attenuate X-ray beam. Air or gas will appear as black structures because they do not attenuate any X-ray beam.

\section*{Fluoroscopy (X-ray screening):}

This imaging technique uses x-rays to produce a moving image on a TV monitor or screen, it enables the examination of moving organs, such as the esophagus during swallowing or heart during contraction (Figure 1.5).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-016.jpg?height=579&width=815&top_left_y=574&top_left_x=405)

\section*{Computed Tomography scan (CT scan)}

It refers to computerized $x$-ray imaging; it is the application of computer to process a group of X-ray images taken from different angles to produce precisely detailed crosssectional images of the internal organs of specific part of human body (Figures 1.7 \& 1.8).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-017.jpg?height=503&width=579&top_left_y=574&top_left_x=375)

Figure 1.8 Sagittal CT scan image of the brain

CT scanner is a ring-shaped machine uses a motorized x-ray tube that rotates around a circular gantry. During a CT scan imaging, the patient lies on a motorized platform that moves slowly through the gantry while the x-ray tube rotates around the patient and produce narrow fan shaped beams of x-rays through the patient. As the x-rays pass through the patient body they are picked up by special array of digital x-ray detectors, which are located directly opposite the x-ray tube, and transmit these attenuated rays to a computer (Figures 1.9 \& 1.10).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-018.jpg?height=712&width=714&top_left_y=626&top_left_x=456)

Figure 1.10 CT scan machine components
The basic principle of CT scan: CT scan is based on the principle that the internal structure of the examined body part can be reconstructed from multiple projections, to build up cross-sectional slices through measurement of the linear attenuation coefficient.

\section*{The Linear Attenuation Coefficient ( $\mu$ ):}

The linear attenuation coefficient describes the fraction of a beam of x-rays that is absorbed or scattered per unit thickness of the medium.
The image of the section irradiated by x-ray is reconstructed from a large number of measurements of attenuation coefficient. It gathers together all the data coming from the elementary volumes of material through the detectors. Using the computer, it presents the elementary surfaces of the reconstructed image from a projection of the data matrix reconstruction, the tone depending on the attenuation coefficients.

Because CT scan image is basically a digital image, it consists of a square matrix of elements (pixel), each of which represents a volume element (voxel) of the tissue of the examined part of the patient. It is typically composed of 512 rows, each of 512 pixels, which means that a square matrix of $512 \times 512=262144$ pixels (one for each voxel). In the process of image reconstruction, the value of the attenuated coefficient for each voxel corresponding to the pixels need to be calculated.
Before the data are presented on the screen, the conventional rescaling was made into CT numbers, expressed in Hounsfield Units (HU).

The Hounsfield scale: (named for the Nobel Prize-winning inventor of CT scan, the British physicist Godfrey N. Hounsfield), The Hounsfield unit (HU) scale is the transformation of the linear attenuation coefficient measurement into the radiodensity of distilled water at standard pressure and temperature (STP), it is defined as zero Hounsfield units (HU), while the radiodensity of air at (STP) is defined as -1000 HU , and the radiodensity of dense materials such as bone is approaching +1000 HU In a voxel.

CT number: it is the value of the calculated x-ray absorption coefficient of a pixel in a CT scan image, expressed in Hounsfield units, where the CT number of water is 0 and that of air is -1000 and of bones is +1000 .

So, the signal transmitted by the detector is processed by the PC in the form of the digital information and the CT image reconstruction.

CT image display: CT scan image is displayed on a black and white monitor with a different shade of gray for each group Hounsfield unit represented (Figure 1.11).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-020.jpg?height=246&width=939&top_left_y=876&top_left_x=339)

Figure 1.11 The display of a group of Hounsfield units to shade of gray. 10 different shades displayed 300 Hounsfield units in the window width.

Although there are more than 2,000 different Hounsfield values, the monitor can display only 256 shades of gray. And the human eye cannot appreciate more than 40 . To overcome these inherent limitations, a gray scale is used in image display. In this system a display processor assigns a certain number of Hounsfield units (HU) to each level of gray. The number of Hounsfield units assigned to each level of gray is determined by the window width.

CT Windowing: also known as grey-level mapping, it is the process in which the CT image grey scale component is manipulated via the CT numbers; in order to clarify the appearance of the picture of the examined structures. The brightness of the image is, adjusted via the window level. The contrast is adjusted via the window width.

Window Width: The window width determines the number of Hounsfield units represented on a specific image. The software assigns shades of gray to CT numbers that fall within the range selected. All values higher than the selected range appear white and any value lower than the range appears black. By increasing the window width, usually referred to as "widening the width," more numbers are assigned to each shade of gray.

Window Level: The window level selects the center CT value of the window width (Figure 1.12). The terms window level and window center are often used interchangeably. The window level selects which Hounsfield numbers are displayed on the image.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-021.jpg?height=310&width=934&top_left_y=499&top_left_x=202)

Figure 1.12 Window width assigns the quantity of pixel values to the gray scale. Window level determines the center pixel value in the gray scale.
Windowing: it is the manipulation of window width and window level to optimize image contrast, the window level should be set at a point that is roughly the same value as the average attenuation number of the tissue of interest, such as lung parenchyma, a window level setting that is intended to display lung parenchyma will be approximately -600 because air-filled lung tissue measures around -600 HU . On the other hand wide window width is better for imaging tissue types of wide variety. For example, in chest imaging, it is necessary to see low- density structures such as lung parenchyma as well as highdensity structures such as contrast enhanced vascular structures.
There are different values of window-width and window level for each examined part of human body (Figure 1.13).

The following table displays the values of width (W) and level (L) are written as in Hounsfield units (HU).

Because CT scan image display is mainly based on tissue density, structures that appear dark on CT scan image are called hypodense, structures that appear bright are called hyperdense, and structures that appear gray are called isodense.

\section*{Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)}

It is the medical imaging that applies a magnetic field and radio wave pulses to build up images of the internal anatomical structure and give information about the physiological processes of the human body.

MRI does not involve the use of ionizing radiation; it is mainly based on the distribution of hydrogen nuclei within different types of body tissue to produces extremely detailed picture of the body soft tissue (Figures $1.14 \& 1.15$ ).

\section*{MRI scanner components:}

MRI scanner is tunnel shaped machine composed of the following components:
1. Large magnet that produces a very strong magnetic field.
2. Radiofrequency coils which produce radiofrequency (RF) signals and receive them from the tissue, they are located within the magnet assembly and relatively close to the patient's body.
3. Gradient coils located within the main magnet, they are three different gradient coils, each one of these produce three different magnetic fields that are each less strong than the main field. The gradient coils create a variable field ( $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}, \mathrm{z}$ ) that can be increased or decreased to allow specific and different parts of the body to be scanned by altering and adjusting the main magnetic field.
4. Patient Table that slides the patient into the MRI machine.
5. Computer System whose major function is to receive, record, and analyze the images of the patient's body that have been scanned. The Computer System is composed of a very sensitive antenna that easily detects the RF signals emitted by the patient's body while undergoing examination and feeds this information in order to be interpreted to produce an understandable image of the body part being examined. (Figure 1.16)

Figure 1.16 MRI machine

\section*{The Basic concept of MRI imaging:}

During the scan, the patient lies on a table that slides inside a tunnel-shaped machine. The position at which the patient lies down on the table is determined by the part of the body that is being scanned. Once the part of the body under examination is in the exact centre of the magnetic field, the scanning process is started (Figure 1.17).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-025.jpg?height=484&width=824&top_left_y=560&top_left_x=248)

Figure 1.17 MRI imaging
In normal circumstances, hydrogen protons of the human body spin on their own axis in a manner very similar to the planet earth, with a north-south pole (Figure 1.18). In this respect hydrogen protons behave like small bar magnets distributed in the body with their axes randomly aligned.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-025.jpg?height=296&width=837&top_left_y=1253&top_left_x=244)

Figure 1.18 Hydrogen protons spin on their own axis in a manner similar to the planet earth

To obtain an MR image of a human body, the following steps take place:
1. First, the human body is placed in a uniform magnetic field in the range between 0.5 to 1.5 Tesla. As a result, the human body's hydrogen protons will precess about the magnetic field direction like gyroscopes and line up, creating a magnetic vector along the axis of the magnetic field (Figure 1.19). This behavior is termed as Larmor precession; the frequency of Larmor precession is proportional to the applied magnetic field strength as defined by the Larmor frequency.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-026.jpg?height=703&width=661&top_left_y=626&top_left_x=495)

Figure 1.19 After magnetization, hydrogen nuclei align with the magnetic field and create a net magnetic moment parallel to the direction of the magnetic field
2. Next, a radio-frequency (RF) pulse with a frequency equal to the Larmor frequency is applied perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field, causing hydrogen nuclei to gradually tilt perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field as in (Figure 1.20). It has been found that there is specific time required for all hydrogen nuclie of each tissue to be organized in the perpendicular direction or transverse to the direction of the magnetic field; known as transverse relaxation timeT2.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-027.jpg?height=738&width=610&top_left_y=575&top_left_x=330)

Figure 1.20 The RF pulse causes the net magnetic moment of the nuclei to tilt perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field
3. The third step when the Radiofrequency pulse stops, the nuclei realign themselves again parallel with the direction of the magnetic field. Returning to equilibrium is referred to as relaxation. During relaxation the nuclei lose energy by emitting their own RF signal (Figure 1.21). This signal is referred to as the free-induction decay (FID) response signal. The FID response signal is measured by a conductive field coil placed around the object being imaged. This measurement is processed or reconstructed to obtain 3D grey-scale MR images on the monitor.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-028.jpg?height=731&width=915&top_left_y=623&top_left_x=374)

Figure 1.21 When the RF pulse stops, the nuclei return to equilibrium again parallel with the direction of the magnetic field, during realignment, the nuclei lose energy and a measurable RF signal is processed to obtain 3D grey-scale MR images on the monitor.

Time required for all hydrogen nuclei of each tissue to return to equilibrium again parallel with the direction of the magnetic field and to be organized in this direction is known as longitudinal relaxation timeT1.

According to the strength of the bond between hydrogen nuclei of different types of tissues, there are four types of tissues:
1. Fluids: the strength of the bond between hydrogen nuclei of fluids is not very strong and not very weak, allowing them to move freely.
2. Fats: the strength of the bond between hydrogen nuclei of fats is similar to fluids, allowing them also to move freely.
3. Solids: the liking bond between hydrogen nuclei of solids is very strong, which does not allow them to move freely.
4. Gasses: there no bond liking between hydrogen nuclei of gasses.

\section*{MRI image display:}

There are many types of MR images their display depends on many factors:
1. T1 weighted MR Image: in this type of image, displayed tissue contrast depends on the longitudinal relaxation time hydrogen nuclei of each tissue. According to tissue characteristics, solids and gasses haven't got relaxation time, because the bond between hydrogen nuclei of solids is very strong and there no bond liking between hydrogen nuclei of gasses, there for solids and gasses appear dark in T1 weight image, while fats have short relaxation time because quickly realigns its longitudinal magnetization therefore appears bright on a T1 weighted image. Conversely, fluids has much slower longitudinal magnetization realignment after RF pulse, therefore it has less transverse magnetization after an RF pulse. Thus, fluids has low signal and appears dark (Figure 1.22).
2. T2 weighted MR Image: this type of image depends on the transverse relaxation time of hydrogen nuclei of each tissue after application of the RF pulse, as mentioned above, solids and gasses haven't got relaxation time and consequently they haven't got transverse relaxation time, so solids and gasses appear dark in T2 weight image, because transverse relaxation basically depends on the net magnetization vector and the radiofrequency pulse, fats and fluids appear bright in T 2 weighted image(Figure 1.23).
3. Proton density weighted MR image: The voxel intensity of this type of MR image displayed on MR monitor of a specific tissue type depends on the proton density of the tissue; the higher the proton density, the stronger the FID response signal, Fluids appear white but darker than the fluid signal in T2 images, and Fats appear bright but slightly darker than the fat signal in T 1 images (Figure 1.24).

\section*{MRI image terminology:}
- Hyperintense: refer to areas of high intensity, which appear bright on MR Image.
- Hypointense: refer to areas of low intensity, which appear dark on MR Image.
- Isointense: refer to areas of medium intensity, which appear gray on MR Image.

\section*{Ultrasound}

It is an imaging method that uses sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing to produce sonographic images of structures within human body. The images can provide valuable information for diagnosing and treating a variety of diseases and conditions (Figure 1.25).

\section*{Basic principle of ultrasound:}

Ultrasound uses high frequency sounds, generally range between $2-15 \mathrm{MHz}$. Ultrasound is produced and detected using an ultrasound transducer, the transducer is mainly composed of piezoelectric crystal that converts electrical energy to mechanical energy through what is known as the piezoelectric effect. When an alternating current applied across the piezoelectric crystal it grows and shrinks causes it to vibrate at a high speed and to produce an ultrasound. Produced ultrasound waves travel through the human body and interact with various organs, sound then bounces back off the object under investigation in the form of echoes. Reflected sound (echo) hits the piezoelectric crystal and then has the reverse effect occur causing the mechanical energy produced from the sound vibrating the crystal to be converted into electrical energy. By measuring the time between when the sound was sent and received in the form of echo, the amplitude of the sound and the pitch of the sound, a computer can produce images, calculate depths and calculate speeds.

\section*{Ultrasound Image display:}

Ultrasound image can be displayed in several modes:
The A-mode: also known as amplitude mode, it is the oldest and simplest ultrasound technique. In this mode a single transducer sends pulses of ultrasound into the medium, these ultrasound pulses encounter the boundary of the different tissues leading to generation of echo spikes which will be displayed in a simple one-dimensional image with a series of vertical peaks (Figure 1.26).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-033.jpg?height=409&width=587&top_left_y=638&top_left_x=367)

Figure 1.26 The A-mode of ultrasound image displaying a series of vertical peaks
The B-mode: it is a two-dimensional image in which the amplitude of the echo from a series of A-scans is converted into dots of different levels of brightness in B-mode imaging. The horizontal and vertical directions represent real distances in tissue, whereas the intensity of the gray scale indicates echo strength (Figure 1.27). B-mode can provide an image of a cross section through the area of interest, and it is the primary mode currently used.

Figure 1.27 B-mode of ultrasound image displaying the liver

The M-mode: it is referred to as motion mode representing display of time motion of ultrasound wave along a specific line of ultrasound. M-mode is mainly applied for moving structures such as cardiac valves, it has high sampling rate, leading to high time resolution to displaying and measurement of rapidly moving structures (Figure 1.28).

Figure 1.28 M-mode displaying movement of the mitral valve

The Doppler mode: this mode is based on the fact that relative motion between the sound source and the sound receiver will lead to change in the frequency or wavelength of a sound wave. Sound waves will be squeezed if the sound source moves toward the sound receiver, leading to positive Doppler shift, and sound waves will be stretched if the sound source moves away from the receiver, leading to negative Doppler shift.
Color Doppler prodúces a color-coded map of Doppler shifts superimposed onto a Bmode ultrasound image. Blood flow direction depends on whether the motion is toward or away from the transducer (Figure 1.29)

\section*{Echogenicity:}

Echogenicity is the ability of a tissue to reflect an ultrasound wave; it is a measure of acoustic reflectance which is due to impedance mismatching between tissues. Echogenicity of tissues is displayed on ultrasound image in the form of brightness level.
- Anechoic structures: refer to structures that appear as completely black areas on US image, they do not have internal echoes. Examples of these structures include cysts, urinary bladder, gallbladder and ascites (Figure 1.30).
- Hypoechoic structures: refer to structures that appear as dark areas on US Image, they give few echoes. Examples of these structures include lymph nodes, congested structures and tumors (Figure 1.31).
- Hyperechoic structures: refer to structures that appear as bright areas on US Image. These structures are of high density and give large amount of echoes. Examples of these structures include bones, fibrous tissue, calcified structures and lipomas (Figure 1.32).
- Isoechoic structures: refer to structures that appear as gray areas on US Image.

These structures are of moderate density such as liver and spleen, these structures give moderate number of echoes (Figure 1.33).

\section*{Nuclear medicine (Isotope scan)}

It is based on injecting radioactive material (isotope) into a vein or introducing it orally (by swallow), the radioactive material will concentrate in a particular organ or tissue, such as the Thyroid gland or kidney. It will emit gamma rays, which are type of radiation that behaves like X-rays. A special camera detects the gamma rays coming out of the particular organ and builds up an image of that organ (Figures $1.34 \& 1.35$ ).

Figure 1.35 Renal Isotope scan

Isotope bone scanning is an excellent screening for bone metastases, in this method bone metastases usually appear as multiple foci of increased activity, although they occasionally manifest as areas of decreased uptake. The technique is performed with technetium-99m-labeled diphosphonates. These compounds accumulate rapidly in bone, and by $2-6$ hours after injection, about $50 \%$ of the injected dose is in the skeletal system. The degree of radiotracer uptake depends primarily on two factors: blood flow and, perhaps more importantly, the rate of new bone formation. The presence of multiple, randomly distributed areas of increased uptake of varying size, shape, and intensity are highly suggestive of bone metastases (Figure 1.36).

Anatomical terminology is composed of:
1. Anatomical Position
2. Regional Terms
3. Directional Terms
4. Body Planes
5. Body Cavities and Serous Membranes

Anatomical Position: For precision, there is standard way to view the human body anatomically. It is that of the human body standing upright position and facing forward, with straight, parallel feet and at shoulder width with toes directed forward, the upper limbs are held out to each side, and the palms facing forward with extended fingers and thumb points anteriorly (Figure 2.1).

Anatomical Planes: a plane is an imaginary two-dimensional surface that passes through the body (Figure 2.11). There are three planes commonly referred to in anatomy and medicine:
1. The sagittal plane.
2. The coronal plane.
3. The transverse plane.

\section*{Body Cavities:}

The body maintains its internal organization by means of membranes, sheaths, and other structures that separate the body into two main compartments:
1. The dorsal (posterior) cavity.

\section*{2. The ventral (anterior) cavity.}

These cavities contain and protect delicate internal organs, and allow for significant changes in the size and shape of the organs as they perform their functions. The lungs, heart, stomach, and intestines, for example, can expand and contract without distorting other tissues or disrupting the activity of nearby organs.
The dorsal (posterior) cavity: this cavity is subdivided into two main cavities:
1. The cranial cavity houses the brain.
2. The spinal cavity (vertebral cavity) encloses the spinal cord.

The cranial and spinal cavities are continuous. The brain and spinal cord are protected by the bones of the skull and vertebral column and by cerebrospinal fluid.
The anterior (ventral) cavity: it has two main subdivisions:
1. The thoracic cavity: is the superior subdivision of the anterior cavity
2. The abdominopelvic cavity: is the inferior subdivision of the anterior cavity.

The thoracic cavity is enclosed by the rib cage and contains the lungs and the heart, which is located in the mediastinum. The diaphragm forms the floor of the thoracic cavity and separates it from the inferior abdominopelvic cavity.
The abdominopelvic cavity: is the largest cavity in the body, it is divided into two part the abdominal part houses the digestive organs and the pelvic part houses the organs of reproduction (Figures $2.18 \& 2.19$ ).

\section*{TISSUE}

Tissue is an assembly of similar cells with extracellular matrix; they are both from the same embryonic origin that arranged in an orderly pattern to carry out a specific function. The functional grouping of multiple tissues leads to the formation of different body organs.
There are four broad categories of tissues:
1. Epithelial tissue.
2. Connective tissue.
3. Muscular tissue.
4. Nervous tissue.

\section*{Epithelial Tissues}

Epithelial tissues are essentially large sheets of cells covering all the surfaces of the body. They cover the external surfaces of the body such as skin, and form the inner lining of the internal organs that are exposed to the external environment, such as the inner lining of the digestive tract, respiratory tract, urinary tract and reproductive organs. Epithelial tissues form the lining of hollow parts of every organ such as heart and the ventricular system of the brain. They also form the glandular tissue of the body.
Epithelial tissues are highly cellular, with little or no extracellular material present between cells.
Cells that are making up epithelial tissues are often closely bound together through specialized structures called tight junctions.
Epithelial tissues are free from blood vessels and nerves and are supported by a connective tissue called the basement membrane, which are always attached to the inner layer of epithelial tissue.

Figure 3.1 Epithelial Tissues

\section*{Functions of Epithelial Tissues:}
1. Epithelial tissues provide protection from physical, chemical, and biological wear and tear.
2. All substances that enter the body must cross the epithelial tissues.
3. Epithelial tissues control permeability and allow selective transfer of materials.
4. Some epithelial cells are capable of secreting mucous and chemical compounds, such as the epithelium of the small intestine releases digestive enzymes.
5. Epithelial tissue can be involved in movement of substances, such as the epithelium lining the bronchioles contain cilia that move mucus and trapped microorganisms to improve immune function.
6. Some epithelial tissues can stretch and expand the capacity of the organ, such as the epithelial lining of the urinary bladder.

\section*{Types of Epithelial Tissues:}

There are two types of epithelial tissues classification:
1. Classification based on and the shape of the epithelial cells.
2. Classification based on the number of cell layers that from the epithelial tissue.

\section*{Classification of the shape of the epithelial cells:}
1. Squamous epithelial tissue: consists of extremely thin and flattened cells that resemble the scales of a fish (Figures $3.2 \& 3.3$ ).
2. Cuboidal epithelial tissue: contains cells that are square in shape, as wide as it is tall. (Figures $3.4 \& 3.5$ ).
3. Columnar epithelial tissue: consists of elongated cell of rectangular shape (Figures $3.6 \& 3.7)$.

\section*{Classification of the number of epithelial cell layers:}
1. Simple epithelia: this type of epithelium: composed of a single layer of cells.
2. Stratified epithelia: this type contains two or more layers of cells (Figures 3.8 \& 3.9).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-061.jpg?height=240&width=731&top_left_y=540&top_left_x=303)

Figure 3.9 Microseopic sample of stratified epithelium

\section*{The combination of the two classifications gives the following types of epithelium: Simple Epithelium:}
1. Simple squamous epithelium
2. Simple cuboidal epithelium
3. Simple columnar epithelium

\section*{Stratified Epithelium:}
1. Stratified squamous epithelium
2. Stratified cuboidal epithelium
3. Stratified columnar epithelium

Simple squamous epithelium: Because this type of epithelial tissue is composed of one layer of flat and thin cells, it is present where rapid passage of chemical compounds is needed, such as:
1. The lining of blood vessels where blood pass for gas exchange.
2. The alveoli of lungs where gasses pass by diffusion.
3. The tubules of kidney where blood is filtered.

\section*{Simple cuboidal epithelium:}

This layer have a secretory function and absorptive function, it is present in the thyroid gland to secrete thyroid hormones and the collecting ducts of the kidney to absorb the components of blood filtration that form urine.

\section*{Simple columnar epithelium:}

This layer is active in the absorption and secretion of molecules. Simple columnar epithelium forms the lining of some sections of the digestive system and parts of the female reproductive tract. The cells of this layer are ciliated and involved in the movement of particles; they are found in the lining of the fallopian tubes, where they are involved in the movement of the ovum towards the uterus, and are found in some parts of the respiratory system to remove foreign particles.

Stratified squamous epithelium: It is the most common type of stratified epithelium in the human body. As it is composed of multiple layers, the apical layer of cells are exposed to the external environment, while the inner layer is in direct contact with the basement membrane, these tissues often have a protective role against friction, abrasion and other environmental factors. This layer is mainly found in skin. There are many dead and keratinized cells in the apical layer, providing protection against external environmental factors and prevents loss of water and nutrients.

Stratified cuboidal epithelium: This layer is located around the ducts of many glands, including mammary glands in the breast and salivary glands in the mouth.

Stratified columnar epithelium: This layer is rare, mainly found in the conjunctiva of the eye and in some organs of the reproductive system (Table: 3.1).

\section*{Connective tissues}

Connective tissues are essential part of body. Their main function is to connect tissues and organs.
Connective tissues have three characteristic components:
1. Cells.
2. Ground substance.
3. Protein fibers.

Connective tissue is mainly composed of the ground substance in which cells are dispersed in, and crisscrossed by protein fibers.
The ground substance: is the main component of the connective tissue, it is mainly composed of the extracellular material, it is usually fluid in nature such as blood, but it can also be mineralized and become solid, as in bones, the ground substance plays a major role in the functioning of the connective tissue.
Protein fibers: There are three types of fibers in the intercellular matrix of connective tissue: (1) collagen fibers, (2) reticular fibers, and (3) elastic fibers

\section*{Classification of connective tissues:}

Connective tissues are classified according to the characteristics of their ground substance and the types of fibers found within it into three main types:
1. Connective tissues proper: such as tendons, ligaments and adipose tissue.
2. Supportive connective tissues: such as bone and cartilage.
3. Fluid connective tissues: such as blood and lymph.

Connective tissue proper: it includes two types of tissues:
1. Loose connective tissues they commonly lie between other tissues or between organs, binding them together such as Adipose tissue.
2. Dense connective tissues: such as
1) Tendons: connect muscles to bones.
2) Ligaments: connect bones to other bones at joints.

Supportive connective tissues: provide strength and support to the body and protect soft tissues. Fibers of supportive connective tissue are densely packed in the ground substance. Supportive connective tissues include:
1. Bone: it is the most rigid type of the connective tissues. It has an extremely hard ground substance of calcium salts, deposited around protein fibers.
2. Cartilage: it is a flexible type of connective tissue with special type of cells known as chondrocytes; these cells are dispersed in flexible rubbery gelatinous ground substance known as chondrin.
Fluid connective tissues: it is liquid in nature with circulating cells in extracellular matrix. There are two type of fluid connective tissue.
1. Blood: is a connective tissue composed of cells suspended in a liquid matrix called plasma.
2. Lymph contains a liquid matrix and white blood cells.

\section*{General Functions of connective tissues:}
1. Connective tissues support and connect other tissues.
2. Protection is a major function of connective tissue, in the form of fibrous capsules and bones that protect delicate organs.
3. Transportation of fluid, gases, nutrients, waste products, and other chemical materials is the function fluid connective tissues, such as blood and lymph.
4. Fatty connective tissue store energy in the form of fat and contribute to the thermal insulation of the body.

\section*{Muscular tissues}

Muscular tissues are highly specialized tissues for the production of tension which results in the generation of force that allows movement.

\section*{Properties of Muscular tissue:}
1. Muscle cells are contractile: they can shorten and generate a pulling force.
2. Muscle cells are excitable: they contract as a response to stimulation.
3. Muscles cause the bones to move: they are attached between two movable bones, when muscles contract between these bones, the bones start to move.
Types of Muscular tissue: Muscular tissue is classified according their structure and function into three types:
1. Skeletal muscles.
2. Cardiac muscles.
3. Smooth muscles.

The Skeletal muscles: are attached to the bones and their contraction leads to skeletal movement. $40 \%$ of body mass is made up of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscles generate heat as a byproduct of their contraction and thus participate in thermal homeostasis. Shivering is an involuntary contraction of skeletal muscles in response to low body temperature (Figure 3.10).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-066.jpg?height=437&width=722&top_left_y=986&top_left_x=443)

Figure 3.10 Skeletal muscle fibers found in skeletal muscles

The Cardiac muscles: form the contractile walls of the heart; they contract on their own intrinsic rhythms without any external stimulation. They pump blood through the body and under involuntary control (Figure 3.11).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-067.jpg?height=259&width=610&top_left_y=480&top_left_x=354)

Figure 3.11 Cardiac muscle fibers found in the heart
The Smooth muscles: their contraction is responsible for involuntary movements in the internal organs. They form the contractile component of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems as well as the airways and arteries (Figure 3.12).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-067.jpg?height=371&width=723&top_left_y=894&top_left_x=301)

\section*{The Nervous Tissue}

Nervous Tissue is an excitable tissue and capable of sending and receiving electrochemical signals that provide the body with information.
There are two main classes of cells that make up nervous tissue:
1. The neuron
2. The neuroglia

The neurons: have got a characteristic morphology helps them to play their role as conducting cells, with three main parts (Figure: 3.13).
1. The cell body includes most of the cytoplasm, the organelles, and the nucleus.
2. The dendrites branch off the cell body and appear as thin extensions.
3. The axon a long tail extends from the neuron body and can be wrapped in an insulating layer known as myelin, which is formed by accessory cells.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-068.jpg?height=463&width=870&top_left_y=801&top_left_x=390)

Figure 3.13 Illustration of the Neuron

Myelin is a fatty white substance that surrounds the axon of some nerve cells, forming an electrically insulating layer.
The main purpose of a myelin sheath is to increase the speed at which impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber. Nerve pulses move as waves along unmyelinated fibers, but they "hop" or propagate by salutatory conduction, in myelinated fibers (Figure.3.14).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-069.jpg?height=591&width=801&top_left_y=538&top_left_x=264)

Figure.3.14 Nerve pulses move as waves along unmyelinated fibers, but they "hop" or propagate by salutatory conduction, in myelinated fibers.

The Synapse: is the gap between nerve cells, or between a nerve cell and its target, such as a muscle or a gland, across which impulses are transmitted by chemical compounds known as neurotransmitters (Figure.3.15).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-069.jpg?height=409&width=617&top_left_y=1336&top_left_x=343)

Figure.3.15 Structure of Synapse

The neurotransmitters: are chemical compounds known as chemical messengers, they transmit signals across the synapse, there are many different neurotransmitters including: dopamine, adrenaline, histamine and serotonin.
The neuroglia: also known as glial cells. The word "glia" comes from the Greek word for glue. long ago it was believed that neuroglia are glue like material that does not play any role in neuro-transmission, however recent advances have demonstrated that neuroglia are special types of non-neuronal cells that are part of the nervous system but does not convey pulses, they primarily support the neurons and play a key role in synapse formation and maintenance.
Functions of Neuroglia: they have many vital functions, including:
1. Formation of myelin.
2. Provide nutrition for neurons, including oxygen.
3. Provide a general support structure for neurons.
4. Neuroglia provide protection for neurons by:
5. Destroying pathogens.
6. Formation of the blood-brain barrier, the membrane that separates the circulatory system from the brain.
7. Digest the parts of dead neurons.
8. It is very important to know that neuroglia do not convey nerve pulses.

Types of neuroglia: There are six main types of neuroglia:
1. Astrocytes.
2. Oligodendrocytes.
3. Ependymal Cells.
4. Schwann Cells.
5. Satellite Cells.
6. Microglia.

Astrocytes: They are named astrocytes because they are star shaped, they supply nutrients to cells of the nervous tissue, repair and regenerate damaged spinal cord and brain cells and support cells of the blood-brain barrier (Figure.3.16).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-070.jpg?height=308&width=505&top_left_y=1416&top_left_x=554)

Figure.3.16 Astrocyte

Oligodendrocytes: They produce the myelin sheath that surrounds axons; provide support to nerves and axons (Figure.3.17).

Figure.3.18 Ependymal Cells

Schwann cells: these cells play a supporting role in the nervous system by wrapping around nerve tissue and cells to form a protective myelin sheath; they are involved in nerve regeneration, repair and development (Figure.3.19).

Figure.3.19 Schwann cells

Satellite cells: they surround neurons in the sympathetic and parasympathetic, sensory ganglia. They inform the body about impending danger and stress and prepare it for an appropriate fight-or-flight response (Figure.3.20).

\section*{Components of Skeletal System}

The skeletal system is composed of:
1. Bones: form the rigid part of the skeletal system, they support and protect the body and its organs.
2. Cartilage: are of intermediate firmness to provide flexible support for certain structures in the human body.
3. Joints: are the areas where two or more bones meet, they are mobile, allowing the bones to move.
4. Tendons: are bands of fibrous connective tissue that connects muscles to bones.
5. Ligaments: are band of connective tissue that connects bones to another bones.
6. Fascia: are sheets of connective tissue join muscles together, they stabilize, enclose, and separate muscles.

\section*{1. Bones}

Bones are the hard and dense connective tissues that form most of the skeleton. They represent the structural and supportive part of the human body.

\section*{Types of Bone:}
1. Long Bones.
2. Short Bones.
3. Flat Bones.
4. Irregular Bones.
5. Sesamoid Bones.

Long Bones: they are cylindrical in shape, being longer than they are wide. Long bones are found in the arms (humerus, ulna, radius) and legs (femur, tibia, fibula), as well as in the fingers (metacarpals, phalanges) and toes (metatarsals, phalanges). Long bones function as levers; they move due to muscular contraction (Figure.4.9 \& 4.10).

Short Bones: they are cube-like in shape, being approximately equal in length, width, and thickness. The only short bones in the human skeleton are in the carpals of the wrists and the tarsals of the ankles. Short bones provide stability and support as well as some limited motion (Figures.4.11 \& 4.12).

\section*{Anatomical parts of long bone:}

A long bone is composed of three parts:
1. The diaphysis: represents the medial part of the bone.
2. The epiphysis: represents the distal end of the bone.
3. The metaphysis: represents the portion between the diaphysis and the epiphysis (Figure.4.19).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-087.jpg?height=320&width=733&top_left_y=1423&top_left_x=300)

Figure.4.19 Anatomical parts of long bone
1. The diaphysis: is the tubular shaft that runs between the proximal and distal ends of the bone. It contains:
1) The medullary cavity: it is the hollow region in the diaphysis.
2) The compact bone: it is the wall of the diaphysis, mainly composed of dense and hard bone.
3) The Periosteum: it is the tough fibrous layer that envelopes the bone.
4) The Endosteum: it is the inner layer that lines the medullary cavity (Figure.4.20).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-088.jpg?height=492&width=604&top_left_y=607&top_left_x=498)

Figure.4.20 Structural components of Diaphysis
2. The epiphysis: is the wider section at each end of the bone, it is composed of:
1) Spongy bone: fills the inner part of epiphysis.
2) Compact bone: form the outer layer of epiphyses.
3) Articular cartilage: covers the articular surface of epiphysis (Figure 4.21).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-088.jpg?height=390&width=951&top_left_y=1318&top_left_x=329)

Figure.4.21 Epiphysis
3. The Metaphysis: is the narrow portion of a long bone between the epiphysis and the diaphysis. It contains the growth plate, for growth during childhood; it is rich in blood supply which makes it prone to infection in childhood leading to osteomyelitis (Figure 4.22).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-089.jpg?height=448&width=511&top_left_y=500&top_left_x=401)

Structural components of the Bone: basically any bone is composed of the following four components:
1. Periosteum: is a dense fibrous layer that coyers the outer surface of all bones, except at the joints of long bones. It contains nerve fibers that cause pain when the tissue is damaged. It also contains many blood vessels, which penetrate the bone to supply the bone cells. The periosteum represents the layer where ligaments and tendons attach to the bone.
2. Compact (Cortical) bone: Also known as (Cortical) bone. It is the strongest and densest part of the bone; it is found under the periosteum and forms the hard outer shell around spongy bone in the diaphysis of long bones, where it provides support and protection. Its main function is to provide support and protection. It is the primary component of the long bones of the arm and leg and other bones, where its greater strength and rigidity are needed, it contains many tiny passages for blood vessels and nerves and houses the cells that repair and maintain bones. Compact bone represents the main component of the shaft of long bones covered with the periosteum, where it provides strength and rigidity for long bones (Figure 4.23).
3. Spongy (Cancellous) Bone: also known as the (Cancellous) bone. It is made up of spongy, porous, bone tissue that is filled with red bone marrow. It is very important for producing blood cells. It is found in the ends of long bones and in the bones of the pelvis, ribs, vertebrae, and skull (Figure 4.23).
4. Endosteum: is a thin vascular membrane of connective tissue that lines the inner surface of the bony tissue that forms the medullary cavity of long bones.
5. The medullary cavity: is the central cavity of bone shafts (Diaphysis) it contains:

1- Red bone marrow: where new blood cells are produced.
2- Yellow bone marrow: where adipose tissue is stored.

\section*{Bone Development:}

At 3 month fetal life an early skeleton-like framework composed of cartilage and connective tissue membrane starts to develop. As the fetus matures, the cartilage and connective tissue change into bone. The formation of bones is called (Ossification), it occurs in different ways in flat and long bones.
Ossification: is the process of new bone formation by laying down new bone material by cells called osteoblasts.
There are two processes resulting in the formation of normal, healthy bone tissue: -
1- Intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. It is involved in the formation of the flat bones.
2- Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. It is involved in the formation of long bones.

\section*{Intramembranous Ossification:}

Intramembranous ossification is one of the two essential processes of bone formation during fetal development it involves replacement of thin membrane of connective tissue with new bone, it is mainly involved in the formation of the flat bones of the skull, the mandible, and the clavicles. Intramembranous ossification is also an essential process during the natural healing of bone fractures and the rudimentary formation of the bones of the head.

\section*{Steps of Intramembranous ossification:}
1. Development of the Ossification Center: a group of mesenchymal cells enlarge and become rounded to differentiate into osteoblasts, these osteoblasts cluster together to and secrete an extracellular matrix known as osteoid to form an ossification center (Figure 4.26).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-092.jpg?height=352&width=737&top_left_y=1204&top_left_x=349)

Figure 4.26 Development of the Ossification Center
2. Calcification of osteoid: clustered osteoblasts secrete calcium and other minerals into the spaces between the thin connective tissue membranes and around the framework of collagen, leading to the calcification of the osteoid. Trapped osteoblasts within the calcifying osteoid become known as osteocytes (Figure 4.27).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-093.jpg?height=354&width=750&top_left_y=365&top_left_x=342)

Figure 4.27 Calcification of osteoid
3. New bone formation and Periosteum Development: The non-mineralized portion of the osteoid forms the spongy bone around blood vessels, the superficial part of spongy bone remodels into a thin layer of compact bone, the matrix differentiates into red bone marrow. Mesenchymal cells at periphery condense to form periosteum (Figure $4.28 \& 4.29$ ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-093.jpg?height=371&width=746&top_left_y=966&top_left_x=194)

Figure 4.29 formation of spongy and compact bone and periosteum

\section*{Endochondral Ossification:}

Endochondral ossification is the second essential processes of bone formation during fetal development. It involves the replacement of hyaline cartilage with bony tissue. It occurs in most of the bones of the skeleton. It is essential during the growth of the length of long bones, and the natural healing of bone fractures.

\section*{Steps of Endochondral ossification:}
1. Development of the Fetal Cartilage Model: Endochondral ossification begins when mesenchyme cells aggregate and differentiate into Chondrocytes which secrete a matrix to form hyaline cartilage model, this cartilage model will be surrounded by a layer of dense irregular connective tissue known as perichondrium (Figure 4.30).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-094.jpg?height=361&width=308&top_left_y=723&top_left_x=659)

Figure 4.30 Fetal Cartilage Model
2. Periosteum and calcified cartilage formation: The perichondrium of the diaphysis begins to calcify and becomes the periosteum, internally, chondrocytes in the diaphysis begin to accumulate glycogen, undergo hypertrophy and produce alkaline phosphatase and the surrounding matrix begins to calcify leading to calcified cartilage formation(Figure 4.31).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-094.jpg?height=371&width=452&top_left_y=1334&top_left_x=578)

Figure 4.31 Periosteum and calcified cartilage formation
3. Primary ossification center formation: Blood vessels and osteoblasts from periosteum begin to invade the calcified cartilage leading to primary ossification center formation in the diaphysis; Osteoblasts begin to lay down bone matrix, leading to cancellous bone formation.
4. Secondary Ossification Center formation: Chondrocytes in epiphyses undergo hypertrophy, the cartilage matrix compressed, calcifies, and dies, which open up spaces between spicules of calcified cartilage, blood vessels enter spaces in epiphyses and secondary ossification centers develop, a medullary cavity begins to form in the center of the diaphysis. (Figure 4.32).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-095.jpg?height=410&width=907&top_left_y=705&top_left_x=215)

Figure 4.32 Primary and secondary ossification centers formation
5. Epiphyseal plate articular cartilage formation: The original cartilage model becomes almost completely ossified. Unossified cartilage becomes the epiphyseal plate and the articular cartilage.
6. Mature bone formation: Epiphyseal plates gradually ossify and become the epiphyseal lines, all the cartilage become bone except the articular cartilage (Figure 4.33).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-095.jpg?height=312&width=990&top_left_y=1397&top_left_x=178)

\section*{2. Cartilage}

Cartilage is an elastic connective tissue, composed of closely packed collagenous fibers in a rubbery gelatinous ground substance known as chondrin. Cartilaginous material is of intermediate firmness, it is neither as hard as bones nor as soft as tendons to provide flexible support for certain structures in the human body.

\section*{Types of cartilage:}
1. Hyaline Cartilage: It is the most common type of cartilage; its main function is to resist compressive stress, support and reinforcement. This type of cartilage is found in the following regions:
- The articular surface of bones.
- The anterior portion of the ribs (Figure 4.34).
- The nose.
- The supporting rings of the trachea.
- Some parts of the skull.
- In the embryo, bone begins as hyaline cartilage and later ossifies.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-096.jpg?height=433&width=629&top_left_y=937&top_left_x=530)

Figure 4.34 Hyaline cartilage in the thoracic cage
2. Elastic Cartilage: It has a ground substance containing rich network of yellow elastic fibers and collagenous fibers leading to its elasticity, elastic cartilage is found in the following regions:
- In the framework of the outer ear (Figure 4.35)
- In the epiglottis.
- In the Eustachian tube.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-097.jpg?height=373&width=240&top_left_y=573&top_left_x=540)

Figure 4.35 Elastic cartilage is found in the framework of the outer ear.
3. Fibrocartilage: It has a ground substance containing large amount of strong collagen fibers leading the toughness and flexibility of fibrocartilage. This type of cartilage absorbs shock and reduces friction between joints. It is found in structures that withstand tension and pressure such as:
- The symphysis pubis
- The sternoclavicular joint
- The temporomandibular joint
- The intervertebral disc (Figure 4.36)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-097.jpg?height=410&width=648&top_left_y=1338&top_left_x=404)

Figure 4.36 Fibrocartilage forming the intervertebral disc

\section*{Characteristic features of cartilage:}
- Cartilage has no blood or lymphatics supply, its nutrition diffuses through the matrix. This explains the slowness of healing process in cartilages.
- Cartilage has no nerve supply and therefore it is insensitive.
- Hyaline and elastic cartilage is surrounded by a fibrous layer known as the perichondrium provides blood supply to the cartilage and plays a major role in regeneration of the cartilage after injury.
- There is no perichondrium around articular cartilage thus its regeneration is poor after injury.

\section*{3. Joints}

Joints are the location where bones come together. It represents the connection between bones in the body to allow for movement, flexibility, stability and protection.

\section*{Classifications of joints:}

There are two types of joints classification:
1- Structural classification.
2- Functional classification.
Structural classification: based on the way the bones connect to each other, according to their structure, joints are classified into:
1. Synovial joints.
2. Fibrous joints.
3. Cartilaginous joints.
4. Facet joints.

Functional classification: based on the degree of joint movement they classified into three main types:
1. Synarthrosis: with limited degree of mobility such as fibrous joints
2. Amphiarthrosis: with small amount of mobility such as cartilaginous joints.
3. Diarthrosis: freely-movable joint such as synovial joints.

\section*{1. Synovial joints:}

They are also known as Diarthrosis, these are the most common type of joints in the body, the bones of this joint are not directly joined to each other, they have a synovial cavity and are united by a dense irregular connective tissue that forms an articular capsule that is normally associated with accessory ligaments.
Structural Features of Synovial: Synovial joints are characterized by the presence of an articular capsule formed by a fibrous connective tissue structure, the walls of the capsule form a joint cavity, filled with a synovial fluid. The bones of the joint articulate with each other within the joint cavity. The entire articulating surface of each bone is covered by a thin layer of hyaline cartilage known as the articular cartilage (Figure 4.37).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-100.jpg?height=416&width=551&top_left_y=738&top_left_x=537)

Figure 4.37 The Synovial joint

Friction between the bones at synovial joint is prevented by two factors:
1) The presence of the articular cartilage that covers the entire articulating surface of each bone to facilitate the smooth gliding of articular surfaces during joint movement.
2) The presence of the synovial fluid which lubricates the joint and allows for ease of movement.
Types of Synovial joints: Synovial joints are subdivided according to the shapes of the articulating surfaces into six types:
1. Pivot joint
2. Hinge joint
3. Condyloid joint
4. Saddle joint
5. Plane joint
6. Ball-and socket joint
1) Pivot joint: it is composed of a rounded portion of a bone, enclosed within a ring formed partially by the articulation with another bone and partially by a ligament, such as atlantoaxial joint (Figures $4.38 \& 4.39$ ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-101.jpg?height=319&width=896&top_left_y=467&top_left_x=191)

4) Saddle joint: At this type of joint, both of the articulating surfaces have a saddle shape, which is concave in one direction and convex in the other, such as trapeziometacarpal joint (Figure $4.44 \& 4.45$ ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-104.jpg?height=389&width=930&top_left_y=470&top_left_x=331)

Figure 4.45 X-ray image showing trapeziometacarpal joint forming saddle joint.
5) Plain joint: Also known as gliding joint, the articulating surfaces of the bones are flat or slightly curved and of approximately the same size, which allows the bones to slide against each other, such as the tarsal bones (Figure $4.46 \& 4.47$ ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-105.jpg?height=259&width=935&top_left_y=503&top_left_x=197)

\section*{2. Fibrous joints:}

These joints are connected by dense fibrous connective tissue and have no joint cavity; this is why these joints do not move.
There are three types of fibrous joints:
1) Sutures: the joints that join the skull bones (Figure 4.50).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-107.jpg?height=251&width=793&top_left_y=539&top_left_x=270)

Figure 4.50 Sutures
2) Syndesmosis: the joints between two bone bound by long collagen fibers, such as the tibia and fibula and between radius and ulna (Figure 4.51).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-107.jpg?height=414&width=751&top_left_y=923&top_left_x=308)

\section*{3. Cartilaginous joints:}

They are mainly joined by cartilage. There are two types of cartilaginous joints:
1) Synchondrosis: this joint is mainly composed two bones joined together by hyaline cartilage, such as the first sternocostal joint, where the first rib is anchored to the manubrium by hyaline cartilage (Figure 4.53).

Figure 4.53 Synehondrosis
2) Symphysis: these are secondary cartilaginous joints, because they are composed of hyaline cartilage covering fibrocartilage connecting the articular surfaces of the involved bones. It is very strong because it contains bundles of thick collagen fibers, thus giving it a much greater ability to resist pulling and bending forces when compared with hyaline cartilage, such as symphysis pubis (Figure 4.54).

\section*{4. Facet joints:}

These are set of joints between two articular processes of two adjacent vertebrae. Each vertebra has two sets of facet joints. One pair faces upward and one pair faces downward (Figures $4.55 \& 4.56$ ).

\section*{4. Tendons}

Tendon is a fibrous connective tissue attaches muscle to bone to transmit the mechanical force of muscle contraction to the bones and joints. The tendon is firmly connected to muscle fibers at one end and to the bone at its other end. Tendons are remarkably strong, having one of the highest tensile strengths found among soft tissues. Their great strength is necessary for withstanding the stresses generated by muscular contraction (Figure 4.57 \& 4.58).

\section*{5. Ligaments}

Ligament is a tough fibrous connective tissue that connects between two bones, it serves to support and hold bones together in proper articulation at the joints. Some ligaments form a capsular sac around joints to enclose the articulating ends of bones and the synovial membrane. Other ligaments fasten around or across bone ends in bands, permitting varying degrees of movement, or act as tie pieces between bones to restrict any inappropriate movement (Figure 4.59 \& 4.60).

\section*{6. Fascia}

Fascia is a sheet of fibrous connective tissue that wraps all internal body organs and muscles to provide support for them and to hold their parts together. Fasciae are similar to ligaments and tendons as they are fibrous connective tissue, they differ in that ligaments join one bone to another bone, tendons join muscle to bone, and fasciae join muscles to muscles and join other internal structures.

\section*{Types of fascia:}

\section*{1. Superficial Fascia}
2. Deep Fascia
3. Visceral Fascia

\section*{The Skull}

The Skull is the skeletal framework of the head; it is the bony structure that forms the protective cavity for the brain and supports the face. It is comprised of many bones which are joined by fibrous joints known as sutures (Figure 5.1).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-116.jpg?height=854&width=606&top_left_y=555&top_left_x=499)

Figure 5.1 The Skull.

\section*{Skull divisions:}

The skull can be divided into two divisions (Figure 5.2):
1. Cranium: also known as the skullcap, it is the upper part of the skull represents the brain case, it surrounds the brain and protects its components, and it mainly houses the meninges, cerebral vasculature and the structures of the middle and inner ear.
2. Facial bones: they underlie the facial structures and supports the soft tissues of the face, enclose the eyeballs, form the nasal and oral cavities, and support the teeth of the upper and lower jaws.

Figure 5.2 Skull divisions

\section*{Cranium of the Skull}

Anatomically, the cranium is subdivided into a roof known as the calvarium and a base. The cranium of the skull is composed of several bones joined together by sutures, the base of the cranium has several openings known as foramina, through which blood vessels and nerves enter and leave the cavity of the cranium.

\section*{The cranial bones:}

There are 8 cranial bones (Figure 5.3):
- The Frontal bone (1)
- The Parietal bones (2)
- The Temporal bones (2)
- The Sphenoid bone (1)
- The Ethmoid bone (1)
- The Occipital bone (1)

Figure 5.3 The Cranial bones

\section*{The Frontal Bone:}

The frontal bone is located at the front of the skull and corresponds to the region known as the forehead. The frontal bone consists of two portions:
1. Vertical portion, also known as the squama, corresponding with the region of the forehead.
2. Horizontal portion, also known as the orbital portion, it forms the roofs of the orbital and nasal cavities (Figure 5.4).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-119.jpg?height=1099&width=653&top_left_y=624&top_left_x=336)

\section*{The Temporal Bones:}

The temporal bones are situated on the sides and bases of the skull. The functions of the temporal bones are protection of the brain and support of the face (Figure 5.8).
Each temporal bone consists of five parts:
1. The Squamous part.
2. The Tympanic part.
3. The Styloid process.
4. The Petrous part.
5. The Mastoid part.

\section*{Parts of Temporal Bone:}
1. The Squamous part: It is the largest part of the temporal bone, located superiorly. It is flat and plate-like, with its outer surface convex in shape.
2. The Tympanic part: It the part that surrounds the external ear, it lies inferior to the squamous part, and anterior to the mastoid part.
3. The Mastoid part: It is an inferior bony projection, lies just behind the external ear. It is a site of attachment for many muscles.
4. The Petrous part: It is pyramidal shaped, and lies superior to the mastoid part, it contains the inner ear.
5. The Styloid process: It is located immediately underneath the tympanic part; it acts as an attachment point for muscles and ligaments. (Figure 5.9)

The Ethmoid bone is located in the midline of the anterior part of the skull between the two orbits contributing in the formation of the medial wall of the orbits, and on the upper part of the nasal cavity forming its roof and lateral walls, and the upper portion of the nasal septum (Figure 5.12). The ethmoid bone contributes in the formation of the floor of the anterior cranial fossa.

\section*{Components of Ethmoid Bone:}
1. Crista galli: an upward bony projection located at the midline of the superior surface of the ethmoid bone.
2. Cribriform plate: a flattened horizontal areas located to either side of the crista galli with numerous small openings, at the superior surface of the ethmoid bone.
3. Perpendicular plate: a thin, vertical lamina descends from the under surface of the cribriform plate, forming part of the nasal septum (Figure 5.13).

\section*{The Facial Bones}

The facial bones underlie the facial structures and supports the soft tissues of the face, enclose the eyeballs, form the nasal and oral cavities, and support the teeth of the upper and lower jaws.
There are 14 facial bones comprising the facial skeleton: (Figure 5.20)
- Maxilla (2)
- Palatine bones (2)
- Zygomatic bones (2)
- Nasal bones (2)
- Inferior nasal concha (2)
- Lacrimal bones (2)

Figure 5.20 Anterior view of skull showing facial bones

Maxilla: it is pair of pyramidal shaped bones fused to form the upper jaw. Maxilla is composed of body and four projections (Figure 5.21):
- Frontal process
- Zygomatic process
- Alveolar process
- Palatine process
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-133.jpg?height=1099&width=606&top_left_y=576&top_left_x=376)

Figure 5.21 Anterior view of the skull (a) and lateral view of the skull (b) illustrating the Maxilla

Processes of Maxilla: the maxilla has three processes (Figure 5.22):
1. The Frontal process.
2. The Zygomatic process.
3. The Alveolar process.
4. The Palatine process.

The Frontal process: is a strong plate, projects upward, medially and backward, by the side of the nose, forming part of its lateral boundary.
The Zygomatic process: is a rough triangular eminence, which protrudes laterally creating a non-smooth articular surface with the zygomatic bone.
The Alveolar process: is the thickened ridge of bone that contains the tooth sockets (dental alveoli) on the jaw bones that hold teeth; it represents the upper jaw

Nasal Bones: consists of two bones located near the middle of the face, they come together to form the nasal bridge of the nose. These bones vary in size from individual to individual. The main function of nasal bones is the support of the nose (Figure 5.26).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-138.jpg?height=567&width=540&top_left_y=472&top_left_x=551)

Figure 5.26 Nasal Bone

Nasal concha: plural conchae, it is a long, narrow, curled shelf of bone that protrudes into the nasal cavity, there are three nasal conchae, superior, middle and inferior.
The superior and middle nasal conchae form part of the ethmoid bone, while the inferior nasal concha is a bonystructure by itself Nasal conchae divide the nasal airway into 4 groove-like air passages, and are responsible for forcing inhaled air to flow in a steady, regular pattern around the largest possible surface area of nasal mucosa (Figure 5.27).

Figure 5.27 Nasal conchae

Lacrimal Bone: The lacrimal bone (lacrima is Latin word means tear) is the smallest bone of the skull. It is paired and sits inside the bony orbit taking up a small area of the most anterior part of the medial wall (Figure 5.28). The lacrimal bone has two surfaces, a lateral (orbital) and medial (nasal) one.

\section*{The Vertebral Column}

The vertebral column (also known as the backbone) is the part of the axial skeleton that extends from the base of the skull down to the pelvis, it consists of sequence of 33 separate bony vertebrae, 24 of them are joined by cartilaginous intervertebral discs inbetween known as presacral vertebrae, and 9 are fused in two regions: sacral 5 and coccygeal 4. The vertebral column houses the spinal cord in a cavity known as the spinal canal.

\section*{Regions of vertebral Column:}

Vertebral column is divided into five regions (Figure 6.1):
1. Cervical region at the neck, it is composed of 7 vertebrae.
2. Thoracic region at the mid-back, it is composed of 12 vertebrae.
3. Lumbar region at the lower-back, it is composed of 5 vertebrae.
4. Sacral region at the upper pelvis, it is composed of 5 vertebrae.
5. Coccygeal region at the lower pelvis, it is composed of 5 vertebrae.

Figure 6.1 The vertebral column

\section*{Curvatures of the Vertebral Column:}

Normal vertebral column does not form a straight line, but instead has four curvatures (Figure 6.2).
1. The cervical curve.
2. The thoracic curve.
3. The lumbar curve.
4. The sacrococcygeal curve.

These curvatures increase the strength and flexibility of the vertebral column, beside they increase the ability of the vertebral column to absorb shock.

Figure 6.2 Curvatures of the vertebral Column

\section*{Function of the vertebral column:}

Protection: The major function of the vertebral column is protection of the spinal cord.
Support: It carries the weight of the body above the pelvis.
Central Axis: it forms the central axis of the body, and provides attachment for the muscles of pectoral and pelvic girdles.
Movement: it controls movement and transmits body weight during walking and standing.

\section*{Anatomical structure of vertebra:}

Although the anatomical structure of vertebrae varies in size and shape within the different regions of the vertebral column, all vertebrae follow general similarity in their structural pattern.
The basic anatomical structure of a typical vertebra is composed of two main parts (Figure 6.4):
1. Vertebral body anteriorly.
2. Vertebral arch posteriorly.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-145.jpg?height=415&width=716&top_left_y=1166&top_left_x=302)

Figure 6.4 Anatomical structure of a typical vertebra

\section*{Vertebral Body:}

The vertebral body forms the anterior part of vertebra and it is the weight-bearing part, this is why lower vertebral bodies are larger than the upper to better support the increased weight.

\section*{Vertebral Arch:}

The vertebral arch forms the lateral and posterior aspect of each vertebrae, it is formed by seven processes (Figure 6.4):
1. Single spinous process centered posteriorly.
2. Two transverse processes extend laterally and posteriorly from the vertebral body.
3. Two pedicles connect the vertebral body to the transverse processes.
4. Two laminae connect the transverse and spinous processes.

On each side of vertebrae there are two articular facets:
1. Two superior articular facets facing superiorly and backward.
2. Two inferior articular facets facing inferiorly and forward.

Each inferior facet articulates with the superior facet of the lower vertebra forming facet joint between each two vertebra (Figures $6.5 \& 6.6$ ).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-146.jpg?height=496&width=896&top_left_y=941&top_left_x=354)

Figure 6.6 X-ray cervical spine lateral view demonstrating facet joint between cervical vertebra number 5 and number 6

Vertebral canal: The vertebral body and the vertebral arch surround an opening known as the vertebral foramen; it provides passage of the spinal cord and its meninges. Vertebral foramina extend from the first cervical vertebra down to the fifth lumber vertebra forming a tunnel known as the vertebral canal or spinal canal.

Cervical Vertebrae: The cervical region is composed of seven cervical vertebrae numbered from C 1 to C 7 ; their main function is to support the weight of the head, which weighs between 10 and 13 pounds. In addition, they allow for the great range of head motion and neck flexibility.
Atlas and Axis: The uppermost two cervical vertebrae are specialized vertebrae; the first cervical vertebra C1 is known as the Atlas (Figure 6.7). It is ring-shaped vertebra lacks a body and a spinous process; and there is no intervertebral disc below or above it. Atlas is directly connected to skull through the articulation of the superior articular facets of the atlas with the occipital condyles of the skull at the Atlanto-occipital joint, this joint allows for the "yes" motion of the head.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-148.jpg?height=378&width=877&top_left_y=708&top_left_x=372)

Figure 6.7 First cervical vertebra (Atlas) superior view

The second cervical vertebra (C2) is known as the Axis (Figure 6.8). This vertebra is pegshaped composed of a vertebral body, pedicles, laminae, transverse processes, and a unique projection called the (Dens) or (Odontoid process), the anterior arch of the Atlas articulates and pivots around this projection at the atlantoaxial joint allowing for the side-to-side or "no" motion of the head (Figure 6.9).

Dens of the second cervical vertebra

Figure 6.10 x-ray open mouth view demonstrating the odontoid process (dens) of the second cervical vertebra

The five lower cervical vertebrae from C3 down to C7 are similar to each other; each has a vertebral body with a concave superior surface and convex inferior surface. They have facets of superior and inferior articular processes that articulate in oblique planes that slope downward laterally and posteriorly. Only cervical vertebrae have a transverse foramen in each of their transverse processes (Figure 6.11).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-150.jpg?height=479&width=928&top_left_y=404&top_left_x=342)

Thoracic Vertebrae: the main function of the thoracic spine is to hold the rib cage and protect the heart and lungs. There are twelve thoracic vertebrae are numbered from T 1 to T12. The range of motion in the thoracio spine is limited. Thoracic vertebrae articulate with the ribs on the superior and inferior costal facets found on the bodies of thoracic vertebrae (Figure 6.12 \& 13).

Lumber vertebrae: The main function of the lumbar spine is to bear the weight of the body. The five lumbar vertebrae are numbered from L1 to L5. These vertebrae are much larger in size to absorb the stress of lifting and carrying heavy objects (Figure 6.14).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-151.jpg?height=517&width=756&top_left_y=1007&top_left_x=278)

Figure 6.14 Superior view of lumbar vertebra

Sacrum and Coccyx: The main function of the sacrum is the connection of between the spine and the hip bone. Sacrum is composed of five fused vertebrae (Fig 6.15). The union of the sacrum with the ilium forms the pelvic girdle.
The coccyx or tailbone is composed of four fused bones; they provide attachment for muscles and ligaments of the pelvic floor (Fig 6.15 \& 16).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-152.jpg?height=501&width=746&top_left_y=541&top_left_x=423)

Figure 6.16 Sacrum and Coccyx (posterior view)

Intervertebral discs: intervertebral discs are fibrocartilaginous cushions located between adjacent bony vertebrae in the spine they keep them from rubbing together and form fibrocartilaginous joint, to allow slight movement of the vertebrae. Intervertebral discs are composed of two layers;
1. The annulus fibrosus is an outer fibrous ring.
2. The nucleus pulposus is an inner gel-like center.

The fibers of the annulus fibrosus pull the vertebral bodies together against the elastic resistance of the gel-filled nucleus pulposus which act like a ball-bearing during movement, allowing the vertebral bodies to roll over the incompressible gel. The gelfilled nucleus is composed mostly of fluid. This fluid absorbed in the night during lying down and is pushed out during the day due to upright movement (Figures 6.17, 6.18 \& 6.19).

\section*{Joints and Ligaments of the vertebral column}

The vertebrae articulate with each other via joints between their articular facets and joints between their bodies and surrounding cartilages, there are also ligaments that strengthen and stabilize these joints; they resist hyperflexion and hyperextension of the vertebral column and hold the articulating parts that form the vertebral joints together.

\section*{Joints of the vertebral column:}
1. Intervertebral joints: There are two types of intervertebral joints between each adjacent vertebra;
1- Intervertebral fibrocartilaginous joint between the vertebral bodies and their adjacent intervertebral discs.
2- Intervertebral synovial joint between the facets of adjoining vertebral arches (Figures 6.5 \& 6.6).
2. Craniovertebral joints: there are two craniovertebral joints;

1- Atlantooccipital joint between the superior articular surfaces of the atlas and the occipital condyles ("yes"-nodding).
2- Atlantoaxial joint composed of two lateral joints between the inferior facets of atlas and superior facets of axis, and one median joint between the dens of the axis and anterior arch of the atlas ("no"-movement).
3. Costovertebral joints: between the head of the ribs and adjacent vertebral bodies

Figure 6.21 Atlantooccipital and Atlantoaxial joints

\section*{Ligaments of the vertebral column:}
1. Ligamentum Flavum: are paired ligaments run between adjacent laminae of the vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra down to the sacrum, they mainly connect the laminae of each adjacent vertebrae and fuses them with the capsule of the facet joint serving as a covering band over the spinal canal. Ligamentum flavum means "yellow ligament," and is so known because it has a yellow coloring due to the large amount of a springy type of collagen known as elastin, which elastin pulls the ligament out of the canal when the spine is extended (Figures 6.22, $6.23 \& 6.24$ ).
2. Anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments run in bands down the anterior and posterior surfaces of the vertebral bodies from the skull to the sacrum. They help to stabilize the vertebral column (Figure 6.23).
3. The interspinous ligament runs between the spinous processes (Figure 6.23).
4. The supraspinous ligament connects the tips of the spinous processes and forms the strong nuchal ligament that runs posterior to the cervical spine (Figure 6.23).

\section*{The Thoracic Cage}

Thoracic Cage is the thoracic wall skeleton. It consists of Sternum anteriorly, 12 thoracic vertebrae posteriorly and 12 pairs of ribs anchored to the vertebrae (Figure 7.1).
Function of thoracic cage: The main functions of the thoracic cage are as follows:
1. It supports the thorax and to protect the vital thoracic and abdominal organs,
2. It provides attachment for upper limbs and supports their weight.
3. It provides attachment for the muscles that move upper limb and stabilize their position.
4. It resists the negative pressure generated by the elastic recoil of the lungs during respiration.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-159.jpg?height=716&width=881&top_left_y=791&top_left_x=220)

Figure 7.1 Thoracic cage

\section*{Sternum}

Sternum: is a flat elongated bone located in the anterior part of the thoracic cage. It is anchored to the rib via costal cartilage. The sternum consists of three parts (Figure 7.2):
1. The manubrium
2. The body
3. The xiphoid process

The manubrium: it is the broad superior part of the sternum, it is quadrangular in shape. It has a superior shallow, U-shaped border called the jugular notch located between the medial ends of the clavicles. The inferior border of the sternum is oval in shape and covered with a thin layer of cartilage for articulation with the body of the sternum at the sternal angle. The lateral borders of the sternum are marked by depression for the first costal cartilages.
The Body of the Sternum: it is the long flat central part of the sternum, directed upward and forward, its superior border joins the manubrium at the sternal angle where the cartilage of the second rib is attached to the sternum. At the lateral border of the body of the sternum there are four angular depressions for the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. The inferior border of the body of the sternum is narrow, and articulates with the xiphoid process, at this point there is a notch for the cartilage of the seventh rib.
The xiphoid process: it is a small cartilaginous process located at the inferior end of the sternum, which is usually ossified in the adult human.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-160.jpg?height=598&width=592&top_left_y=1079&top_left_x=521)

Figure 7.2 The Sternum anterior view

The sternal angle: also clinically known as the Angle of Louis, it is the point where the body of the sternum joins the manubrium; it is about 160 degrees, it can be felt at the anterior wall of the chest at the farthest point of sternal projects, there are two lateral depressions at sternal angle for the attachment of the second pair of costal cartilages, that is why it can be used as a land mark for the second rib. The sternal angle is located at the level of the inferior border of T4 (Figures 7.3\& 7.4).

\section*{Ribs and Costal cartilages}
ribs are long bones, flattened and curved. There are twelve pairs of ribs in the thoracic cage; they connect the sternum anteriorly to the upper ten thoracic vertebrae posteriorly.
Function of ribs: As part of the thoracic, the ribs protect the vital thoracic and part of the abdominal organs. They also play a role in breathing, as they move to permit lung inflation during thoracic expansion.
Rib Classifications: there are two types of rib classification:
1- According to their anatomical features ribs are classified into: Typical and Atypical ribs.
2- According to their articulation, location and their costal cartilage ribs are classified into: True, Floating and False ribs.
Typical Ribs include from $3^{\text {rd }}$ up to $\mathbf{9}^{\text {th }}$ ribs: A typical rib is mainly composed of: head, neck and body. The head of a typical rib is wedge shaped with two articular facets separated by crest, the inferior facet articulates with the numerically corresponding vertebrae and the superior facet articulates with the vertebrae above. The neck of a typical rib connects the head with the body at a roughed tubercle, with a facet for articulation with the transverse process of the corresponding vertebrae. The body of a typical rib is thin, flat and curved, most markedly at the costal angle where the rib turns anterolaterally; there is a groove in internal surface of the body of a typical rib for the protection of the neurovascular supply of the thorax (Figure 7.5).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-162.jpg?height=458&width=936&top_left_y=1081&top_left_x=334)

Figure 7.5 landmarks of a typical rib

\section*{Atypical Ribs}

Atypical Ribs are the 1st, 2nd, 10th and 12th ribs: Atypical are characterized with the following features:
$\mathbf{1}^{\text {st }}$ Rib: is the shortest rib, it is flat and wider than other ribs. It has a small rounded head with one facet for articulation with its corresponding vertebrae. The superior and lateral surfaces are indented by two grooves for the subclavian vessels (Figure 7.6).

\section*{True, False and Floating ribs}

The first seven ribs (from $1^{\text {st }}$ down to $7^{\text {th }}$ ribs) are True ribs; the main feature of true ribs is that the costal cartilages from these ribs are directly attached to the sternum. The next lower five ribs (from $8^{\text {th }}$ down to $12^{\text {th }}$ ribs) are False ribs, the main feature of false ribs is that the costal cartilages from these ribs do not directly attach to the sternum. The costal cartilages from $8^{\text {th }}, 9^{\text {th }}$ and $10^{\text {th }}$ ribs are attached to the cartilage of the next higher ribs. The two lower ribs ( $11^{\text {th }}$ and $12^{\text {th }}$ ribs) are Floating ribs the main feature of these ribs is that they are short and do not attach to the sternum at all. The costal cartilages of these ribs terminate within the musculature of the lateral abdominal wall (Figure 7.9).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-165.jpg?height=733&width=898&top_left_y=704&top_left_x=222)

Figure 7.9 Classification of Ribs into True, False and Floating
The costal cartilages: There are 12 pairs of costal cartilage form part of the anterior wall of the thoracic cage. They connect the ribs to the sternum and help in extending the forward motion of the ribs. They also contribute to thoracic elasticity within by allowing chest expand during respiration. The upper seven pairs of costal cartilage are directly connected to the sternum, while the next lower three pairs are connected with the next upper ribs, and the last two pairs of costal cartilage are pointed, ending in the abdominal wall.

\section*{The Scapula}

The scapula, also known as the shoulder blade, is a triangular flat bone with three borders; superior, medial lateral borders, and two corners; the superior corner, located between the medial and superior borders, and the inferior corner, located between the medial and lateral borders, there is a shallow depression located at the superior corner known as the glenoid fossa, it articulates with the head of the humerus to form the shoulder joint which is also known as the Glenohumeral joint.
The scapula has anterior and posterior surfaces; the anterior surface also known as the costal surface, it is concave in shape and contains a depression over the majority of its surface, known as the Subscapular fossa. There is a small hook-like bony process located on the lateral edge of the superior portion of the anterior surface of the scapula pointing anterolaterally known as the Coracoid process; it plays a role in the stabilization of the shoulder joint. On the superior aspect of the anterior surface there is a large concave depression, medial to the coracoid process, known as The Suprascapular notch; it separates the coracoid process from the superior border of the scapula. The posterior surface of the scapula is convex in shape, it has a protruding bony ridge known as the spine of the scapula it divides the posterior surface into two unequal parts, the superior part is known as The Supraspinous fossa which is much bigger than the inferior part which is known as The Infraspinous fossa. On the lateral end of the spine of scapula, there is an anterolateral bony protuberance arcs over the shoulder joint and articulates with the distal end of the clavicle, it is known as the acromion process (Figures 8.3, 8.4 \& 8.5).

\section*{The Clavicle}

The clavicle, also known as the collarbone, is a curved long bone, forms the anterior portion of the shoulder girdle. It is located at the anterosuperior part of the thorax, just above the first rib and articulates laterally with the acromion process of the scapula and medially with the manubrium of the sternum. It is the only long bone that lies almost horizontally in the human body.
Functions of the clavicle: The clavicle has many important functions.
1. It serves as a strut to support the scapula superiorly, by the action of the muscles that anchors it from above.
2. It stabilizes the shoulder joint superolaterally, and by this it allows for free motion of the upper limb.
3. It transmits forces coming from the upper limb to the axial skeleton through the sternum.
4. It protects the underlying neurovascular bundle that pass between the trunk and the upper limb.
Anatomical regions of the clavicle: The clavicle is divided into three regions:
1. The medial region, also known as the sternal end, it is of triangular shape and articulates with the sternum at the manubrium forming the sternoclavicular joint, which is the only direct bony articulation between the axial skeleton and the pectoral girdle of the upper limb.
2. The lateral region, also known as the acromial end, it articulates with the acromion of the scapula forming the acromioclavicular joint, which forms the bony tip of the shoulder.
3. The intermediate region or the shaft is divided into medial two-thirds and lateral one third. The lateral third has two borders and an inferior and superior surfaces; the first border is a concave anterior border gives attachment to the deltoid muscle, and the second border is a convex posterior border gives attachment to the trapezius muscle. The superior surface of the clavicle is flat and rough, it is marked by two impressions; the anterior impression for the attachments of the Deltoid muscle, and the posterior impression for the attachment of the Trapezius muscle; between these two impressions there is small subcutaneous bony portion.

Figure 9.1 Upper Limb Bones

\section*{Humerus}

The humerus is the bone of the arm, it extends between the scapula proximally and the radius and ulna distally. The proximal end of the humerus consists of head, anatomical neck, and surgical neck, greater and lesser tubercles. The head is a rounded, smooth area faces medially, it articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula to form the shoulder joint (Glenohumeral joint). The anatomical neck is smooth groove surrounds the articular margin of the smooth area of the head. The Greater tubercle is an expanded bony area located on the lateral side of the proximal humerus. The Lesser tubercle is located on the anterior aspect of the proximal humerus. There is a narrow groove passing between the greater and lesser tubercles known as The intertubercular groove or (bicipital groove) it provides passage for the biceps brachii muscle tendon. The surgical neck is located at the expanded region at the base of the proximal end of the humerus; it represents the connection between the head and the shaft of the humerus, it is a common site of fractures.
The shaft of the humerus is almost triangular in cut section with 3 surfaces; the anteromedial and the anterolateral surfaces which are separated by a line drawn as a continuation of the crest of the greater tubercle. The third surface is the posterior surface which is located between the medial and lateral borders; there is a roughened, V-shaped area at the lateral side in the midshaft of the humerus known as the deltoid tuberosity, it is the site of attachment for the deltoid muscle. There is a shallow oblique spiral groove found on the posterior surface of the shaft of the humerus known as the radial sulcus, it is the groove for the passage of the radial nerve and deep vessels.
The distal end of the humerus becomes flattened with prominent bony projections on the medial and lateral sides known as medial and lateral epicondyles of the humerus, with lateral epicondyle is smaller than the medial epicondyle of the humerus. There are roughened bony ridges located above the lateral and medial epicondyles known as the lateral and medial supracondylar ridges, they are areas of attachment for the muscles of the forearm, wrist, and hand. The medial epicondyle give attachment for the strong grasping muscles of the anterior forearm, thus it is larger and more prominent than the lateral epicondyle which gives attachment for the weaker muscles of the posterior forearm (Figure 9.2).
There are two articulation areas on the distal end of the humerus joining the radius and ulna to form the elbow joint, the medial area is known as the trochlea, it is pulley shaped structure articulates with the ulna. The lateral area is known as the capitulum it is a knob-like structure located on the anterior surface of the distal humerus, it articulates with the radius. There are two small depressions located superior to the trochlea and capitulum; these depressions accommodate the radius and ulna during full flexion of the elbow joint. The coronoid fossa is located superior to the trochlea, it receives the coronoid process of the ulna, and the radial fossa is located superior to the capitulum, it receives the head of the radius during flexion of the elbow joint. On the posterior surface
of the distal end of the humerus there is a bony depression known as the olecranon fossa, it receives the olecranon process of the ulna during full extension of the forearm (Figure 9.3).

\section*{Radius and Ulna}

Radius and ulna are the bones of the forearm. They extend from the elbow proximally to the wrist distally.

\section*{The Radius:}

It is the lateral of the two bones of the forearm; it extends from the lateral side of the elbow to the thumb side of the wrist and runs parallel to the ulna. The proximal end of the radius is a disc-shaped structure known as the head of the radius. The superior surface of the head of the radius articulates with the capitulum of the humerus as part of the elbow joint, and the lateral margin of the head of the radius articulates with a shallow depression on the medial side of the proximal ulna known as the radial notch of the ulna at the proximal radioulnar joint. A narrow region lies immediately distal to the radial head known as the neck of the radius. Inferiorly there an oval-shaped, bony protuberance acts as a muscular attachment point located on the medial side of the radius known as the radial tuberosity. On the medial side of the shaft of the radius there is small ridge forms the interosseous border of the radius, it is for the attachment of interosseous membrane. The interosseous membrane is a sheet of dense connective tissue extends between the radius and ulna to unite these two bones. The distal end of the radius expands to form a rectangular end; it has two smooth facets, for articulation with the scaphoid and lunate carpal bones at the radiocarpal joint or wrist joint. On the medial surface of the distal end of the radius, there is shallow concavity known as the ulnar notch of the radius, it articulates with the head of the ulna, to form the distal radioulnar joint. The lateral side of the distal end of the radius has a projection known as the styloid process of the radius; it provides attachment for ligaments that support the lateral side of the wrist joint.

\section*{The Ulna:}

It is the medial bone of the forearm; it extends, parallel to the radius, from the medial side of the elbow to the medial side of the wrist. At the proximal end of the ulna there is wrench shaped area known as the trochlear notch, it articulates with the trochlea of the humerus at the medial side of the elbow joint. The lower margin of the trochlear notch is formed by a boney prominence known as the coronoid process, and the upper margin of the trochlear notch is formed by a boney tip extends from the olecranon process which form the posterior and superior portions of the proximal ulna.
Inferior to the trochlear notch there is a roughened area known as the ulnar tuberosity, it is the attachment area for brachialis muscle. Inferolateral to the trochlear notch, is the location of radial notch of the ulna, it is the articulation site between the proximal radius and ulna, to form the proximal radioulnar joint.
On the lateral side of the shaft of the ulna, there is a ridge for the attachment of the interosseous membrane of the forearm, it is known as the interosseous border of the ulna. At the distal end of the ulna there is small, rounded bony prominence known as the head of the ulna. On the posterior side of the head of the ulna there is short bony
projection known as the styloid process of the ulna, it serves as an attachment point for a connective tissue structure that unites the distal ends of the radius and ulna. The styloid process of the radius is more prominent compared to the styloid process of the ulna; thereby it limits lateral deviation movement of the wrist joint (Figures $9.4 \& 9.5$ ).

\section*{The Shoulder Joint}

Shoulder joint, also known as Glenohumeral joint, it is the multiaxial ball-and-socket synovial joint formed by the articulation of the head of the humerus with the glenoid cavity of the scapula, which is deepened and slightly enlarged by the glenoid labrum, a fibrocartilage ring attaching to the outside margin of the glenoid fossa (Figure 10.1).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-187.jpg?height=1099&width=819&top_left_y=589&top_left_x=255)

Figure 10.1 Anterior view (A) and posterior view (B) of Shoulder joint

\section*{The capsule of the shoulder joint:}

As a synovial joint, the shoulder joint has a capsule surrounds the joint cavity and encloses synovial fluid that lubricates the articular surfaces of the joint, it is attached medially to the outer margin of the glenoid fossa and laterally to the anatomical neck of the humerus, just distal to the head of the humerus. This capsule is loose inferiorly, and lies in folds during full adduction of the arm, these folds allow for abduction of the arm, during which they become taught (Figure 10.2).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-188.jpg?height=714&width=943&top_left_y=642&top_left_x=341)

Figure 10.2 The capsule of the shoulder joint

\section*{Bursae of the shoulder joint:}

The bursa is a fluid filled sac provides cushioning between joint structures to protect the joint capsule from wear. The glenohumeral joint has a number of bursae that protect the joint capsule from excessive wear from overlying structures. The most common of which is the subacromial bursa which lies between the acromion process of the scapula and the supraspinatus muscle. Subscapular bursa protects the joint capsule and the muscle tendon of the supraspinatus muscle from wear from the acromion process during arm abduction. Subscapular bursa lies between the tendon of subscapularis muscle and the scapula. It reduces wear and tear on the subscapularis tendon during shoulder joint movement (Figure 10.3).

\section*{Elbow joint}

The elbow is the joint connecting the upper arm to the forearm. It is classed as a hingetype synovial joint. It is the articulation point of the humerus and the radius and the ulna. The elbow joint consists of two separate articulations:
1. Humeroulnar joint between the trochlea on the medial aspect of the distal end of the humerus and the trochlear notch on the proximal ulna.
2. Humeroradial joint between the capitulum on the lateral aspect of the distal end of the humerus with the head of the radius.
These two joints give the elbow its characteristic hinge like properties. The rounded surfaces of the capitulum of the humerus rotate against the concave surfaces of the head of the radius, and the wrench shape of the trochlear notch of the ulna moves around the trochlea of the humerus (Figure 10.6).

\section*{The capsule of the elbow joint:}

The elbow joint has a strong and fibrous capsule encloses and strengthens the joint. This capsule is thickened medially and laterally to form collateral ligaments, which stabilize the flexing and extending motion of the arm (Figure 10.7).

\section*{The bursa of the elbow joint:}

There are many bursae in the elbow, but only a few have clinical importance:
1. Intratendinous bursa: leis within the tendon of the triceps brachii muscle.
2. Subtendinous bursa: reduces friction between the olecranon and the tendon of the triceps brachii muscle during extension and flexion of the arm.
3. Olecranon bursa: lies between the olecranon and the overlying connective tissue.

\section*{Proximal Radioulnar Joint}

The proximal radioulnar joint is pivot-joint formed by an articulation between the head of the radius and the radial notch of the ulna; it lies immediately distal to the elbow joint, and is enclosed with in the same articular capsule.
The radial head is held in place by the Annular Radial Ligament, which forms a 'collar' around the joint. The annular radial ligament is lined with a synovial membrane, reducing friction during movement. Movement is produced by the head of the radius rotating within the annular ligament. There are two movements possible at this joint; pronation and supination (Figure 10.10).

\section*{Distal Radioulnar Joint}

The distal radioulnar joint is pivot-joint formed by an articulation between the head of the ulna and the ulnar notch on the distal end of the radius, just proximally to the wrist joint. The distal radioulnar joint is strengthened by anterior and posterior ligaments and a fibrocartilaginous ligament known as the articular disk, they hold the radius and ulna together during joint movement and separate the distal radioulnar joint from the wrist joint (Figure 10.10).

Figure 10.10 Proximal and Distal Radioulnar Joints

\section*{Wrist Joint}

The wrist is the joint connecting the forearm and the hand, it is a synovial joint formed by articulation between the distal end of the radius and the articular disk proximally and scaphoid, lunate and triquetrum distally the ulna is not part of the wrist joint).
The radius articulates with the scaphoid laterally and the lunate medially (Figure 10.11), on the medial side of the wrist joint there is a cartilaginous structure known as the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), it extends from the ulna to insert into the lunate and triquetrum via the ulnolunate and ulnotriquetral ligaments respectively (Figure 10.12). The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is a major contributor to the stability of the wrist joint.

\section*{Metacarpophalangeal joint}

Metacarpophalangeal joints are condyloid type synovial joints between the head of metacarpal and the base of proximal phalanx in each of the 5 digits. Each joint is enclosed by a fibrous capsule which attaches to the margins of the articular surfaces and is lined by a synovial membrane. There are two collateral ligaments and one palmar ligament associated with each metacarpophalangeal joint.

\section*{Interphalangeal joints}

Interphalangeal joints are hinge joints between the phalanges, there are two Interphalangeal joints in each digit except the thumb which has only one interphalangeal joint. The two joints are: Proximal Interphalangeal Joints between the proximal phalanx and intermediate phalanx in each of the 2nd to 5th digits and Distal Interphalangeal Joints between the intermediate phalanx and distal phalanx in each of the 2 nd to 5 th digits (Figure 10.13).

\section*{Learning Objectives:}
- Identify the pelvic girdle.
- List the anatomical components of the hip bone.
- Identify the anatomical components of ilium.
- Identify the anatomical components of pubis.
- Identify the anatomical components of ischium.

\section*{The Pelvic Girdle}

The pelvic girdle is formed by the two hip bones; it connects the bones of the lower limb to the axial skeleton. The bones are firmly attached to the axial skeleton via the sacrum of the vertebral column; they also converge anteriorly to attach to each other. The pelvic girdle is part of the bony pelvis which is composed of the two hip bones, the sacrum and the coccyx (Figure 11.1). The bones of the pelvis are strongly attached to each other to form a strong immobile, weight-bearing structure providing a stable foundation for the upper body as the pelvis transfers the body weight from the vertebral column, through the pelvic girdle into the lower limbs.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-197.jpg?height=596&width=988&top_left_y=707&top_left_x=198)

Figure 11.1 The Pelvic Girdle

\section*{The Hip Bone}

The right and left hip bones (also known as the innominate bones) are two irregularly shaped bones that form the main component of the pelvic girdle, each hip bone is comprised of the three parts;
1. The ilium.
2. The pubis.
3. The ischium.

There is a cup shaped socket located at the middle region between ilium, pubis and ischium known as the acetabulum (a Latin ward means "vinegar cup"), where the head of the femur articulates to form the hip joint, hip bone has two more articulations beside the hip joint; the right and left hip bones articulate with each other anteriorly to form the symphysis pubis, the two hip bones articulate with the sacrum posteriorly to form the sacroiliac joint (Figures 11.2 \& 11.3).

Figure 11.3 Right hip bone (medial view)

\section*{The Ilium:}

The ilium is the widest, largest and the superior of the three parts of the hip bone. The body of the ilium forms the superior part of the acetabulum (acetabular roof). Immediately above the acetabulum, the ilium expands to form the wing.
The ilium has two surfaces provide muscular attachment. The inner surface has a concave shape produces the iliac fossa. The external surface has a convex shape.
The ilium has a superior thickened margin known as the iliac crest; it extends anteriorly from a bony prominence known as the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to a posterior bony prominence known as the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS). There is an indentation on the posteroinferior aspect of the ilium known as the greater sciatic notch; it lies between the posterior inferior iliac spine (above), and the ischial spine (below).

\section*{The Pubis:}

The Pubis: is the most anterior portion of the hip bone. It consists of:
1. A body.
2. A superior ramus.
3. An inferior ramus (ramus means branch.)

The Pubic body: is located medially, it articulates with the opposite pubic body at the pubic symphysis. Its superior aspect is marked by a rounded thickening known as the pubic crest, which extends laterally as the pubic tubercle.
The Superior pubic ramus: extends laterally from the body to form part of the acetabulum.
The Inferior pubic ramus; projects towards the ischium. Together, the superior and inferior rami enclose part of the Obturator foramen, through which the obturator nerve, artery and vein pass through to reach the lower limb.

\section*{The Ischium:}

The Ischium forms the posteroinferior part of the hip bone; it is composed of
1. Ischial body.
2. Ischial ramus.
3. Ischial tuberosity.
4. Ischial spine.

The ischial ramus combines with the inferior pubic ramus to enclose part of the obturator foramen.
The ischial tuberosity is located on the posteroinferior aspect of the ischium, when sitting; the body weight falls on right and left ischial tuberosities.
The ischial spine is a posteromedial projection located near the junction of the superior ramus and body.

\section*{Lower Limb Bones}

\section*{Femur \\ Patella \\ Tibia \\ Fibula \\ Tarsals \\ Metatarsals \\ Lower limb Phalanges}

\section*{Learning Objectives:}
- Identify the anatomical divisions of the lower limb
- Identify the lower limb bones
- Identify anatomical components of the femur.
- Identify anatomical components of the tibia and fibula.
- List the tarsal bones.
- Identify anatomical structure of each tarsal 1 bone.
- Identify numbering of metatarsal bones.
- Identify the anatomical structure of lower limb phalanges.

\section*{The Lower Limb Bones}

Lower limb is divided into three anatomical divisions:
1. The Thigh: is the region between the hip joint and knee joint.
2. The Leg: is the region between the knee joint and the ankle joint.
3. The Foot: is the region distal to the ankle joint.

Bones of lower limb: each lower limb composed of 30 bones as follows:
There are two bones in the thigh; single Femur and single Patella distally, the leg is composed of two bones Tibia and Fibula, and the Foot composed of twenty six bones; seven tarsals, five metatarsal bones, and fourteen phalanges (Figure 12.1).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-203.jpg?height=1023&width=474&top_left_y=739&top_left_x=440)

Figure 12.1 Lower limb bones

\section*{The Femur}

The femur is the bone of the thigh and the longest bone in the body, it can be divided into three regions; proximal region, shaft and distal region.
The Proximal region of the femur:
The proximal aspect of the femur consists of a head and neck, the greater and lesser trochanters, with two bony ridges connecting the two trochanters; the intertrochanteric line anteriorly and the trochanteric crest posteriorly.
The Head of the femur is the rounded, proximal end of the femur, it has a smooth surface and covered with articular cartilage, it articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone to form the hip joint
The Neck of the femur is the cylindrical narrowed region below the head; it connects the head of the femur with the shaft. It is set at an angle of approximately 135 degrees to the shaft. This angle of projection allows for an increased range of movement at the hip joint. The Greater trochanter is an upward, bony projection extending from the base of the neck, it is the most palpable bony projection on the lateral side of the upper thigh.
The Lesser trochanter is a small, bony projection extending from the posteromedial aspect of the inferior part of the neck of the femur.
The Intertrochanteric line is a bony ridge extends between the two trochanters in an inferomedial direction on the anterior surface of the femur. It serves as the anterior attachment of the hip joint capsule.
The Intertrochanteric crest is a bony ridge located on the posterior surface of the femur, it connects the two trochanters (Figure 12.2).

\section*{The Shaft of the femur:}

The shaft of the femur is cylindrical in the middle with posterior flattening and widening in the proximal and distal ends, as it descends the femoral shaft has a slight medial bowing, which brings the knees closer to the body's centre of gravity, increasing stability. The linea aspera (Latin for rough line) are roughened ridges on the posterior surface of the shaft of the femur, they are made up of medial and lateral lips, the medial lip originates near the lesser trochanter as the pectineal line, and the lateral lip arises from the greater trochanter as the gluteal tuberosity, the two ridges split inferiorly to form the medial and lateral supracondylar lines, the popliteal surface is a triangular space lies between these two lines (Figure 12.2).

\section*{The Distal region of the femur:}

The distal region of the femur, which articulates with the tibia and patella at the knee joint, is made up of the medial and lateral condyles, the intercondylar fossa, and the patellar surface.
The Medial and Lateral condyles: are rounded areas at the end of the femur, they articulate with the tibia and menisci of the knee on the posterior and inferior surfaces, while they articulate with the patella on the anterior surface. The lateral condyle is larger and more prominent than the medial condyle; the prominence of the lateral condyle
prevents the lateral dislocation of the patella, while the flatter and smaller medial condyle may result in medial dislocation of the patella. The medial and lateral condyles are connected anteriorly, while they are separated posteriorly by the Intercondylar fossa. The medial wall of the intercondylar fossa serve as the point of attachment for the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), while the lateral wall of the intercondylar fossa serve as the point of attachment for the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).
The Medial and lateral epicondyles: are bony elevations on the outer sides of the condyles, they provide attachment for muscles and supporting ligaments of the knee joint. The medial epicondyle: is located on the outer medial side of the medial condyle, while the lateral epicondyle is located on the outer lateral side of the lateral condyle. The medial epicondyle is the larger than the lateral epicondyle, there is a small bony prominence at the superior margin of the medial epicondyle known as the adductor tubercle (Figure 12.3).

\section*{The Patella}

The patella (also known as the kneecap) is largest sesamoid bone of the body that, it is thick and flat with triangular shape with its apex pointing downwards and the base upwards. It lies in front of the knee joint within the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, which originates from the anterior thigh and passes across the anterior knee to attach to the tibia. The patella articulates with the patellar surface of the femur and thus prevents rubbing of the quadriceps femoris muscle tendon against the distal femur to protect the knee joint from damage. The patella also lifts the tendon away from the knee joint, which increases the leverage power of the quadriceps femoris muscle as it acts across the knee. The patella does not articulate with the tibia. The patellar ligament rises from the apex of the patella and inserts onto the tibial tuberosity on the anterior surface of the tibia (Figure 12.4).

\section*{Functions of the Patella:}
1. It protects the anterior articular surface of the knee joint from damage.
2. It prevents rubbing of the quadriceps femoris muscle tendon against the distal femur.

The posterior surface of the patella articulates with the femur, and is marked by two facets:
Medial facet: articulates with the medial condyle of the femur.
Lateral facet: articulates with the lateral condyle of the femur.
- The patella does not articulate with the tibia.

\section*{The Tibia}

The tibia (also known as the shin bone) is the main long bone of the leg, it is found medial to the fibula. It is the weight bearing bone of the leg, and that is why it is the second largest bone in the body after the femur. It is expanded at its proximal and distal ends and articulates proximally with femur at the knee and distally with the talus at the ankle joint.
The tibia is divided into three main portions:
1. Proximal end of tibia
2. Shaft of tibia.
3. Distal end of tibia.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-209.jpg?height=991&width=765&top_left_y=721&top_left_x=284)

Figure 12.8 Posterior view of right tibia and fibula
The proximal end of tibia has several important landmarks which act as articular surfaces and sites of muscle attachment, the medial and lateral tibial condyles are two expanded eminences at the proximal tibia, these two condyles have smooth superior articular surfaces known as the medial and lateral facets, the medial facet is oval in shape with slight concavity from side to side, and from front to backward, the lateral facet is nearly circular with concavity from side to side and slight convexity from front to backward. The central portions of the medial and lateral facets articulate with the condyles of the femur, while their peripheral portions support the menisci of the kneejoint. There is a bony eminence between the medial and lateral facets known as the intercondyloid eminence (spine of tibia), it is the site for attachment of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the menisci. The anterior surfaces of the condyles are continuous with one another, forming a large flattened triangular area; this area ends
inferiorly in a bony elevation known as the tibial tuberosity, which gives attachment to the patellar ligament. the condyles are separated posteriorly by a shallow depression known as the posterior intercondyloid fossa, which gives attachment to part of the posterior cruciate ligament. The medial surface of the medial condyle is prominent and convex; it gives attachment to the tibial collateral ligament. On the posterolateral surface of the lateral condyle there is flat facet directed downward and backward, for articulation with the head of the fibula (Figures $12.7 \& 12.8$ ).
The Shaft of the tibia has three borders: the anterior, medial and lateral borders and it has three surfaces: the medial, lateral and posterior surfaces.
The anterior border (also known as the anterior crest) it is the most prominent border, it commences superiorly at the tibial tuberosity, and ends inferiorly at the anterior margin of the medial malleolus. The upper two-thirds of anterior crest is prominent and its lower third is smooth and rounded below; it gives attachment to the deep fascia of the leg.
The medial border is smooth and rounded at its superior and inferior ends, with prominent central portion; it begins proximally at the posterior part of the medial condyle, and ends distally at the posterior border of the medial malleolus; its upper part gives attachment to the tibial collateral ligament of the knee-joint. 1
The lateral border (also known as the interosseous crest) it begins proximally in front of the articular facet of the fibula, and bifurcates distally to form the boundaries of a triangular surface, for the attachment of the interosseous ligament that connects the tibia and fibula.
The medial surface is subcutaneous along the entire length of its anteromedial aspect, it is smooth, convex surface, and broader superiorly than inferiorly.
The lateral surface is narrower than the medial surface; there is a shallow groove on the upper two-thirds of the lateral surface for the origin of the Tibialis anterior muscle; which covers the lower third of the laterat surface by its tendons.
The posterior surface it is characterized by a smooth triangular area, on its upper third, this triangular are gives insertion to the Popliteus muscle. There is prominent ridge, below this triangular area, known as the Soleal line, which extends obliquely downward from the posterior part of the articular facet for the fibula to the medial border, at the junction of its upper and middle thirds; it marks the lower limit of the insertion of the Popliteus muscle, and gives origin to part of the Soleus muscle.
The distal end of the tibia is wide to assist with stabilization and weight-bearing. There is strong pyramidal process extends from the medial surface of the distal end of the tibia, known as the medial malleolus. It articulates with the tarsal bones to form part of the ankle joint. There is a triangular rough depression on the lateral surface of the distal end of the tibia act as attachment site for the inferior interosseous ligament which connects the tibia to the fibula. The inferior surface of the distal end of the tibia is smooth and articulates with the talus (Figures $12.7 \& 12.8$ ).

\section*{The Fibula}

The fibula (fibula is Latin for "brooch" or "pin") is located lateral to the tibia, with which it is connected proximally and distally. The fibula serves more as an attachment point for muscles rather than a weight-bearing bone, it is the smaller of the two bones of leg, and it is the most slender of all the long bones. The proximal end of the fibula is small, lies toward the posterior portion of the head of the tibia, inferior to the level of the knee-joint and it does not form part of the knee. The distal end of the fibula inclines forward minimally, so as to be on a plane anterior to that of the proximal end; the distal end projects below the tibia, to forms the lateral part of the ankle-joint. The fibula can be divided into three main portions:
1. Proximal end of fibula.
2. Shaft of fibula.
3. Distal end of fibula.

Proximal end of fibula provides an attachment point for the supporting ligaments of the knee joint. It is composed of an irregular quadrate shaped head and a short neck, there is a flat rounded area on the medial surface of the head of the fibula known as a facet, it articulates with a complementary facet on the inferolateral surface of the lateral tibial condyle to form the proximal tibiofibular joint. There is an apical projection protrudes from the posterolateral part of the head of the fibula known as the styloid process of the fibula. The neck of the fibula is a short bare region lies inferior to the head of the fibula. It provides passage for the common fibular nerve which travels posterolaterally.
The shaft of the fibula is triangular in cross-section and consequently has three borders: anterior, interosseous, and posterior borders and it has three surfaces: lateral, medial, and posterior surfaces.
The anterior border of fibular shaft starts proximally at the head of the fibula and extends distally toward the lateral malleolus, where it diverges into two ridges that surround a triangular subcutaneous surface just above the lateral malleolus.
The medial border of fibular shaft also known as the interosseous border, it is located on the medial aspect of the fibula, it is the point of attachment of the fibrous interosseous membrane of the leg that forms the middle tibiofibular joint. This fibrous septum acts as a barrier between the extensor and fibular muscles.
The posterior border of fibular shaft runs along the back part of the fibula. Its proximal part is slightly rounded; however, it becomes more prominent distally, as it approaches the medial segment of the lateral malleolus.
The medial surface of fibular shaft is located between the anterior and medial borders. This surface provides attachment for the muscles that extend the foot and cause the toes to point upward (dorsiflexion).
The lateral surface of fibular shaft is found between the posterior and anterior borders, it provides attachment for the fibular muscles. This surface is spiral, its proximal part faces laterally; and as it spirals as it passes inferiorly, its distal end faces posterolaterally.

The distal end of the lateral surface is continuous with the posterior groove of the lateral malleolus.
The posterior surface of fibular shaft is found between the posterior and medial borders, it provides attachment for the flexor muscles of the foot which are responsible for pointing the toes downward (plantar flexion). The proximal part of this surface is narrower than the distal part (Figures 12.7 \& 12.8).
The distal end of the fibula is characterized by a bony projection noted on the lateral surface of the ankle known as the lateral malleolus. It is complementary to another bony projection on the medial aspect of the ankle, formed by the tibia, known as the medial malleolus. The lateral malleolus, is round and rough anteriorly, and has a broad groove posteriorly. The lateral surface of the lateral malleolus is subcutaneous (only covered by skin) and the medial surface has a triangular area that is convex along the vertical axis. The distal end of the fibula tapers off as an apical projection that articulates with the lateral aspect of the talus at the talofibular joint.

\section*{The Foot Bones}

The Foot composed of twenty six bones; seven tarsals, five metatarsal bones, and fourteen phalanges they help the foot to withstand body weight during standing and motion and provide mechanical support for the soft tissues (Figure 12.9).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-214.jpg?height=886&width=851&top_left_y=556&top_left_x=385)

\section*{The Tarsal bones:}

The tarsal bones are group of seven bones form the posterior half of the foot. They are named as follows:
1. The Calcaneus
2. The Talus
3. The Cuboid
4. The Navicular
5. The medial, middle, and lateral Cuneiforms (Figure 12.9).

The Talus: It is the uppermost tarsal bone with an irregular saddle-shape, its main function to transmit the whole body weight from the tibia to the foot. It articulates superiorly with the tibia and fibula at the ankle joint, articulates posteroinferiorly with the calcaneus at the Talocalcaneal joint and articulates anteroinferiorly with the navicular bone at the Talonavicular joint.
The talus has three main components: the body, head, and neck.
The body of the talus represents most of the volume of the talus bone, it has a curved smooth upper surface known as the talar dome, which is covered with hyaline cartilage. The medial and lateral surfaces of the body of the talus articulate with the medial malleolus of the tibia and lateral malleolus of the fibula respectively.
The head of the talus is the anterior part, it articulates with the navicular bone.
The neck of the talus is a constricted part of the talus and inclined downwards, distally and medially and connects the head of the talus to the body.

\section*{The Calcaneus:}

The calcaneus, also known as the heel bone, is the largest tarsal bone; it is an irregular cuboid shaped bone, forms the foundation of the posterior part of the foot (Figure 12.11). The calcaneus articulates superiorly with the Talus at the Talocalcaneal joint, and anteriorly with Cuboid bone at the Calcaneocuboid joint.
It protrudes posteriorly and takes the weight of the body as the heel hits the ground when walking. The posterior aspect of the calcaneus is marked by calcaneal tuberosity, to which the Achilles tendon attaches (Figure 12.13).

\section*{The Navicular:}

The navicular is a boat-shaped bone located on the medial side of the foot, it helps to connect the talus to the cuneiform bones, it articulates proximally with the talus, distally with the three cuneiform bones, and laterally with the cuboid (Figures $12.9 \& 12.14$ ).

\section*{The Cuboid:}

The cuboid is cube-shaped bone located on the lateral side of the foot (Figures 12.9 \& 12.14). It is the main bone of the mid foot, due to the several articular surfaces it possesses, it articulates with four bones: the calcaneus posteriorly, the lateral cuneiform medially, the fourth metatarsal anteromedially, and the fifth metatarsal anterolaterally.

\section*{The Cuneiforms:}

Cuneiform is a latin word means 'wedge', cuneiform bones are group of three wedge shaped tarsal bones composed of medial, middle and lateral cuneiforms, they are located in the medial side of the foot and articulate with the navicular proximally and with the first three metatarsals distally. The wedge shape of the plantar surface of the medial cuneiform bone is an important factor in the forming the shape of the transverse arch of the foot (Figures $12.9 \& 12.14$ ).

Figure 12.14 X ray right foot AP view

\section*{The Metatarsal bones:}

The Metatarsal bones are group of five long bones connect the tarsals to the phalanges; they are of convex in shape with an upward arch, which give the foot its characteristic arch, which is essential in weight bearing and walking. They are numbered from the medial side of the foot as the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsals. Each metatarsal bone articulates proximally with one or more of the tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and they articulate distally with proximal phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. They also articulate at their bases with each other at the intermetatarsal joints as follows:
- The first metatarsal articulates with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.
- The second metatarsal articulates with the three cuneiforms.
- The third metatarsal articulates with the lateral cuneiform.
- The fourth metatarsal articulates with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.
- The fifth metatarsal articulates with the cuboid (Figures 12.9 \& 12.14).

\section*{The Phalanges:}

The Phalanges of the foot are the bones of the toes, they are fourteen bones, each toe has three phalanges, proximal, intermediate and distal except the big toe, which only has two phalanges.

\section*{Learning Objectives:}
- Identify the Hip joint type.
- List the anatomical components of hip joint.
- Identify the anatomical classification of knee joint.
- List the anatomical components of knee joint.
- Identify the anatomical components of the Proximal and distal tibiofibular joints.
- Identify the anatomical components of the ankle joint.

\section*{The Hip Joint}

The hip joint is a ball and socket synovial joint, formed by the articulation between the acetabulum of the hip bone and the head of the femur.
It represents a connection between the lower limb and the pelvic girdle, thus it is designed for weight-bearing and stability rather than of movement.
The acetabulum is a cup shaped socket located on the inferolateral aspect of the hip bone, it is deepened by a fibrocartilaginous collar known as the acetabular labrum. The head of femur is hemispherical structure with smooth surface and covered with articular cartilage; it completely fits into the cavity of the acetabulum (Figure 13.1).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-222.jpg?height=586&width=902&top_left_y=727&top_left_x=368)

Figure 13.1 Hip joint

An articular cartilage surrounds the articular surfaces of the head of the femur and the acetabulum; it is much stronger at weight bearing areas. There is strong, fibrous capsule attached to the edge of the acetabulum proximally, and on the distal part it is attached to the intertrochanteric line anteriorly and to the neck of the femur posteriorly.
There is group of inner and outer ligaments attached to the hip joint to increase its stability; the inner ligaments are the head of femur ligament and transverse acetabular ligament, while the outer ligaments are Iliofemoral, Pubofemoral, and Ischiofemoral ligaments. Although these ligaments are strong and tough, they are loose enough to accommodate the high range of hip joint movement (Figure 13.1).

\section*{The knee joint}

The knee joint is a synovial hinge joint, formed by articulations between the patella, femur and tibia. It mainly allows for flexion and extension as well as small degree of medial and lateral rotation. Knee joint is composed of two articulations, the tibiofemoral articulation, connecting the distal femur to the proximal tibia, and the patellofemoral articulation, connecting the anterior portion of distal femur to the patella, knee joint is an unstable joint, thus it requires a great deal of support from tendons and muscles (Figure 13.2).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-223.jpg?height=768&width=945&top_left_y=674&top_left_x=192)

Figure 13.2 knee joint

\section*{Menisci:}

The term "meniscus" is a Greek word means "crescent", menisci of the knee joint are two crescent-shaped pads of fibrocartilaginous tissue lie between femur and tibia; they serve to disperse body weight and reduce friction during movement.,.
The medial and lateral menisci sit between the tibiofemoral articulations, where they mainly articulate with the tibia. The thicker parts of menisci face the outer edges and they wedge into the centre of the tibiofemoral articulation to allow even distribution of pressure on the tibia. The medial meniscus is more C-shaped while the lateral is more circular. The medial meniscus is fixed to the medial collateral ligament and the joint
capsule while the lateral meniscus does not have any extra attachments (Figure 13.3), rendering it fairly mobile. The transverse ligament (meniscomeniscal ligament) connects the anterior convex margin of the lateral meniscus to the anterior end of the medial meniscus; it holds the menisci in place during knee extension. The meniscofemoral ligaments attach the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus to the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle

Figure: 13.3 Anterior view of right knee in flexion

\section*{Ligaments:}

There are three major ligaments in the knee joint which are:
1. Patellar ligament
2. Collateral ligaments
3. Cruciate Ligaments

Patellar ligament: is the continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon distal to the patella. It attaches to the tibial tuberosity.
Collateral ligaments: are two strap-like ligaments:
Medial collateral ligament
Lateral collateral ligament
They play major role in stabilizing the hinge motion of the knee joint by preventing excessive medial or lateral movement.

Medial collateral ligament: is a wide and flat ligament, located on the medial side of the knee joint, it is attached proximally to the medial epicondyle of the femur, and attached distally to the medial condyle of the tibia.
Lateral collateral ligament: is located on the lateral side of the knee joint, it is thinner and rounder than the medial collateral ligament, it is attached proximally to the lateral epicondyle of the femur, and attached distally to the lateral surface of the fibular head.
Cruciate Ligaments: 'cruciate' is a latin term means "cross", cruciate ligaments are two ligaments, anterior and posterior, they cross each other as they extend from the femur proximally and the tibia distally.
Anterior cruciate ligament: it is attached proximally to the intercondylar fossa of the femur and distally to the anterior intercondylar region of the tibia where it blends with the medial meniscus. It acts to prevents anterior dislocation of the tibia onto the femur.
Posterior cruciate ligament: it is attached proximally to the anteromedial femoral condyle and distally to the posterior intercondylar region of the tibia. It acts to prevent posterior dislocation of the tibia onto the femur (Figure $13.3 \& 13.4$ ).

Figure 13.4 Sagittal MRI Proton Density sequence of knee joint

Knee joint bursae: there are multiple bursae surrounding the knee joint, they facilitate movement and reduce friction where tendons or muscles pass over bony prominences. They can be either communicating or non-communicating with the knee joint itself. There are four bursae anterior to the knee joint:
1. Suprapatellar bursa: located between the femur and quadriceps femoris muscle.
2. Subcutaneous Prepatellar bursa: between the skin and patella
3. Subcutaneous Infrapatellar bursa: between the skin and tibial tuberosity
4. Deep Infrapatellar bursa: between patella ligament and upper tibia (Figure 13.5).

Figure 13.5 Knee joint bursae

\section*{The Tibiofibular Joints}

The proximal and distal tibiofibular joints refer to two articulations between the tibia and fibula of the leg. These two joints play a major role in stability and weight-bearing rather than movement (Figures 13.6 \& 13.7).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-227.jpg?height=1038&width=826&top_left_y=537&top_left_x=247)

Figure 13.7 Anterior view of right tibia and fibula

\section*{The Proximal Tibiofibular Joint:}

The proximal tibiofibular joint is a plane type synovial joint formed by articulation between the head of the fibula and the lateral condyle of the tibia.
The articular surfaces of the proximal tibiofibular joint are lined with hyaline cartilage and contained within a joint capsule.
The joint capsule receives additional support from:
- Anterior and posterior superior tibiofibular ligaments which span between the fibular head and lateral tibial condyle.
- Lateral collateral ligament of the knee joint.
- Biceps femoris - provides reinforcement as it inserts onto the fibular head (Figure 13.7).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-228.jpg?height=636&width=920&top_left_y=753&top_left_x=357)

Figure 13.7 Posterior view of The Proximal Tibiofibular Joint

The Distal Tibiofibular joint: also known as (tibiofibular syndesmosis) is fibrous joint formed by articulation between the fibular notch of the distal tibia and the fibula.
As it is a fibrous joint, the distal tibiofibular joint does not have a joint capsule, it is supported by:
- Interosseous membrane which spans the whole length of the tibia and fibula.
- Anterior and posterior inferior tibiofibular ligaments.
- Inferior transverse tibiofibular ligament (Figures $13.8 \& 13.9$ ).

\section*{The Ankle Joint}

The ankle joint is a hinge type synovial joint formed by articulation between three bones; the bones of the leg (tibia and fibula) and the foot bone (talus). The tibia and fibula are strongly bound together by tibiofibular ligaments, and they form a bracket shaped socket known as a mortise into which the dome of the talus fits.
The medial malleolus of the tibia extends inferiorly to articulate with the talus on its medial aspect, and the lateral malleolus of the fibula articulate with the talus on its lateral aspect laterally.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_09_5c7058303e6d1c6ad4cfg-230.jpg?height=456&width=737&top_left_y=684&top_left_x=442)

Figure 13.10 X ray Ankle Joint AP view
The ankle joint Ligaments: There are two main groups of ligaments; medial and lateral groups, which originate the medial and lateral malleoli respectively, they mainly stabilize the ankle joint, and act as a guide to direct the motion of the ankle joint by attaching the lateral malleolus to the bones below the ankle joint, and they are also responsible for resistance against over-inversion and over-eversion stress of the foot.
Medial Ligament: also known as the deltoid ligament, it consists of four ligaments, which fan out from the medial malleolus and attached to the talus, calcaneus and navicular bones. Their primary action is to resist over-eversion stress of the foot (Figure 13.11).

Lateral Ligament: it originates from the lateral malleolus and is consists of three distinct ligaments (Figure 13.12):
Anterior Talofibular: it spans between the lateral malleolus and lateral aspect of the talus.
Posterior Talofibular: it spans between the lateral malleolus and the posterior aspect of the talus.
Calcaneofibular: it spans between the lateral malleolus and the calcaneus.
The primary action of the lateral ligament is to resist over-inversion stress of the foot.

\section*{The Subtalar joint}

The subtalar joint (also known as the talocalcaneal joint) is a plane synovial joint formed by the articulation between the inferior surface of the body of the talus and the superior surface of the calcaneus, it is enclosed by a joint capsule, which is strengthened externally by a fibrous layer and supported by the following ligaments:
1. Posterior talocalcaneal ligament.
2. Medial talocalcaneal ligament.
3. Lateral talocalcaneal ligament.
4. Interosseous talocalcaneal ligament.

Figure 13.8 X ray ankle joint lateral view

\section*{Talocalcaneonavicular joint}

This joint is composed of two articulations: the anterior articulation of the subtalar joint and the articulation between the talus and the navicular. They are stabilized by a fibrous capsule and by the talonavicular and plantar calcaneonavicular ligaments. The talonavicular ligament connects the dorsal aspect of the talar neck with the navicular bone and is covered by extensor tendons. The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, also known as the spring ligament, runs from the anterior aspect of the sustentaculum tali to the plantar surface of the navicular bone.

\section*{Calcaneocuboid joint}

The calcaneocuboid joint is a saddle (biaxial) joint, and is formed by the distal surface of the calcaneus and the proximal aspect of the cuboid. This joint is stabilized by three ligaments:
1. The bifurcate ligament is a Y-shaped band, attaches proximally to the anterior aspect of the calcaneus and divides distally into two parts: the calcaneocuboid part attaches to the dorsomedial surface of the cuboid bone and the calcaneonavicular part attaches to the dorsolateral aspect of the navicular bone.
2. The longest ligament also known as the long plantar ligament. It runs from the plantar surface of the calcaneus bone to the tuberosity located on the plantar aspect of the cuboid bone. More superficial fibers continue on to attach to the bases of the second to fourth metatarsals.
3. The plantar calcaneocuboid ligament extends from the anterior tubercle of the calcaneus to the plantar aspect of the cuboid. It is located deep to the long plantar ligament and is separated from it by areolar tissue.

\section*{Naviculocuneiform joint}

The naviculocuneiform joint is a compound joint and consists of articulations between the navicular and the three cuneiform bones. The bones of this joint are connected by two ligaments: The dorsal and plantar ligaments connect the navicular bone with each cuneiform. The medial dorsal ligament continues as a capsule around the medial aspect of the joint.

\section*{Cuboideonavicular joint}

The cuboideonavicular joint is a syndesmosis that connects the cuboid and navicular bones. This joint is stabilized by dorsal, plantar and interosseous ligaments.

\section*{Intercuneiform and cuneocuboid joints}

The intercuneiform and cuneocuboid joints are synovial joints involving the cuneiform and cuboid bones. The bones are connected together by dorsal, plantar and interosseous ligaments. Both the dorsal and plantar ligaments consist of three transverse bands, which run between the cuneiform bones and between the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid bone. The interosseous ligaments connect non-articular surfaces of the bones.

\section*{Tarsometatarsal joints}

The tarsometatarsal joints connect the metatarsals with some of the tarsal bones of the foot. The first metatarsal articulates with the medial cuneiform, the second with the intermediate cuneiform and the third metatarsal articulates with the lateral cuneiform. The lateral cuneiform also articulates with the fourth metatarsal and the cuboid bone forms articulations with both the fourth and fifth metatarsals. There are three bands of ligaments involved in stabilizing these joints:
1. The dorsal tarsometatarsal ligaments connect the metatarsal bones to the cuboid and cuneiform bones.
2. The plantar tarsometatarsal ligaments consist of both longitudinal and oblique bands.
3. The interosseous cuneometatarsal ligaments this is the strongest of the three ligaments, it runs from the second metatarsal to the lateral aspect of the medial cuneiform (Figure 13.9).

\section*{Intermetatarsal joints}

The intermetatarsal joints are articulations formed between the metatarsal bones and are stabilized by intermetatarsal interosseous ligaments. These ligaments run between the lateral four metatarsal bones. Dorsal and plantar intermetatarsal ligaments are also involved in the stabilization of this joint.

\section*{Metatarsophalangeal joints}

The metatarsophalangeal joints are ellipsoid joints, which consist of articulations between the heads of the metatarsals and the bases of the proximal phalanges. On the plantar surface of the first metatarsal head, there are two longitudinal grooves separated by a ridge, the crista. These two grooves articulate with the two sesamoid bones within the joint capsule. The bones of the metatarsophalangeal joints are stabilized by the following ligaments:
1. The collateral ligaments: run from the dorsal tubercles of the metatarsal heads before widening and attaching to the bases of the proximal phalanges.
2. The Plantar ligaments: lie between the collateral ligaments, are attached firmly to the phalangeal bases and loosely to the metatarsal heads. They blend with both the deep transverse metatarsal and collateral ligaments.
3. The Deep transverse metatarsal ligaments: they are four flat bands, unite the plantar ligaments and lie between the interossei and the lumbricals (Figure 13.10).

\section*{Interphalangeal joints}

These hinge joints are formed between the trochlear surface of the phalangeal heads and the curved surface of the bases of the corresponding phalanges. They are stabilized by an articular capsule and two collateral ligaments.
