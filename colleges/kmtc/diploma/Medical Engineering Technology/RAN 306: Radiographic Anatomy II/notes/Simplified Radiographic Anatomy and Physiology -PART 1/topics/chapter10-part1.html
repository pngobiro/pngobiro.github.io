<h2 class="section-heading">The Shoulder Joint</h2>

<p>Shoulder joint, also known as Glenohumeral joint, is the multiaxial ball-and-socket synovial joint formed by the articulation of the head of the humerus with the glenoid cavity of the scapula. The glenoid cavity is deepened and slightly enlarged by the glenoid labrum, a fibrocartilage ring attaching to the outside margin of the glenoid fossa.</p>

<h3>The capsule of the shoulder joint</h3>
<p>As a synovial joint, the shoulder joint has a capsule that surrounds the joint cavity and encloses synovial fluid that lubricates the articular surfaces of the joint. It is attached medially to the outer margin of the glenoid fossa and laterally to the anatomical neck of the humerus, just distal to the head of the humerus. This capsule is loose inferiorly, and lies in folds during full adduction of the arm, these folds allow for abduction of the arm, during which they become taught.</p>

</figure>

<h3>Bursae of the shoulder joint</h3>
<p>The bursa is a fluid filled sac that provides cushioning between joint structures to protect the joint capsule from wear. The glenohumeral joint has several bursae that protect the joint capsule from excessive wear from overlying structures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subacromial bursa lies between the acromion process of the scapula and the supraspinatus muscle</li>
<li>Subscapular bursa protects the joint capsule and the muscle tendon of the supraspinatus muscle from wear from the acromion process during arm abduction</li>
<li>Subscapular bursa lies between the tendon of subscapularis muscle and the scapula, reducing wear and tear on the subscapularis tendon during shoulder joint movement</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Elbow Joint</h2>

<p>The elbow is the joint connecting the upper arm to the forearm. It is classed as a hinge-type synovial joint. It is the articulation point of the humerus and the radius and the ulna. The elbow joint consists of two separate articulations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Humeroulnar joint between the trochlea on the medial aspect of the distal end of the humerus and the trochlear notch on the proximal ulna</li>
<li>Humeroradial joint between the capitulum on the lateral aspect of the distal end of the humerus with the head of the radius</li>
</ol>

<p>These two joints give the elbow its characteristic hinge like properties. The rounded surfaces of the capitulum of the humerus rotate against the concave surfaces of the head of the radius, and the wrench shape of the trochlear notch of the ulna moves around the trochlea of the humerus.</p>

</figure>

<h3>The capsule of the elbow joint</h3>
<p>The elbow joint has a strong and fibrous capsule that encloses and strengthens the joint. This capsule is thickened medially and laterally to form collateral ligaments, which stabilize the flexing and extending motion of the arm.</p>

</figure>

<h3>The bursa of the elbow joint</h3>
<p>There are many bursae in the elbow, but only a few have clinical importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Intratendinous bursa: lies within the tendon of the triceps brachii muscle</li>
<li>Subtendinous bursa: reduces friction between the olecranon and the tendon of the triceps brachii muscle during extension and flexion of the arm</li>
<li>Olecranon bursa: lies between the olecranon and the overlying connective tissue</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="section-heading">Proximal and Distal Radioulnar Joints</h2>

<p>The proximal radioulnar joint is a pivot-type synovial joint between the head of the radius and the radial notch of the ulna. The joint is strengthened by the annular ligament of the radius, which holds the radial head in position during pronation and supination movements of the forearm.</p>

<p>The distal radioulnar joint is also a pivot-type synovial joint between the head of the ulna and the ulnar notch of the radius. It works in conjunction with the proximal radioulnar joint to allow pronation and supination of the forearm.</p>
