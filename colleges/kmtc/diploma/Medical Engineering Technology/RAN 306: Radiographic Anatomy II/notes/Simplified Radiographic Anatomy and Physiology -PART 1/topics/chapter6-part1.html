<p>The vertebral column (also known as the backbone) is the part of the axial skeleton that extends from the base of the skull down to the pelvis. It consists of sequence of 33 separate bony vertebrae, 24 of them are joined by cartilaginous intervertebral discs inbetween known as presacral vertebrae, and 9 are fused in two regions: sacral 5 and coccygeal 4. The vertebral column houses the spinal cord in a cavity known as the spinal canal.</p>

<p>Vertebral column is divided into five regions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cervical region at the neck, composed of 7 vertebrae</li>
<li>Thoracic region at the mid-back, composed of 12 vertebrae</li>
<li>Lumbar region at the lower-back, composed of 5 vertebrae</li>
<li>Sacral region at the upper pelvis, composed of 5 vertebrae</li>
<li>Coccygeal region at the lower pelvis, composed of 5 vertebrae</li>

<p>Normal vertebral column does not form a straight line, but instead has four curvatures:</p>
<ol>
<li>The cervical curve</li>
<li>The thoracic curve</li>
<li>The lumbar curve</li>
<li>The sacrococcygeal curve</li>
</ol>

<p>These curvatures increase the strength and flexibility of the vertebral column, beside they increase the ability of the vertebral column to absorb shock.</p>

<li><strong>Protection:</strong> The major function of the vertebral column is protection of the spinal cord.</li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> It carries the weight of the body above the pelvis.</li>
<li><strong>Central Axis:</strong> It forms the central axis of the body, and provides attachment for the muscles of pectoral and pelvic girdles.</li>

<p>Although the anatomical structure of vertebrae varies in size and shape within the different regions of the vertebral column, all vertebrae follow general similarity in their structural pattern. The basic anatomical structure of a typical vertebra is composed of two main parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Vertebral body anteriorly</li>
<li>Vertebral arch posteriorly</li>
</ol>

<figcaption>Figure 6.4: Anatomical structure of a typical vertebra showing vertebral body and vertebral arch.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Vertebral Body</h3>
<p>The vertebral body forms the anterior part of vertebra and it is the weight-bearing part. This is why lower vertebral bodies are larger than the upper to better support the increased weight.</p>

<h3>Vertebral Arch</h3>
<p>The vertebral arch forms the lateral and posterior aspect of each vertebrae, it is formed by seven processes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Single spinous process centered posteriorly</li>
<li>Two transverse processes extend laterally and posteriorly from the vertebral body</li>
<li>Two pedicles connect the vertebral body to the transverse processes</li>
<li>Two laminae connect the transverse and spinous processes</li>
</ol>

<p>On each side of vertebrae there are two articular facets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two superior articular facets facing superiorly and backward</li>
<li>Two inferior articular facets facing inferiorly and forward</li>
</ol>

<p>The cervical region is composed of seven cervical vertebrae numbered from C1 to C7; their main function is to support the weight of the head, which weighs between 10 and 13 pounds. In addition, they allow for the great range of head motion and neck flexibility.</p>

<h3 class="subsection-heading">Atlas and Axis</h3>

<p>The uppermost two cervical vertebrae are specialized vertebrae. The first cervical vertebra C1 is known as the Atlas. It is ring-shaped vertebra lacks a body and a spinous process; and there is no intervertebral disc below or above it. Atlas is directly connected to skull through the articulation of the superior articular facets of the atlas with the occipital condyles of the skull at the Atlanto-occipital joint, this joint allows for the "yes" motion of the head.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 6.7: First cervical vertebra (Atlas) superior view.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The second cervical vertebra (C2) is known as the Axis. This vertebra is peg-shaped composed of a vertebral body, pedicles, laminae, transverse processes, and a unique projection called the (Dens) or (Odontoid process). The anterior arch of the Atlas articulates and pivots around this projection at the atlantoaxial joint allowing for the side-to-side or "no" motion of the head.</p>

<p>The five lower cervical vertebrae from C3 down to C7 are similar to each other; each has a vertebral body with a concave superior surface and convex inferior surface. They have facets of superior and inferior articular processes that articulate in oblique planes that slope downward laterally and posteriorly. Only cervical vertebrae have a transverse foramen in each of their transverse processes.</p>
