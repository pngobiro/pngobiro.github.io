<p>The Shoulder Girdle, also known as the Pectoral Girdle, connects the bones of the upper limb to the axial skeleton. The shoulder girdle is composed of two bones:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Scapula</li>
<li>The Clavicle</li>
</ol>

<section id="chapter-8-scapula" class="content-section">
<h2 class="section-heading">The Scapula</h2>

<p>The scapula, also known as the shoulder blade, is a triangular flat bone with three borders: superior, medial, and lateral borders, and two corners: the superior corner (located between the medial and superior borders) and the inferior corner (located between the medial and lateral borders). There is a shallow depression located at the superior corner known as the glenoid fossa, which articulates with the head of the humerus to form the shoulder joint (also known as the Glenohumeral joint).</p>

<p>The scapula has anterior and posterior surfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>The anterior surface (also known as the costal surface) is concave in shape and contains a depression over the majority of its surface, known as the Subscapular fossa.</li>
<li>There is a small hook-like bony process located on the lateral edge of the superior portion of the anterior surface of the scapula pointing anterolaterally known as the Coracoid process; it plays a role in the stabilization of the shoulder joint.</li>
<li>On the superior aspect of the anterior surface there is a large concave depression, medial to the coracoid process, known as The Suprascapular notch; it separates the coracoid process from the superior border of the scapula.</li>
</ul>

<p>The posterior surface of the scapula is convex in shape and has several notable features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A protruding bony ridge known as the spine of the scapula divides the posterior surface into two unequal parts</li>
<li>The superior part is known as The Supraspinous fossa</li>
<li>The inferior part is known as The Infraspinous fossa</li>
<li>On the lateral end of the spine of scapula, there is an anterolateral bony protuberance that arcs over the shoulder joint and articulates with the distal end of the clavicle, known as the acromion process</li>
</ul>

<section id="chapter-8-clavicle" class="content-section">
<h2 class="section-heading">The Clavicle</h2>

<p>The clavicle, also known as the collarbone, is a curved long bone that forms the anterior portion of the shoulder girdle. It is located at the anterosuperior part of the thorax, just above the first rib and articulates laterally with the acromion process of the scapula and medially with the manubrium of the sternum. It is the only long bone that lies almost horizontally in the human body.</p>

<h3>Functions of the clavicle</h3>
<p>The clavicle has many important functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>It serves as a strut to support the scapula superiorly, by the action of the muscles that anchors it from above.</li>
<li>It stabilizes the shoulder joint superolaterally, and by this it allows for free motion of the upper limb.</li>
<li>It transmits forces coming from the upper limb to the axial skeleton through the sternum.</li>
<li>It protects the underlying neurovascular bundle that pass between the trunk and the upper limb.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Anatomical regions of the clavicle</h3>
<p>The clavicle is divided into three regions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The medial region, also known as the sternal end:
  <ul>
    <li>It is triangular in shape</li>
    <li>Articulates with the sternum at the manubrium forming the sternoclavicular joint</li>
    <li>This is the only direct bony articulation between the axial skeleton and the pectoral girdle of the upper limb</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>The lateral region, also known as the acromial end:
  <ul>
    <li>Articulates with the acromion of the scapula forming the acromioclavicular joint</li>
    <li>Forms the bony tip of the shoulder</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>The intermediate region or shaft:
  <ul>
    <li>Divided into medial two-thirds and lateral one third</li>
    <li>The lateral third has two borders and inferior and superior surfaces</li>
    <li>The anterior border is concave and gives attachment to the deltoid muscle</li>
    <li>The posterior border is convex and gives attachment to the trapezius muscle</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<figcaption>Figure 8.6: Superior view of the right clavicle</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The inferior surface of the clavicle has two notable features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ridge known as the trapezoid line for attachment with the trapezoid</li>
<li>A tubercle, known as the conoid tubercle for attachment with the conoid ligament</li>
</ul>
