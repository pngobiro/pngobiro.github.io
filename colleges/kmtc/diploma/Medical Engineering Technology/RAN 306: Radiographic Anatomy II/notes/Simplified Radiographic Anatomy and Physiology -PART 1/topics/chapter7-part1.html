<p>Thoracic Cage is the thoracic wall skeleton. It consists of Sternum anteriorly, 12 thoracic vertebrae posteriorly and 12 pairs of ribs anchored to the vertebrae.</p>

<p>The main functions of the thoracic cage are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>It supports the thorax and protects the vital thoracic and abdominal organs</li>
<li>It provides attachment for upper limbs and supports their weight</li>
<li>It provides attachment for the muscles that move upper limb and stabilize their position</li>
<li>It resists the negative pressure generated by the elastic recoil of the lungs during respiration</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Sternum</h2>

<p>Sternum is a flat elongated bone located in the anterior part of the thoracic cage. It is anchored to the rib via costal cartilage. The sternum consists of three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The manubrium</li>
<li>The body</li>
<li>The xiphoid process</li>
</ol>

<figcaption>Figure 7.2: The Sternum anterior view</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>The manubrium</h3>
<p>It is the broad superior part of the sternum, it is quadrangular in shape. It has a superior shallow, U-shaped border called the jugular notch located between the medial ends of the clavicles. The inferior border of the sternum is oval in shape and covered with a thin layer of cartilage for articulation with the body of the sternum at the sternal angle. The lateral borders of the sternum are marked by depression for the first costal cartilages.</p>

<h3>The Body of the Sternum</h3>
<p>It is the long flat central part of the sternum, directed upward and forward. Its superior border joins the manubrium at the sternal angle where the cartilage of the second rib is attached to the sternum. At the lateral border of the body of the sternum there are four angular depressions for the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. The inferior border of the body of the sternum is narrow, and articulates with the xiphoid process, at this point there is a notch for the cartilage of the seventh rib.</p>

<h3>The xiphoid process</h3>
<p>It is a small cartilaginous process located at the inferior end of the sternum, which is usually ossified in the adult human.</p>

</figure>

<h3>The sternal angle</h3>
<p>Also clinically known as the Angle of Louis, it is the point where the body of the sternum joins the manubrium; it is about 160 degrees. It can be felt at the anterior wall of the chest at the farthest point of sternal projects. There are two lateral depressions at sternal angle for the attachment of the second pair of costal cartilages, that is why it can be used as a land mark for the second rib. The sternal angle is located at the level of the inferior border of T4.</p>

<section id="chapter-7-ribs" class="content-section">
<h2 class="section-heading">Ribs and Costal cartilages</h2>

<p>Ribs are long bones, flattened and curved. There are twelve pairs of ribs in the thoracic cage; they connect the sternum anteriorly to the upper ten thoracic vertebrae posteriorly.</p>

<h3>Function of ribs</h3>
<p>As part of the thoracic cage, the ribs protect the vital thoracic and part of the abdominal organs. They also play a role in breathing, as they move to permit lung inflation during thoracic expansion.</p>

<h3>Rib Classifications</h3>
<p>There are two types of rib classification:</p>
<ol>
<li>According to their anatomical features ribs are classified into: Typical and Atypical ribs.</li>
<li>According to their articulation, location and their costal cartilage ribs are classified into: True, Floating and False ribs.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Typical Ribs</h3>
<p>Typical Ribs include from 3rd up to 9th ribs. A typical rib is mainly composed of: head, neck and body. The head of a typical rib is wedge shaped with two articular facets separated by crest, the inferior facet articulates with the numerically corresponding vertebrae and the superior facet articulates with the vertebrae above.</p>

<img src="../assets/images/chapter7/chapter7-fig5-typical-rib.jpg" alt="Landmarks of a typical rib">
<figcaption>Figure 7.5: Landmarks of a typical rib</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Atypical Ribs</h3>
<p>Atypical Ribs are the 1st, 2nd, 10th and 12th ribs. Atypical ribs have distinct characteristics for each:</p>

<h4>1st Rib</h4>
<p>Is the shortest rib, it is flat and wider than other ribs. It has a small rounded head with one facet for articulation with its corresponding vertebrae. The superior and lateral surfaces are indented by two grooves for the subclavian vessels.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 7.6: Superior view of the first left rib demonstrating its landmarks</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>2nd Rib</h4>
<p>The second rib is longer than the first rib and thinner, it has two articular facets and a tubercle on its superior surface for the attachment of Serratus anterior muscle.</p>

<img src="../assets/images/chapter7/chapter7-fig7-second-rib.jpg" alt="Superior view of the second left rib">
<figcaption>Figure 7.7: Superior view of the second left rib demonstrating its landmarks</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>10th, 11th and 12th Ribs</h4>
<p>Are directly attached to their numerically corresponding vertebrae with single facet for articulation.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 7.8: Posterior end of 10th, 11th and 12th Ribs demonstrating their single facets</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>True, False and Floating ribs</h3>
<p>The first seven ribs (from 1st down to 7th ribs) are True ribs; the main feature of true ribs is that the costal cartilages from these ribs are directly attached to the sternum. The next lower five ribs (from 8th down to 12th ribs) are False ribs, the main feature of false ribs is that the costal cartilages from these ribs do not directly attach to the sternum. The costal cartilages from 8th, 9th and 10th ribs are attached to the cartilage of the next higher ribs. The two lower ribs (11th and 12th ribs) are Floating ribs; the main feature of these ribs is that they are short and do not attach to the sternum at all. The costal cartilages of these ribs terminate within the musculature of the lateral abdominal wall.</p>

</figure>

<h3>The costal cartilages</h3>
<p>There are 12 pairs of costal cartilage that form part of the anterior wall of the thoracic cage. They connect the ribs to the sternum and help in extending the forward motion of the ribs. They also contribute to thoracic elasticity within by allowing chest expand during respiration. The upper seven pairs of costal cartilage are directly connected to the sternum, while the next lower three pairs are connected with the next upper ribs, and the last two pairs of costal cartilage are pointed, ending in the abdominal wall.</p>
