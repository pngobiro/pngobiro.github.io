                    <p>It refers to computerized x-ray imaging; it is the application of computer to process a group of X-ray images taken from different angles to produce precisely detailed cross-sectional images of the internal organs of specific part of human body.</p>

                    <h3>CT Scanner Components and Operation</h3>
                    <p>CT scanner is a ring-shaped machine uses a motorized x-ray tube that rotates around a circular gantry. During a CT scan imaging, the patient lies on a motorized platform that moves slowly through the gantry while the x-ray tube rotates around the patient and produce narrow fan shaped beams of x-rays through the patient. As the x-rays pass through the patient body they are picked up by special array of digital x-ray detectors, which are located directly opposite the x-ray tube, and transmit these attenuated rays to a computer.</p>

                    <h3>Basic Principle of CT Scan</h3>
                    <p>CT scan is based on the principle that the internal structure of the examined body part can be reconstructed from multiple projections, to build up cross-sectional slices through measurement of the linear attenuation coefficient.</p>

                    <h3>The Linear Attenuation Coefficient ($\mu$)</h3>
                    <p>The linear attenuation coefficient describes the fraction of a beam of x-rays that is absorbed or scattered per unit thickness of the medium.</p>
                    <p>The image of the section irradiated by x-ray is reconstructed from a large number of measurements of attenuation coefficient. It gathers together all the data coming from the elementary volumes of material through the detectors.</p>

                    <h3>CT Image Composition</h3>
                    <p>Because CT scan image is basically a digital image, it consists of a square matrix of elements (pixel), each of which represents a volume element (voxel) of the tissue of the examined part of the patient. It is typically composed of 512 rows, each of 512 pixels, which means that a square matrix of $512 \times 512=262144$ pixels (one for each voxel).</p>

                    <h3>The Hounsfield Scale</h3>
                    <p>Named for the Nobel Prize-winning inventor of CT scan, the British physicist Godfrey N. Hounsfield, The Hounsfield unit (HU) scale transforms the linear attenuation coefficient measurement where:</p>

                    <h3>CT Windows</h3>
                    <p>Although there are more than 2,000 different Hounsfield values, the monitor can display only 256 shades of gray, and the human eye cannot appreciate more than 40. To overcome these inherent limitations, a gray scale is used in image display.</p>

                    <h3>Basic Concept of MRI Imaging</h3>
                    <p>In normal circumstances, hydrogen protons of the human body spin on their own axis in a manner very similar to the planet earth, with a north-south pole. In this respect hydrogen protons behave like small bar magnets distributed in the body with their axes randomly aligned.</p>
