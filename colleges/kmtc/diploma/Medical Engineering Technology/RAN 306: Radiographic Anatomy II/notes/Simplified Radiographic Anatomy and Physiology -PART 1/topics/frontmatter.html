                    <p>It is very important for medical imaging students to understand that radiographic evaluation of the internal components of human body is a difficult task due the complexity of the internal anatomic structures of human body.</p>
                    <p>Radiographic images, x-ray films, sonographic section, CT scan or magnetic resonance images, are all represent an illustration of anatomical views of the internal components of human body, the key to understand the normal appearance of radiographic images and consequently to obtain ideal and informative radiographic images, is the comprehensive knowledge of the normal anatomical structure of human body.</p>
