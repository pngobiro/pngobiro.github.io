                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Chest radiographic examinations are the most common of all radiographic procedures. Before beginning clinical experience, it is important to learn and understand chest anatomy, including relative relationships of all anatomy within the chest cavity.</p>
                        <p>The chest, or thorax, is the upper portion of the trunk between the neck and the abdomen.</p>
                        <p>Radiographic anatomy of the chest is divided into three sections: bony thorax, respiratory system Proper, and mediastinum.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Bony thorax</h3>
                        <p>The bony thorax is the part of the skeletal system that provides a protective framework for the parts of the chest involved with breathing and blood circulation.</p>
                        <p>Thoracic viscera is the term used to describe these parts of the chest consisting of the lungs and the remaining thoracic organs contained in the mediastinum.</p>
                        <p>Anteriorly, the bony thorax consists of the sternum which has three divisions. The superior portion is the manubrium, the large center portion is the body, and the smaller inferior portion is the xiphoid process. Superiorly, the bony thorax consists of the 2 clavicles (collarbones) that connect the sternum to the 2 scapulae (shoulder blades), the 12 pairs of ribs that circle the thorax, and the 12 thoracic vertebrae posteriorly.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Topographic Positioning Landmarks</h3>
                        <p>Accurate and consistent radiographic positioning requires certain landmarks, or reference points, that can be used to center the image receptor (IR) correctly to ensure that all essential anatomy is included on that specific projection.</p>
                        <p>These topographic landmarks should be parts of the body that are easily and consistently located on patients, such as parts of the bony thorax.</p>
                        <p>For chest positioning, two of these landmarks are the vertebra prominence and the jugular notch.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Vertebra prominence (seventh cervical vertebra)</h4>
                        <p>The vertebra prominence is an important landmark for determining the central ray (CR) location on a Posteroanterior (PA) chest projection.</p>
                        <p>It can be palpated readily on most patients by applying light pressure with the fingertips at the base of the neck.</p>
                        <p>The vertebra prominence is the first prominent process felt as you gently but firmly palpate down the back of the neck with the head dropped forward.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Jugular notch (manubrial or suprasternal notch)</h4>
                        <p>The jugular notch is an important landmark for determining the CR placement on Anteroposterior (AP) chest projections. This is palpated easily as a deep notch or depression on the superior portion of the sternum below the thyroid cartilage. The midthorax, at the level of T7 (seventh thoracic vertebra), Can be located easily from these two landmarks.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Xiphoid process (tip)</h3>
                        <p>The inferior tip of the sternum, the xiphoid process, which corresponds to the level of T9 or T10, can also be palpated. The xiphoid process corresponds to the approximate level of the anterior portion of the diaphragm, which separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. However, this is not a reliable landmark for positioning the chest because of variations in body habitus and the variable lower position of the posterior lungs, which may extend as far as T11 or T12 on inspiration.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Respiration is the exchange of gaseous substances between the air we breathe and the bloodstream. The respiratory system consists of the parts of the body through which air passes as it travels from the nose and mouth into the lungs.</p>
                        <p>Four general divisions of the respiratory system are the pharynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs.</p>
                        <p>An important structure of the respiratory system is the dome shaped diaphragm, which is the primary muscle of inspiration.</p>
                        <p>Each half of the diaphragm is called a hemi diaphragm ("hemi-" meaning half).</p>
                        <p>As the dome of the diaphragm moves downward, it increases the volume of the thoracic cavity.</p>
                        <p>This increase in volume, along with certain other dimensional movements of the thorax described later in this chapter, decreases the intrathoracic pressure, creating a "sucking" action or negative pressure effect, resulting in air being drawn into the lungs through the nose and mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. This causes the lungs to fill with air, which is known as inspiration.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pharynx</h3>
                        <p>The pharynx (far'-inks) (upper airway) is a structure or passageway that is important to the respiratory system because air must pass through it before entering the respiratory system, which begins with the larynx, or voice box. The pharynx, also referred to as the upper airway or the upper respiratory tract, is the posterior area between the nose and mouth above and the larynx and esophagus below.</p>
                        <p>This area serves as a passageway for food and fluids as well as air, making it common to the digestive and respiratory systems.</p>
                        <p>For this reason, the pharynx is not considered part of the respiratory system.</p>
                        <p>The pharynx has three divisions, nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx.</p>
                        <p>The interior of the pharynx communicates posteriorly with certain cavities-the nose above (nasopharynx), the mouth (oropharynx), and the larynx below (laryngopharynx)-as well as the esophagus.</p>
                        <p>The hard palate and the soft palate make up the roof of the oral cavity. The lower posterior aspect of the soft palate is called the uvula, this marks the boundary between the nasopharynx and the oropharynx.</p>
                        <p>The laryngopharynx lies above and posterior to the larynx and extends from the upper border of the epiglottis to where the laryngopharynx narrows to join the esophagus.</p>
                        <p>The upper portion of the epiglottis projects upward behind the tongue and acts as a lid for the slanted opening of the larynx.</p>
                        <p>During the act of swallowing, the epiglottis flips down and covers the laryngeal opening, and this prevents food and fluid from entering the larynx and bronchi.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Esophagus</h3>
                        <p>The esophagus is the part of the digestive system that connects the pharynx with the stomach. Note the relationship of the esophagus to both the pharynx and the larynx. It begins at the distal end of the laryngopharynx and continues downward to the stomach, posterior to the larynx and trachea.</p>

                          <p>The pharynx serves as a passage for both air and food and is not considered part of the respiratory system proper.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Larynx (voice box)</h3>
                        <p>The larynx, or voice box, is a cage like, cartilaginous structure that is approximately 1.5 to 2 inches (4 to 5 cm) in length in an adult.</p>
                        <p>The larynx is located in the anterior portion of the neck, suspended from a small bone called the hyoid. The hyoid bone is found in the upper neck just below the tongue or floor of the mouth</p>
                        <p>The hyoid bone is not part of the larynx. The larynx serves as the organ of voice. Sounds are made as air passes between the vocal cords located within the larynx.</p>
                        <p>The upper margin of the larynx is at the approximate level of C3. Its lower margin, where the larynx joins with the trachea, is at the level of C6.</p>
                        <p>The framework of the larynx consists of cartilages that are connected by ligaments and moved by numerous muscles that assist in the complex sound-making or voice process. The largest and least mobile of these cartilages is the thyroid cartilage, which consists of two fused plate like structures that form the anterior wall of the larynx.</p>
                        <p>The prominent anterior projection of the thyroid cartilage is palpated easily and is known as the laryngeal prominence, or Adam's apple.</p>
                        <p>This prominent structure is an important positioning landmark because it is easy to locate. The laryngeal prominence of the thyroid cartilage located at approximately the level of C5 is an excellent topographic reference for locating specific skeletal structures in this region.</p>
                        <p>The cricoid cartilage is a ring of cartilage that forms the inferior and posterior wall of the larynx. It is attached to the first ring of cartilage of the trachea.</p>
                        <p>One of the cartilages that make up the larynx is the uniquely shaped epiglottis, which resembles a leaf with the narrow distal stem portion attached to a part of the thyroid cartilage.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Trachea</h3>
                        <p>Continuing from the larynx downward, the second division of the respiratory system proper is the trachea, or windpipe. It is a fibrous muscular tube about 0.75 inch (2 cm) in diameter and 4.5 inches (11 cm) long.</p>
                        <p>Approximately 20 C-shaped rings of cartilage are embedded in its walls. These rigid rings keep the airway open by preventing the trachea from collapsing during inspiration. The trachea, located just anterior to the esophagus, extends from its junction with the larynx at the level of C6 (sixth cervical vertebra) downward to the level of T4 or T5 (fourth or fifth thoracic vertebra), where it divides into right and left primary bronchi.</p>
                        <p>Glands located near the respiratory system include the thyroid, parathyroid, and thymus glands.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-18-1.jpg" alt="Fig. 2-8 Trachea." class="content-image">

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Right and Left Bronchi</h3>
                        <p>The third part of the respiratory system consists of the right and left primary bronchi, also known as the right and left main stem bronchi.</p>
                        <p>The right primary bronchus is wider and shorter than the left bronchus. The right primary bronchus is also more vertical; therefore, the angle of divergence from the distal trachea is less abrupt for the right bronchus than for the left.</p>
                        <p>This difference in size and shape between the two primary bronchi is important because food particles or other foreign objects that happen to enter the respiratory system are more likely to enter and lodge in the right bronchus. The right bronchus is about 2.5 cm long and 1.3 cm in diameter. The angle of divergence of the right bronchus is only about <span class="math-inline">$25^{\circ}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>The left bronchus is smaller in diameter (1.1 cm) than the right bronchus but about twice as long (5 cm). The divergent angle of the left primary bronchus is approximately <span class="math-inline">$37^{\circ}$</span>, which is more horizontal than the right bronchus. This increased angle and the smaller diameter make food particles or other foreign matter less likely to enter the left bronchus.</p>
                        <p>The carina is a specific prominence, or ridge, of the lowest tracheal cartilage, which is seen at the bottom and inside portion of the trachea, where it divides into right and left bronchi.</p>
                        <p>As viewed from above through a bronchoscope, the carina is to the left of the midline, and the right bronchus appears more open than the left, which clearly shows why particles that come down the trachea is more likely to enter the right bronchus.</p>
                        <p>The position of the carina, is at the lower level of the division into the right and left primary bronchi. This is at the approximate level of T5 and is used as a specific reference point or level for CT of the thorax.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Secondary Bronchi, Lobes, and Alveoli</h3>
                        <p>In addition to differences in size and shape between the right and left bronchi, another important difference is that the right bronchus divides into three secondary bronchi, but the left divides into only two, with each entering individual lobes of the lungs.</p>
                        <p>The right lung contains three lobes, and the left lung contains two lobes.</p>
                        <p>These secondary bronchi continue to subdivide into smaller branches, called bronchioles that spread to all parts of each lobe. Each of these small terminal bronchioles terminates in very small air sacs called alveoli. The two lungs contain 500 million to 700 million alveoli. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the blood through the thin walls of alveoli.</p>

                        <p>The fourth and last division of the respiratory system comprises the two large, spongy lungs, which are located on each side of the thoracic cavity. The lungs fill all of the space not occupied by other structures.</p>
                        <p>The right lung is made up of three lobes‚Äîthe superior, middle, and inferior lobes‚Äîdivided by two deep fissures.</p>
                        <p>The inferior fissure, which separates the inferior and middle lobes, is called the oblique fissure. The horizontal fissure separates the superior and middle lobes.</p>

                        <p>This substance allows for the breathing mechanism responsible for expansion and contraction of the lungs, which brings oxygen into and removes carbon dioxide from the blood through the thin walls of the alveoli.</p>
                        <p>Each lung is contained in a delicate double walled sac, or membrane, called the pleura.</p>
                        <p>The outer layer of this pleural sac lines the inner surface of the chest walls and diaphragm and is called the parietal pleura.</p>
                        <p>The inner layer that covers the surface of the lungs, also dipping into the fissures between the lobes, is called the pulmonary or visceral.</p>
                        <p>The potential space between the doublewalled pleura, called the pleural cavity, contains a lubricating fluid that allows movement of one or the other during breathing.</p>
                        <p>When a lung collapses, or when air or fluid collects between these two layers, this space may be visualized radiographically.</p>
                        <p>Air or gas present in this pleural cavity results in a condition called a pneumothorax, wherein air or gas pressure in the pleural cavity may cause the lung to collapse.</p>
                        <p>Accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity (pleural effusion) creates a condition called a hemothorax.</p>
                        <p>Pulmonary edema is a condition caused by excess fluid in the lungs. This fluid collects in the numerous air sacs in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. In most cases, heart problems cause pulmonary edema</p>

                        <p>Radiographically important parts of the lungs include the following.</p>
                        <p>The apex (B) of each lung is the rounded upper area above the level of the clavicles. The apices of the lungs extend up into the lower neck area to the level of T1 (first thoracic vertebra).</p>
                        <p>This important part of the lungs must be included on chest radiographs.</p>

                        <p>The carina (C) is shown as the point of bifurcation, the lowest margin of the separation of the trachea into the right and left bronchi. The base (D) of each lung is the lower concave area of each lung that rests on the diaphragm (E). The diaphragm is a muscular partition that separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities.</p>
                        <p>The costophrenic angle (F) refers to the extreme outermost lower corner of each lung, where the diaphragm meets the ribs.</p>
                        <p>When positioning for chest radiographs, you should know the relative locations of the uppermost and lowermost parts of the lungs- the apices and the costophrenic angles, respectively-to ensure that these regions are included on every chest radiograph.</p>
                        <p>Pathology, such as a small amount of fluid collection, would be evident at these costophrenic angles in the erect position.</p>
                        <p>The hilum (hilus) (G), also known as the root region, is the central area of each lung, where the bronchi, blood vessels, lymph vessels, and nerves enter and leave the lungs.</p>

                        <p>The average respiratory rate is <span class="math-inline">$12-15$</span> breaths per minute.</p>
                        <p>Each breath consists of three phases: inspiration, expiration and pause.</p>
                        <p>The visceral pleura is adherent to the lungs and the parietal pleura to the inner wall of the thorax and to the diaphragm. Breathing depends upon changes in pressure and volume in the thoracic cavity. It follows the underlying physical principle that increasing the volume of a container decreases the pressure inside it, and that decreasing the volume of a container increases the pressure inside it.</p>
                        <p>Since air flows from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure, changing the pressure inside the lungs determines the direction of airflow.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Inspiration</h3>
                        <p>Simultaneous contraction of the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm expands the thorax. As the parietal pleura is firmly adhered to the diaphragm and the inside of the ribcage, it is pulled outward along with them.</p>
                        <p>This pulls the visceral pleura outwards too, since the two pleura are held together by the thin film of pleural fluid. Because the visceral pleura is firmly adherent to the lung, the lung tissue is, therefore, also pulled up and out with the ribs, and downwards with the diaphragm.</p>
                        <p>This expands the lungs, and the pressure within the alveoli and in the air passages falls, drawing air into the lungs in an attempt to equalize atmospheric and alveolar air pressures.</p>
                        <p>The process of inspiration is active, as it needs energy for muscle contraction. The negative pressure created in the thoracic cavity aids venous return to the heart and is known as the respiratory pump.</p>
                        <p>At rest, inspiration lasts about 2 seconds.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Expiration</h3>
                        <p>Relaxation of the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm results in downward and inward movement of the ribcage and elastic recoil of the lungs.</p>
                        <p>As this occurs, pressure inside the lungs rises and expels air from the respiratory tract. At the end of expiration, the lungs still contain some air, and are prevented from complete collapse by the intact pleura.</p>
                        <p>This process is passive as it does not require the expenditure of energy.</p>
                        <p>At rest, expiration lasts about 3 seconds, and after expiration there is a pause before the next cycle begins.</p>
