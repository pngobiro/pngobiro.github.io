                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The skull rests on the upper end of the vertebral column and its bony structure is divided into two parts: the cranium and the face.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sinuses</h3>
                        <p>Sinuses containing air are present in the sphenoid, ethmoid, maxillary and frontal bones. They all communicate with the nasal cavity and are lined with ciliated mucous membrane. They give resonance to the voice and reduce the weight of the skull, making it easier to carry.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cranial bones</h3>
                        <p>The cranium is formed by a number of flat and irregular bones that protect the brain. It has a base upon which the brain rests and a vault that surrounds and covers it. The periosteum lining the inner surface of the skull bones forms the outer layer of Dura mater. In the mature skull the joints (sutures) between the bones are immovable. The bones have numerous perforations (e.g. foramina, fissures) through which nerves, blood and lymph vessels pass.</p>
                        <p>The bones of the cranium are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">1 frontal bone</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Frontal bone</h4>
                        <p>This is the bone of the forehead. It forms part of the orbital cavities (eye sockets) and the prominent ridges above the eyes, the supraorbital margins.</p>
                        <p>Just above the supraorbital margins, within the bone, are two air-filled cavities or sinuses lined with ciliated mucous membrane, which open into the nasal cavity.</p>
                        <p>The coronal suture joins the frontal and parietal bones and other sutures are formed with the sphenoid, zygomatic, lacrimal, nasal and ethmoid bones.</p>
                        <p>The frontal bone originates in two parts joined in the midline by the frontal suture.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Parietal bones</h4>
                        <p>These bones form the sides and roof of the skull. They articulate with each other at the sagittal suture, with the frontal bone at the coronal suture, with the occipital bone at the lambdoidal suture and with the temporal bones at the squamous sutures. The inner surface is concave and is grooved to accommodate the brain and blood vessels.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Temporal bones</h4>
                        <p>These bones lie one on each side of the head and form sutures with the parietal, occipital, sphenoid and zygomatic bones. The squamous part is the thin fan-shaped area that articulates with the parietal bone. The zygomatic process articulates with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch (cheekbone). The mastoid part contains the mastoid process, a thickened region easily felt behind the ear. It contains a large number of very small air sinuses that communicate with the middle ear and are lined with squamous epithelium. The petrous portion forms part of the base of the skull and contains the organs of hearing (the spiral organ) and balance. The temporal bone articulates with the mandible at the temporomandibular joint, the only movable joint of the skull. Immediately behind this articulating surface is the external acoustic meatus (auditory canal), which passes inwards towards the petrous portion of the bone. The styloid process projects from the lower process of the temporal bone, and supports the hyoid bone and muscles associated with the tongue and pharynx.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Occipital bone</h4>
                        <p>This bone forms the back of the head and part of the base of the skull. It forms sutures with the parietal, temporal and sphenoid bones. Its inner surface is deeply concave and the concavity is occupied by the occipital lobes of the cerebrum and by the cerebellum. The occiput has two articular condyles that form condyloid joints with the first bone of the vertebral column, the atlas. This joint permits nodding movements of the head. Between the condyles is the foramen magnum (meaning 'large hole') through which the spinal cord passes into the cranial cavity.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sphenoid bone</h4>
                        <p>This bone occupies the middle portion of the base of the skull and it articulates with the occipital, temporal, parietal and frontal bones. It links the cranial and facial bones, and crossbraces the skull. On the superior surface in the middle of the bone is a little saddle-shaped depression, the hypophyseal fossa (sella turcica) in which the pituitary gland rests. The body of the bone contains some fairly large air sinuses lined with ciliated mucous membrane with openings into the nasal cavity. The optic nerves pass through the optic foramina on their way to the brain.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Ethmoid bone</h4>
                        <p>The Ethmoid bone occupies the anterior part of the base of the skull and helps to form the orbital cavity, the nasal septum and the lateral walls of the nasal cavity. On each side are two projections into the nasal cavity, the superior and middle conchae or turbinated processes. It is a very delicate bone containing many air sinuses lined with ciliated epithelium and with openings into the nasal cavity. The horizontal flattened part, the cribriform plate, forms the roof of the nasal cavity and has numerous small foramina through which nerve fibres of the olfactory nerve (sense of smell) pass upwards from the nasal cavity to the brain.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Infant Cranium</h3>
                        <p>The calvarium (skullcap) on an infant is very large in proportion to the rest of the body, but the facial bones are quite small.</p>
                        <p>Ossification of the individual cranial bones is incomplete at birth, and the sutures are membrane-covered spaces that fill in soon after birth. However, certain regions where sutures join are slower in their ossification, and these are called fontanels.</p>
                        <p>The cranial sutures themselves generally do not ossify completely until an individual is in his or her mid-to-late 20s , and some may not completely close until the fifth decade of life.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Fontanels</h4>
                        <p>Early in life, the bregma and the lambda are not bony but are membrane-covered openings or "soft spots." These soft spots are termed the anterior and posterior fontanels in an infant.</p>
                        <p>The anterior fontanel is the largest and at birth measures about 2.5 cm wide and 4 cm long.</p>
                        <p>It does not completely close until about 18 months of age.</p>
                        <p>Two smaller lateral fontanels that close soon after birth are the sphenoid (pterion in an adult) and mastoid (asterion in an adult) fontanels, which are located at the sphenoid and mastoid angles of the parietal bones on each side of the head.</p>
                        <p>Six fontanels occur in an infant as follows:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sutural, or Wormian, Bones</h4>
                        <p>Certain small, irregular bones called sutural, or wormian, bones sometimes develop in adult skull sutures. These isolated bones most often are found in the lambdoidal suture but occasionally also are found in the region of the fontanels, especially the posterior fontanel. In the adult skull, these are completely ossified and are visible only by the sutural lines around their borders</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Zygomatic (cheek) bones</h4>
                        <p>The zygomatic bone originates as two bones that fuse before birth. They form the prominences of the cheeks and part of the floor and lateral walls of the orbital cavities.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Maxilla (upper jaw bone)</h4>
                        <p>This originates as two bones that fuse before birth. The maxilla forms the upper jaw, the anterior part of the roof of the mouth, the lateral walls of the nasal cavity and part of the floor of the orbital cavities. The alveolar ridge, or process, projects downwards and carries the upper teeth. On each side is a large air sinus, the maxillary sinus, lined with ciliated mucous membrane and with openings into the nasal cavity.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nasal bones</h4>
                        <p>These are two small flat bones that form the greater part of the lateral and superior surfaces of the bridge of the nose.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Lacrimal bones</h4>
                        <p>These two small bones are posterior and lateral to the nasal bones and form part of the medial walls of the orbital cavities. Each is pierced by a foramen for the passage of the nasolacrimal duct that carries the tears from the medial canthus of the eye to the nasal cavity.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Vomer</h4>
                        <p>The vomer is a thin flat bone that extends upwards from the middle of the hard palate to form most of the inferior part of the nasal septum. Superiorly it articulates with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Palatine bones</h4>
                        <p>These are two small L-shaped bones. The horizontal parts unite to form the posterior part of the hard palate and the perpendicular parts project upwards to form part of the lateral walls of the nasal cavity. At their upper extremities they form part of the orbital cavities.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nasal conchae</h4>
                        <p>Each concha is a scroll-shaped bone, which forms part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and projects into it below the middle concha. The superior and middle conchae are parts of the ethmoid bone. The conchae collectively increase the surface area in the nasal cavity, allowing inspired air to be warmed and humidified more effectively.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mandible (lower jaw bone</h4>
                        <p>This is the lower jaw, the only movable bone of the skull. It originates as two parts that unite at the midline. Each half consists of two main parts: a curved body with the alveolar ridge containing the lower teeth and a ramus, which projects upwards almost at right angles to the posterior end of the body. At the upper end the ramus divides into the condylar process which articulates with the temporal bone to form the temporomandibular joint and the coronoid process, which gives attachment to muscles and ligaments that close the jaw. The point where the ramus joins the body is the angle of the jaw.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Hyoid bone</h3>
                        <p>This is an isolated horseshoe-shaped bone lying in the soft tissues of the neck just above the larynx and below the mandible. It does not articulate with any other bone, but is attached to the styloid process of the temporal bone by ligaments. It supports the larynx and gives attachment to the base of the tongue.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Fontanelles of the skull</h3>
                        <p>At birth, ossification of the cranial sutures is incomplete. The skull bones do not fuse earlier to allow for molding of the baby's head during childbirth. Where three or more bones meet there are distinct membranous areas, or fontanelles. The two largest are the anterior fontanelle, not fully ossified until the child is between 12 and 18 months old, and the posterior fontanelle, usually ossified 2-3 months after birth.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Functions of the skull</h3>
                        <p>The various parts of the skull have specific and different functions:</p>

                        <p>There are 26 bones in the vertebral column. Twenty-four separate vertebrae extend downwards from the occipital bone of the skull; then there is the sacrum, formed from five fused vertebrae, and lastly the coccyx, or tail, which is formed from between three and five small fused vertebrae.</p>
                        <p>The vertebral column is divided into different regions. The first seven vertebrae, in the neck, form the cervical spine; the next twelve vertebrae are the thoracic spine, and the next five the lumbar spine, the lowest vertebra of which articulates with the sacrum. Each vertebra is identified by the first letter of its region in the spine, followed by a number indicating its position.</p>
                        <p>For example, the topmost vertebra is C1, and the third lumbar vertebra is L3. The movable vertebrae have many characteristics in common, but some groups have distinguishing features.</p>

                        <p>Projecting from the regions where the pedicle meets the lamina is a lateral prominence, the transverse process, and where the two laminae meet at the back is a process called the spinous process.</p>
                        <p>These bony prominences can be felt through the skin along the length of the spine.</p>
                        <p>The vertebral arch has four articular surfaces: two articulate with the vertebra above and two with the one below. The vertebral foramina form the vertebral (neural) canal that contains the spinal cord.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Region-specific vertebral characteristics</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cervical vertebrae</h4>
                        <p>These are the smallest vertebrae. The transverse processes have a foramen through which a vertebral artery passes upwards to the brain.</p>
                        <p>The first two cervical vertebrae, the atlas and the axis, are atypical.</p>
                        <p>The first cervical vertebra (C1), the atlas, is the bone on which the skull rests. Below the atlas is the axis, the second cervical vertebra (C2).</p>
                        <p>The atlas is essentially a ring of bone, with no distinct body or spinous process, although it has two short transverse processes.</p>
                        <p>It possesses two flattened facets that articulate with the occipital bone; these are condyloid joints and they permit nodding of the head.</p>
                        <p>The axis sits below the atlas, and has a small body with a small superior projection called the odontoid process (also called the dens, meaning tooth). This occupies part of the posterior foramen of the atlas above, and is held securely within it by the transverse ligament. The head pivots (i.e. turns from side to side) on this joint. The 7th cervical vertebra, C7, is also known as the vertebra prominence.</p>
                        <p>It possesses a long spinous prominence terminating in a swollen tubercle, which is easily felt at the base of the neck.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Thoracic vertebrae</h4>
                        <p>The 12 thoracic vertebrae are larger than the cervical vertebrae because this section of the vertebral column has to support more body weight.</p>
                        <p>The bodies and transverse processes have facets for articulation with the ribs.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Lumbar vertebrae</h4>
                        <p>These are the largest of the vertebrae because they have to support the weight of the upper body.</p>
                        <!-- Duplicate sentence removed as per verbatim rule after review -->
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sacrum</h4>
                        <p>This consists of five rudimentary vertebrae fused to form a triangular or wedge shaped bone with a concave anterior surface.</p>
                        <p>The upper part, or base, articulates with the 5th lumbar vertebra. On each side it articulates with the ilium to form a sacroiliac joint, and at its inferior tip it articulates with the coccyx.</p>
                        <p>The anterior edge of the base, the promontory, protrudes into the pelvic cavity.</p>
                        <p>The vertebral foramina are present, and on each side of the bone there is a series of foramina for the passage of nerves.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Coccyx</h4>
                        <p>This consists of the four terminal vertebrae fused to form a very small triangular bone, the broad base of which articulates with the tip of the sacrum.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Curves of the vertebral column</h3>
                        <p>When viewed from the side, the vertebral column presents four curves: two primary and two secondary.</p>
                        <p>The fetus in the uterus lies curled up so that the head and the knees are more or less touching.</p>
                        <p>This position shows the primary curvature. The secondary cervical curve develops when the child can hold up their head (after about 3 months) and the secondary lumbar curve develops when able to stand (after 12-15 months). The thoracic and sacral primary curves are retained.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Movement of the vertebral column</h3>
                        <p>Movement between the individual bones of the vertebral column is very limited. However, the movements of the column as a whole are quite extensive and include flexion (bending forward), extension (bending backward), lateral flexion (bending to the side) and rotation. There is more movement in the cervical and lumbar regions than elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>The thorax (thoracic cage) is formed by the sternum anteriorly, twelve pairs of ribs forming the lateral bony cages, and the twelve thoracic vertebrae.</p>

                        <p>This flat bone can be felt just under the skin in the middle of the front of the chest. The manubrium is the uppermost section and articulates with the clavicles at the sternoclavicular joints and with the first two pairs of ribs. The body or middle portion gives attachment to the ribs.</p>
                        <p>The xiphoid process is the inferior tip of the bone. It gives attachment to the diaphragm, muscles of the anterior column.</p>
                        <p>Anteriorly, the first seven pairs of ribs articulate directly with the sternum and are known as the true ribs. The next three pairs articulate only indirectly.</p>
                        <p>In both cases, costal cartilages attach the ribs to the sternum. The lowest two pairs of ribs, referred to as floating ribs, do not join the sternum at all, their anterior tips being free.</p>
                        <p>Each rib forms up to three joints with the vertebral column. Two of these joints are formed between facets on the head of the rib and facets on the bodies of two vertebrae, the one above the rib and the one below. Ten of the ribs also form joints between the tubercle of the rib and the transverse process of (usually) the lower vertebra. The inferior surface of the rib is deeply grooved, providing a channel along which intercostal nerves and blood vessels run. Between each rib and the one below are the intercostal muscles, which move the rib cage during breathing. Because of the arrangement of the ribs, and the quantity of cartilage</p>
