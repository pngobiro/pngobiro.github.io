                        <p>Bone is a strong and durable type of connective tissue. Its major constituent (65%) is a mixture of calcium salts, mainly calcium phosphate.</p>
                        <p>This inorganic matrix gives bone great hardness, but on its own would be brittle and prone to shattering. The remaining third is organic material, called osteoid, which is composed mainly of collagen.</p>
                        <p>Collagen is very strong and gives bone slight flexibility.</p>
                        <p>The cellular component of bone contributes less than <span class="math-inline">$2\%$</span> of bone mass.</p>

                        <p>These bone-forming cells are responsible for the deposition of both inorganic salts and osteoid in bone tissue.</p>
                        <p>They are therefore present at sites where bone is growing, repairing or remodeling, e.g.:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">In the deeper layers of periosteum</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>As they deposit new bone tissue around themselves, they eventually become trapped in tiny pockets (lacunae, in the growing bone, and differentiate into osteocytes.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Osteocytes</h4>
                        <p>These are mature bone cells that monitor and maintain bone tissue, and are nourished by tissue fluid in the canaliculi that radiate from the central canals.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Osteoclasts</h4>
                        <p>These cells break down bone, releasing calcium and phosphate.</p>
                        <p>They are very large cells with up to 50 nuclei, which have formed from the fusion of many monocytes.</p>
                        <p>The continuous remodeling of healthy bone tissue is the result of balanced activity of the bone's osteoblast and osteoclast populations.</p>
                        <p>Osteoclasts are found in areas of the bone where there is active growth, repair or remodeling, e.g.:</p>

                        <p>Compact bone makes up about <span class="math-inline">$80\%$</span> of the body bone mass.</p>
                        <p>It is made up of a large number of parallel tube-shaped units called osteons (Haversian systems), each of which is made up of a central canal surrounded by a series of expanding rings, similar to the growth rings of a tree.</p>
                        <p>Osteons tend to be aligned the same way that force is applied to the bone, so for example in the femur (thigh bone), they run from one epiphysis to the other.</p>
                        <p>This gives the bone great strength. The central canal contains nerves, lymphatics and blood vessels, and each central canal is linked with neighboring canals by tunnels running at right angles between them, called perforating canals.</p>
                        <p>The series of cylindrical plates of bone arranged around each central canal are called lamellae. Between the adjacent lamellae of the osteon are strings of little cavities called lacunae, in each of which sits an osteocyte. Lacunae communicate with each other through a series of tiny channels called canaliculi, which allows the circulation of interstitial fluid through the bone, and direct contact between the osteocytes, which extend fine processes into them.</p>
                        <p>Between the osteons are interstitial lamellae, the remnants of older systems partially broken down during remodeling or growth of bone.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Spongy (cancellous, trabecular) bone.</h3>
                        <p>To the naked eye, spongy bone looks like a honeycomb. Microscopic examination reveals a framework formed from trabecular (meaning 'little beams'), which consist of a few lamellae and osteocytes interconnected by canaliculi.</p>
                        <p>Osteocytes are nourished by interstitial fluid diffusing into the bone through the tiny canaliculi. The spaces between the trabecular contain red bone marrow.</p>
                        <p>In addition, spongy bone is lighter than compact bone, reducing the weight of the skeleton.</p>

                        <p>Long, short and irregular bones develop in the fetus from rods of cartilage, cartilage models. Flat bones develop from membrane models and sesamoid bones from tendon models.</p>
                        <p>During ossification, osteoblasts secrete osteoid, which gradually replaces the initial model; then this osteoid is progressively calcified, also by osteoblast action. As the bone grows, the osteoblasts become trapped in the matrix of their own making and become osteocytes.</p>
                        <p>In mature bone, a fine balance of osteoblast and osteoclast activity maintains normal bone.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Development of long bones</h3>
                        <p>In long bones the focal points from which ossification begins are small areas of osteogenic cells, or centres of ossification in the cartilage model.</p>
                        <p>This is accompanied by development of a bone collar at about 8 weeks of gestation.</p>
                        <p>Later the blood supply develops and bone tissue replaces cartilage as osteoblasts secrete osteoid in the shaft.</p>
                        <p>The bone lengthens as ossification continues and spreads to the epiphyses.</p>
                        <p>Around birth, secondary centres of ossification develop in the epiphyses, and the medullary canal forms when osteoclasts break down the central bone tissue in the middle of the shaft.</p>
                        <p>During childhood, long bones continue to lengthen because the epiphyseal plate at each end of the bone, which is made of cartilage, continues to produce new cartilage on its diaphyseal surface (the surface facing the shaft of the bone. This cartilage is then turned to bone. As long as cartilage production matches the rate of ossification, the bone continues to lengthen.</p>
                        <p>At puberty, under the influence of sex hormones, the epiphyseal plate growth slows down, and is overtaken by bone deposition.</p>
                        <p>Once the whole epiphyseal plate is turned to bone, no further lengthening of the bone is possible.</p>

                        <p>Hormones that regulate the growth, size and shape of bones include the following.</p>
                        <p>Growth hormone and the thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine, are especially important during infancy and childhood; deficient or excessive secretion of these results in abnormal development of the skeleton.</p>
                        <p>Testosterone and oestrogen influence the physical changes that occur at puberty and help maintain bone structure throughout life. Rising levels of these hormones are responsible for the growth spurt of puberty, but later stimulate closure of the epiphyseal plates so that bone growth lengthways stops (although bones can grow in thickness throughout life). Average adult male height is usually greater than female, because male puberty tends to occur at a later age than female puberty, giving a male child's bones longer to keep growing. Oestrogen are responsible for the wider female pelvis that develops during puberty, and for maintaining bone mass in the adult female. Falling oestrogen levels after menopause can put postmenopausal women at higher risk of bone fracture.</p>
                        <p>Calcitonin and parathyroid hormone control blood levels of calcium by regulating its uptake into and release from bone. Calcitonin increases calcium uptake into bone (reducing blood calcium), and parathormone decreases it (increasing blood calcium)</p>

                        <p>Although bone growth lengthways permanently ceases once the epiphyseal plates have ossified, thickening of bone is possible throughout life. This involves the laying down of new osteons at the periphery of the bone through the action of osteoblasts in the inner layer of the periosteum.</p>
                        <p>Weight-bearing exercise stimulates thickening of bone, strengthening it and making it less liable to fracture.</p>

                        <p>Following a fracture, the broken ends of bone are joined by the deposition of new bone.</p>

                        <p>Factors that delay healing of fractures:</p> <!-- Rephrased slightly for clarity as a heading, original text remains -->
                        <p>Tissue fragments between bone ends. Splinters of dead bone (sequestrae) and soft tissue fragments not removed by phagocytosis delay healing.</p>
                        <p>Deficient blood supply. This delays growth of granulation tissue and new blood vessels. Hypoxia also reduces the number of osteoblasts and increases the number of chondrocytes that develop from their common parent cells.</p>
                        <p>Poor alignment of bone ends. This may result in the formation of a large and irregular callus that heals slowly and often results in permanent disability.</p>
                        <p>Continued mobility of bone ends. Continuous movement results in fibrosis of the granulation tissue followed by fibrous union of the fracture. Infection), systemic illness, malnutrition, drugs, e.g. corticosteroids and ageing</p>
