If the radiograph is produced with the use of traditional filmscreen technology, the image is stored and displayed on film; if the radiograph is produced via digital technology, the image is viewed and stored with the use of computers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Radiography:</strong> The process and procedures of producing a radiograph.</p>
                        <p><strong>Radiograph versus <span class="math-inline">$x$</span>-ray film:</strong> In practice, the terms radiograph and <span class="math-inline">$x$</span>-ray film (or just film) are often used interchangeably. However, <span class="math-inline">$x$</span>-ray film specifically refers to the physical piece of material on which a latent (nonprocessed) radiographic image is stored. The term radiograph includes the recording medium and the image.</p>
                        <p><strong>Image receptor (IR):</strong> The device that captures the radiographic image that exits the patient; refers to both film-screen cassettes and digital acquisition devices.</p>

                        <p>Positioning terms that describe CR angles or relationships between body parts often are related to imaginary planes that pass through the body in the anatomic position. The study of CT, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and sonography (diagnostic medical ultrasound) emphasizes sectional anatomy, which also involves the primary body planes and sections as described subsequently.</p>
                        <p><strong>Plane:</strong> straight line surface Connecting Two Points</p>
                        <p>Four common planes as used in medical imaging are as follows:</p>

                        <p>A sagittal plane is any longitudinal plane that divides the body into right and left parts. It passes approximately through the sagittal suture of the skull. Any plane parallel to the midsagittal or median plane is called a sagittal plane.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Coronal plane</h3>
                        <p>A coronal plane is any longitudinal plane that divides the body into anterior and posterior parts. It is called a coronal plane because it passes approximately through the coronal suture of the skull.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Horizontal (axial) plane</h3>
                        <p>A horizontal (axial) plane is any transverse plane that passes through the body at right angles to a longitudinal plane, dividing the body into superior and inferior portions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Oblique plane</h3>
                        <p>An oblique plane is a longitudinal or transverse plane that is at an angle or slant and is not parallel to the sagittal, coronal, or horizontal plane.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Anteroposterior (AP) projection</h4>
                        <p>Anteroposterior (AP) projection refers to a projection of CR from anterior to posterior, the opposite of PA.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">AP oblique projection</h4>
                        <p>An AP projection of the upper or lower limb that is rotated is called "oblique." This is not a true AP projection and must also include a qualifying term that indicates which way it is rotated, such as medial or lateral rotation with an AP oblique projection, the CR enters the anterior surface and exits the posterior surface of the body or body part.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PA oblique projection</h4>
                        <p>A PA projection of the upper limb with lateral rotation (from PA). This projection is described as a PA oblique. It must also include a qualifying term that indicates which way it is rotated. With a PA oblique projection, the CR enters the posterior surface and exits the anterior surface of the body or body part.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mediolateral and lateromedial projections</h4>
                        <p>A lateral projection is described by the path of the CR. The medial and lateral sides are determined with the patient in the anatomic position.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Specific Body Positions</h3>
                        <p>In addition to a general body position, the second way the term position is used in radiography is to refer to a specific body position described by the body part closest to the IR (oblique and lateral) or by the surface on which the patient is lying (decubitus).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Lateral position</h4>
                        <p>Lateral position refers to the side of, or a side view. Specific lateral positions described by the part closest to the IR or the body part from which the CR exits. A right lateral position is shown with the right side of the body closest to the IR in the erect position. A true lateral position is always <span class="math-inline">$90^{\circ}$</span>, or perpendicular, or at a right angle, to a true AP or PA projection. If it is not a true lateral, it is an oblique position.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Oblique position</h4>
                        <p>Oblique position refers to an angled position in which neither the sagittal nor the coronal body plane is perpendicular or at a right angle to the IR. Oblique body positions of the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis are described by the part closest to the IR or the body part from which the CR exits. These also can be referred to as AP oblique projections because the CR enters an anterior surface and exits posteriorly. However, this is not a complete description and requires a specific position clarifier such as LPO or RPO position. Therefore, these body obliques are referred to as positions and not projections. Oblique of upper and lower limbs are described correctly as AP and PA oblique, but require the use of either medial or lateral rotation as a qualifier.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Right and left anterior oblique (RAO and LAO) positions</h4>
                        <p>Refer to oblique positions in which the right or left anterior aspect of the body is closest to the IR and can be erect or recumbent general body positions.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Decubitus (decub) position</h4>
                        <p>The word decubitus literally means to "lie down," or the position assumed in "lying down." This body position, meaning to lie on a horizontal surface, is designated according to the surface on which the body is resting. This term describes a patient who is lying on one of the following body surfaces: back (dorsal), front (ventral), or side (right or left lateral). In radiographic positioning, decubitus is always performed with the central ray horizontal. Decubitus positions are essential for detecting air-fluid levels or free air in a body cavity such as the chest or abdomen, where the air rises to the uppermost part of the body cavity.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Right or left lateral decubitus position‚ÄîAP or PA projection</h4>
                        <p>In this position, the patient lies on the side, and the x-ray beam is directed horizontally from anterior to posterior. The AP or PA projection is important as a qualifying term with decubitus positions to denote the direction of the CR. This position is either a left lateral decubitus or a right lateral decubitus. It is named according to the dependent side (side down) and the AP or PA projection indication.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Dorsal decubitus position‚Äîleft or right lateral</h4>
                        <p>In this position, the patient is lying on the dorsal (posterior) surface with the x ray beam directed horizontally, exiting from the side closest to the IR. The position is named according to the surface on which the patient is lying (dorsal or ventral) and by the side closest to the IR (right or left).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Ventral decubitus position‚Äîright or left lateral</h4>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Following are some additional terms that are commonly used to describe projections. These terms, as shown by their definitions, also refer to the path or projection of the CR and are projections rather than positions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">AP axial projection‚Äîlordotic position</h3>
                        <p>This is a specific AP chest projection for demonstrating the apices of the lungs. It also is sometimes called the apical lordotic projection. In this case, the long axis of the body rather than the CR is angled. The term lordotic comes from lordosis, a term that denotes curvature of the cervical and lumbar spine. As the patient assumes this position the lumbar lordotic curvature is exaggerated, making this a descriptive term for this special chest.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Transthoracic lateral projection (right lateral position)</h3>
                        <p>A lateral projection through the thorax. Requires a qualifying positioning term (right or left lateral position) to indicate which shoulder is closest to the IR and is being examined.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Dorsoplantar and plantodorsal projections</h3>
                        <p>These are secondary terms for AP or PA projections of the foot. Dorsoplantar (DP) describes the path of the CR from the dorsal (anterior) surface to the plantar (posterior) surface of the foot. A special plantodorsal projection of the heel bone (calcaneus) is called an axial plantodorsal projection (PD) because the angled CR enters the plantar surface of the foot and exits the dorsal surface.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Parietoacanthial and acanthioparietal projections</h3>
                        <p>The CR enters at the cranial parietal bone and exits at the acanthion (junction of nose and upper lip) for the Parietoacanthial projection. The opposite CR direction would describe the acanthioparietal projection. These are also known as PA Waters and AP reverse Waters methods and are used to visualize the facial bones.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Medial versus lateral</h3>
                        <p>Medial versus lateral refers to toward versus away from the center, or median plane. In the anatomic position, the medial aspect of any body part is the "inside" part closest to the median plane, and the lateral part is away from the center, or away from the median plane or midline of the body.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Acute flexion of wrist</h4>
                        <p>An acute or full flexion of the wrist is required for a special tangential projection for a carpal bridge view of the posterior aspect of the wrist.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Ulnar deviation versus radial deviation of wrist</h4>
                        <p>Deviation: literally means "to turn aside" or "to turn away from the standard or course." Ulnar deviation is to turn or bend the hand and wrist from the natural position toward the ulnar side, and radial deviation is toward the radial side of the wrist.</p>

                        <p><strong>Dorsiflexion of foot:</strong> To decrease the angle (flex) between the dorsum (top of foot) and the lower leg, moving foot and toes upward.</p>
                        <p><strong>Plantar flexion of foot:</strong> extending the ankle joint, moving foot and toes downward from the normal position; flexing or decreasing the angle toward the plantar (posterior) surface of the foot.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Eversion versus inversion</h3>
                        <p><strong>Eversion</strong> is an outward stress movement of the foot at the ankle joint.<br>
                        <strong>Inversion</strong> is inward stress movement of the foot as applied to the foot without rotation of the leg.
                        The plantar surface (sole) of the foot is turned or rotated away from the median plane of the body (the sole faces in a more lateral direction) for eversion and toward the median plane for inversion. The leg does not rotate, and stress is applied to the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle joint for evaluation of possible widening of the joint space (ankle mortise).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Valgus versus Varus</h3>
                        <p><strong>Varus Valgus</strong> describes the bending of the part outward or away from the midline of the body. Valgus sometimes is used to describe eversion stress of the ankle joint.<br>
                        <strong>Varus</strong> meaning "knock-kneed," describes the bending of a part inward or toward the midline. The term varus stress sometimes is used to describe inversion stress applied at the ankle joint.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Medial (internal) rotation versus lateral (external) rotation</h3>
                        <p><strong>Medial rotation</strong> is a rotation or turning of a body part with movement of the anterior aspect of the part toward the inside, or median, plane.<br>
                        <strong>Lateral rotation</strong> is a rotation of an anterior body part toward the outside, or away from the median plane.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Abduction versus adduction</h3>
                        <p><strong>Abduction</strong> is the lateral movement of the arm or leg away from the body.<br>
                        <strong>Adduction</strong> is a movement of arm or leg toward the body, to draw toward a center or medial line.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Supination versus pronation</h3>
                        <p><strong>Supination</strong> is a rotational movement of the hand into the anatomic position (palm up in supine position or forward in erect position). This movement rotates the radius of the forearm laterally along its long axis.<br>
                        <strong>Pronation</strong> is a rotation of the hand into the opposite of the anatomic position (palm down or back).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Protraction versus retraction</h3>
                        <p><strong>Protraction</strong> is a movement forward from a normal position. Retraction is a movement backward or the condition of being drawn back. Protraction is moving the jaw forward (sticking the chin out) or drawing the shoulders forward. Retraction is the opposite of this-that is, moving the jaw backward or squaring the shoulders, as in a military stance.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Elevation versus depression</h3>
                        <p><strong>Elevation</strong> is a lifting, raising, or moving of a part superiorly.<br>
                        <strong>Depression</strong> is a letting down, lowering, or moving of a part inferiorly.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Circumduction</h3>
                        <p>Circumduction means to move around in the form of a circle. This term describes sequential movements of flexion, abduction, extension, and adduction, resulting in a cone-type movement at any joint where the four movements are possible (e.g., fingers, wrist, arm, leg).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Rotation versus Tilt</h3>
                        <p><strong>Rotate</strong> is to turn or rotate a body part on its axis, the midsagittal plane of the entire body, including the head, is rotated.<br>
                        <strong>Tilt</strong> is a slanting or tilting movement with respect to the long axis.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The three terms position, projection, and view are sometimes confusing and may be used incorrectly in practice. These terms should be understood and used correctly.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Position</h3>
                        <p>Position is a term that is used to indicate the patient's general physical position, such as supine, prone, recumbent, or erect. Position also is used to describe specific body positions by the body part closest to the IR,</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Projection</h3>
                        <p>Projection is a correct positioning term that describes or refers to the path or direction of the central ray (CR), projecting an image onto an image receptor (IR). The term projection should be "restricted to discussion of the path of the central ray."</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">View</h3>
                        <p>View is not a correct positioning term. View describes the body part as seen by the IR or other recording medium, such as a fluoroscopic screen.</p>
