                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="fibrous-joints">1. Fibrous Joints</h3>
                        <p>Fibrous joints lack a joint cavity. The adjoining bones, which are nearly in direct contact with each other, are held together by fibrous connective tissue.</p>
                        <p>Three types of fibrous joints are syndesmoses, which are slightly movable; sutures, which are immovable; and gomphosis, a unique type of joint with only very limited movement</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">a. Syndesmoses</h4>
                        <p>Syndesmoses are fibrous types of articulations that are held together by interosseous ligaments and slender fibrous cords that allow slight movement at these joints. Some earlier references restricted the fibrous Syndesmosis classification to the inferior tibiofibular joint. However, fibroustype connections also may occur in other joints such as the sacroiliac junction with its massive interosseous ligaments that in later life become almost totally fibrous articulations.</p>
                        <p>The carpal and tarsal joints of the wrist and foot also include interosseous membranes that can be classified as Syndesmosis-type joints that are only slightly movable, or amphiarthrodial.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">b. Sutures</h4>
                        <p>Sutures are found only between bones in the skull. These bones make contact with one another along interlocking or serrated edges and are held together by layers of fibrous tissue, or sutural ligaments. Movement is very limited at these articulations; in adults, these are considered immovable, or synarthrodial, joints. Limited expansion- or compression-type movement at these sutures can occur in the infant skull (e.g., during the birthing process). However, by adulthood, active bone deposition partially or completely obliterates these suture lines</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">c. Gomphosis</h4>
                        <p>A gomphosis joint is the third unique type of fibrous joint, in which a conical process is inserted into a socket-like portion of bone. This joint or fibrous union-which, strictly speaking, does not occur between bones but between the roots of the teeth and the alveolar sockets of the mandible and the maxillae-is a specialized type of articulation that allows only very limited movement</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="cartilaginous-joints">2. Cartilaginous Joints</h3>
                        <p>Cartilaginous joints also lack a joint cavity, and the articulating bones are held together tightly by cartilage. Similar to fibrous joints, cartilaginous joints allow little or no movement. These joints are synarthrodial or amphiarthrodial and are held together by two types of cartilage-symphyses and synchondroses.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">a. Symphyses</h4>
                        <p>The essential feature of a symphysis is the presence of a broad, flattened disk of fibrocartilage between two contiguous bony surfaces. These fibrocartilage disks form relatively thick pads that are capable of being compressed or displaced, allowing some movement of these bones, which makes these joints amphiarthrodial (slightly movable). Examples of such symphyses are the intervertebral disks (between bodies of the vertebrae), which are found between the manubrium (upper portion) and body of the sternum, and the symphysis pubis (between the two pubic bones of the pelvis).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-33-2.jpg" alt="Illustrations of Cartilaginous Joints: Symphysis and Synchondrosis." class="content-image">

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">b. Synchondroses</h4>
                        <p>A typical synchondrosis is a temporary form of joint wherein the connecting hyaline cartilage (which on long bones is called an epiphyseal plate) is converted into bone at adulthood. These temporary types of growth joints are considered synarthrodial or immovable. Examples of such joints are the epiphyseal plates between the epiphyses and the metaphysis of long bones and at the threepart union of the pelvis, which forms a cupshaped acetabulum for the hip joint.</p>
                        <figure>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="synovial-joints">3. Synovial Joints</h3>
                        <p>Synovial joints are freely movable joints, most often found in the upper and lower limbs, which are characterized by a fibrous capsule that contains synovial fluid. The ends of the bones that make up a synovial joint may make contact but are completely separate and contain a joint space or cavity, which allows for a wide range of movement at these joints. Synovial joints are generally diarthrodial, or freely movable. (Exceptions include the sacroiliac joints of the pelvis, which are amphiarthrodial, or slightly movable.) The exposed ends of these bones contain thin protective coverings of articular cartilage. The joint cavity, which contains a viscous lubricating synovial fluid, is enclosed and surrounded by a fibrous capsule that is reinforced by strengthening accessory ligaments. These ligaments limit motion in undesirable directions. The inner surface of this fibrous capsule is thought to secrete the lubricating synovial fluid.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Movement Types of Synovial Joints</h4>
                        <p>There are a considerable number and variety of synovial joints, and they are grouped according to the seven types of movement that they permit. These are listed in order from the least to the greatest permitted movement.</p>
                        <p>The preferred name is listed first, followed by an older term or synonym in parentheses.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">a. Plane (gliding) joints</h5>
                        <p>This type of synovial joint permits the least movement, which, as the name implies, is a sliding or gliding motion between the articulating surfaces. Examples of plane joints are the intermetacarpal, carpometacarpal, and intercarpal joints of the hand and wrist. The right and left lateral atlantoaxial joints between C1 and C2 vertebrae are also classified as plane, or gliding, joints; they permit some rotational movement between these vertebrae.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-34-2.jpg" alt="Illustration of Plane (gliding) joints, showing examples in the hand and wrist." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">b. Ginglymus (hinge) joints</h5>
                        <p>The articular surfaces of ginglymi, or ginglymus joints, are molded to each other in such a way that they permit flexion and extension movements only. The articular fibrous capsule on this type of joint is thin on surfaces where bending takes place, but strong collateral ligaments firmly secure the bones at the lateral margins of the fibrous capsule. Examples of ginglymi include the interphalangeal joints of fingers and toes and the elbow joint.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-35-1.jpg" alt="Illustration of Ginglymus (hinge) joints, showing examples like the elbow and interphalangeal joints." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">c. Trochoid (pivot) joints</h5>
                        <p>The trochoid joint is formed by a bony, pivotlike process that is surrounded by a ring of ligaments or a bony structure or both. This type of joint allows rotational movement around a single axis. Examples of trochoid joints are the proximal and distal radioulnar joints of the forearm, which demonstrate this pivot movement during rotation of the hand and wrist. Another example is the joint between the first and second cervical vertebrae. The dens of the axis (C2) forms the pivot, and the anterior arch of the atlas (C1), combined with posterior ligaments, and forms the ring.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-35-2.jpg" alt="Illustration of Trochoid (pivot) joints, showing examples like the radioulnar joint and C1-C2 vertebrae joint." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">d. Ellipsoid (condylar) joints</h5>
                        <p>In the ellipsoid joint, movement occurs primarily in one plane and is combined with a slight degree of rotation at an axis at right angles to the primary plane of movement. The rotational movement is limited by associated ligaments and tendons. This type of joint allows primarily four directional movements: flexion and extension and abduction and adduction. Circumduction movement also occurs; this results from cone like sequential movements of flexion, abduction, extension, and adduction. Examples of ellipsoid joints include the metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers, the wrist joint, and the metatarsophalangeal joints of the toes.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-35-3.jpg" alt="Illustration of Ellipsoid (condylar) joints, showing examples like metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints." class="content-image">

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">e. Sellar (saddle) joints</h5>
                        <p>The term sellar or saddle, describes this joint structure well in that the ends of the bones are shaped concave-convex and are positioned opposite each other. Two saddle-like structures fit into each other. Movements of this biaxial type of sellar joint are the same as for ellipsoidal joints-flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, and circumduction. The best example of a true sellar joint is the first carpometacarpal joint of the thumb. Other sellar joints include the ankle and the calcaneocuboid joints. Although the ankle joint was classified as a ginglymus in earlier references, current references classify it as a sellar joint.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">f. Bicondylar joints</h5>
                        <p>Bicondylar joints usually provide movement in a single direction. They can permit limited rotation. Bicondylar joints are formed by two convex condyles, which may be encased by a fibrous capsule. Two examples of bicondylar joints are the knee (formerly classified as ginglymus) and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). It must be regarded as consisting of three articulations in one: two condyloid joints, one between each condyle of the femur and the corresponding meniscus and condyle of the tibia; and a third between the patella and the femur, partly arthrodial, but not completely so, since the articular surfaces are not mutually adapted to each other, so that the movement is not a simple gliding one.

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">g. Spheroidal (ball and socket) joints</h5>
                        <p>The spheroidal, or ball and socket, joint allows the greatest freedom of motion. The distal bone that makes up the joint is capable of motion around an almost indefinite number of axes, with one common center. The greater the depth of the socket, the more limited is the movement. However, the deeper joint is stronger and more stable. For example, the hip joint is a much stronger and more stable joint than the shoulder joint, but the range of movement is more limited in the hip. Movements of spheroidal joints include flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, and medial and lateral rotation. Two examples of ball and socket joints are the hip joint and the shoulder joint.</p>
