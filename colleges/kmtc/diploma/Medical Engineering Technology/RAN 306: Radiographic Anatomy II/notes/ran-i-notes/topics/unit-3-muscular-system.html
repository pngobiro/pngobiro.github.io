                        <p>In the body, there are three types of muscle: skeletal (striated), smooth, and cardiac.</p>

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Skeletal Muscle</strong><br>
                                Skeletal muscle, attached to bones, is responsible for skeletal movements. The peripheral portion of the central nervous system (CNS) controls the skeletal muscles. Thus, these muscles are under conscious, or voluntary, control. The basic unit is the muscle fiber with many nuclei. These muscle fibers are striated (having transverse streaks) and each acts independently of neighboring muscle fibers.</span>
                            </li>

                                <span class="item-text"><strong>Smooth Muscle</strong><br>
                                Smooth muscle, found in the walls of the hollow internal organs such as blood vessels, the gastrointestinal tract, bladder, and uterus, is under control of the autonomic nervous system. Smooth muscle cannot be controlled consciously and thus acts involuntarily. The non-striated (smooth) muscle cell is spindleshaped and has one central nucleus. Smooth muscle contracts slowly and rhythmically.</span>

                                Cardiac muscle, found in the walls of the heart, is also under control of the autonomic nervous system. The cardiac muscle cell has one central nucleus, like smooth muscle, but it also is striated, like skeletal muscle. The cardiac muscle cell is rectangular in shape. The contraction of cardiac muscle is involuntary, strong, and rhythmical.</span>

                        <p>Many muscles are involved in changing facial expression and with movement of the lower jaw during chewing and speaking. Only the main muscles are described here.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Occipitofrontalis (unpaired)</h4>
                        <p>This consists of a posterior muscular part over the occipital bone (occipitalis), an anterior part over the frontal bone (frontalis) and an extensive flat tendon or aponeurosis that stretches over the dome of the skull and joins the two muscular parts. It raises the eyebrows.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Levator palpebrae superioris</h4>
                        <p>This muscle extends from the posterior part of the orbital cavity to the upper eyelid. It raises the eyelid.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Orbicularis oculi</h4>
                        <p>This muscle surrounds the eye, eyelid and orbital cavity. It closes the eye and when strongly contracted 'screws up' the eyes.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Buccinator</h4>
                        <p>This flat muscle of the cheek draws the cheeks in towards the teeth in chewing and in forcible expulsion of air from the mouth ('the trumpeter's muscle').</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Orbicularis oris (unpaired)</h4>
                        <p>This muscle surrounds the mouth and blends with the muscles of the cheeks. It closes the lips and, when strongly contracted, shapes the mouth for whistling.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Masseter</h4>
                        <p>This broad muscle extends from the zygomatic arch to the angle of the jaw. In chewing it draws the mandible up to the maxilla, closing the jaw, exerting considerable pressure on the food.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Temporalis</h4>
                        <p>This muscle covers the squamous part of the temporal bone. It passes behind the zygomatic arch to be inserted into the coronoid process of the mandible. It closes the mouth and assists with chewing.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pterygoid</h4>
                        <p>This muscle extends from the sphenoid bone to the mandible. It closes the mouth and pulls the lower jaw forward.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="muscles-of-the-neck">Muscles of the neck</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sternocleidomastoid</h4>
                        <p>This muscle arises from the manubrium of the sternum and the clavicle and extends upwards to the mastoid process of the temporal bone. It assists in turning the head from side to side and is also an accessory muscle in respiration. When the muscle on one side contracts it draws the head towards the shoulder. When both contract at the same time they flex the cervical vertebrae or draw the sternum and clavicles upwards when the head is maintained in a fixed position, e.g. in forced respiration.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Trapezius.</h4>
                        <p>This muscle covers the shoulder and the back of the neck. The upper attachment is to the occipital protuberance, the medial attachment is to the transverse processes of the cervical and thoracic vertebrae and the lateral attachment is to the clavicle and to the spinous and acromion processes of the scapula. It pulls the head backwards, squares the shoulders and controls the movements of the scapula when the shoulder joint is in use.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="muscles-of-the-back">Muscles of the back</h3>
                        <p>There are six pairs of large muscles in the back, in addition to those forming the posterior abdominal wall. The arrangement of these muscles is the same on each side of the vertebral column.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Latissimus dorsi</h4>
                        <p>This arises from the posterior part of the iliac crest and the spinous processes of the lumbar and lower thoracic vertebrae. It passes upwards across the back then under the arm to be inserted into the bicipital groove of the humerus. It adducts, medially rotates and extends the arm.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="muscles-of-the-trunk">Muscles of the trunk</h3>
                        <p>These muscles stabilize the association between the appendicular and axial skeletons at the pectoral girdle, and stabilize and allow movement of the shoulders and upper arms.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Teres major.</h4>
                        <p>This originates from the inferior angle of the scapula and is inserted into the humerus just below the shoulder joint. It extends, adducts and medially rotates the arm.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Quadratus lumborum.</h4>
                        <p>This muscle originates from the iliac crest, then it passes upwards, parallel and close to the vertebral column and it is inserted into the 12th rib.</p>
                        <p>Together the two muscles fix the lower rib during respiration and cause extension of the vertebral column (bending backwards). If one muscle contracts it causes lateral flexion of the lumbar region of the vertebral column.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sacrospinalis (erector spinae).</h4>
                        <p>This is a group of muscles lying between the spinous and transverse processes of the vertebrae. They originate from the sacrum and are finally inserted into the occipital bone. Their contraction causes extension of the vertebral column.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="muscles-of-anterior-abdominal-wall">Muscles of the Anterior Abdominal Wall</h4>
                        <figure>
                           <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-26-2.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>The main function of these paired muscles is to form the strong muscular anterior wall of the abdominal cavity.</p>
                        <p>When the muscles contract together they:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">compress the abdominal organs</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Contraction of the muscles on one side only bends the trunk towards that side. Contraction of the oblique muscles on one side rotates the trunk. The anterior abdominal wall is divided longitudinally by a very strong midline tendinous cord, the linea Alba (meaning 'white cord') which extends from the xiphoid process of the sternum to the symphysis pubis.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Rectus abdominis</h5> <!-- Using H5 as these are specific muscles within the "Anterior Abdominal Wall" H4 group -->
                        <p>This is the most superficial muscle. It is broad and flat, originating from the transverse part of the pubic bone then passing upwards to be inserted into the lower ribs and the xiphoid process of the sternum. Medially the two muscles are attached to the linea Alba.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">External oblique</h5>
                        <p>This muscle extends from the lower ribs downwards and forward to be inserted into the iliac crest and, by an aponeurosis, to the linea Alba.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Internal oblique</h5>
                        <p>This muscle lies deep to the external oblique. Its fibres arise from the iliac crest and by a broad band of fascia from the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The fibres pass upwards towards the midline to be inserted into the lower ribs and, by an aponeurosis, into the linea Alba. The fibres are at right angles to those of the external oblique.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Transverse abdominis.</h5>
                        <p>This is the deepest muscle of the abdominal wall. The fibres arise from the iliac crest and the lumbar vertebrae and pass across the abdominal wall to be inserted into the linea Alba by an aponeurosis. The fibres are at right angles to those of the rectus abdominis.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="muscles-of-the-thorax">Muscles of the thorax</h3>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>There are 11 pairs of intercostal muscles occupying the spaces between the 12 pairs of ribs. They are arranged in two layers, the external and internal intercostal muscles.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The external intercostal muscles</h4>
                        <p>These extend downwards and forwards from the lower border of the rib above to the upper border of the rib below. They are involved in inspiration.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The internal intercostal muscles</h4>
                        <p>These extend downwards and backwards from the lower border of the rib above to the upper border of the rib below, crossing the external intercostal muscle fibres at right angles. The internal intercostals are used when expiration becomes active, as in exercise. The first rib is fixed. Therefore, when the external intercostal muscles contract they pull all the other ribs towards the first rib.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diaphragm</h4>
                        <p>The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscular structure separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities. It forms the floor of the thoracic cavity and the roof of the abdominal cavity and consists of a central tendon from which muscle fibres radiate to be attached to the lower ribs and sternum and to the vertebral column by two crura. Quiet, restful breathing is sometimes called diaphragmatic breathing because 75% of the work is done by the diaphragm.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The pelvic floor is divided into two identical halves that unite along the midline. Each half consists of fascia and muscle. The muscles are the levator ani and the coccygeus.</p>
                        <p>The pelvic floor supports the organs of the pelvis and maintains continence, i.e. it resists raised intrapelvic pressure during micturition and defaecation.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Levator ani</h4>
                        <p>This is a pair of broad flat muscles, forming the anterior part of the pelvic floor. They originate from the inner surface of the true pelvis and unite in the midline. Together they form a sling that supports the pelvic organs.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Coccygeus</h4>
                        <p>This is a paired triangular sheet of muscle and tendinous fibres situated behind the levator ani. They originate from the medial surface of the ischium and are inserted into the sacrum and coccyx. They complete the formation of the pelvic floor, which is perforated in the male by the urethra and anus, and in the female by the urethra, vagina and anus.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="muscles-of-the-shoulder-and-upper-limb">Muscles of the shoulder and upper limb</h3>
                        <p>These muscles stabilise the association between the appendicular and axial skeletons at the pectoral girdle, and stabilise and allow movement of the shoulders and upper arms.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-28-2.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating muscles of the shoulder and upper limb." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Muscles of the shoulder and upper limb.</figcaption> <!-- Caption added for clarity -->
                        </figure>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Deltoid</h4>
                        <p>These muscle fibres originate from the clavicle, acromion process and spine of scapula and radiate over the shoulder joint to be inserted into the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus. It forms the fleshy and rounded contour of the shoulder and its main function is movement of the arm. The anterior part causes flexion, the middle or main part abduction and the posterior part extends and laterally rotates the shoulder joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pectoralis major</h4>
                        <p>This lies on the anterior thoracic wall. The fibres originate from the middle third of the clavicle and from the sternum and are inserted into the lip of the intertubercular groove of the humerus. It draws the arm forward and towards the body, i.e. flexes and adducts.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Coracobrachialis</h4>
                        <p>This lies on the upper medial aspect of the arm. It arises from the coracoid process of the scapula, stretches across in front of the shoulder joint and is inserted into the middle third of the humerus. It flexes the shoulder joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Biceps</h4>
                        <p>This lies on the anterior aspect of the upper arm. At its proximal end it is divided into two parts (heads), each of which has its own tendon. The short head rises from the coracoid process of the scapula and passes in front of the shoulder joint to the arm. The long head originates from the rim of the glenoid cavity and its tendon passes through the joint cavity and the bicipital groove of the humerus to the arm. It is retained in the bicipital groove by a transverse humeral ligament that stretches across the groove. The distal tendon crosses the elbow joint and is inserted into the radial tuberosity. It helps to stabilise and flex the shoulder joint and at the elbow joint it assists with flexion and supination.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Brachialis</h4>
                        <p>This lies on the anterior aspect of the upper arm deep to the biceps. It originates from the shaft of the humerus, extends across the elbow joint and is inserted into the ulna just distal to the joint capsule. It is the main flexor of the elbow joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Triceps</h4>
                        <p>This lies on the posterior aspect of the humerus. It arises from three heads, one from the scapula and two from the posterior surface of the humerus. The insertion is by a common tendon to the olecranon process of the ulna. It helps to stabilise the shoulder joint, assists in adduction of the arm and extends the elbow joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Brachioradialis</h4>
                        <p>The brachioradialis spans the elbow joint, originating on the distal end of the humerus and inserts on the lateral epicondyle of the radius. Contraction flexes the elbow joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pronator quadratus</h4>
                        <p>This square-shaped muscle is the main muscle causing pronation of the hand and has attachments on the lower sections of both the radius and the ulna.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pronator teres</h4>
                        <p>This lies obliquely across the upper third of the front of the forearm. It arises from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the coronoid process of the ulna and passes obliquely across the forearm to be inserted into the lateral surface of the shaft of the radius. It rotates the radioulnar joints, changing the hand from the anatomical to the writing position, i.e. pronation.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Supinator</h4>
                        <p>This lies obliquely across the posterior and lateral aspects of the forearm. Its fibres arise from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the upper part of the ulna and are inserted into the lateral surface of the upper third of the radius. It rotates the radioulnar joints, often with help from the biceps, changing the hand from the writing to the anatomical position, i.e. supination.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Flexor carpi radialis</h4>
                        <p>This lies on the anterior surface of the forearm. It originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and is inserted into the second and third metacarpal bones. It flexes the wrist joint, and when acting with the extensor carpi radialis, abducts the joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Flexor carpi ulnaris</h4>
                        <p>This lies on the medial aspect of the forearm. It originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the upper parts of the ulna and is inserted into the pisiform, the hamate and the fifth metacarpal bones. It flexes the wrist, and when acting with the extensor carpi ulnaris, adducts the joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis</h4>
                        <p>These lie on the posterior aspect of the forearm. The fibres originate from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and are inserted by a long tendon into the second and third metacarpal bones. They extend and abduct the wrist.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Extensor carpi ulnaris</h4>
                        <p>This lies on the posterior surface of the forearm. It originates from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and is inserted into the fifth metacarpal bone. It extends and adducts the wrist.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Palmaris longus</h4>
                        <p>This muscle resists shearing forces that might pull the skin and fascia of the palm away from the underlying structures, and flexes the wrist. Its origin is on the medial epicondyle of the humerus, and it inserts on tendons on the palm of the hand.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Extensor digitorum</h4>
                        <p>This muscle originates on the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and spans both the elbow and wrist joints; in the wrist, it divides into four tendons, one for each finger. Action of this muscle can extend any of the joints across which it passes, i.e. the elbow, wrist or finger joints. Muscles that control finger movements. Large muscles in the forearm that extend to the hand give power to the hand and fingers, but not the delicacy of movement needed for fine and dexterous finger control. Smaller muscles, which originate on the carpal and metacarpal bones, control tiny and precise finger movements via tendinous attachments on the phalanges; muscle fibres do not extend into the fingers.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="muscles-of-the-hip-and-lower-limb">Muscles of the hip and lower limb</h3>
                        <p>The biggest muscles of the body are found here, since their function is largely in weight bearing. The lower parts of the body are designed to transmit the force of body weight in walking, running, etc., evenly throughout weight-bearing structures, and act as shock absorbers.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Psoas</h4>
                        <p>This arises from the transverse processes and bodies of the lumbar vertebrae. It passes across the flat part of the ilium and behind the inguinal ligament to be inserted into the femur. Together with the iliacus it flexes the hip joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Iliacus</h4>
                        <p>This lies in the iliac fossa of the innominate bone. It originates from the iliac crest, passes over the iliac fossa and joins the tendon of the psoas muscle to be inserted into the lesser trochanter of the femur. The combined action of the iliacus and psoas flexes the hip joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Quadriceps femoris</h4>
                        <p>This is a group of four muscles lying on the front and sides of the thigh. They are the rectus femoris and three vasti: lateralis, medialis and intermedius. The rectus femoris originates from the ilium and the three vasti from the upper end of the femur. Together they pass over the front of the knee joint to be inserted into the tibia by the patellar tendon. Only the rectus femoris flexes the hip joint. Together, the group acts as a very strong extensor of the knee joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Obturators</h4>
                        <p>The obturators, deep muscles of the buttock, have their origins in the rim of the obturator foramen of the pelvis and insert into the proximal femur. Their main function lies in lateral rotation at the hip joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Gluteals</h4>
                        <p>These consist of the gluteus maximus, medius and minimus, which together form the fleshy part of the buttock. They originate from the ilium and sacrum and are inserted into the femur. They cause extension, abduction and medial rotation at the hip joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sartorius</h4>
                        <p>This is the longest muscle in the body and crosses both the hip and knee joints. It originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and passes obliquely across the hip joint, thigh and knee joint to be inserted into the medial surface of the upper part of the tibia. It is associated with flexion and abduction at the hip joint and flexion at the knee.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Adductor group</h4>
                        <p>This lies on the medial aspect of the thigh. They originate from the pubic bone and are inserted into the linea aspera of the femur. They adduct and medially rotate the thigh.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Hamstrings</h4>
                        <p>These lie on the posterior aspect of the thigh. They originate from the ischium and are inserted into the upper end of the tibia. They are the biceps femoris, semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles. They flex the knee joint.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Gastrocnemius</h4>
                        <p>This forms the bulk of the calf of the leg. It arises by two heads, one from each condyle of the femur, and passes down behind the tibia to be inserted into the calcaneus by the calcanean tendon (Achilles tendon).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Anterior tibialis</h4>
                        <p>This originates from the upper end of the tibia, lies on the anterior surface of the leg and is inserted into the middle cuneiform bone by a long tendon. It is associated with dorsiflexion of the foot.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Soleus.</h4> <!-- Note: MMD has dot here -->
                        <p>This is one of the main muscles of the calf of the leg, lying immediately deep to the gastrocnemius. It originates from the heads and upper parts of the fibula and the tibia.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Soleus</h4>
                        <p>This is one of the main muscles of the calf of the leg, lying immediately deep to the gastrocnemius. It originates from the heads and upper parts of the fibula and the tibia. Its tendon joins that of the gastrocnemius so that they have a common insertion into the calcaneus by the calcanean (Achilles) tendon.</p>
