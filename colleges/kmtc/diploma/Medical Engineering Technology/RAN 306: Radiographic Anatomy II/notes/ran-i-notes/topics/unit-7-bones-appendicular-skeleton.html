                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The upper limb forms a joint with the trunk via the shoulder (pectoral) girdle.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Shoulder girdle</h3>
                        <p>Consists of two clavicles and scapulae.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clavicle (collar bone)</h4>
                        <p>Clavicle is an S-shaped long bone. It articulates with the manubrium of the sternum at the sternoclavicular joint and forms the acromioclavicular joint with the acromion process of the scapula. The clavicle provides the only bony link between the upper limb and the axial skeleton.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Scapula (shoulder blade)</h4>
                        <p>The scapula is a flat triangular-shaped bone, lying on the posterior chest wall superficial to the ribs and separated from them by muscles.</p>
                        <p>At the lateral angle is a shallow articular surface, the glenoid cavity, which, with the head of the humerus, forms the shoulder joint. On the posterior surface runs a rough ridge called the spine, which extends beyond the lateral border of the scapula and overhangs the glenoid cavity.</p>
                        <p>The prominent overhang, which can be felt through the skin as the highest point of the shoulder, is called the acromion process and forms a joint with the clavicle, the acromioclavicular joint, a slightly movable synovial joint that contributes to the mobility of the shoulder girdle.</p>
                        <p>The coracoid process, a projection from the upper border of the bone, gives attachment to muscles that move the shoulder joint.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The upper limb</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Humerus</h4>
                        <p>This is the bone of the upper arm. The head sits within the glenoid cavity of the scapula, forming the shoulder joint. Distal to the head are two roughened projections of bone, the greater and lesser tubercles, and between them there is a deep groove, the bicipital groove or intertubercular synovial joint that contributes to the mobility of the shoulder girdle</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Ulna and radius</h4>
                        <p>These are the two bones of the forearm. The ulna is longer than and medial to the radius and when the arm is in the anatomical position, i.e. with the palm of the hand facing forward, the two bones are parallel. They articulate with the humerus at the elbow joint, the carpal bones at the wrist joint and with each other at the proximal and distal radioulnar joints. In addition, an interosseous membrane, a fibrous joint, connects the bones along their shafts, stabilizing their association and maintaining their relative positions despite forces applied from the elbow or wrist.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Carpal (wrist) bones</h4>
                        <p>These bones are closely fitted together and held in position by ligaments that allow a limited amount of movement between them. The bones of the proximal row are associated with the wrist joint and those of the distal row form joints with the metacarpal bones. Tendons of muscles lying in the forearm cross the wrist and are held close to the bones by strong fibrous bands, called retinacula.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Metacarpal bones (bones of the hand)</h4>
                        <p>These five bones form the palm of the hand. They are numbered from the thumb side inwards. The proximal ends articulate with the carpal bones and the distal ends with the phalanges.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Phalanges (finger bones)</h4>
                        <p>There are 14 phalanges, three in each finger and two in the thumb. They articulate with the metacarpal bones and with each other, by hinge joints.</p>

                        <p>The lower limb forms a joint with the trunk at the pelvic girdle</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The pelvic girdle</h3>
                        <p>The pelvic girdle is formed from two innominate (hip) bones. The pelvis is the pelvis term given to the basin-shaped structure formed by the pelvic girdle and its associated sacrum.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Innominate (hip) bones</h3>
                        <p>Each hip bone consists of three fused bones: the ilium, ischium and pubis.</p>
                        <p>On its lateral surface is a deep depression, the acetabulum, which forms the hip joint with the almost-spherical head of femur. The ilium is the upper flattened part of the bone and it presents the iliac crest, the anterior curve of which is called the anterior superior iliac spine. The ilium forms a synovial joint with the sacrum, the sacroiliac joint, a strong joint capable of absorbing the stresses of weight bearing and which tends to become fibrosed in later life. The pubis is the anterior part of the bone and it articulates with the pubis of the other hip bone at a cartilaginous joint, the symphysis pubis. The ischium is the inferior and posterior part. The rough inferior projections of the ischia, the ischial tuberosities, bear the weight of the body when seated. The union of the three parts iliopectineal lines of the innominate bones. The greater or false pelvis is above the brim and the lesser or true pelvis is below.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Differences between male and female pelvis</h3>
                        <p>The shape of the female pelvis allows for the passage of the baby during childbirth. In comparison with the male pelvis, the female pelvis has lighter bones, is more shallow and rounded and is generally roomier.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The lower limb Femur (thigh bone)</h3>
                        <p>The femur is the longest and heaviest bone of the body. The head is almost spherical and fits into the acetabulum of the hip bone to form the hip joint. The neck extends outwards and slightly downwards from the head to the shaft and most of it is within the capsule of the hip joint. The posterior surface of the lower third forms a flat triangular area called the popliteal surface. The distal extremity has two articular condyles, which, with the tibia and patella, form the knee joint. The femur transmits the weight of the body through the bones below the knee to the foot.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tibia (shin bone)</h3>
                        <p>The tibia is the medial of the two bones of the lower leg. The proximal extremity is broad and flat and presents two condyles for articulation with the femur at the knee joint. The head of the fibula articulates with the inferior aspect of the lateral condyle, forming the proximal tibiofibular joint. The distal extremity of the tibia forms the ankle joint with the talus and the fibula. The medial malleolus is a downward projection of bone medial to the ankle joint.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Fibula</h3>
                        <p>The fibula is the long slender lateral bone in the leg. The head or upper extremity articulates with the lateral condyle of the tibia, forming the proximal tibiofibular joint, and the lower extremity articulates with the tibia, and projects beyond it to form the lateral malleolus. This helps to stabilize the ankle joint.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Patella (knee cap)</h3>
                        <p>This is a roughly triangular-shaped sesamoid bone associated with the knee joint. Its posterior surface articulates with the patellar surface of the femur in the knee joint and its anterior surface is in the patellar tendon, i.e. the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tarsal (ankle) bones</h3>
                        <p>The seven tarsal bones forming the posterior part of the foot (ankle) are the talus, calcaneus, navicular, cuboid and three cuneiform bones. The talus articulates with the tibia and fibula at the ankle joint. The calcaneus forms the heel of the foot. The other bones articulate with each other and with the metatarsal bones.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Metatarsals (bones of the foot)</h3>
                        <p>These are five bones, numbered from inside out, which form the greater part of the dorsum (sole) of the foot. At their proximal ends they articulate with the tarsal bones and at their distal ends, with the phalanges. The enlarged distal head of the 1st metatarsal bone forms the 'ball' of the foot.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Phalanges (toe bones,)</h3> <!-- Comma kept as per verbatim -->
                        <p>There are <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{14}$</span> phalanges arranged in a similar manner to those in the fingers, i.e. two in the great</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The arrangement of bones in the foot, supported by associated ligaments and action of associated muscles, gives the sole of the foot an arched or curved shape.</p>
                        <p>The curve running from heel to toe is called the longitudinal arch, and the curve running across the foot is called the transverse arch.</p>
                        <p>In the normal longitudinal arch, only the calcaneus and the distal ends of the metatarsals should touch the ground, the bones in between being lifted clear. This gives the conventional footprint shape.</p>
                        <p>If, however, the concavity of the sole is lost because of sagging ligaments or tendons, the arch sinks and much more of the sole of the foot is in contact with the ground: this is called flat foot.</p>
                        <p>Because the arches of the foot are important in distributing the weight of the body evenly whilst upright, whether stationary or moving, the flat foot loses the springiness of normal foot structure and leads to sore feet when standing, walking or running for long periods. As there are movable joints between all the bones of the foot, very strong muscles and ligaments are necessary to maintain the strength, resilience and stability of the foot during walking, running and jumping.</p>
