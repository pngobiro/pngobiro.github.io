\section*{ANATOMICAL TERMINOLOGY}

Anatomy is the study, classification, and description of the structure and organs of the human body, whereas physiology deals with the processes and functions of the body, or how the body parts work.
Radiographic anatomy involves the study of anatomy through the use of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.

Positioning terminology
Radiographic positioning refers to the study of patient positioning performed for radiographic demonstration or visualization of specific body parts on image receptors. Each person who plans to work as a radiologic technologist must clearly understand the correct use of positioning terminology.

\section*{General Terms}

Radiograph an image of a patient's anatomic part(s), as produced by the action of $x$-rays on an image receptor. If the radiograph is produced with the use of traditional filmscreen technology, the image is stored and displayed on film; if the radiograph is produced via digital technology, the image is viewed and stored with the use of computers. Radiography The process and procedures of producing a radiograph. Radiograph versus $x$-ray film: In practice, the terms radiograph and x-ray film (or just film) are often used interchangeably. However, x-ray film specifically refers to the physical piece of material on which a latent (nonprocessed) radiographic image is stored. The term radiograph includes the recording medium and the image. Image receptor (IR):

The device that captures the radiographic image that exits the patient; refers to both film-screen cassettes and digital acquisition devices.

Central ray (CR): Refers to the center-most portion of the x -ray beam emitted from the x ray tube; the portion of the x-ray beam that has the least divergence.
Radiographic examination or procedure: A radiologic technologist is shown positioning the patient for a routine chest examination or procedure. A radiographic examination involves five general functions:
1. Positioning of body part and alignment with the IR and CR
2. Application of radiation protection measures and devices
3. Selection of exposure factors (radiographic technique) on the control panel
4. Instructions to the patient related to respiration (breathing) and initiation of the x ray exposure
5. Processing of the IR (film-based [analog] and cassette-based [PSP] system)
Anatomic position: The anatomic position is a reference position that defines specific surfaces and planes of the body. The anatomic position is an upright position with arms abducted slightly (down), palms forward, and head and feet directed straight ahead.
Viewing radiographs: A general rule in viewing radiographs is to display them so that the patient is facing the viewer, with the patient in the anatomic position.

Body Planes, Sections, and Lines
Positioning terms that describe CR angles or relationships between body parts often are related to imaginary planes that pass through the body in the anatomic position. The study of CT, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and sonography (diagnostic medical ultrasound) emphasizes sectional anatomy, which also involves the primary body planes and sections as described subsequently.

Plane: straight line surface Connecting Two Points

Four common planes as used in medical imaging are as follows:

\section*{Sagittal plane}

A sagittal plane is any longitudinal plane that divides the body into right and left parts. It passes approximately through the sagittal suture of the skull. Any plane parallel to the midsagittal or median plane is called a sagittal plane.

\section*{Coronal plane}

A coronal plane is any longitudinal plane that divides the body into anterior and posterior parts.
It is called a coronal plane because it passes approximately through the coronal suture of the skull.

Horizontal (axial) plane
A horizontal (axial) plane is any transverse plane that passes through the body at right angles to a longitudinal plane, dividing the body into superior and inferior portions.

\section*{Oblique plane}

An oblique plane is a longitudinal or transverse plane that is at an angle or slant
and is not parallel to the sagittal, coronal, or horizontal plane.

Fig. 1-40 Transverse (axial) image.

\section*{Planes of The skull}

Base plane of skull: This precise transverse plane is formed by connecting the lines from the infraorbital margins (inferior edge of bony orbits) to the superior margin of the external auditory meatus (EAM), the external opening of the ear. This sometimes is called the Frankfort horizontal plane, as used in orthodontics and cranial topography to measure and locate specific cranial points or structures.

Occlusal plane
This horizontal plane is formed by the biting surfaces of the upper and lower teeth with jaws closed (used as a reference plane of the head for cervical spine and skull radiography).

\section*{Body Surfaces and Parts}

Terms for the BACK and Front Portions of the Body

\section*{Posterior or dorsal}

Posterior or dorsal refers to the back half of the patient, or the part of the body seen when the person is viewed from the back; includes the bottoms of the feet and the backs of the hands as demonstrated in the anatomic position.

\section*{Anterior or ventral}

Anterior or ventral refers to front half of the patient, or the part seen when viewed from the front; includes the tops of the feet and the fronts or palms of the hands in the anatomic position.

Terms for surfaces of The Hands and Feet
Plantar
Plantar refers to the sole or posterior surface of the foot.

Dorsal
Dorsal refers to the top or anterior surface of the foot (dorsum pedis).

\section*{Hand}

Dorsal also refers to the back or posterior aspect of the hand (dorsum manus).
Note: The term dorsum (or dorsal) in general refers to the vertebral or posterior part of the body. However, when used in relationship with the foot, dorsum (dorsum pedis) specifically refers to the upper surface, or anterior aspect, of the foot opposite the sole, whereas for the hand (dorsum manus), it refers to the back or posterior surface opposite the palm.

\section*{Palmar}

Palmar refers to the palm of the hand; in the anatomic position, the same as the anterior or ventral surface of the hand.

\section*{Radiographic Projections}

Projection is a positioning term that describes the direction or path of the CR of the x-ray beam as it passes through the patient, projecting an image onto the IR. Although the term position is used in the clinical setting, the term projection is considered to be the most accurate term for describing how the procedure is performed.

\section*{Common Projection Terms}

\section*{Poster anterior}
(PA) projection Posteroanterior (PA) projection refers to a projection of the CR from posterior to anterior. The CR enters at the posterior surface and exits at the anterior surface (PA projection). A true PA requires the CR to be perpendicular to the coronal body plane and parallel to the sagittal plane, unless some qualifying oblique or rotational term is used to indicate otherwise.

Anteroposterior (AP) projection Anteroposterior (AP) projection refers to a projection of CR from anterior to posterior, the opposite of PA.

\section*{AP oblique projection}

An AP projection of the upper or lower limb that is rotated is called "oblique." This is not a true AP projection and must also include a qualifying term that indicates which way it is rotated, such as medial or lateral rotation with
an AP oblique projection, the CR enters the anterior surface and exits the posterior surface of the body or body part.

\section*{PA oblique projection}

A PA projection of the upper limb with lateral rotation (from PA ). This projection is described as a PA oblique. It must also include a qualifying term that indicates which way it is rotated. With a PA oblique projection, the CR enters the posterior surface and exits the anterior surface of the body or body part.

Mediolateral and lateromedial projections A lateral projection is described by the path of the CR. The medial and lateral sides are determined with the patient in the anatomic position.

\section*{Body Positions}

In radiography, the term position is used in two ways, first as general body positions, and second as specific body positions.

\section*{General Body Positions}

The eight most commonly used general body positions in medical imaging are as follows:
1. Supine lying on back, facing upward.
2. Prone lying on abdomen, facing downward (head may be turned to one side).
3. Erect (upright) an upright position, to stand or sit erect.
4. Recumbent (reclining) lying down in any position (prone, supine, or on side).
- Dorsal recumbent: Lying on back (supine).
- Ventral recumbent: Lying face down (prone).
- Lateral recumbent: Lying on side (right or left lateral).
5. Trendelenburg position: A recumbent position with the body tilted with the head lower than the feet.
6. Fowler' position: A recumbent position with the body tilted with the head higher than the feet.
7. Sims' position: (semiprone position) A recumbent oblique position with the patient lying on the left anterior side, with the right knee and thigh flexed and the left arm extended down behind the back.
8. Lithotomy position: a recumbent (supine) position with knees and hip flexed and thighs abducted and rotated externally, supported by ankle supports.

Fig. 1-55 Modified lithotomy position (for retrograde urography).

\section*{Specific Body Positions}

In addition to a general body position, the second way the term position is used in radiography is to refer to a specific body position described by the body part closest to the IR (oblique and lateral) or by the surface on which the patient is lying (decubitus).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-08.jpg?height=2203&width=2813&top_left_y=1293&top_left_x=4896)

Fig. 1-53 Fowler's position-feet lower than head.

\section*{Lateral position}

Lateral position refers to the side of, or a side view. Specific lateral positions described by the part closest to the IR or the body part from which the CR exits. A right lateral position is shown with the right side of the body closest to the IR in the erect position. A true lateral position is always $90^{\circ}$, or perpendicular, or at a right angle, to a true AP or PA projection.

If it is not a true lateral, it is an oblique position.

\section*{Oblique position}

Oblique position refers to an angled position in which neither the sagittal nor the coronal
body plane is perpendicular or at a right angle to the IR. Oblique body positions of the thorax, abdomen, or pelvis are described by the part closest to the IR or the body part from which the CR exits.

These also can be referred to as AP oblique projections because the CR enters an anterior surface and exits posteriorly. However, this is not a complete description and requires a specific position clarifier such as LPO or RPO position. Therefore, these body obliques are referred to as positions and not projections.
Oblique of upper and lower limbs are described correctly as AP and PA oblique, but require the use of either medial or lateral rotation as a qualifier.

Right and left anterior oblique (RAO and LAO) positions: Refer to oblique positions in which the right or left anterior aspect of the body is closest to the IR and can be erect or recumbent general body positions.
Decubitus (decub) position
The word decubitus literally means to "lie down," or the position assumed in "lying down." This body position, meaning to lie on a horizontal surface, is designated according to the surface on which the body is resting. This term describes a patient who is lying on one of the following body surfaces: back (dorsal), front (ventral), or side (right or left lateral).
In radiographic positioning, decubitus is always performed with the central ray horizontal.
Decubitus positions are essential for detecting air-fluid levels or free air in a body cavity such as the chest or abdomen, where
the air rises to the uppermost part of the body cavity.
Right or left lateral decubitus positionAP or PA projection: In this position, the patient lies on the side, and the x-ray beam is directed horizontally from anterior to posterior. The AP or PA projection is important as a qualifying term with decubitus positions to denote the direction of the CR. This position is either a left lateral decubitus or a right lateral decubitus. It is named according to the dependent side (side down) and the AP or PA projection indication.

Fig. 1-63 Right lateral decubitus position (PA projection).

Dorsal decubitus position-left or right lateral: In this position, the patient is lying on the dorsal (posterior) surface with the x ray beam directed horizontally, exiting from the side closest to the IR.

The position is named according to the surface on which the patient is lying (dorsal or ventral) and by the side closest to the IR (right or left).

Ventral decubitus position-right or left lateral: In this position, the patient is lying on the ventral (anterior) surface with the xray beam directed horizontally, exiting from the side closest to the IR.

\section*{Additional Special Use Projection Terms}

Following are some additional terms that are commonly used to describe projections. These terms, as shown by their definitions, also refer to the path or projection of the CR and are projections rather than positions.

\section*{AP axial projection-lordotic position}

This is a specific AP chest projection for demonstrating the apices of the lungs. It also is sometimes called the apical lordotic projection. In this case, the long axis of the body rather than the CR is angled.
The term lordotic comes from lordosis, a term that denotes curvature of the cervical and lumbar spine. As the patient assumes this position the lumbar lordotic curvature is exaggerated, making this a descriptive term for this special chest.

Transthoracic lateral projection (right lateral position): A lateral projection through the thorax. Requires a qualifying positioning term (right or left lateral position) to indicate which shoulder is closest to the IR and is being examined.

Dorsoplantar and plantodorsal projections: These are secondary terms for AP or PA projections of the foot. Dorsoplantar (DP) describes the path of the CR from the dorsal (anterior) surface to the plantar (posterior) surface of the foot.
A special plantodorsal projection of the heel bone (calcaneus) is called an axial plantodorsal projection (PD) because the angled CR enters the plantar surface of the foot and exits the dorsal surface.

Parietoacanthial and acanthi parietal projections: The CR enters at the cranial parietal bone and exits at the acanthion (junction of nose and upper lip) for the Parietoacanthial projection.
The opposite CR direction would describe the acanthioparietal projection. These are also known as PA Waters and AP reverse Waters methods and are used to visualize the facial bones.

\section*{Relationship Terms}

Following are paired positioning or anatomic terms that are used to describe relationships to parts of the body with opposite meanings.

\section*{Medial versus lateral}

Medial versus lateral refers to toward versus away from the center, or median plane. In the anatomic position, the medial aspect of any body part is the "inside" part closest to the median plane, and the lateral part is away from the center, or away from the median plane or midline of the body.

\section*{Proximal versus distal}

Proximal is near the source or beginning, and distal is away from. In regard to the upper and lower limbs, proximal and distal would be the
part closest to or away from the trunk, the source or beginning of that limb.
Cephalad versus caudad
Cephalad means toward the head end of the body, whereas caudad means away from the head end of the body.

The prefix intra- means within or inside (e.g., intravenous: inside a vein).
The prefix inter- means situated between things (e.g., intercostal: located between the ribs).

\section*{Ipsilateral versus contralateral Ipsilateral:} is on the same side of the body or part; contralateral is on the opposite side.

\section*{Terms Related to Movements}

The final group of positioning and related terms that every technologist should know relates to various movements.

\section*{Flexion versus extension}

When a joint is flexed or extended, the angle between parts is decreased or increased.
Flexion decreases the angle of the joint (see examples of knee, elbow, and wrist flexions. Extension increases the angle as the body part moves from a flexed to a straightened position.

\section*{Hyperextension}

Extending a joint beyond the straight or neutral position.
Abnormal hyperextension
A hyperextended elbow or knee results when the joint is extended beyond the straightened or neutral position. This is not a natural movement for these two joints and results in injury or trauma.

Normal flexion and hyperextension of spine Flexion is bending forward, and extension is

Fig. 1-84 Hyperextension, extension, and flexion of spine.
Acute flexion of wrist: An acute or full flexion of the wrist is required for a special tangential projection for a carpal bridge view of the posterior aspect of the wrist.
Ulnar deviation versus radial deviation of wrist Deviation: literally means "to turn aside" or "to turn away from the standard or course." Ulnar deviation is to turn or bend the hand and wrist from the natural position toward the ulnar side, and radial deviation is toward the radial side of the wrist.

Dorsiflexion versus plantar flexion of foot Dorsiflexion of foot: To decrease the angle (flex) between the dorsum (top of foot) and the lower leg, moving foot and toes upward.

Plantar flexion of foot extending the ankle joint, moving foot and toes downward from the normal position; flexing or decreasing the angle toward the plantar (posterior) surface of the foot.

\section*{Eversion versus inversion}

Eversion is an outward stress movement of the foot at the ankle joint.
Inversion is inward stress movement of the foot as applied to the foot without rotation of the leg.
The plantar surface (sole) of the foot is turned or rotated away from the median plane of the body (the sole faces in a more lateral direction) for eversion and toward the median plane for inversion.
The leg does not rotate, and stress is applied to the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle joint for evaluation of possible widening of the joint space (ankle mortise).

\section*{Valgus versus Varus}

Varus Valgus describes the bending of the part outward or away from the midline of the body. Valgus sometimes is used to describe eversion stress of the ankle joint.
Varus meaning "knock-kneed," describes the bending of a part inward or toward the midline. The term varus stress sometimes is used to describe inversion stress applied at the ankle joint.
Medial (internal) rotation versus lateral (external) rotation Medial rotation is a rotation or turning of a body part with movement of the anterior aspect of the part toward the inside, or median, plane.
Lateral rotation is a rotation of an anterior body part toward the outside, or away from the median plane.

\section*{Abduction versus adduction}

Abduction is the lateral movement of the arm or leg away from the body.
Adduction is a movement of arm or leg toward the body, to draw toward a center or medial line

\section*{Supination versus pronation}

Supination is a rotational movement of the hand into the anatomic position (palm up in supine position or forward in erect position). This movement rotates the radius of the forearm laterally along its long axis.
Pronation is a rotation of the hand into the opposite of the anatomic position (palm down or back).

\section*{Protraction versus retraction}

Protraction is a movement forward from a normal position. Retraction is a movement backward or the condition of being drawn back.
Protraction is moving the jaw forward (sticking the chin out) or drawing the shoulders forward. Retraction is the opposite of this-that is, moving the jaw backward or squaring the shoulders, as in a military stance.

\section*{Elevation versus depression}

Elevation is a lifting, raising, or moving of a part superiorly.
Depression is a letting down, lowering, or moving of a part inferiorly.

\section*{Circumduction}

Circumduction means to move around in the form of a circle. This term describes sequential movements of flexion, abduction, extension, and adduction, resulting in a cone-
type movement at any joint where the four movements are possible (e.g., fingers, wrist, arm, leg).

\section*{Rotation versus Tilt}

Rotate is to turn or rotate a body part on its axis, the midsagittal plane of the entire body, including the head, is rotated.
Tilt is a slanting or tilting movement with respect to the long axis

\section*{Summary of Potentially Misused Positioning Terms}

The three terms position, projection, and view are sometimes confusing and may be used incorrectly in practice. These terms should be understood and used correctly.

\section*{Position}

Position is a term that is used to indicate the patient's general physical position, such as supine, prone, recumbent, or erect.
Position also is used to describe specific body positions by the body part closest to the IR,

\section*{Projection}

Projection is a correct positioning term that describes or refers to the path or direction of the central ray (CR), projecting an image onto an image receptor (IR).
The term projection should be "restricted to discussion of the path of the central ray."
View
View is not a correct positioning term. View describes the body part as seen by the IR or other recording medium, such as a fluoroscopic screen.

\section*{RESPIRATORY SYSTEM}

\section*{Chest}

Chest radiographic examinations are the most common of all radiographic procedures. Before beginning clinical experience, it is important to learn and understand chest anatomy, including relative relationships of all anatomy within the chest cavity.

The chest, or thorax, is the upper portion of the trunk between the neck and the abdomen.

Radiographic anatomy of the chest is divided into three sections: bony thorax, respiratory system Proper, and mediastinum.

\section*{Bony thorax}

The bony thorax is the part of the skeletal system that provides a protective framework for the parts of the chest involved with breathing and blood circulation.

Thoracic viscera is the term used to describe these parts of the chest consisting of the lungs and the remaining thoracic organs contained in the mediastinum.

Anteriorly, the bony thorax consists of the sternum which has three divisions. The superior portion is the manubrium, the large center portion is the body, and the smaller inferior portion is the xiphoid process.
Superiorly, the bony thorax consists of the 2 clavicles (collarbones) that connect the sternum to the 2 scapulae (shoulder blades), the 12 pairs of ribs that circle the thorax, and the 12 thoracic vertebrae posteriorly.

Topographic Positioning Landmarks
Accurate and consistent radiographic positioning requires certain landmarks, or reference points, that can be used to center the image receptor (IR) correctly to ensure that all essential anatomy is included on that specific projection.

These topographic landmarks should be parts of the body that are easily and consistently located on patients, such as parts of the bony thorax.

For chest positioning, two of these landmarks are the vertebra prominence and the jugular notch.

\section*{Vertebra prominence (seventh cervical vertebra)}

The vertebra prominence is an important landmark for determining the central ray (CR) location on a Posteroanterior (PA) chest projection.

It can be palpated readily on most patients by applying light pressure with the fingertips at the base of the neck.

The vertebra prominence is the first prominent process felt as you gently but firmly palpate down the back of the neck with the head dropped forward.

\section*{Jugular notch (manubrial or suprasternal notch)}

The jugular notch is an important landmark for determining the CR placement on
Anteroposterior (AP) chest projections. This is palpated easily as a deep notch or
depression on the superior portion of the sternum below the thyroid cartilage.
The midthorax, at the level of T7 (seventh thoracic vertebra), Can be located easily from these two landmarks.

\section*{Xiphoid process (tip)}

The inferior tip of the sternum, the xiphoid process, which corresponds to the level of T9 or T10, can also be palpated. The xiphoid process corresponds to the approximate level of the anterior portion of the diaphragm, which separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. However, this is not a reliable landmark for positioning the chest because of variations in body habitus and the variable lower position of the posterior lungs, which may extend as far as T11 or T12 on inspiration.

\section*{Respiratory system}

Respiration is the exchange of gaseous substances between the air we breathe and the bloodstream. The respiratory system consists of the parts of the body through which air passes as it travels from the nose and mouth into the lungs.

Four general divisions of the respiratory system are the pharynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs.

An important structure of the respiratory system is the dome shaped diaphragm, which is the primary muscle of inspiration.

Each half of the diaphragm is called a hemi diaphragm ("hemi-" meaning half).

As the dome of the diaphragm moves downward, it increases the volume of the thoracic cavity.

This increase in volume, along with certain other dimensional movements of the thorax described later in this chapter, decreases the intrathoracic pressure, creating a "sucking" action or negative pressure effect, resulting in air being drawn into the lungs through the nose and mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. This causes the lungs to fill with air, which is known as inspiration.

Fig. 2-2 Topographic landmarks.

\section*{Pharynx}

The pharynx (far'-inks) (upper airway) is a structure or passageway that is important to the respiratory system because air must pass through it before
entering the respiratory system, which begins with the larynx, or voice box. The pharynx, also referred to as the upper airway or the upper respiratory tract, is the posterior area between the nose and mouth above and the larynx and esophagus below.

This area serves as a passageway for food and fluids as well as air, making it common to the digestive and respiratory systems.

For this reason, the pharynx is not considered part of the respiratory system.

The pharynx has three divisions, nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx.

The interior of the pharynx communicates posteriorly with certain cavities-the nose above (nasopharynx), the mouth (oropharynx), and the larynx below (laryngopharynx)-as well as the esophagus.

The hard palate and the soft palate make up the roof of the oral cavity. The lower posterior aspect of the soft palate is called the uvula, this marks the boundary between the nasopharynx and the oropharynx.

The laryngopharynx lies above and posterior to the larynx and extends from the upper border of the epiglottis to where the laryngopharynx narrows to join the esophagus.

The upper portion of the epiglottis projects upward behind the tongue and acts as a lid for the slanted opening of the larynx.

During the act of swallowing, the epiglottis flips down and covers the laryngeal opening, and this prevents food and fluid from entering the larynx and bronchi.

\section*{Esophagus}

The esophagus is the part of the digestive system that connects the pharynx with the stomach. Note the relationship of the esophagus to both the pharynx and the larynx. It begins at the distal end of the laryngopharynx and continues downward to the stomach, posterior to the larynx and trachea.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-16.jpg?height=4010&width=3310&top_left_y=3394&top_left_x=4738)

Fig. 2-4 Pharynx, upper airway (midsagittal section).

\section*{Parts of the Respiratory System}

The four parts of the respiratory system proper that are important in chest radiography are as follows:

\section*{1. Larynx (voice box)}
2. Trachea
3. Right and left bronchi

\section*{4. Lungs}

The larynx, trachea, and bronchi form a continuous, tubular structure through which air can pass from the nose and mouth into the lungs.

NOTE: The pharynx serves as a passage for both air and food and is not considered part of the respiratory system proper.

\section*{Larynx (voice box)}

The larynx, or voice box, is a cage like, cartilaginous structure that is approximately 1.5 to 2 inches ( 4 to 5 cm ) in length in an adult.

The larynx is located in the anterior portion of the neck, suspended from a small bone called the hyoid. The hyoid bone is found in the upper neck just below the tongue or floor of the mouth

The hyoid bone is not part of the larynx.
The larynx serves as the organ of voice. Sounds are made as air passes between the vocal cords located within the larynx.

The upper margin of the larynx is at the approximate level of C3. Its lower margin, where the larynx joins with the trachea, is at the level of C6.

The framework of the larynx consists of cartilages that are connected by ligaments and moved by numerous muscles that assist in the complex sound-making or voice process. The largest and least mobile of these cartilages is the thyroid cartilage, which consists of two fused plate like structures that form the anterior wall of the larynx.

The prominent anterior projection of the thyroid cartilage is palpated easily and is
known as the laryngeal prominence, or Adam's apple.

This prominent structure is an important positioning landmark because it is easy to locate. The laryngeal prominence of the thyroid cartilage located at approximately the level of C5 is an excellent topographic reference for locating specific skeletal structures in this region.

The cricoid cartilage is a ring of cartilage that forms the inferior and posterior wall of the larynx. It is attached to the first ring of cartilage of the trachea.

One of the cartilages that make up the larynx is the uniquely shaped epiglottis, which resembles a leaf with the narrow distal stem portion attached to a part of the thyroid cartilage.

Fig. 2-6 Larynx (lateral view).

\section*{Trachea}

Continuing from the larynx downward, the second division of the respiratory system proper is the trachea, or windpipe. It is a fibrous muscular tube about 0.75 inch ( 2 cm ) in diameter and 4.5 inches ( 11 cm ) long.

Approximately 20 C -shaped rings of cartilage are embedded in its walls. These rigid rings keep the airway open by preventing the trachea from collapsing during inspiration.
The trachea, located just anterior to the esophagus, extends from its junction with the larynx at the level of C6 (sixth cervical vertebra) downward to the level of T4 or T5 (fourth or fifth thoracic vertebra), where it divides into right and left primary bronchi.

Glands located near the respiratory system include the thyroid, parathyroid, and thymus glands.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-18.jpg?height=3479&width=2870&top_left_y=6449&top_left_x=1185)

Fig. 2-8 Trachea.

\section*{Right and Left Bronchi}

The third part of the respiratory system consists of the right and left primary bronchi, also known as the right and left main stem bronchi.

The right primary bronchus is wider and shorter than the left bronchus. The right primary bronchus is also more vertical; therefore, the angle of divergence from the distal trachea is less abrupt for the right bronchus than for the left.

This difference in size and shape between the two primary bronchi is important because food particles or other foreign objects that happen to enter the respiratory system are more likely to enter and lodge in the right bronchus.
The right bronchus is about 2.5 cm long and 1.3 cm in diameter. The angle of divergence of the right bronchus is only about $25^{\circ}$.

The left bronchus is smaller in diameter ( 1.1 cm ) than the right bronchus but about twice as long ( 5 cm ). The divergent angle of the left primary bronchus is approximately $37^{\circ}$, which is more horizontal than the right bronchus. This increased angle and the smaller diameter make food particles or other foreign matter less likely to enter the left bronchus.

The carina is a specific prominence, or ridge, of the lowest tracheal cartilage, which is seen at the bottom and inside portion of the trachea, where it divides into right and left bronchi.

As viewed from above through a bronchoscope, the carina is to the left of the midline, and the right bronchus appears more open than the left, which clearly shows why particles that come down the trachea is more likely to enter the right bronchus.

The position of the carina, is at the lower level of the division into the right and left primary bronchi. This is at the approximate level of T5 and is used as a specific reference point or level for CT of the thorax.

\section*{Secondary Bronchi, Lobes, and Alveoli}

In addition to differences in size and shape between the right and left bronchi, another important difference is that the right bronchus divides into three secondary bronchi, but the left divides into only two, with each entering individual lobes of the lungs.

The right lung contains three lobes, and the left lung contains two lobes.

These secondary bronchi continue to subdivide into smaller branches, called bronchioles that spread to all parts of each lobe.
Each of these small terminal bronchioles terminates in very small air sacs called alveoli. The two lungs contain 500 million to 700 million alveoli. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the blood through the thin walls of alveoli.

\section*{Lungs}

The fourth and last division of the respiratory system comprises the two large, spongy lungs, which are located on
each side of the thoracic cavity. The lungs fill all of the space not occupied by other structures.

The right lung is made up of three lobesthe superior, middle, and inferior lobesdivided by two deep fissures.

The inferior fissure, which separates the inferior and middle lobes, is called the oblique fissure. The horizontal fissure separates the superior and middle lobes.

The lungs are composed of a light, spongy, highly elastic substance called parenchyma.

Fig. 2-13 Secondary bronchi and alveoli.

This substance allows for the breathing mechanism responsible for expansion and contraction of the lungs, which brings oxygen into and removes carbon dioxide from the blood through the thin walls of the alveoli.

Each lung is contained in a delicate double walled sac, or membrane, called the pleura.

The outer layer of this pleural sac lines the inner surface of the chest walls and diaphragm and is called the parietal pleura.

The inner layer that covers the surface of the lungs, also dipping into the fissures between the lobes, is called the pulmonary or visceral.

The potential space between the doublewalled pleura, called the pleural cavity, contains a lubricating fluid that allows movement of one or the other during breathing.

When a lung collapses, or when air or fluid collects between these two layers, this space may be visualized radiographically.

Air or gas present in this pleural cavity results in a condition called a pneumothorax, wherein air or gas pressure in the pleural cavity may cause the lung to collapse.

Accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity (pleural effusion) creates a condition called a hemothorax.

Pulmonary edema is a condition caused by excess fluid in the lungs. This fluid collects in the numerous air sacs in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. In most cases, heart problems cause pulmonary edema

\section*{Parts of Lungs}

Radiographically important parts of the lungs include the following.

The apex (B) of each lung is the rounded upper area above the level of the clavicles. The apices of the lungs extend up into the lower neck area to the level of T1 (first thoracic vertebra).

This important part of the lungs must be included on chest radiographs.

Fig. 2-16 Cross-section of lower mediastinum and lungs.
The carina ( $C$ ) is shown as the point of bifurcation, the lowest margin of the separation of the trachea into the right and left bronchi.
The base (D) of each lung is the lower concave area of each lung that rests on the diaphragm (E).
The diaphragm is a muscular partition that separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities.

The costophrenic angle ( $F$ ) refers to the extreme outermost lower corner of each lung, where the diaphragm meets the ribs.

When positioning for chest radiographs, you should know the relative locations of the uppermost and lowermost parts of the lungs- the apices and the costophrenic angles, respectively-to ensure that these regions are included on every chest radiograph.

Pathology, such as a small amount of fluid collection, would be evident at these costophrenic angles in the erect position.

The hilum (hilus) (G), also known as the root region, is the central area of each lung, where the bronchi, blood vessels, lymph vessels, and nerves enter and leave the lungs.

\section*{Cycle of breathing}

The average respiratory rate is $12-15$ breaths per minute.

Each breath consists of three phases: inspiration, expiration and pause.

The visceral pleura is adherent to the lungs and the parietal pleura to the inner wall of the thorax and to the diaphragm.
Breathing depends upon changes in pressure and volume in the thoracic
cavity. It follows the underlying physical principle that increasing the volume of a container decreases the pressure inside it, and that decreasing the volume of a container increases the pressure inside it.

Since air flows from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure, changing the pressure inside the lungs determines the direction of airflow.

\section*{Inspiration}

Simultaneous contraction of the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm expands the thorax. As the parietal pleura is firmly adhered to the diaphragm and the inside of the ribcage, it is pulled outward along with them.

This pulls the visceral pleura outwards too, since the two pleura are held together by the thin film of pleural fluid. Because
the visceral pleura is firmly adherent to the lung, the lung tissue is, therefore, also pulled up and out with the ribs, and downwards with the diaphragm.

This expands the lungs, and the pressure within the alveoli and in the air passages falls, drawing air into the lungs in an attempt to equalize atmospheric and alveolar air pressures.

The process of inspiration is active, as it needs energy for muscle contraction. The negative pressure created in the thoracic cavity aids venous return to the heart and is known as the respiratory pump.

At rest, inspiration lasts about 2 seconds.

\section*{Expiration}

Relaxation of the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm results in downward and inward movement of the ribcage and elastic recoil of the lungs.

As this occurs, pressure inside the lungs rises and expels air from the respiratory tract. At the end of expiration, the lungs still contain some air, and are prevented from complete collapse by the intact pleura.

This process is passive as it does not require the expenditure of energy.

At rest, expiration lasts about 3 seconds, and after expiration there is a pause before the next cycle begins.

\section*{MUSCULAR SYSTEM}

\section*{Functions of muscles}
i. Movement. Skeletal muscles pull on the bones causing movements at the joints. ...
ii. Support. Muscles of the body wall support the internal organs. ...
iii. Protection. ...
iv. Heat generation. ...
v. Blood circulation.

\section*{Muscle Types}

In the body, there are three types of muscle: skeletal (striated), smooth, and cardiac.
- Skeletal Muscle

Skeletal muscle, attached to bones, is responsible for skeletal movements. The peripheral portion of the central nervous system (CNS) controls the skeletal muscles. Thus, these muscles are under conscious, or voluntary, control. The basic unit is the muscle fiber with many nuclei. These muscle fibers are striated (having transverse streaks) and each acts independently of neighboring muscle fibers.
- Smooth Muscle

Smooth muscle, found in the walls of the hollow internal organs such as blood vessels, the gastrointestinal tract, bladder, and uterus, is under control of the autonomic nervous system. Smooth muscle cannot be controlled consciously and thus acts involuntarily. The non-striated (smooth) muscle cell is spindleshaped and has one central nucleus. Smooth muscle contracts slowly and rhythmically.
- Cardiac Muscle

Cardiac muscle, found in the walls of the heart, is also under control of the autonomic nervous system. The cardiac muscle cell has
one central nucleus, like smooth muscle, but it also is striated, like skeletal muscle. The cardiac muscle cell is rectangular in shape. The contraction of cardiac muscle is involuntary, strong, and rhythmical.

A skeletal muscle may sometimes contain hundreds of thousands of muscle fibres as well as blood vessels and nerves. Throughout the muscle, providing internal structure and scaffolding, is an extensive network of connective tissue.

\section*{Principal skeletal muscles Muscles of the face}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-24.jpg?height=3028&width=2633&top_left_y=5172&top_left_x=5099)

Many muscles are involved in changing facial expression and with movement of the lower jaw during chewing and speaking. Only the main muscles are described here.

\section*{Occipitofrontalis (unpaired)}

This consists of a posterior muscular part over the occipital bone (occipitalis), an anterior part over the frontal bone (frontalis) and an extensive flat tendon or aponeurosis
that stretches over the dome of the skull and joins the two muscular parts. It raises the eyebrows.

\section*{Levator palpebrae superioris}

This muscle extends from the posterior part of the orbital cavity to the upper eyelid. It raises the eyelid.

\section*{Orbicularis oculi}

This muscle surrounds the eye, eyelid and orbital cavity. It closes the eye and when strongly contracted 'screws up' the eyes.

\section*{Buccinator}

This flat muscle of the cheek draws the cheeks in towards the teeth in chewing and in forcible expulsion of air from the mouth ('the trumpeter's muscle').

\section*{Orbicularis oris (unpaired)}

This muscle surrounds the mouth and blends with the muscles of the cheeks. It closes the lips and, when strongly contracted, shapes the mouth for whistling.

\section*{Masseter}

This broad muscle extends from the zygomatic arch to the angle of the jaw. In chewing it draws the mandible up to the maxilla, closing the jaw, exerting considerable pressure on the food.

\section*{Temporalis}

This muscle covers the squamous part of the temporal bone. It passes behind the Muscles of the back
There are six pairs of large muscles in the back, in addition to those forming the posterior abdominal wall. The arrangement of these muscles is the same on each side of the vertebral column.

\section*{Latissimus dorsi}

This arises from the posterior part of the iliac crest and the spinous processes of the lumbar
and lower thoracic vertebrae. It passes upwards across the back then under the arm to be inserted into the bicipital groove of the humerus. It adducts, medially rotates and extends the arm.
zygomatic arch to be inserted into the coronoid process of the mandible. It closes the mouth and assists with chewing.

\section*{Pterygoid}

This muscle extends from the sphenoid bone to the mandible. It closes the mouth and pulls the lower jaw forward.

\section*{Muscles of the neck \\ Sternocleidomastoid}

This muscle arises from the manubrium of the sternum and the clavicle and extends upwards to the mastoid process of the temporal bone. It assists in turning the head from side to side and is also an accessory muscle in respiration. When the muscle on one side contracts it draws the head towards the shoulder. When both contract at the same time they flex the cervical vertebrae or draw the sternum and clavicles upwards when the head is maintained in a fixed position, e.g. in forced respiration.

\section*{Trapezius.}

This muscle covers the shoulder and the back of the neck. The upper attachment is to the occipital protuberance, the medial attachment is to the transverse processes of the cervical and thoracic vertebrae and the lateral attachment is to the clavicle and to the spinous and acromion processes of the scapula. It pulls the head backwards, squares the shoulders and controls the movements of the scapula when the shoulder joint is in use. Muscles of the trunk
These muscles stabilize the association between the appendicular and axial skeletons at the pectoral girdle, and stabilize and allow movement of the shoulders and upper arms.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-26.jpg?height=8218&width=2937&top_left_y=1197&top_left_x=1118)

Teres major.
This originates from the inferior angle of the scapula and is inserted into the humerus just
below the shoulder joint. It extends, adducts and medially rotates the arm.

\section*{Quadratus lumborum.}

This muscle originates from the iliac crest, then it passes upwards, parallel and close to the vertebral column and it is inserted into the 12th rib.

Together the two muscles fix the lower rib during respiration and cause extension of the vertebral column (bending backwards). If one muscle contracts it causes lateral flexion of the lumbar region of the vertebral column.

\section*{Sacrospinalis (erector spinae).}

This is a group of muscles lying between the spinous and transverse processes of the vertebrae. They originate from the sacrum and are finally inserted into the occipital bone. Their contraction causes extension of the vertebral column.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-26.jpg?height=3649&width=3412&top_left_y=5856&top_left_x=4675)

The main function of these paired muscles is to form the strong muscular anterior wall of the abdominal cavity.

When the muscles contract together they:
- compress the abdominal organs
- flex the vertebral column in the lumbar region
Contraction of the muscles on one side only bends the trunk towards that side. Contraction of the oblique muscles on one side rotates the trunk. The anterior abdominal wall is divided longitudinally by a very strong midline tendinous cord, the linea Alba (meaning 'white cord') which extends from the xiphoid process of the sternum to the symphysis pubis.

\section*{Rectus abdominis}

This is the most superficial muscle. It is broad and flat, originating from the transverse part of the pubic bone then passing upwards to be inserted into the lower ribs and the xiphoid process of the sternum. Medially the two muscles are attached to the linea Alba.

\section*{External oblique}

This muscle extends from the lower ribs downwards and forward to be inserted into the iliac crest and, by an aponeurosis, to the linea Alba.

\section*{Internal oblique}

This muscle lies deep to the external oblique. Its fibres arise from the iliac crest and by a broad band of fascia from the spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The fibres pass upwards towards the midline to be inserted into the lower ribs and, by an aponeurosis, into the linea Alba. The fibres are at right angles to those of the external oblique.

\section*{Transverse abdominis.}

This is the deepest muscle of the abdominal wall. The fibres arise from the iliac crest and the lumbar vertebrae and pass across the
abdominal wall to be inserted into the linea Alba by an aponeurosis. The fibres are at right angles to those of the rectus abdominis.

\section*{Muscles of the thorax}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-27.jpg?height=5874&width=3254&top_left_y=2010&top_left_x=4664)

There are 11 pairs of intercostal muscles occupying the spaces between the 12 pairs of ribs. They are arranged in two layers, the external and internal intercostal muscles.

\section*{The external intercostal muscles}

These extend downwards and forwards from the lower border of the rib above to the upper
border of the rib below. They are involved in inspiration.

\section*{The internal intercostal muscles}

These extend downwards and backwards from the lower border of the rib above to the upper border of the rib below, crossing the external intercostal muscle fibres at right angles. The internal intercostals are used when expiration becomes active, as in exercise. The first rib is fixed. Therefore, when the external intercostal muscles contract they pull all the other ribs towards the first rib.

\section*{Diaphragm}

The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscular structure separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities. It forms the floor of the thoracic cavity and the roof of the abdominal cavity and consists of a central tendon from which muscle fibres radiate to be attached to the lower ribs and sternum and to the vertebral column by two crura.
Quiet, restful breathing is sometimes called diaphragmatic breathing because $75 \%$ of the work is done by the diaphragm.

\section*{Muscles of the pelvic floor.}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-28.jpg?height=2328&width=2938&top_left_y=7239&top_left_x=1185)

The pelvic floor is divided into two identical halves that unite along the midline. Each half
consists of fascia and muscle. The muscles are the levator ani and the coccygeus

The pelvic floor supports the organs of the pelvis and maintains continence, i.e. it resists raised intrapelvic pressure during micturition and defaecation.

\section*{Levator ani}

This is a pair of broad flat muscles, forming the anterior part of the pelvic floor. They originate from the inner surface of the true pelvis and unite in the midline. Together they form a sling that supports the pelvic organs.

\section*{Coccygeus}

This is a paired triangular sheet of muscle and tendinous fibres situated behind the levator ani. They originate from the medial surface of the ischium and are inserted into the sacrum and coccyx. They complete the formation of the pelvic floor, which is perforated in the male by the urethra and anus, and in the female by the urethra, vagina and anus.

\section*{Muscles of the shoulder and upper limb}

These muscles stabilise the association between the appendicular and axial skeletons at the pectoral girdle, and stabilise and allow movement of the shoulders and upper arms.

\section*{Deltoid}

These muscle fibres originate from the clavicle, acromion process and spine of scapula and radiate over the shoulder joint to be inserted into the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus. It forms the fleshy and rounded contour of the shoulder and its main function is movement of the arm. The anterior part causes flexion, the middle or main part abduction and the posterior part extends and laterally rotates the shoulder joint.

\section*{Pectoralis major}

This lies on the anterior thoracic wall. The fibres originate from the middle third of the clavicle and from the sternum and are inserted into the lip of the intertubercular groove of the humerus. It draws the arm forward and towards the body, i.e. flexes and adducts.

\section*{Coracobrachialis}

This lies on the upper medial aspect of the arm. It arises from the coracoid process of the scapula, stretches across in front of the shoulder joint and is inserted into the middle third of the humerus. It flexes the shoulder joint.

\section*{Biceps}

This lies on the anterior aspect of the upper arm. At its proximal end it is divided into two parts (heads), each of which has its own tendon. The short head rises from the coracoid process of the scapula and passes in front of the shoulder joint to the arm. The long head originates from the rim of the glenoid cavity and its tendon passes through the joint cavity and the bicipital groove of the humerus to the arm. It is retained in the bicipital groove by a transverse humeral ligament that stretches across the groove. The distal tendon crosses the elbow joint and is inserted into the radial tuberosity. It helps to stabilise and flex the shoulder joint and at the
elbow joint it assists with flexion and supination.

\section*{Brachialis}

This lies on the anterior aspect of the upper arm deep to the biceps. It originates from the shaft of the humerus, extends across the elbow joint and is inserted into the ulna just distal to the joint capsule. It is the main flexor of the elbow joint.

\section*{Triceps}

This lies on the posterior aspect of the humerus. It arises from three heads, one from the scapula and two from the posterior surface of the humerus. The insertion is by a common tendon to the olecranon process of the ulna. It helps to stabilise the shoulder joint, assists in adduction of the arm and extends the elbow joint.

\section*{Brachioradialis}

The brachioradialis spans the elbow joint, originating on the distal end of the humerus and inserts on the lateral epicondyle of the radius. Contraction flexes the elbow joint.

\section*{Pronator quadratus}

This square-shaped muscle is the main muscle causing pronation of the hand and has attachments on the lower sections of both the radius and the ulna.

\section*{Pronator teres}

This lies obliquely across the upper third of the front of the forearm. It arises from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the coronoid process of the ulna and passes obliquely across the forearm to be inserted into the lateral surface of the shaft of the radius. It rotates the radioulnar joints, changing the hand from the anatomical to the writing position, i.e. pronation.

\section*{Supinator}

This lies obliquely across the posterior and lateral aspects of the forearm. Its fibres arise
from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the upper part of the ulna and are inserted into the lateral surface of the upper third of the radius. It rotates the radioulnar joints, often with help from the biceps, changing the hand from the writing to the anatomical position, i.e. supination.

\section*{Flexor carpi radialis}

This lies on the anterior surface of the forearm. It originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and is inserted into the second and third metacarpal bones. It flexes the wrist joint, and when acting with the extensor carpi radialis, abducts the joint.

\section*{Flexor carpi ulnaris}

This lies on the medial aspect of the forearm. It originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the upper parts of the ulna and is inserted into the pisiform, the hamate and the fifth metacarpal bones. It flexes the wrist, and when acting with the extensor carpi ulnaris, adducts the joint.

\section*{Extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis}

These lie on the posterior aspect of the forearm. The fibres originate from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and are inserted by a long tendon into the second and third metacarpal bones. They extend and abduct the wrist.

\section*{Extensor carpi ulnaris}

This lies on the posterior surface of the forearm. It originates from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and is inserted into the fifth metacarpal bone. It extends and adducts the wrist.

\section*{Palmaris longus}

This muscle resists shearing forces that might pull the skin and fascia of the palm away from the underlying structures, and flexes the wrist. Its origin is on the medial epicondyle
of the humerus, and it inserts on tendons on the palm of the hand.

\section*{Extensor digitorum}

This muscle originates on the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and spans both the elbow and wrist joints; in the wrist, it divides into four tendons, one for each finger. Action of this muscle can extend any of the joints across which it passes, i.e. the elbow, wrist or finger joints. Muscles that control finger movements. Large muscles in the forearm that extend to the hand give power to the hand and fingers, but not the delicacy of movement needed for fine and dexterous finger control. Smaller muscles, which originate on the carpal and metacarpal bones, control tiny and precise finger movements via tendinous attachments on the phalanges; muscle fibres do not extend into the fingers.

\section*{Muscles of the hip and lower limb}

The biggest muscles of the body are found here, since their function is largely in weight bearing. The lower parts of the body are designed to transmit the force of body weight in walking, running, etc., evenly throughout weight-bearing structures, and act as shock absorbers.

\section*{Psoas}

This arises from the transverse processes and bodies of the lumbar vertebrae. It passes across the flat part of the ilium and behind the
inguinal ligament to be inserted into the femur. Together with the iliacus it flexes the hip joint.

\section*{Iliacus}

This lies in the iliac fossa of the innominate bone. It originates from the iliac crest, passes over the iliac fossa and joins the tendon of the psoas muscle to be inserted into the lesser trochanter of the femur. The combined action of the iliacus and psoas flexes the hip joint.

\section*{Quadriceps femoris}

This is a group of four muscles lying on the front and sides of the thigh. They are the rectus femoris and three vasti: lateralis, medialis and intermedius. The rectus femoris originates from the ilium and the three vasti from the upper end of the femur. Together they pass over the front of the knee joint to be inserted into the tibia by the patellar tendon. Only the rectus femoris flexes the hip joint. Together, the group acts as a very strong extensor of the knee joint.

\section*{Obturators}

The obturators, deep muscles of the buttock, have their origins in the rim of the obturator foramen of the pelvis and insert into the proximal femur. Their main function lies in lateral rotation at the hip joint.

\section*{Gluteals}

These consist of the gluteus maximus, medius and minimus, which together form the fleshy part of the buttock. They originate from the ilium and sacrum and are inserted into the femur. They cause extension, abduction and medial rotation at the hip joint. Sartorius
This is the longest muscle in the body and crosses both the hip and knee joints. It originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and passes obliquely across the hip joint, thigh and knee joint to be inserted into the medial surface of the upper part of the
tibia. It is associated with flexion and abduction at the hip joint and flexion at the knee.

This forms the bulk of the calf of the leg. It arises by two heads, one from each condyle of the femur, and passes down behind the tibia to be inserted into the calcaneus by the calcanean tendon (Achilles tendon).

\section*{Anterior tibialis}

This originates from the upper end of the tibia, lies on the anterior surface of the leg and is inserted into the middle cuneiform bone by a long tendon. It is associated with dorsiflexion of the foot. Soleus. This is one of the main muscles of the calf of the leg, lying immediately deep to the gastrocnemius. It originates from the heads and upper parts of the fibula and the tibia.

\section*{Soleus}

This is one of the main muscles of the calf of the leg, lying immediately deep to the gastrocnemius. It originates from the heads and upper parts of the fibula and the tibia. Its tendon joins that of the gastrocnemius so that they have a common insertion into the calcaneus by the calcanean (Achilles) tendon.

\section*{JOINTS}

\section*{Arthrology (Joints)}

The study of joints or articulations is called arthrology. It is important to understand that movement does not occur in all joints.

The first two types of joints to be described are immovable joints and only slightly movable joints, which are held together by several fibrous layers, or cartilage.

These joints are adapted for growth rather than for movement.

\section*{Classification of joints}

\section*{Functional}

Joints may be classified according to their function in relation to their mobility or lack of mobility as follows:
- Synarthrosis immovable joint
- Amphiarthrosis joint with limited movement
- Diarthrosis freely movable joint

\section*{Structural}

The primary classification system of joints is a structural classification based on the three types of tissue that separate the ends of bones in the different joints.

These three classifications by tissue type, along with their subclasses, are as follows:

\section*{1. Fibrous}
- Syndesmosis
- Suture
- Gomphosis

\section*{2. Cartilaginous}
- Symphysis
- Synchondrosis

\section*{3. Synovial joints}

\section*{1. Fibrous Joints}

Fibrous joints lack a joint cavity. The adjoining bones, which are nearly in direct contact with each other, are held together by fibrous connective tissue.

Three types of fibrous joints are syndesmoses, which are slightly movable; sutures, which are immovable; and gomphosis, a unique type of joint with only very limited movement

\section*{a. Syndesmoses}

Syndesmoses are fibrous types of articulations that are held together by interosseous ligaments and slender fibrous cords that allow slight movement at these joints. Some earlier references restricted the fibrous Syndesmosis classification to the inferior tibiofibular joint. However, fibroustype connections also may occur in other joints such as the sacroiliac junction with its massive interosseous ligaments that in later life become almost totally fibrous articulations.

The carpal and tarsal joints of the wrist and foot also include interosseous membranes that can be classified as Syndesmosis-type joints that are only slightly movable, or amphiarthrodial.

\section*{b. Sutures}

Sutures are found only between bones in the skull. These bones make contact with one another along interlocking or serrated edges and are held together by layers of fibrous tissue, or sutural ligaments. Movement is
very limited at these articulations; in adults, these are considered immovable, or synarthrodial, joints. Limited expansion- or compression-type movement at these sutures can occur in the infant skull (e.g., during the birthing process). However, by adulthood, active bone deposition partially or completely obliterates these suture lines

\section*{c. Gomphosis}

A gomphosis joint is the third unique type of fibrous joint, in which a conical process is inserted into a socket-like portion of bone. This joint or fibrous union-which, strictly speaking, does not occur between bones but between the roots of the teeth and the alveolar sockets of the mandible and the maxillae-is a specialized type of articulation that allows only very limited movement
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-33.jpg?height=4936&width=3141&top_left_y=5122&top_left_x=1185)
3. Gomphosis-Amphiarthrodial (only limited movement)

\section*{2. Cartilaginous Joints}

Cartilaginous joints also lack a joint cavity, and the articulating bones are held together tightly by cartilage. Similar to fibrous joints, cartilaginous joints allow little or no movement. These joints are synarthrodial or amphiarthrodial and are held together by two types of cartilage-symphyses and synchondroses.

\section*{a. Symphyses}

The essential feature of a symphysis is the presence of a broad, flattened disk of fibrocartilage between two contiguous bony surfaces. These fibrocartilage disks form relatively thick pads that are capable of being compressed or displaced, allowing some movement of these bones, which makes these joints amphiarthrodial (slightly movable). Examples of such symphyses are the intervertebral disks (between bodies of the vertebrae), which are found between the manubrium (upper portion) and body of the sternum, and the symphysis pubis (between the two pubic bones of the pelvis).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-33.jpg?height=2316&width=3164&top_left_y=6387&top_left_x=4664)

\section*{b. Synchondroses}

A typical synchondrosis is a temporary form of joint wherein the connecting hyaline cartilage (which on long bones is called an epiphyseal plate) is converted into bone at adulthood. These temporary types of growth joints are considered synarthrodial or
immovable. Examples of such joints are the epiphyseal plates between the epiphyses and the metaphysis of long bones and at the threepart union of the pelvis, which forms a cupshaped acetabulum for the hip joint.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-34.jpg?height=2475&width=2711&top_left_y=2264&top_left_x=1728)

\section*{3. Synovial}

Joints Synovial joints are freely movable joints, most often found in the upper and lower limbs, which are characterized by a fibrous capsule that contains synovial fluid. The ends of the bones that make up a synovial joint may make contact but are completely separate and contain a joint space or cavity, which allows for a wide range of movement at these joints. Synovial joints are generally diarthrodial, or freely movable. (Exceptions include the sacroiliac joints of the pelvis, which are amphiarthrodial, or slightly movable.) The exposed ends of these bones contain thin protective coverings of articular cartilage. The joint cavity, which contains a viscous lubricating synovial fluid, is enclosed and surrounded by a fibrous capsule that is reinforced by strengthening accessory ligaments. These ligaments limit motion in undesirable directions. The inner surface of this fibrous capsule is thought to secrete the lubricating synovial fluid.

\section*{Movement Types of Synovial Joints}

There are a considerable number and variety of synovial joints, and they are grouped according to the seven types of movement that they permit. These are listed in order from the least to the greatest permitted movement.

The preferred name is listed first, followed by an older term or synonym in parentheses.

\section*{a. Plane (gliding) joints}

This type of synovial joint permits the least movement, which, as the name implies, is a sliding or gliding motion between the articulating surfaces. Examples of plane joints are the intermetacarpal, carpometacarpal, and intercarpal joints of the hand and wrist. The right and left lateral atlantoaxial joints between C1 and C2 vertebrae are also classified as plane, or gliding, joints; they permit some rotational movement between these vertebrae.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-34.jpg?height=2282&width=2915&top_left_y=5986&top_left_x=5093)

\section*{b. Ginglymus (hinge) joints}

The articular surfaces of ginglymi, or ginglymus joints, are molded to each other in such a way that they permit flexion and extension movements only. The articular fibrous capsule on this type of joint is thin on surfaces where bending takes place, but strong collateral ligaments firmly secure the bones at the lateral margins of the fibrous
capsule. Examples of ginglymi include the interphalangeal joints of fingers and toes and the elbow joint.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-35.jpg?height=1842&width=2644&top_left_y=1801&top_left_x=1592)
c. Trochoid (pivot) joints

The trochoid joint is formed by a bony, pivotlike process that is surrounded by a ring of ligaments or a bony structure or both. This type of joint allows rotational movement around a single axis. Examples of trochoid joints are the proximal and distal radioulnar joints of the forearm, which demonstrate this pivot movement during rotation of the hand and wrist. Another example is the joint between the first and second cervical vertebrae. The dens of the axis (C2) forms the pivot, and the anterior arch of the atlas (C1), combined with posterior ligaments, and forms the ring.

\section*{d. Ellipsoid (condylar) joints}

In the ellipsoid joint, movement occurs primarily in one plane and is combined with a slight degree of rotation at an axis at right angles to the primary plane of movement. The rotational movement is limited by associated ligaments and tendons. This type of joint allows primarily four directional movements: flexion and extension and abduction and adduction. Circumduction movement also occurs; this results from cone like sequential movements of flexion, abduction, extension, and adduction. Examples of ellipsoid joints include the metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers, the wrist joint, and the metatarsophalangeal joints of the toes.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-35.jpg?height=3129&width=2904&top_left_y=5438&top_left_x=4941)
e. Sellar (saddle) joints

The term sellar or saddle, describes this joint structure well in that the ends of the bones are shaped concave-convex and are positioned opposite each other. Two saddle-like structures fit into each other. Movements of this biaxial type of sellar joint are the same as for ellipsoidal joints-flexion, extension,
adduction, abduction, and circumduction. The best example of a true sellar joint is the first carpometacarpal joint of the thumb. Other sellar joints include the ankle and the calcaneocuboid joints. Although the ankle joint was classified as a ginglymus in earlier references, current references classify it as a sellar joint.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-36.jpg?height=1805&width=2905&top_left_y=2983&top_left_x=1236)
f. Bicondylar joints

Bicondylar joints usually provide movement in a single direction. They can permit limited rotation. Bicondylar joints are formed by two convex condyles, which may be encased by a fibrous capsule. Two examples of bicondylar joints are the knee (formerly classified as ginglymus) and the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). It must be regarded as consisting of three articulations in one: two condyloid joints, one between each condyle of the femur and the corresponding meniscus and condyle of the tibia; and a third between the patella and the femur, partly arthrodial, but not completely so, since the articular surfaces are not mutually adapted to each other, so that the movement is not a simple gliding one.

g. Spheroidal (ball and socket) joints The spheroidal, or ball and socket, joint allows the greatest freedom of motion. The distal bone that makes up the joint is capable of motion around an almost indefinite number of axes, with one common center. The greater the depth of the socket, the more limited is the movement. However, the deeper joint is stronger and more stable. For example, the hip joint is a much stronger and more stable joint than the shoulder joint, but the range of movement is more limited in the hip. Movements of spheroidal joints include flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, and medial and lateral rotation. Two examples of ball and socket joints are the hip joint and the shoulder joint.

The musculoskeletal system consists of the bones of the skeleton, their joints and the skeletal (voluntary) muscles that move the body.

Although bones are often thought to be static or permanent, they are highly vascular living structures that are continuously being remodeled.

\section*{Functions of bones}
- Providing the body framework
- giving attachment to muscles and tendons
- allowing movement of the body as a whole and of parts of the body, by forming joints that are moved by muscles
- forming the boundaries of the cranial, thoracic and pelvic cavities, and protecting the organs they contain
- haemopoiesis, the production of blood cells in red bone marrow
- mineral storage, especially calcium phosphate - the mineral reservoir within bone is essential for maintenance of blood calcium levels, which must be tightly controlled

\section*{Types of bones}

Bones are classified as long, short, irregular, flat and sesamoid.

\section*{Long bones.}

These consist of a shaft and two extremities. As the name suggests, these bones are longer than they are wide.
Most long bones are found in the limbs; examples include the femur, tibia and fibula.

Short, irregular, flat and sesamoid bones.
These have no shafts or extremities and are diverse in shape and size. Examples include:

\section*{Microscopic structure of bone (composition of bone)}

Bone is a strong and durable type of connective tissue. Its major constituent (65\%) is a mixture of calcium salts, mainly calcium phosphate.

This inorganic matrix gives bone great hardness, but on its own would be brittle and prone to shattering. The remaining third is organic material, called osteoid, which is composed mainly of collagen.

Collagen is very strong and gives bone slight flexibility.

The cellular component of bone contributes less than $2 \%$ of bone mass.

\section*{Bone cells}

There are three types of bone cell
- osteoblast
- osteocyte
- osteoclast.

\section*{Osteoblasts}

These bone-forming cells are responsible for the deposition of both inorganic salts and osteoid in bone tissue.

They are therefore present at sites where bone is growing, repairing or remodeling, e.g.:
- In the deeper layers of periosteum
- in the centers of ossification of immature bone
- at the ends of the diaphysis adjacent to the epiphyseal cartilages of long bones At the site of a fracture.

As they deposit new bone tissue around themselves, they eventually become trapped in tiny pockets (lacunae, in the growing bone, and differentiate into osteocytes.

\section*{Osteocytes}

These are mature bone cells that monitor and maintain bone tissue, and are nourished by tissue fluid in the canaliculi that radiate from the central canals.

\section*{Osteoclasts}

These cells break down bone, releasing calcium and phosphate.

They are very large cells with up to 50 nuclei, which have formed from the fusion of many monocytes.

The continuous remodeling of healthy bone tissue is the result of balanced activity of the bone's osteoblast and osteoclast populations.

Osteoclasts are found in areas of the bone where there is active growth, repair or remodeling, e.g.:
- Under the periosteum, maintaining bone shape during growth and to remove excess callus formed during healing of fractures.
- round the walls of the medullary canal during growth and to canalize callus during healing

Figure 16.3 Microscopic structure of compact bone.

\section*{Compact (cortical) bone}

Compact bone makes up about $80 \%$ of the body bone mass.

It is made up of a large number of parallel tube-shaped units called osteons (Haversian systems), each of which is made up of a central canal surrounded by a series of expanding rings, similar to the growth rings of a tree.

Osteons tend to be aligned the same way that force is applied to the bone, so for example in the femur (thigh bone), they run from one epiphysis to the other.

This gives the bone great strength. The central canal contains nerves, lymphatics and blood vessels, and each central canal is linked with neighboring canals by tunnels running at right angles between them, called perforating canals.

The series of cylindrical plates of bone arranged around each central canal are called lamellae. Between the adjacent lamellae of the osteon are strings of little cavities called lacunae, in each of which sits an osteocyte.
Lacunae communicate with each other through a series of tiny channels called canaliculi, which allows the circulation of interstitial fluid through the bone, and direct contact between the osteocytes, which extend fine processes into them.

Between the osteons are interstitial lamellae, the remnants of older systems partially broken down during remodeling or growth of bone.

\section*{Spongy (cancellous, trabecular) bone.}

To the naked eye, spongy bone looks like a honeycomb. Microscopic examination reveals a framework formed from trabecular (meaning 'little beams'), which consist of a few lamellae and osteocytes interconnected by canaliculi.

Osteocytes are nourished by interstitial fluid diffusing into the bone through the tiny canaliculi. The spaces between the trabecular contain red bone marrow.

In addition, spongy bone is lighter than compact bone, reducing the weight of the skeleton.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-39.jpg?height=2938&width=2915&top_left_y=1185&top_left_x=5071)

Development of bone tissue
Long, short and irregular bones develop in the fetus from rods of cartilage, cartilage models. Flat bones develop from membrane models and sesamoid bones from tendon models.

During ossification, osteoblasts secrete osteoid, which gradually replaces the initial model; then this osteoid is progressively calcified, also by osteoblast action. As the bone grows, the osteoblasts become trapped in the matrix of their own making and become osteocytes.

In mature bone, a fine balance of osteoblast and osteoclast activity maintains normal bone.

\section*{Development of long bones}

In long bones the focal points from which ossification begins are small areas of osteogenic cells, or centres of ossification in the cartilage model.

This is accompanied by development of a bone collar at about 8 weeks of gestation.

Later the blood supply develops and bone tissue replaces cartilage as osteoblasts secrete osteoid in the shaft.

The bone lengthens as ossification continues and spreads to the epiphyses.

Around birth, secondary centres of ossification develop in the epiphyses, and the medullary canal forms when osteoclasts break down the central bone tissue in the middle of the shaft.

During childhood, long bones continue to lengthen because the epiphyseal plate at each end of the bone, which is made of cartilage, continues to produce new cartilage on its diaphyseal surface (the surface facing the shaft of the bone.

This cartilage is then turned to bone. As long as cartilage production matches the rate of ossification, the bone continues to lengthen.

At puberty, under the influence of sex hormones, the epiphyseal plate growth slows down, and is overtaken by bone deposition.

Once the whole epiphyseal plate is turned to bone, no further lengthening of the bone is possible.

\section*{Hormonal regulation of bone growth}

Hormones that regulate the growth, size and shape of bones include the following.

Growth hormone and the thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine, are especially important during infancy and childhood; deficient or excessive secretion of these results in abnormal development of the skeleton.

Testosterone and oestrogen influence the physical changes that occur at puberty and help maintain bone structure throughout life. Rising levels of these hormones are responsible for the growth spurt of puberty, but later stimulate closure of the epiphyseal plates so that bone growth lengthways stops (although bones can grow in thickness throughout life). Average adult male height is usually
greater than female, because male puberty tends to occur at a later age than female puberty, giving a male child's bones longer to keep growing. Oestrogen are responsible for the wider female pelvis that develops during puberty, and for maintaining bone mass in the adult female. Falling oestrogen levels after menopause can put postmenopausal women at higher risk of bone fracture.

Calcitonin and parathyroid hormone control blood levels of calcium by regulating its uptake into and release from bone. Calcitonin increases calcium uptake into bone (reducing blood calcium), and parathormone decreases it (increasing blood calcium)

\section*{Exercise and bone}

Although bone growth lengthways permanently ceases once the epiphyseal plates have ossified, thickening of bone is possible throughout life. This involves the laying down of new osteons at the periphery of the bone through the action of osteoblasts in the inner layer of the periosteum.

Weight-bearing exercise stimulates thickening of bone, strengthening it and making it less liable to fracture.

Lack of exercise reverses these changes, leading to lighter, weaker bones.

\section*{Diet and bone}

Healthy bone tissue requires adequate dietary calcium and vitamins $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$ and D . Calcium, and smaller amounts of other minerals such as phosphate, iron and manganese, is essential for adequate mineralization of bone. Vitamin A is needed for osteoblast activity. Vitamin C is used in collagen synthesis, and vitamin $D$ is required for calcium and phosphate absorption from the intestinal tract.

\section*{Bone markings}

Most bones have rough surfaces, raised protuberances and ridges that give attachment to muscle tendons and ligaments. These are not included in the following descriptions of individual bones unless they are of particular note, but many are marked on illustrations.

\section*{Healing of bone}

There are a number of terms used to classify bone fractures, including:
- Simple: the bone ends do not protrude through the skin
- compound: the bone ends protrude through the skin
- pathological: fracture of a bone weakened by disease

Following a fracture, the broken ends of bone are joined by the deposition of new bone.

This occurs in several stages
1. A hematoma (collection of clotted blood) forms between the ends of bone and in surrounding soft tissues.
2. There follows development of acute inflammation and accumulation of inflammatory exudate, containing macrophages that phagocytose the hematoma and small dead fragments of bone.
(This takes about 5 days). Fibroblasts migrate to the site; granulation tissue and new capillaries develop.
3. New bone forms as large numbers of osteoblasts secrete spongy bone, which unites the broken ends, and is protected by an outer layer of bone and cartilage; the new deposits of bone and cartilage is called a callus. Over the next few weeks, the callus matures,
and the cartilage is gradually replaced with new bone.
4. Reshaping of the bone continues and gradually the medullary canal is reopened through the callus (in weeks or months). In time the bone heals completely with the callus tissue completely replaced with mature compact bone. Often the bone is thicker and stronger at the repair site than originally, and a second fracture is more likely to occur at a different site.

\section*{Healing of fractures}

Tissue fragments between bone ends. Splinters of dead bone (sequestrae) and soft tissue fragments not removed by phagocytosis delay healing.

Deficient blood supply. This delays growth of granulation tissue and new blood vessels. Hypoxia also reduces the number of osteoblasts and increases the number of chondrocytes that develop from their common parent cells.

Poor alignment of bone ends. This may result in the formation of a large and irregular callus that heals slowly and often results in permanent disability.

Continued mobility of bone ends. Continuous movement results in fibrosis of the granulation tissue followed by fibrous union of the fracture. Infection), systemic illness, malnutrition, drugs, e.g. corticosteroids and ageing The bones of the skeleton are divided into two groups:

The axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton.

The axial skeleton consists of the skull, vertebral column, ribs and sternum. Together the bones forming these structures constitute the central bony core of the body, the axis.

The appendicular skeleton consists of the shoulder and pelvic girdles and the limb bones

\section*{Skull}

The skull rests on the upper end of the vertebral column and its bony structure is divided into two parts: the cranium and the face.

\section*{Sinuses}

Sinuses containing air are present in the sphenoid, ethmoid, maxillary and frontal bones. They all communicate with the nasal cavity and are lined with ciliated mucous membrane. They give resonance to the voice and reduce the weight of the skull, making it easier to carry.

\section*{Cranial bones}

The cranium is formed by a number of flat and irregular bones that protect the brain. It has a base upon which the brain rests and a vault that surrounds and covers it. The periosteum lining the inner surface of the skull bones forms the outer layer of Dura mater. In the mature skull the joints (sutures) between the bones are immovable. The bones have numerous perforations (e.g. foramina, fissures) through which nerves, blood and lymph vessels pass.

The bones of the cranium are:
- 1 frontal bone
- 2 parietal bones
- 2 temporal bones
- 1 occipital bone
- 1 sphenoid bone
- ethmoid bone.

\section*{Frontal bone}

This is the bone of the forehead. It forms part of the orbital cavities (eye sockets) and the prominent ridges above the eyes, the supraorbital margins.

Just above the supraorbital margins, within the bone, are two air-filled cavities or sinuses lined with ciliated mucous membrane, which open into the nasal cavity.

The coronal suture joins the frontal and parietal bones and other sutures are formed with the sphenoid, zygomatic, lacrimal, nasal and ethmoid bones.

The frontal bone originates in two parts joined in the midline by the frontal suture.

\section*{Parietal bones}

These bones form the sides and roof of the skull. They articulate with each other at the sagittal suture, with the frontal bone at the coronal suture, with the occipital bone at the lambdoidal suture and with the temporal bones at the squamous sutures. The inner surface is concave and is grooved to accommodate the brain and blood vessels.

\section*{Temporal bones}

These bones lie one on each side of the head and form sutures with the parietal, occipital, sphenoid and zygomatic bones. The squamous part is the thin fan-shaped area that articulates with the parietal bone. The zygomatic process articulates with the zygomatic bone to form the zygomatic arch (cheekbone). The mastoid part contains the mastoid process, a thickened region easily felt behind the ear. It contains a large number of very small air sinuses
that communicate with the middle ear and are lined with squamous epithelium. The petrous portion forms part of the base of the skull and contains the organs of hearing (the spiral organ) and balance. The temporal bone articulates with the mandible at the temporomandibular joint, the only movable joint of the skull. Immediately behind this articulating surface is the external acoustic meatus (auditory canal), which passes inwards towards the petrous portion of the bone. The styloid process projects from the lower process of the temporal bone, and supports the hyoid bone and muscles associated with the tongue and pharynx.

\section*{Occipital bone}

This bone forms the back of the head and part of the base of the skull. It forms sutures with the parietal, temporal and sphenoid bones. Its inner surface is deeply concave and the concavity is occupied by the occipital lobes of the cerebrum and by the cerebellum. The occiput has two articular condyles that form condyloid joints with the first bone of the vertebral column, the atlas. This joint permits nodding movements of the head. Between the condyles is the foramen magnum (meaning 'large hole') through which the spinal cord passes into the cranial cavity.

\section*{Sphenoid bone}

This bone occupies the middle portion of the base of the skull and it articulates with the occipital, temporal, parietal and frontal bones. It links the cranial and facial bones, and crossbraces the skull. On the superior surface in the middle of the bone is a little saddle-shaped depression, the hypophyseal fossa (sella turcica) in which the pituitary gland rests. The body of the bone contains some fairly large air sinuses lined with ciliated mucous membrane with
openings into the nasal cavity. The optic nerves pass through the optic foramina on their way to the brain.

\section*{Ethmoid bone}

The Ethmoid bone occupies the anterior part of the base of the skull and helps to form the orbital cavity, the nasal septum and the lateral walls of the nasal cavity. On each side are two projections into the nasal cavity, the superior and middle conchae or turbinated processes. It is a very delicate bone containing many air sinuses lined with ciliated epithelium and with openings into the nasal cavity. The horizontal flattened part, the cribriform plate, forms the roof of the nasal cavity and has numerous small foramina through which nerve fibres of the olfactory nerve (sense of smell) pass upwards from the nasal cavity to the brain.

\section*{Infant Cranium}

The calvarium (skullcap) on an infant is very large in proportion to the rest of the body, but the facial bones are quite small.

Ossification of the individual cranial bones is incomplete at birth, and the sutures are membrane-covered spaces that fill in soon after birth. However, certain regions where sutures join are slower in their ossification, and these are called fontanels.

The cranial sutures themselves generally do not ossify completely until an individual is in his or her mid-to-late 20 s , and some may not completely close until the fifth decade of life.

\section*{Fontanels}

Early in life, the bregma and the lambda are not bony but are membrane-covered openings or "soft spots." These soft spots are termed the anterior and posterior fontanels in an infant.

The anterior fontanel is the largest and at birth measures about 2.5 cm wide and 4 cm long.

It does not completely close until about 18 months of age.

Two smaller lateral fontanels that close soon after birth are the sphenoid (pterion in an adult) and mastoid (asterion in an adult) fontanels, which are located at the sphenoid and mastoid angles of the parietal bones on each side of the head.

Six fontanels occur in an infant as follows:
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{ Infant } & adult \\
Anterior fontanel & Bregma \\
Posterior fontanel & Lambda \\
Right sphenoid fontanel & Right pterion \\
Left sphenoid fontanel & Left pterion \\
Right mastoid fontanel & Right asterion \\
Left mastoid fontanel & Left asterion
\end{tabular}

Fig. 11-20 Infant cranial sutures and fontanels.

Sutural, or Wormian, Bones

Certain small, irregular bones called sutural, or wormian, bones sometimes develop in adult skull sutures. These isolated bones most often are found in the lambdoidal suture but occasionally also are found in the region of the fontanels, especially the posterior fontanel. In the adult skull, these are completely ossified and are visible only by the sutural lines around their borders

\section*{Facial bones}

The skeleton of the face is formed by 13 bones.
- 2 zygomatic (cheek) bones
- 1 maxilla
- 2 nasal bones
- 2 lacrimal bones
- 1 vomer
- 2 palatine bones
- 2 inferior conchae
- 1 mandible.

\section*{Zygomatic (cheek) bones}

The zygomatic bone originates as two bones that fuse before birth. They form the prominences of the cheeks and part of the floor and lateral walls of the orbital cavities.

\section*{Maxilla (upper jaw bone)}

This originates as two bones that fuse before birth. The maxilla forms the upper jaw, the anterior part of the roof of the mouth, the lateral walls of the nasal cavity and part of the floor of the orbital cavities. The alveolar ridge, or process, projects downwards and carries the upper teeth. On each side is a large air sinus, the maxillary sinus, lined with ciliated mucous membrane and with openings into the nasal cavity.

\section*{Nasal bones}

These are two small flat bones that form the greater part of the lateral and superior surfaces of the bridge of the nose.

\section*{Lacrimal bones}

These two small bones are posterior and lateral to the nasal bones and form part of the medial walls of the orbital cavities. Each is pierced by a foramen for the passage of the nasolacrimal duct that carries the tears from the medial canthus of the eye to the nasal cavity.

\section*{Vomer}

The vomer is a thin flat bone that extends upwards from the middle of the hard palate to form most of the inferior part of the nasal septum. Superiorly it articulates with the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone.

\section*{Palatine bones}

These are two small L-shaped bones. The horizontal parts unite to form the posterior part of the hard palate and the perpendicular parts project upwards to form part of the lateral walls of the nasal cavity. At their upper extremities they form part of the orbital cavities.

\section*{Nasal conchae}

Each concha is a scroll-shaped bone, which forms part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and projects into it below the middle concha. The superior and middle conchae are parts of the ethmoid bone. The conchae collectively increase the surface area in the nasal cavity, allowing inspired air to be warmed and humidified more effectively.

\section*{Mandible (lower jaw bone}

This is the lower jaw, the only movable bone of the skull. It originates as two parts that unite at the midline. Each half consists of two main parts: a curved body with the alveolar ridge containing the lower teeth and a ramus, which projects upwards almost at right angles to the posterior end of the body. At the upper end the ramus divides into the condylar process which articulates with the temporal bone to form the temporomandibular joint and the coronoid process, which gives attachment to muscles and ligaments that close the jaw. The point where the ramus joins the body is the angle of the jaw.

\section*{Hyoid bone}

This is an isolated horseshoe-shaped bone lying in the soft tissues of the neck just above the larynx and below the mandible. It does not articulate with any other bone, but is attached to the styloid process of the temporal bone by ligaments. It supports the larynx and gives attachment to the base of the tongue.

\section*{Fontanelles of the skull}

At birth, ossification of the cranial sutures is incomplete. The skull bones do not fuse earlier to allow for molding of the baby's head during childbirth. Where three or more bones meet there are distinct membranous areas, or fontanelles. The two largest are the anterior fontanelle, not fully ossified until the child is between 12 and 18 months old, and the posterior fontanelle, usually ossified 2-3 months after birth.

\section*{Functions of the skull}

The various parts of the skull have specific and different functions:
The cranium protects the brain
The bony eye sockets protect the eyes and give attachment to the muscles that move them
The temporal bone protects the delicate structures of the inner ear
The sinuses in some face and skull bones give resonance to the voice
The bones of the face form the walls of the posterior part of the nasal cavities and form the upper part of the air passages
The maxilla and the mandible provide alveolar ridges in which the teeth are embedded

The mandible, controlled by muscles of the lower face, allows chewing.

\section*{Vertebral column}

There are 26 bones in the vertebral column. Twenty-four separate vertebrae extend downwards from the occipital bone of the skull; then there is the sacrum, formed from five fused vertebrae, and lastly the coccyx, or tail, which is formed from between three and five small fused vertebrae.

The vertebral column is divided into different regions.
The first seven vertebrae, in the neck, form the cervical spine; the next twelve vertebrae are the thoracic spine, and the next five the lumbar
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_14_fd878e6ae66fdaf94465g-46.jpg?height=5287&width=2892&top_left_y=1027&top_left_x=5003)

Figure 16.19 The vertebral column. Lateral view.
spine, the lowest vertebra of which articulates with the sacrum.
Each vertebra is identified by the first letter of its region in the spine, followed by a number indicating its position.

For example, the topmost vertebra is C1, and the third lumbar vertebra is L3. The movable vertebrae have many characteristics in common, but some groups have distinguishing features.

\section*{Features of vertebra}

Projecting from the regions where the pedicle meets the lamina is a lateral prominence, the transverse process, and where the two laminae meet at the back is a process called the spinous process.

These bony prominences can be felt through the skin along the length of the spine.

The vertebral arch has four articular surfaces: two articulate with the vertebra above and two with the one below.
The vertebral foramina form the vertebral (neural) canal that contains the spinal cord.

\section*{Region-specific vertebral characteristics}

\section*{Cervical vertebrae}

These are the smallest vertebrae. The transverse processes have a foramen through which a vertebral artery passes upwards to the brain.

The first two cervical vertebrae, the atlas and the axis, are atypical.

The first cervical vertebra (C1), the atlas, is the bone on which the skull rests. Below the atlas is the axis, the second cervical vertebra (C2).

The atlas is essentially a ring of bone, with no distinct body or spinous process, although it has two short transverse processes.

It possesses two flattened facets that articulate with the occipital bone; these are condyloid joints and they permit nodding of the head.

The axis sits below the atlas, and has a small body with a small superior projection called the odontoid process (also called the dens, meaning tooth). This occupies part of the posterior foramen of the atlas above, and is held securely within it by the transverse ligament. The head pivots (i.e. turns from side to side) on this joint. The 7th cervical vertebra, C7, is also known as the vertebra prominence.

It possesses a long spinous prominence terminating in a swollen tubercle, which is easily felt at the base of the neck.

\section*{Thoracic vertebrae}

The 12 thoracic vertebrae are larger than the cervical vertebrae because this section of the vertebral column has to support more body weight.

The bodies and transverse processes have facets for articulation with the ribs.

\section*{Lumbar vertebrae}

These are the largest of the vertebrae because they have to support the weight of the upper body.

These are the largest of the vertebrae because they have to support the weight of the upper body.

\section*{Sacrum}

This consists of five rudimentary vertebrae fused to form a triangular or wedge shaped bone with a concave anterior surface.

The upper part, or base, articulates with the 5th lumbar vertebra. On each side it articulates with the ilium to form a sacroiliac joint, and at its inferior tip it articulates with the coccyx.

The anterior edge of the base, the promontory, protrudes into the pelvic cavity.

The vertebral foramina are present, and on each side of the bone there is a series of foramina for the passage of nerves.

\section*{Coccyx}

This consists of the four terminal vertebrae fused to form a very small triangular bone, the broad base of which articulates with the tip of the sacrum.

\section*{Curves of the vertebral column}

When viewed from the side, the vertebral column presents four curves: two primary and two secondary.

The fetus in the uterus lies curled up so that the head and the knees are more or less touching.

This position shows the primary curvature. The secondary cervical curve develops when the child can hold up their head (after about 3 months) and the secondary lumbar curve develops when able to stand (after 12-15 months). The thoracic and sacral primary curves are retained.

Movement of the vertebral column Movement between the individual bones of the vertebral column is very limited. However, the movements of the column as a whole are quite extensive and include flexion (bending forward), extension (bending backward), lateral flexion (bending to the side) and rotation. There is more movement in the cervical and lumbar regions than elsewhere.

Functions of the vertebral column
Collectively the vertebral foramina form the vertebral canal, which provides a strong bony protection for the delicate spinal cord lying within it

The pedicles of adjacent vertebrae form intervertebral foramina, one on each side, providing access to the spinal cord for spinal nerves, blood vessels and lymph vessels

The numerous individual bones with their intervertebral discs allow movement of the whole column
Support of the skull
The intervertebral discs act as shock absorbers, protecting the brain
Formation of the axis of the trunk, giving attachment to the ribs, shoulder girdle and upper limbs, and the pelvic girdle and lower limbs.

\section*{Thoracic cage}

The thorax (thoracic cage) is formed by the sternum anteriorly, twelve pairs of ribs forming the lateral bony cages, and the twelve thoracic vertebrae.

\section*{Sternum (breast bone)}

This flat bone can be felt just under the skin in the middle of the front of the chest. The manubrium is the uppermost section and articulates with the clavicles at the sternoclavicular joints and with the first two pairs of ribs. The body or middle portion gives attachment to the ribs.

The xiphoid process is the inferior tip of the bone. It gives attachment to the diaphragm, muscles of the anterior column.

Anteriorly, the first seven pairs of ribs articulate directly with the sternum and are known as the true ribs. The next three pairs articulate only indirectly.

In both cases, costal cartilages attach the ribs to the sternum. The lowest two pairs of ribs, referred to as floating ribs, do not join the sternum at all, their anterior tips being free.

Each rib forms up to three joints with the vertebral column. Two of these joints are formed between facets on the head of the rib and facets on the bodies of two vertebrae, the one above the rib and the one below. Ten of the ribs also form joints between the tubercle of the rib and the transverse process of (usually) the lower vertebra. The inferior surface of the rib is deeply grooved, providing a channel along which intercostal nerves and blood vessels run. Between each rib and the one below are the intercostal muscles, which move the rib cage during breathing. Because of the arrangement of the ribs, and the quantity of cartilage

Appendicular skeleton The appendicular skeleton consists of the:

Shoulder girdle with the upper limbs Pelvic girdle with the lower limbs

\section*{Shoulder girdle and upper limb}

The upper limb forms a joint with the trunk via the shoulder (pectoral) girdle. Shoulder girdle

Consists of two clavicles and scapulae.
Clavicle (collar bone)
Clavicle is an S-shaped long bone. It articulates with the manubrium of the sternum at the sternoclavicular joint and forms the acromioclavicular joint with the acromion process of the scapula. The clavicle provides the only bony link between the upper limb and the axial skeleton.

\section*{Scapula (shoulder blade)}

The scapula is a flat triangular-shaped bone, lying on the posterior chest wall superficial to the ribs and separated from them by muscles.

At the lateral angle is a shallow articular surface, the glenoid cavity, which, with the head of the humerus, forms the shoulder joint. On the posterior surface runs a rough ridge called the spine, which extends beyond the lateral border of the scapula and overhangs the glenoid cavity.

The prominent overhang, which can be felt through the skin as the highest point of the shoulder, is called the acromion process and forms a joint with the clavicle, the acromioclavicular joint, a slightly movable synovial joint that contributes to the mobility of the shoulder girdle.

The coracoid process, a projection from the upper border of the bone, gives attachment to muscles that move the shoulder joint.

\section*{The upper limb}

\section*{Humerus}

This is the bone of the upper arm. The head sits within the glenoid cavity of the scapula, forming the shoulder joint. Distal to the head are two roughened projections of bone, the greater and lesser tubercles, and between them there is a deep groove, the bicipital groove or intertubercular synovial joint that contributes to the mobility of the shoulder girdle

\section*{Ulna and radius}

These are the two bones of the forearm. The ulna is longer than and medial to the radius and when the arm is in the anatomical position, i.e. with the palm of the hand facing forward, the two bones are parallel. They articulate with the humerus at the elbow joint, the carpal bones at the wrist joint and with each other at the proximal and distal radioulnar joints. In addition, an interosseous membrane, a fibrous joint, connects the bones along their shafts, stabilizing their association and maintaining their relative positions despite forces applied from the elbow or wrist.

\section*{Carpal (wrist) bones}

These bones are closely fitted together and held in position by ligaments that allow a limited amount of movement between them. The bones of the proximal row are associated with the wrist joint and those of the distal row form joints with the metacarpal bones. Tendons of muscles lying in the forearm cross the wrist and are held close to the bones by strong fibrous bands, called retinacula.

\section*{Metacarpal bones (bones of the hand)}

These five bones form the palm of the hand. They are numbered from the thumb side inwards. The proximal ends articulate with
the carpal bones and the distal ends with the phalanges.

\section*{Phalanges (finger bones)}

There are 14 phalanges, three in each finger and two in the thumb. They articulate with the metacarpal bones and with each other, by hinge joints.

\section*{Pelvic girdle and lower limb}

\section*{True and false pelvis}

The lower limb forms a joint with the trunk at the pelvic girdle

\section*{The pelvic girdle}

The pelvic girdle is formed from two innominate (hip) bones. The pelvis is the pelvis term given to the basin-shaped structure formed by the pelvic girdle and its associated sacrum.

\section*{Innominate (hip) bones}

Each hip bone consists of three fused bones: the ilium, ischium and pubis.

On its lateral surface is a deep depression, the acetabulum, which forms the hip joint with the almost-spherical head of femur. The ilium is the upper flattened part of the bone and it presents the iliac crest, the anterior curve of which is called the anterior superior iliac spine. The ilium forms a synovial joint with the sacrum, the sacroiliac joint, a strong joint capable of absorbing the stresses of weight bearing and which tends to become fibrosed in later life. The pubis is the anterior part of the bone and it articulates with the pubis of the other hip bone at a cartilaginous joint, the symphysis pubis. The ischium is the inferior and posterior part. The rough inferior projections of the ischia, the ischial tuberosities, bear the weight of the body when seated. The union of the three parts iliopectineal lines of the innominate bones. The greater or false pelvis is above the brim and the lesser or true pelvis is below.

\section*{Differences between male and female pelvis}

The shape of the female pelvis allows for the passage of the baby during childbirth. In comparison with the male pelvis, the female pelvis has lighter bones, is more shallow and rounded and is generally roomier.

\section*{The lower limb Femur (thigh bone)}

The femur is the longest and heaviest bone of the body. The head is almost spherical and fits into the acetabulum of the hip bone to form the hip joint. The neck extends outwards and slightly downwards from the head to the shaft and most of it is within the capsule of the hip joint. The posterior surface of the lower third forms a flat triangular area called the popliteal surface. The distal extremity has two articular condyles, which, with the tibia and patella, form the knee joint. The femur transmits the weight of the body through the bones below the knee to the foot.

\section*{Tibia (shin bone)}

The tibia is the medial of the two bones of the lower leg. The proximal extremity is broad and flat and presents two condyles for articulation with the femur at the knee joint. The head of the fibula articulates with the inferior aspect of the lateral condyle, forming the proximal tibiofibular joint. The distal extremity of the tibia forms the ankle joint with the talus and the fibula. The medial malleolus is a downward projection of bone medial to the ankle joint.

\section*{Fibula}

The fibula is the long slender lateral bone in the leg. The head or upper extremity articulates with the lateral condyle of the tibia, forming the proximal tibiofibular joint, and the lower extremity articulates with the tibia, and projects beyond it to form the lateral malleolus. This helps to stabilize the ankle joint.

\section*{Patella (knee cap)}

This is a roughly triangular-shaped sesamoid bone associated with the knee joint. Its posterior surface articulates with the patellar surface of the femur in the knee joint and its anterior surface is in the patellar tendon, i.e. the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle.

\section*{Tarsal (ankle) bones}

The seven tarsal bones forming the posterior part of the foot (ankle) are the talus, calcaneus, navicular, cuboid and three cuneiform bones. The talus articulates with the tibia and fibula at the ankle joint. The calcaneus forms the heel of the foot. The other bones articulate with each other and with the metatarsal bones.

\section*{Metatarsals (bones of the foot)}

These are five bones, numbered from inside out, which form the greater part of the dorsum (sole) of the foot. At their proximal ends they articulate with the tarsal bones and at their distal ends, with the phalanges. The enlarged distal head of the 1st metatarsal bone forms the 'ball' of the foot.

\section*{Phalanges (toe bones,)}

There are $\mathbf{1 4}$ phalanges arranged in a similar manner to those in the fingers, i.e. two in the great

\section*{Arches of the foot}

The arrangement of bones in the foot, supported by associated ligaments and action of associated muscles, gives the sole of the foot an arched or curved shape.

The curve running from heel to toe is called the longitudinal arch, and the curve running across the foot is called the transverse arch.

In the normal longitudinal arch, only the calcaneus and the distal ends of the metatarsals should touch the ground, the bones in between being lifted clear. This gives the conventional footprint shape.

If, however, the concavity of the sole is lost because of sagging ligaments or tendons, the arch sinks and much more of the sole of the foot is in contact with the ground: this is called flat foot.

Because the arches of the foot are important in distributing the weight of the body evenly whilst upright, whether stationary or moving, the flat foot loses the springiness of normal foot structure and leads to sore feet when standing, walking or running for long periods. As there are movable joints between all the bones of the foot, very strong muscles and ligaments are necessary to maintain the strength, resilience and stability of the foot during walking, running and jumping.
