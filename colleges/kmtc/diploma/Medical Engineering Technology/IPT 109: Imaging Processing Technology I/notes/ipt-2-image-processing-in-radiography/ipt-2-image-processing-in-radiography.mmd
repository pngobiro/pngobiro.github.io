The x-ray exposure necessary to produce a radiograph of satisfactory diagnostic quality, commensurate with minimum exposure to the patient, depends not only on the exposure technique and film-screen combination employed but also on the handling and processing of the film. These require a good darkroom and proper developing techniques.

\section*{THE DARKROOM}

Most modern x-ray departments use automatic film processors for film development. Nevertheless, good darkrooms are still an essential requirement whether they are used for manual processing of films or for loading automatic film processors. While specific details may vary from installation to installation, all darkrooms should include certain basic features:
1. DARKROOMS © contain film processors, a loading bench, a film bin for storage of unexposed radiographic film, a film ID printer, safelights, and a pass box in the wall which allows transfer of film/cassettes to and from the darkroom, while ensuring no light is admitted to the darkroom.
2. The room must be completely light-tight.
3. If adjacent to a radiography room, the darkroom must be adequately shielded to ensure that exposure of personnel and film to x-radiation does not occur.
4. The darkroom should be designed to incorporate a lockable door, double doors, or a blackened maze entrance to ensure light tightness when undeveloped films are being handled.
5. A warning light should be located outside the darkroom, at the entrance, to indicate when the room is in use.
6. Safelights fitted with bulbs or correct intensity (7-15 WATTS) above the work areas, within the darkroom. The safelights must have filters appropriate to the specifications of the film used and must be positioned at the proper distances from work areas.
7. SAFELIGHTS - Should be located at least 3 feet from the counters to prevent safelight fogging of exposed, unprocessed film.
8. Walls of the darkroom are painted a light color to help reflect the safelights.
9. Ample ventilation is required because of the presence of chemical fumes.

\section*{SAFELIGHTS}

Kodak 6B filters are dark orange in color and are used for blue-sensitive film. This film is no longer in use. GBX filters are a deep cherry red color and are safe to use with green sensitive film. Safelights are only safe for a limited amount of time, and must contain the correct wattage bulbs, filters, and be located at least 3 feet from the worktable to not fog the undeveloped film.

\section*{FILM HANDLING}

Films must be handled with clean, dry hands, and touched only at the corners. Dirt or chemical residue on hands can cause unwanted marks on the film or may stain the intensifying screens on the cassettes.

Mishandling of the unprocessed film can cause unwanted marks called ARTIFACTS. Film artifacts may be caused by cassette damage, dirty screens, careless handling, improper storage, or problems within the automatic processor. A sharp bending of the film can cause crescent or $=$ crinkle marks. Common film handling artifacts include creases, finger marks and scratches. If the humidity in the darkroom is too low $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ static electricity can occur $\boldsymbol{\bullet}$ causing a crown static or tree static marks on the films. If films are improperly stacked, smudge static will occur. Cassettes should be reloaded as soon as possible after unloading, to prevent dirt

from getting into the cassette. Cassettes that have been exposed to radiation must be kept separate from cassettes loaded with unexposed film to avoid the possibility of accidentally reusing an exposed cassette $\theta$ creating a increasing the radiation dose to the patient by having to repeat the image).

\section*{FILM PROCESING}

Automatic film processors are very simple to use. The film is unloaded from the cassette and placed on the feed tray. The guide shoes then Fullitit the film into the processor though a system of rollers to begin the development. Once the entire film has passed beyond the intake rollers, and so no longer visible on the feed tray, a tone or red light (or both) will signal that it is safe to feed the next film into the processor, or it is safe to turn on the lights. Feeding another film before the signal will result in an overlap of films, possibly ruining the quality of processing for both films, and may also cause a jam within the processor. Turning on the white light (or opening the door) before the signal may cause the trailing edge of film on the feed tray to become fogged. The finished film will drop into the receiving bin from 90 second to 3 minutes from the time it entered the processor.

The purpose of film processing is to change the silver halide crystals contained in the film emulsion (once exposed to x-ray or light photons) to black metallic silver. The LATENT image is then developed into a MANIFEST image.

Improper or careless processing of exposed radiographic films can cause films of poor diagnostic achieve full development of a film which has been exposed, using correct radiographic technique factors, the film must be processed in chemically fresh developer, at proper temperature and for sufficient time to ensure that the silver in the exposed silver halide crystals, in the film emulsion is completely reduced. If this is not done, the blackening of the film will not be optimum and the tendency will be to increase radiation exposure to achieve proper image density. To ensure proper processing of films, certain basic recommendations should be followed:
1. Manufacturer $\quad$ s recommendations with respect to strength of chemical solutions, temperature and time must be followed to ensure optimum development.
2. Developing solutions should be replenished as necessary and should be changed regularly, as required.
3. Developing solutions should be monitored regularly. Even unused developer deteriorates with time. Developer should not be used when I becomes necessary to develop significantly longer than the recommended times in order to obtain optimum film density.

\section*{DARKROOM FOG:}

May be caused from unsafe safelights, white light leaks, excessive developer time, strength or temperature which will result in a decrease of radiographic contrast, and an unwanted increase in radiographic density.

\section*{FILM STORAGE}

Unexposed radiographic films must be stored in such a manner that they are shielded from stray radiation (or light). Storage should be provided such that no film receives more than 0.2 milliroentgen of stray radiation before use. Films should be stored on end in a cool, dry area.

\section*{AUTOMATIC FILM PROCESSING}

Film emulsion consists of silver bromide (halide) crystals suspended in gelatin. The development process transforms the latent image to a manifest (visible) black metallic silver image.

Automatic film processing is carried out by a machine that transports the x-ray film through the necessary chemical solution, at the same time providing agitation, temperature regulation, and chemical replenishment. Within the processor are the developer, fixer, and wash tanks, followed by the dyer.

Rapid processing is accomplished by the use of increased solution temperatures, which requires that a hardener be added to the developer to control excessive emulsion swelling.

Each of the processor systems accomplishes specific functions; a basic understanding of these systems is required so that the processor can be used correctly and efficiently. A properly maintained and monitored processor will ensure consistent radiographs that will retain their quality images over a long period of time (archival quality).

\section*{A. CHEMISTRY OVERVIEW}
1. Developer © The developer functions to convert the lantent (invisible) image into the manifest (visible) silver image by reducing the exposed silver bromide crystals to black metallic silver. Important factors affecting the development process are time (length of development), temperature (of the developer solution), and solution activity (strength, concentration).

The developer solution has an alkaline nature for optimal function of the reducing agents. Sodium or potassium carbonate provides the necessary alkalinity and serves as an activator (or accelerator) by swelling the gelatin emulsion so that the reducing agents are better able to penetrate the emulsion and reach the exposed silver bromide crystals.

The reducing agents are hydroquinone, which works slowly to build up blacks in the film areas of greater exposure, and phenidone, which quickly produces the gray tones in areas of lesser exposure. With respect to sensitometry, hydroquinone controls the shoulder (Dmax) of the characteristic curve, and phenidone controls the toe (Dmin) area.

The developer solution has an alkaline nature for optimal function of the reducing agents. Sodium or potassium carbonate provides the necessary alkalinity and serves as an activator (or accelerator) by swelling the gelatin emulsion so that the reducing agents are better able to penetrate the emulsion and reach the exposed silver bromide crystals.

The reducing agents are hydroquinone, which works slowly to build up blacks in the film areas of greater exposure, and phenidone, which quickly produces the gray tones in areas of lesser exposure. With respect to sensitometry, hydroquinone controls the shoulder (Dmax) of the characteristic curve, and phenidone controls the toe (Dmin) area.

The developer solution, particularly the hydroquinone, is especially sensitive to oxygen. If the developer oxidizes, it becomes weaker and less effective. The preservative, sodium sulfite, or cycon, is added to the developer to prevent its rapid oxidation. A hood always covers the developer tank and replenisher solution. The solvent for the concentrated chemicals is water, used to dilute the concentrate to the proper strength.

Rapid processing is achieved through the use of high temperatures that accelerate the development process; however, high temperatures can cause excessive emulsion swelling. Since excessive swelling can result in roller transportation problems a hardener, traditionally Glutaraldehyde, is added to the developer to control the amount of emulsion swelling.

A restrainer, or antifog agent, is added to the developer to limit its activity to only the exposed silver crystals. The typical restrainer is potassium bromide. Without the restrainer, the developing agents would attack the unexposed crystals, creating chemical fog. Potassium bromide is frequently referred to as ${ }^{[ }$starter solution because it is added only to fresh, new developer. As films are developed, bromine ions are released from the emulsion into solution; thus, potassium bromide is not found in replenisher solution.

\section*{DARKROOM\& PROCESSING RTEC A}
2. Fixer - The function of the fixer (hypo) is to clear the film of the unexposed, undeveloped silver bromide crystals. This process serves to protect the film from further exposure. The fixing or clearing agent is ammonium Thiosulfate.

The fixer is an acidic solution that functions to neutralize any residual developer carried over and provide the required acid medium for the hardener. Acetic acid provides the required acidic medium.

The fixer contains a hardener whose function it is to shrink and re-harden the gelatin emulsion, thus protectin it from abrasion and promoting archival quality. The most commonly used hardeners are potassium alum or aluminum chloride. Fixer preservative sis the same as that found in the developer, ie, sodium sulfite.
3. Wash © The function of the wash is to ride the film of residual chemicals. Should chemicals remain in the emulsion (eg, as a result of defective wash cycle), the film will discolor with age. Since radiographic records are kept for a number of years, it is important that they have sufficient archival quality.

Cold water processors are, in general, less efficient in removing chemicals than warm water processors. Agitation during the wash process and large quantities of water help to rid the emulsion of chemical residue.

\section*{Summary}

- The development process is greatly affected by development time and solution temperature and activity.
- Sodium or potassium carbonate provides the necessary alkalinity and functions as the solution activator by swelling the gelatin emulsion.
- Reducing agents are phenidone and hydroquinone.
- Sodium sulfite or cycon preserves the developer solution from excessive oxidation.
- Glutaraldehyde is a hardener, added to developer solution to control excessive swelling.
- Potassium bromide serves as an antifog agent and restrains the developer from attacking the unexposed silver bromide crystals.
- Potassium bromide is starter solution, and is not required in the replenisher solution.
- The fixing or clearing agent (ammonium thiosulfate) removes unexposed silver bromide crystals from the emulsion, preventing further exposure.
- Acetic acid provides the necessary acid medium for the fixer solution.
- Potassium alum or aluminum chloride serves to harden the film emulsion.
- The fixer preservative is sodium sulfite.
- Adequate washing of residual chemicals from the film emulsion is essential for good archival quality.

\section*{B. TRANSPORT SYSTEM}

The transport system functions to convey the film through the different processor sections by means of a series of rollers driven by gears, chains, and sprockets. This is accomplished without damage to the film and at a prescribed speed, which determines the length of time films spends in each solution. The roller system also provides constant, vigorous agitation of the solution at the film surface. The entire conveyance system consists of the feed tray, crossover rollers, deep racks, turnaround assemblies, and receiving bin.

Film is aligned against one side of the feed tray as it is introduced into the processor. A sensor initiates solution replenishment as the film enters, and replenishment continues as the length of the film passes the sensor. Films should be fed into the processor along their short edge; feeding the film in the =long way wit leads to over-replenishment and increased radiographic density.

Crossover racks are out of solution and bridge the gaps between developer and fixer, fixer and wash, and wash and dry sections of the processor. Crossover rollers must be kept free of crystallized solution that can cause film artifacts as the soft emulsion passes by. The last set of rollers in each solution section has a squeegee action on film emulsion, thus removing excess solution before film enters the next tank.

When the processor is not in use for a period of time, it is advisable to leave the lid open so that moisture can escape. Since the crossover rollers are out of solution, chemicals carried onto them by film can crystallize and should be cleaned off before the processor is used again.

Turnaround assemblies are located at the bottom of the deep racks and serve to change the film direction as it changes from downward to upward motion. Guide shoes, or deflector plates, are also located where film must change direction. They will occasionally scratch film, leaving characteristic guide shoe marks, when they require adjustment.

When returning rollers to the processor after cleaning, care must be taken to seat them securely in their proper position. Transport problems (processor jam-up) will result if racks are misaligned.

\section*{C. REPLENISHMENT SYSTEM}

As films travel from one processor solution section to another, chemical solution is carried away in the swollen film emulsion. It is the function of the processor replenishment system to keep solution tanks full. If solution level is allowed to lower, film-immersion time decreases and radiographic density and contrast changes will occur. Transport problems can also arise from inadequate replenishment, ie, if insufficient developer replenisher, the inadequate addition of hardener will result in excessive emulsion swelling. The essentially Rthickernty film has difficulty transporting between the closely distanced rollers.

As film travels through the fixer, it accumulates residual developer solution; fixer solution also accumulates unexposed silver cleared from the emulsion. Wash water accumulates fixer. In these ways, the activity of each solution is depleted through continual use. Diminished solution activity can have the same effects as low solution levels. The replenishment system assures that proper solution concentration is maintained.

\section*{D. TEMPERATURE REGULATION}

The temperature-regulation system functions to control the temperature of each section of the automatic processor. Developer is the most important solution temperature to regulate; in a $90-\mathrm{sec}$ processor, developer temperature is usually maintained at $92^{\circ}$ to $95^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Once the correct developer temperature is established, it must be constantly maintained. Even a minor fluctuation (ie, $0.5^{\circ}$ ) in developer temperature can cause a visible change in radiographic density and contrast.

Developer temperature is thermostatically controlled and developer solution is circulated through a heat exchanger under the fixer tank. Thus, the fixer temperature is regulated (in cold water processors) by heat conducted from the developer solution. In older processors having stainless steel tanks, fixer temperature is regulated by heat convection from the neighboring developer solution.

\section*{E. RECIRCULATION SYSTEM}

As replenishment chemicals are added to solution, the recirculation system provides agitation necessary for uniform solution concentration.

\section*{F. WASH AND DRYER SYSTEMS}

Thorough removal of chemical solutions from the film emulsion is required for good archival film quality and is provided by the wash section of the automatic processor. Agitation of the water makes the process more efficient. Any residual chemicals will eventually result in film stain. Residual fixer will eventually stain the film a yellowish brown that ultimately obscures the image and diminishes the archival quality. Films can be tested (usually by the film manufacturer or distributor) to determine their degree of fixer retention.

The dryer section functions to remove water from the film by blowing warm, dry air over the film surface. Dryer temperature is usually $120^{\circ}$ to $130^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, sufficient to shrink and dry the emulsion without being excessive. Excessive heat and overdrying can cause film damage. If films emerging from a properly heated dryer are damp, the problem may be excessive emulsion swelling and water retention as a result of inadequate developer or fixer replenisher (hardener).

\section*{G. SILVER RECOVERY}

X-ray film is expensive and represents a large part of a radiology department annual budget. About half of the film $\longleftarrow s$ silver remains in the emulsion after exposure and processing. The other half (unexposed silver)
is removed from the film during the fixing process and most of it is recoverable through silver recovery methods. A drain is connected to the fixer tank and fixer is allowed to flow directly into a silver recovery unit or to a large centrally located receptacle.

Silver recovery is desirable for financial and ecological reasons. Fixer silver is toxic to the public water supply and environmental legislation makes persons responsible for its direct passage into sewer lines, or other means of improper disposal, subject to sever fines and penalties.

There are three types of silver recover methods. Used fixer enters a metallic displacement (or metallic replacement) cartridge and metallic silver is precipitated onto the steel wool within. This method of silver recovery is most useful for low volume locations.

Electrolytic silver recovery units (cells) pass an electric current through the fixer solution, causing silver to be plated onto a cathode cylinder of the unit. The silver is periodically removed by scraping it from the stainless steel cathode. Electrolytic cells are best used in locations having medium to high volume.

There are a number of chemicals that will precipitate metallic silver. In the presence of one of these chemicals (eg, sodium borohydride), metallic silver falls to the bottom of the tank and forms a sludge. This method of silver recovery is generally used only by large institutions having large, centralized receptacles or by professional silver dealers, who employ special techniques for separating the sludge or removing the entire tank.

\section*{FILM STORAGE CONSIDERATIONS}

\section*{A. STORAGE CONDITIONS}

The conditions under which x-ray film is stored can have considerable impact on the final radiographic image. The most common result of improper film storage is fog, which has a severely degrading effect on image quality.
1. Temperature and Humidity. Films should be stored at a temperature no greater than $70^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Temperature greater than $70^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ can accelerate the deterioration process and cause film fog. Atmospheric humidity should be kept between $40 \%$ and $60 \%$. Excessively low humidity is conducive to the production of static electricity discharge. High humidity levels encourage the production of fog. An unopened (ie, hermetically sealed) bag of film protects the film from humidity but not excessive temperatures.
2. Chemicals and Radiation. Boxes of film must also be stored away from chemicals with fumes that can fog film emulsion. Film can be fogged if stored too close to radiographic rooms or radionuclides.
3. Expiration Dates. Each box of x-ray film is identified with an expiration date before which the film must be used in order to avoid age fog. When replenishing film supply, film boxes should be rotated so that the oldest film is used first.
4. Position of Film Boxes. Film boxes, should be stored in the upright position. If film boxes are stacked on one another, the sensitive emulsion (especially in the central portion) will be affected by pressure from the boxes above. Pressure marks (ie, areas of fog) are produced and result in loss of contrast in that area of the radiographic image. Larger size film boxes are particularly susceptible to this problem.
5. Film Bin. The film bin is a light-tight storage area where opened boxes of film are available for reloading empty cassettes. If a single door separates the darkroom from exterior white light, it is wise to have an automatic interlock system in place that prevents opening of the darkroom door while the film bin is open.

\section*{B. SAFELIGHT ILLUMINATION}

Adequate and safe darkroom lighting is an essential part of ensuring quality radiographic images. A source of white light is required for cleaning and routine maintenance. The white light often has a safety devise to help prevent accidental film exposure. Safelight illumination must be appropriate for the type of film used and bright enough to provide adequate illumination and still not expose the sensitive emulsion (exposed film emulsion is about eight times more sensitive than unexposed emulsion).
1. Types. A frequently used safelight is the Kodak Wratten Series 6B, a brownish safelight filter, with a 7.5to 15 -watt frosted light bulb placed 4 feet above the work surface. Another available safelight, which
is somewhat brighter, is the Kodak GBX all purpose filter, which provides a more reddish illumination. This type of filter is often placed in the darkroom so that its light is directed upward toward the ceiling and reflected back down, thus reducing the chance of safelight fog.
2. White Light Leaks. Routine darkroom maintenance includes regular cleaning of all surfaces and walls and checks for white light leaks. When checking for light leaks, all darkroom lights must be turned off, adequate time given for eyes to adjust to the darkness, then a careful visual inspection made for white light leaks.

\section*{SUMMARY}
- Film should be stored in a cool and dry environment, under $70^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ and between $40 \%$ and $60 \%$ humidity.
- Excessive temperatures cause film fog.
- Excessively low humidity encourages buildup of static electricity.
- Film should be stored away from radiation and chemicals.
- The film-box expiration date should be noted, and oldest film used first.
- Film boxes should be stored upright to avoid production of pressure marks.
- Kodak Wratten Series 6B and GBX darkroom filters are the most frequently used.
- Safelights should be placed 4 feet from the work surface with 7.5 to 15 -watt light bulbs.

\section*{ARTIFACTS}

Radiographically speaking, an artifact is a fault, blemish, or aberration in an x-ray image. It can be the result of improper handling, automatic processing, or use of defective radiographic accessories.

Cassettes, screens, and film must be handled carefully to avoid leaving fingerprints or production other film artifacts. Hands should be kept clean and dry, free from residue-leaving creams and powder from gloves. Film should be handled carefully by the corners when loading and unloading cassettes. The technologist should not slide film into or out of the cassette, as the friction can cause static electricity build-up. Cassettes should be numbered or otherwise identified so that artifact-causing problems can be located and removed.

\section*{IDENTIFICATION OF RADIOGRAPHS}

\section*{Essential Information}

Every radiograph must (for medicolegal reasons) include certain specific patient information.
- Patient's name or identification number
- The side marker, right or left
- The examination date
- Name of the institution

Other pertinent information may be included.
- Patient's age or birthdate
- Attending physician
- Time of day

When multiple films are taken of a patient on the same day, it is important that the time the radiographs were taken be included on the film. This permits the physician to chronologically follow the patient's progress.
