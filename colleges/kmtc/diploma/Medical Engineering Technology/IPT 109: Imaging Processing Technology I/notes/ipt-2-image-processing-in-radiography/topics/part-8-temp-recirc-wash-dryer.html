                        <p>The temperature-regulation system functions to control the temperature of each section of the automatic processor. Developer is the most important solution temperature to regulate; in a $90-\mathrm{sec}$ processor, developer temperature is usually maintained at $92^{\circ}$ to $95^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Once the correct developer temperature is established, it must be constantly maintained. Even a minor fluctuation (ie, $0.5^{\circ}$) in developer temperature can cause a visible change in radiographic density and contrast.</p>
                        <p>Developer temperature is thermostatically controlled and developer solution is circulated through a heat exchanger under the fixer tank. Thus, the fixer temperature is regulated (in cold water processors) by heat conducted from the developer solution. In older processors having stainless steel tanks, fixer temperature is regulated by heat convection from the neighboring developer solution.</p>

                        <p>Thorough removal of chemical solutions from the film emulsion is required for good archival film quality and is provided by the wash section of the automatic processor. Agitation of the water makes the process more efficient. Any residual chemicals will eventually result in film stain. Residual fixer will eventually stain the film a yellowish brown that ultimately obscures the image and diminishes the archival quality. Films can be tested (usually by the film manufacturer or distributor) to determine their degree of fixer retention.</p>
                        <p>The dryer section functions to remove water from the film by blowing warm, dry air over the film surface. Dryer temperature is usually $120^{\circ}$ to $130^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, sufficient to shrink and dry the emulsion without being excessive. Excessive heat and overdrying can cause film damage. If films emerging from a properly heated dryer are damp, the problem may be excessive emulsion swelling and water retention as a result of inadequate developer or fixer replenisher (hardener).</p>
