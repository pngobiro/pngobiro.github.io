                        <p>Film emulsion consists of silver bromide (halide) crystals suspended in gelatin. The development process transforms the latent image to a manifest (visible) black metallic silver image.</p>
                        <p>Automatic film processing is carried out by a machine that transports the x-ray film through the necessary chemical solution, at the same time providing agitation, temperature regulation, and chemical replenishment. Within the processor are the developer, fixer, and wash tanks, followed by the dyer.</p>
                        <p>Rapid processing is accomplished by the use of increased solution temperatures, which requires that a hardener be added to the developer to control excessive emulsion swelling.</p>
                        <p>Each of the processor systems accomplishes specific functions; a basic understanding of these systems is required so that the processor can be used correctly and efficiently. A properly maintained and monitored processor will ensure consistent radiographs that will retain their quality images over a long period of time (archival quality).</p>

                        <p>1. Developer ¬© The developer functions to convert the lantent (invisible) image into the manifest (visible) silver image by reducing the exposed silver bromide crystals to black metallic silver. Important factors affecting the development process are time (length of development), temperature (of the developer solution), and solution activity (strength, concentration).</p>
                        <p>The developer solution has an alkaline nature for optimal function of the reducing agents. Sodium or potassium carbonate provides the necessary alkalinity and serves as an activator (or accelerator) by swelling the gelatin emulsion so that the reducing agents are better able to penetrate the emulsion and reach the exposed silver bromide crystals.</p>
                        <p>The reducing agents are hydroquinone, which works slowly to build up blacks in the film areas of greater exposure, and phenidone, which quickly produces the gray tones in areas of lesser exposure. With respect to sensitometry, hydroquinone controls the shoulder (Dmax) of the characteristic curve, and phenidone controls the toe (Dmin) area.</p>

                        <p>The developer solution, particularly the hydroquinone, is especially sensitive to oxygen. If the developer oxidizes, it becomes weaker and less effective. The preservative, sodium sulfite, or cycon, is added to the developer to prevent its rapid oxidation. A hood always covers the developer tank and replenisher solution. The solvent for the concentrated chemicals is water, used to dilute the concentrate to the proper strength.</p>
                        <p>Rapid processing is achieved through the use of high temperatures that accelerate the development process; however, high temperatures can cause excessive emulsion swelling. Since excessive swelling can result in roller transportation problems a hardener, traditionally Glutaraldehyde, is added to the developer to control the amount of emulsion swelling.</p>
                        <p>A restrainer, or antifog agent, is added to the developer to limit its activity to only the exposed silver crystals. The typical restrainer is potassium bromide. Without the restrainer, the developing agents would attack the unexposed crystals, creating chemical fog. Potassium bromide is frequently referred to as ${[ }$starter solution because it is added only to fresh, new developer. As films are developed, bromine ions are released from the emulsion into solution; thus, potassium bromide is not found in replenisher solution.</p>
