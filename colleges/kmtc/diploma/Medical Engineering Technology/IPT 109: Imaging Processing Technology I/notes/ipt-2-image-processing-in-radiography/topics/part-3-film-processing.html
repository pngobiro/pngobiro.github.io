                        <p>Automatic film processors are very simple to use. The film is unloaded from the cassette and placed on the feed tray. The guide shoes then Fullitit the film into the processor though a system of rollers to begin the development. Once the entire film has passed beyond the intake rollers, and so no longer visible on the feed tray, a tone or red light (or both) will signal that it is safe to feed the next film into the processor, or it is safe to turn on the lights. Feeding another film before the signal will result in an overlap of films, possibly ruining the quality of processing for both films, and may also cause a jam within the processor. Turning on the white light (or opening the door) before the signal may cause the trailing edge of film on the feed tray to become fogged. The finished film will drop into the receiving bin from 90 second to 3 minutes from the time it entered the processor.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of film processing is to change the silver halide crystals contained in the film emulsion (once exposed to x-ray or light photons) to black metallic silver. The LATENT image is then developed into a MANIFEST image.</p>
                        <p>Improper or careless processing of exposed radiographic films can cause films of poor diagnostic achieve full development of a film which has been exposed, using correct radiographic technique factors, the film must be processed in chemically fresh developer, at proper temperature and for sufficient time to ensure that the silver in the exposed silver halide crystals, in the film emulsion is completely reduced. If this is not done, the blackening of the film will not be optimum and the tendency will be to increase radiation exposure to achieve proper image density. To ensure proper processing of films, certain basic recommendations should be followed:</p>
