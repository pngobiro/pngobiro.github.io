                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The transport system functions to convey the film through the different processor sections by means of a series of rollers driven by gears, chains, and sprockets. This is accomplished without damage to the film and at a prescribed speed, which determines the length of time films spends in each solution. The roller system also provides constant, vigorous agitation of the solution at the film surface. The entire conveyance system consists of the feed tray, crossover rollers, deep racks, turnaround assemblies, and receiving bin.</p>
                        <p>Film is aligned against one side of the feed tray as it is introduced into the processor. A sensor initiates solution replenishment as the film enters, and replenishment continues as the length of the film passes the sensor. Films should be fed into the processor along their short edge; feeding the film in the =long way wit leads to over-replenishment and increased radiographic density.</p>
                        <p>Crossover racks are out of solution and bridge the gaps between developer and fixer, fixer and wash, and wash and dry sections of the processor. Crossover rollers must be kept free of crystallized solution that can cause film artifacts as the soft emulsion passes by. The last set of rollers in each solution section has a squeegee action on film emulsion, thus removing excess solution before film enters the next tank.</p>
                        <p>When the processor is not in use for a period of time, it is advisable to leave the lid open so that moisture can escape. Since the crossover rollers are out of solution, chemicals carried onto them by film can crystallize and should be cleaned off before the processor is used again.</p>
                        <p>Turnaround assemblies are located at the bottom of the deep racks and serve to change the film direction as it changes from downward to upward motion. Guide shoes, or deflector plates, are also located where film must change direction. They will occasionally scratch film, leaving characteristic guide shoe marks, when they require adjustment.</p>
                        <p>When returning rollers to the processor after cleaning, care must be taken to seat them securely in their proper position. Transport problems (processor jam-up) will result if racks are misaligned.</p>

                        <p>As films travel from one processor solution section to another, chemical solution is carried away in the swollen film emulsion. It is the function of the processor replenishment system to keep solution tanks full. If solution level is allowed to lower, film-immersion time decreases and radiographic density and contrast changes will occur. Transport problems can also arise from inadequate replenishment, ie, if insufficient developer replenisher, the inadequate addition of hardener will result in excessive emulsion swelling. The essentially Rthickernty film has difficulty transporting between the closely distanced rollers.</p>
                        <p>As film travels through the fixer, it accumulates residual developer solution; fixer solution also accumulates unexposed silver cleared from the emulsion. Wash water accumulates fixer. In these ways, the activity of each solution is depleted through continual use. Diminished solution activity can have the same effects as low solution levels. The replenishment system assures that proper solution concentration is maintained.</p>
