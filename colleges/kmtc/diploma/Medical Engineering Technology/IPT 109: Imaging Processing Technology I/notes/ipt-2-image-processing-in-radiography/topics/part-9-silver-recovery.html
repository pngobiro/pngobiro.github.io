                        <p>X-ray film is expensive and represents a large part of a radiology department annual budget. About half of the film $\longleftarrow s$ silver remains in the emulsion after exposure and processing. The other half (unexposed silver) is removed from the film during the fixing process and most of it is recoverable through silver recovery methods. A drain is connected to the fixer tank and fixer is allowed to flow directly into a silver recovery unit or to a large centrally located receptacle.</p>
                        <p>Silver recovery is desirable for financial and ecological reasons. Fixer silver is toxic to the public water supply and environmental legislation makes persons responsible for its direct passage into sewer lines, or other means of improper disposal, subject to sever fines and penalties.</p>
                        <p>There are three types of silver recover methods. Used fixer enters a metallic displacement (or metallic replacement) cartridge and metallic silver is precipitated onto the steel wool within. This method of silver recovery is most useful for low volume locations.</p>
                        <p>Electrolytic silver recovery units (cells) pass an electric current through the fixer solution, causing silver to be plated onto a cathode cylinder of the unit. The silver is periodically removed by scraping it from the stainless steel cathode. Electrolytic cells are best used in locations having medium to high volume.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of chemicals that will precipitate metallic silver. In the presence of one of these chemicals (eg, sodium borohydride), metallic silver falls to the bottom of the tank and forms a sludge. This method of silver recovery is generally used only by large institutions having large, centralized receptacles or by professional silver dealers, who employ special techniques for separating the sludge or removing the entire tank.</p>
