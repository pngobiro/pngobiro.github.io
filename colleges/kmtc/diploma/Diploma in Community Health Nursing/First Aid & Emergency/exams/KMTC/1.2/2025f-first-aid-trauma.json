Management of the Impaled Object (Knife): DO NOT REMOVE: The knife may be tamponading (plugging) a severed blood vessel. Removal could cause massive uncontrollable hemorrhage. Stabilization: Secure the knife in place to prevent movement which could cause further internal damage. Use bulky dressings (gauze/pads) around the base of the knife and tape securely. 3. Wound Care: Control bleeding around the object with direct pressure (carefully) without pressing on the object itself. Cover the surrounding wound with a sterile dressing. 4. Resuscitation: IV Access: Establish two large-bore IV lines (14G/16G). Fluids: Initiate fluid resuscitation with crystalloids (RL/NS) or blood products if signs of shock are present. 5. Position & Monitoring: Keep patient in a position of comfort (usually semi-sitting if conscious to aid breathing, or supine if in shock). Monitor Vital signs (BP, Pulse, RR, SpO2) continuously. Monitor for signs of Pneumothorax/Hemothorax. 6. Definitive Care: Prepare for urgent transfer to the Operating Theatre for surgical removal and repair under controlled conditions. Administer Tetanus toxoid and antibiotics as ordered.",
