The baby's liver and kidneys are immature and cannot metabolize or excrete drugs as well as an adult. Teratogenicity (Birth Defects): Explain that certain drugs can cause physical malformations, especially during the first trimester (organogenesis - organ formation). Fetotoxicity: Drugs taken later in pregnancy (2nd/3rd trimester) can affect the baby's growth, organ function, or cause withdrawal symptoms after birth. Physiological Changes: Pregnancy changes how the mother's body processes drugs (absorption, distribution, excretion), potentially requiring dose adjustments to avoid toxicity or under-dosing. Pregnancy Safety Categories: Explain that drugs are classified (Category A, B, C, D, X) based on safety. The provider needs to check if a drug is safe (Category A/B) or if the benefits outweigh the risks (Category C/D). Self-Medication Risks: Over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies often presumed safe can still be harmful in pregnancy. Part 2: The Rights of Drug Administration (10 Marks) To ensure safety for both Jenny and the fetus, the nurse observes the following rights: Right Patient: Verify Jenny's identity using two identifiers (Name, DOB/Number) before administering any drug. Right Drug: Check the medication label against the order three times. Ensure it is not teratogenic. Right Dose: Verify the dosage is appropriate for a pregnant woman (considering physiological changes). calculation. Right Route: Administer via the prescribed route (oral, IV, etc.) for proper absorption. Right Time: Administer at the correct frequency to maintain therapeutic levels without toxicity. Right Documentation: Record administration immediately after giving it. Right Reason: Ensure the medication is indicated for her condition. Right Response/Evaluation: Monitor Jenny and the fetal heart rate for therapeutic effects and adverse reactions. Right to Education: Teach Jenny about the drug, why it is needed, and specific side effects to report. Right to Refuse: Respect Jenny's autonomy if she declines, after explaining the consequences.",

Check manual dexterity (can she open bottles?) and vision (can she read labels?). 2. Nursing Diagnosis Ineffective Health Management related to fear of adverse effects and complexity of therapeutic regimen. Deficient Knowledge regarding the purpose and safety of prescribed medications. Risk for Injury related to potential drug interactions or untreated medical condition. 3. Planning (Goals/Outcomes) Ms. Heggan will verbalize the purpose and administration schedule of her medications by discharge. Ms. Heggan will agree to a simplified medication schedule. Ms. Heggan will take her medications safely without adverse effects during the 24-hour admission. 4. Implementation (Interventions) Education: Explain each drug simply. Focus on \"What it is for\" and \"How it helps you.\" Address her specific fears about side effects honestly but reassure her about monitoring. Simplification: Collaborate with the prescriber to reduce the number of drugs or frequency (e.g., once-daily dosing) if possible. Aids: Provide a pill organizer (dosette box) or use large-print labels/color coding if vision is poor. Create a simple calendar chart. Monitoring: During the 24 hours, administer meds and closely monitor for the side effects she fears to reassure her or adjust dosage (start low, go slow for elderly). Support: Identify a neighbor or family member who can check on her, or arrange for a home health visit. 5. Evaluation Ask Ms. Heggan to teach back how she will take her meds at home. Observe if she takes medications willingly during the stay. Check if clinical parameters (BP, sugar, etc.) have stabilized.",
