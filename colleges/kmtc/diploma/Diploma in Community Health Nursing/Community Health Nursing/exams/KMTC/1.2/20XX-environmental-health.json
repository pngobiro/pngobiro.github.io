      "caseSensitive": false,
      "partialMatch": false,
      "explanation": "Introduction: Human waste comprises primarily of feces and urine. Its proper management is critical in environmental health to prevent disease transmission and environmental degradation. 1. Health Risks Associated with Human Feces: Pathogen Transmission: Feces contain bacteria (Salmonella, Shigella), viruses (Polio, Hepatitis A), and parasites (Hookworm, Ascaris). Improper disposal leads to fecal-oral diseases. Contamination of Water Sources: Runoff from open defecation sites can pollute rivers and groundwater, causing outbreaks of Cholera and Typhoid. Food Contamination: Use of night soil (untreated feces) as fertilizer transmits helminths and pathogens to crops. 2. Environmental Impact: Aesthetics: Open defecation makes the environment unsightly and produces offensive odours. Vector Breeding: Feces attract flies which mechanically transfer pathogens to food (The 5 Fs: Faeces, Fluids, Fingers, Flies, Food). 3. Control Measures (Barriers): Primary Barrier: Safe disposal of feces (Sanitation). Use of latrines/toilets isolates feces from the environment. Secondary Barriers: Hand washing with soap, clean water supply, and washing fruits/vegetables. 4. Socio-Cultural Aspects: Taboos regarding sharing latrines (e.g., in-laws) can hinder sanitation usage. Privacy and dignity issues, especially for women and girls.",

      "partialMatch": false,
      "explanation": "Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a systematic, pro-active approach to food safety that focuses on preventing hazards rather than inspecting finished products. The Seven Principles of HACCP: Conduct a Hazard Analysis: Identify potential biological, chemical, or physical hazards at every stage of the process (growing to serving). Determine likelihood and severity. Determine Critical Control Points (CCPs): Identify the points in the process where control can be applied to prevent, eliminate, or reduce the hazard to an acceptable level (e.g., cooking temperature). Establish Critical Limits: Set maximum or minimum values (limits) for parameters like temperature or time at each CCP to distinguish safe from unsafe conditions (e.g., Cook chicken to 74\u00b0C). Establish Monitoring Procedures: Define how to measure the critical limits (Who, What, When, How). E.g., Using a thermometer to check soup temperature every 2 hours. Establish Corrective Actions: Decide what must be done if monitoring shows a critical limit has been reached or exceeded (e.g., Discard food, re-cook). Establish Verification Procedures: Activities (audits, testing) to confirm that the HACCP system is working effectively and is scientifically valid. Establish Record-Keeping and Documentation: Maintain proof of all procedures, monitoring logs, deviations, and corrective actions taken for traceability and legal defence.",
