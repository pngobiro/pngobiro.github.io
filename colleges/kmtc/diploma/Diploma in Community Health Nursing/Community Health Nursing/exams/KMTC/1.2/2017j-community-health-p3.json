Visual acuity tests and checking for signs of anaemia (pallor) are standard. Typhoid and Malaria are acute infections usually managed curatively, not via routine mass screening in asymptomatic children. Diabetes is less common in this demographic compared to vision issues and anaemia.",

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: c) Immobilization of the affected limbs, absolute bed rest, avoidance of all then injections Explanation: During the acute/pre-paralytic phase, the goal is to prevent further damage. Absolute bed rest is crucial as exercise increases paralysis risk. Injections (IM) can precipitate paralysis (\"provocation polio\") and must be avoided. Passive movements are generally avoided in the acute painful stage to prevent spasm and pain; gentle positioning/splinting (immobilization) is preferred to prevent contractures until pain subsides.",
