Thickening of Cervical Mucus: Progestin thickens the mucus, creating a barrier that is difficult for sperm to penetrate, thus preventing fertilization. Endometrial Atrophy: The combination renders the endometrium thin and hostile, making it unsuitable for implantation should fertilization occur. Tubal Motility: May alter fallopian tube peristalsis, affecting sperm/egg transport. Effect on Menstrual Cycle: Regularity: Creates a predictable \"withdrawal bleed\" during the hormone-free interval (placebo week), mimicking a regular 28-day cycle. Volume/Pain: Reduces the amount of bleeding and menstrual cramps (prostaglandin inhibition) due to thinner endometrium.",
