Use participatory methods (e.g., problem tree) to analyze root causes and effects. Allow everyone to air their views (ensure gender balance). Generating Solutions: Brainstorm possible solutions to the identified problems. Discuss the feasibility of each solution using available local resources. Reach a consensus on the best way forward. Action Planning: Develop an action plan: What will be done? Who will do it? When? With what resources? Form a committee or assign roles for implementation.
