Socio-economic Factors: Poverty, large family size, displacement/conflict preventing access to food. B. Management of Master P (Marasmic-Kwashiorkor) (16 Marks): The management follows the WHO 10 Steps for Severe Acute Malnutrition: Phase 1: Stabilization (Days 1-7) Hypoglycemia: Treat/prevent with 10% dextrose or F-75 feed immediately. Feed every 2-3 hours. Hypothermia: Keep warm (Kangaroo care), cover head, keep room warm. No bathing initially. Dehydration: Use ReSoMal (special rehydration solution low in sodium, high in potassium). Do not use standard ORS). Electrolytes: Correct imbalance (Potassium and Magnesium supplementation is crucial). Infection: Treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics (routine) and measles vaccine if due. Micronutrients: Give Vitamin A, Folic acid, Zinc, Copper. (Withhold Iron until rehabilitation phase). Cautious Feeding: Start F-75 formula (low protein/sodium) to prevent refeeding syndrome. Small frequent feeds. Phase 2: Rehabilitation (Weeks 2-6) Rebuild Wasted Tissues: Transition to F-100 or RUTF (Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food). Increase calorie and protein intake to support rapid weight gain. Introduce Iron. Stimulation: Provide tender loving care, play therapy, and a stimulating environment. Prepare for Follow-up: Educate parents on proper nutrition and hygiene. Discharge when weight gain is achieved, edema lost, and clinically well.",
