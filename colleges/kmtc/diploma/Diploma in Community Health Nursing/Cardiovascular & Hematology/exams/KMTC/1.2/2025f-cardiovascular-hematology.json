Nursing Diagnosis: Acute Pain related to myocardial ischemia. Decreased Cardiac Output related to altered contractility/rate/rhythm. Ineffective Tissue Perfusion (Cardiopulmonary) related to interrupted blood flow. Anxiety/Fear related to perceived threat of death. 3. Implementation (MONA Protocol & Care): Oxygen: Administer oxygen (if SpO2 <94% or dyspneic) to improve myocardial oxygen supply. Aspirin: Administer chewable Aspirin (160-325mg) immediately (if not given by EMS) to inhibit platelet aggregation. Nitroglycerin: Administer sublingual NTG (monitor BP closely as he is borderline hypotensive; hold if SBP <90). Relieves pain and preload. Morphine: Administer IV Morphine if pain persists after NTG. Reduces pain, anxiety, and oxygen demand. ECG: Obtain 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes to confirm STEMI vs NSTEMI. IV Access: Establish 2 large-bore IV lines for meds and fluids. Labs: Draw cardiac enzymes (Troponin, CK-MB), electrolytes, coagulation profile. Reperfusion Prep: Prepare for Thrombolytics (if indicated/no cath lab) or transfer to Cath Lab for PCI (Angioplasty) within 90 minutes. Bed Rest: Maintain bed rest (Semi-Fowler's) to reduce myocardial oxygen consumption. Reassurance: Provide calm reassurance to reduce anxiety and sympathetic stress on the heart. 4.
