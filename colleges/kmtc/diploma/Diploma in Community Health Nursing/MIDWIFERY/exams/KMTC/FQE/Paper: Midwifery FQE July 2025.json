      ],
      "explanation": "In human embryology, the prenatal period is divided into three stages: Pre-embryonic (0-2 weeks), Embryonic (2-8 weeks), and Fetal stage (from 9 weeks until birth). The fetal stage is characterized by rapid growth and maturation of tissues.",

      ],
      "explanation": "As the uterus enlarges, it pushes upward on the diaphragm, displacing it by about 4 cm. This causes physiological dyspnea in late pregnancy before lightening occurs.",
      "hint": "Think about what physical structure separates the abdomen from the chest."
