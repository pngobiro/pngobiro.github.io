      ],
      "explanation": "Historically, before the formalization of midwifery education, childbirth was attended by 'Traditional Birth Attendants' (TBAs) or community women who gained skills through experience rather than formal training.",
      "hint": "Think about traditional birth attendants."

        { "id": "d", "text": "Rounded brim, side walls are straight, fore pelvis generous", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The Android pelvis is typically heart-shaped with a narrow fore pelvis. While 'rounded brim' is usually Gynaecoid, in the context of elimination, Option A contains 'Narrow fore pelvis' which is the distinguishing feature of the Android (male-type) pelvis compared to the generous fore pelvis of the Gynaecoid.",

      "explanation": "Note: The provided options actually describe delayed or poor progress. Crossing to the Right of the Alert Line indicates delay. 5/5 descent at 8cm indicates obstruction. 2 contractions in 10 mins is uterine inertia. If forced to choose an 'indicator' mentioned in the context of monitoring (often asking for danger signs), crossing the Alert line is the key warning signal.",
