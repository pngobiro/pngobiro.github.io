Decreased Tactile Fremitus. B. Medical Management: Thoracentesis: Aspiration of fluid for diagnosis (analysis) and therapeutic relief of dyspnea. Treat Underlying Cause: Antibiotics for pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion), Diuretics for Heart Failure, Chemotherapy for malignancy. Chest Tube Drainage: Inserted if effusion is recurrent or purulent (empyema) to drain fluid continuously. Pleurodesis: Chemical sclerosis of the pleural space to prevent recurrence (for malignant effusions). C. Nursing Management: Respiratory Support: Position in High Fowler's to maximize lung expansion. Administer Oxygen if hypoxic. Encourage deep breathing and coughing. Assist with Thoracentesis: Position patient (sitting on edge of bed leaning over table). Monitor vitals during procedure. Monitor for complications (pneumothorax, bleeding) post-procedure. Pain Management: Administer analgesics as prescribed, especially before deep breathing exercises. Splint chest when coughing. Activity Tolerance: Assist with ADLs to conserve energy. Plan rest periods. Nutrition: High protein diet to replace protein lost in pleural fluid. Education: Teach signs of recurrence (worsening breathlessness) and medication adherence.",
