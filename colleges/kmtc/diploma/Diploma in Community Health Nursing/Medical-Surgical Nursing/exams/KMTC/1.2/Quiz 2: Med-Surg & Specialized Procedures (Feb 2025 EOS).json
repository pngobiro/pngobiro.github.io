        { "id": "d", "text": "Serous exudate on a shiny, dark brown wound", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Full-thickness (3rd degree) burns destroy the epidermis and dermis, cauterizing blood vessels and nerves. This results in a dry, leathery, hard eschar that is insensitive to pain. Fluid-filled vesicles (blisters) are characteristic of partial-thickness burns.",
      "hint": "Think of the texture of leather; the tissue is dead and dry."

      "explanation": "Systemic signs like subtle changes in vital signs (increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or temperature spikes/drops) are often the earliest indicators of sepsis, appearing before local wound changes.",
      "hint": "Look at the systemic monitors first."

      "points": 10,
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "Normal Saline is a crystalloid that leaves the intravascular space quickly (only ~25% remains). Large volumes are needed to restore blood pressure, leading to potential fluid overload, hyperchloremic acidosis, and hypernatremia.",
      "hint": "Crystalloids don't stay in the blood vessels very long."

      "explanation": "The inflammatory phase involves the release of cytokines and recruitment of immune cells to fight infection and clear debris, often resulting in systemic signs like fever and elevated white blood cell count.",
