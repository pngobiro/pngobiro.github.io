      "explanation": "Correct Answer: C. Leathery, dry, hard skin Explanation: Full-thickness (3rd degree) burns destroy the epidermis, dermis, and often underlying tissues. The destruction of blood vessels and nerves results in a wound that is dry, leathery (eschar), hard, and insensitive to pain (insensate). Why other options are incorrect: A: Red, fluid-filled vesicles (blisters) are characteristic of partial-thickness (2nd degree) burns. B: While edema occurs systemically and locally, \"massive edema\" at the site is not the defining characteristic of the wound surface itself compared to the leathery eschar.",

TOTAL TBSA: 4.5% + 18% + 9% + 1% = 32.5% . 2. Emergency Management of Inhalation Injury: The signs (singed nasal hair, hoarseness, sooty breath) indicate a high risk of airway obstruction due to laryngeal edema. Airway Management (Priority): Prepare for immediate Endotracheal Intubation . Do not wait for obstruction to complete. Maintain cervical spine immobilization if trauma is suspected. Breathing Support: Administer 100% Humidified Oxygen via non-rebreather mask (pre-intubation) or T-piece/Ventilator. Elevate head of bed (High Fowler's) to facilitate lung expansion if BP allows. Circulation & Fluid Resuscitation: Establish 2 large-bore IV lines. Start Parkland Formula resuscitation (RL) calculated on 32.5% TBSA. Monitoring: Monitor Arterial Blood Gases (ABGs) for hypoxia and Carboxyhemoglobin levels (CO poisoning). Continuous Pulse Oximetry (Note: CO poisoning can give false high readings).

Schedule: Usually 3 times/week at a center (4 hours/session). Pros/Cons: Staff does the work, social interaction vs rigid schedule, diet restrictions. 3. Peritoneal Dialysis (PD): Mechanism: Uses lining of abdomen (peritoneum) as filter. Dialysate fluid is instilled via catheter, dwells, then drained. Types: CAPD (Manual, daytime) or APD (Machine, nighttime). Pros/Cons: Flexible, done at home, fewer diet restrictions vs Risk of Peritonitis, supply storage space needed. Note: Since she lives alone, PD requires self-sufficiency or help. Assessment of her ability is key. 4. Collaborative Roles (Nurse & Patient): Nurse Role: Monitor vital signs (BP often drops). Assess access site (bruit/thrill for fistula, infection for catheter). Administer meds (EPO, Heparin). Education on diet (Low Phos/K/Na) and fluid restriction. Patient Role: Adhere to schedule and diet. Protect access arm (no BP/blood draws). Report symptoms (dizziness, cramping, fever). Daily weights.",
