Insert Foley catheter to monitor hourly urine output (indicator of renal perfusion; goal >30ml/hr). Monitor Level of Consciousness (GCS).

History & Allergies: Assess for allergies to shellfish, iodine, or contrast dye. Check medication history (e.g., anticoagulants, metformin). NPO Status: Ensure patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for 6-8 hours prior to prevent aspiration. Baseline Assessment: Record vital signs and mark peripheral pulses (dorsalis pedis/posterior tibial) for post-op comparison. Renal Function: Check BUN/Creatinine levels as contrast dye can be nephrotoxic. Access: Establish patent IV access. Education: Inform patient they may feel a \"flushing\" sensation or warmth when dye is injected. Preparation: Have patient void before the procedure. Post-operative Care (First 48 Hours) (10 Marks): Positioning: Keep the affected leg straight and patient on bed rest for 4-6 hours to prevent bleeding from the femoral insertion site. Insertion Site Assessment: Check the dressing/site for bleeding, hematoma, or swelling frequently. Neurovascular Checks: Assess the extremity distal to the puncture site for Color, Warmth, Sensation, Movement, and Pulses (compare with marked baseline) to detect arterial occlusion. Vital Signs: Monitor BP and Pulse q15min x 4, q30min x 2, q1h x 4, then q4h. Watch for hypotension (bleeding) or arrhythmias. Hydration: Encourage oral fluids or maintain IV fluids to flush the contrast dye from the kidneys and prevent nephrotoxicity. Pain Management: Assess for chest pain or back/groin pain. Report chest pain immediately (could indicate re-occlusion). Discharge Teaching: Advise on limiting activity for a few days and signs of infection/bleeding to report.",
