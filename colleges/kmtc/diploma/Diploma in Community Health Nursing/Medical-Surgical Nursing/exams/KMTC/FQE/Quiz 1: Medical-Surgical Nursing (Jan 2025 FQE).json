    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "The plasma membrane of a cell presents a barrier to the movement of electrolytes through it. The one characteristic for this barrier is:",
      "points": 10,
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "There are no channels in the membrane for the passage of electrolytes.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Electrolytes are not soluble in the lipid of the membrane.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Electrolytes are too large to pass through membrane channels.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Membrane proteins electrically repel charged particles.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The plasma membrane is composed primarily of a phospholipid bilayer, which has a hydrophobic (water-fearing) interior. Electrolytes are charged ions (hydrophilic) and cannot pass through this non-polar lipid barrier without assistance (channels/carriers).",
      "hint": "Think about the solubility of charged ions in fat (lipids)."

      "question": "The blood PH is constantly maintained by buffer systems. The reaction of the blood's phosphate buffer when a hydrogen ion is encountered is:",
      "points": 10,
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "HPO4(2-) destroys the hydrogen ion and becomes H2PO4(-) and blood pH decreases very slightly", "isCorrect": true },
        { "id": "b", "text": "H2PO4(-) destroys the hydrogen ion and becomes HPO4(2-) and blood pH decreases very slightly", "isCorrect": false },
        { "id": "c", "text": "HPO4(2-) destroys the hydrogen ion and becomes H2PO4(-) and blood pH increases very slightly", "isCorrect": false },
        { "id": "d", "text": "H2PO4(-) destroys the hydrogen ion and becomes HPO4(2-) and blood pH increases very slightly", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The monohydrogen phosphate ion (HPO4 2-) acts as a weak base. When it encounters a strong acid (H+), it accepts the proton to form dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4 -), a weak acid. This prevents a drastic pH drop, though a very slight decrease still occurs.",
      "hint": "The buffer accepts the acid (H+) to minimize pH change."

        { "id": "d", "text": "Do not massage the site because it may cause irritation.", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "The Z-track method is used to seal medication in the muscle. Massaging can force the medication back into the subcutaneous tissue, causing irritation or staining. Injection should be slow (10 sec/ml), not quick.",
      "hint": "Massaging defeats the purpose of sealing the track."

      ],
      "explanation": "Inhaled corticosteroids can cause oral candidiasis (thrush), presenting as white patches, due to local immunosuppression in the mouth.",

      ],
      "explanation": "The affective domain relates to feelings, values, and attitudes. 'Valuing' health (Option C) is affective. 'Listing' (A) and 'Planning' (D) are cognitive. 'Demonstrating' (B) is psychomotor.",
      "hint": "Look for the option dealing with values, feelings, or attitudes."

      "points": 10,
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "This describes SURGICAL asepsis (sterile technique). In medical asepsis (clean technique), areas are contaminated if they bear pathogens (are 'dirty'), not just if they touch something non-sterile.",
