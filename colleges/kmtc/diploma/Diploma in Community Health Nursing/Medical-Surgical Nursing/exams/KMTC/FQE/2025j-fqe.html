                                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B. Electrolytes are not soluble in the lipid of the membrane.</p>
                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The plasma membrane is composed primarily of a phospholipid bilayer, which has a hydrophobic (water-fearing) interior. Electrolytes are charged ions (hydrophilic/water-loving) and cannot pass through this non-polar lipid barrier without assistance. They require specific transport proteins (channels or carriers) to cross.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>A:</strong> There <em>are</em> specific ion channels (proteins) that allow electrolytes to pass; the membrane itself is the barrier.</li>
                                    <li><strong>C:</strong> Electrolytes (ions) are very small; size is less of an issue than charge/solubility.</li>
                                    <li><strong>D:</strong> While membrane potential exists, it doesn't simply "repel" all charged particles; specific electrochemical gradients drive movement.</li>

                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In the phosphate buffer system, the monohydrogen phosphate ion ($HPO_4^{2-}$) acts as a weak base. When it encounters a strong acid ($H^+$), it accepts the hydrogen ion to form dihydrogen phosphate ($H_2PO_4^-$), which is a weak acid. By binding the free $H^+$, it prevents a drastic drop in pH. The pH still decreases, but only very slightly compared to if no buffer were present.</p>
                                <p><strong>Reaction:</strong> $HPO_4^{2-} + H^+ \rightarrow H_2PO_4^-$</p>

                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Z-track method is used to seal medication deep within the muscle and prevent leakage into subcutaneous tissue. Massaging the site can force the medication out of the muscle and cause tissue irritation or staining. The technique involves displacing the skin, injecting slowly (not quickly as in C), holding for 10 seconds, withdrawing, and releasing the skin.</p>

                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Inhaled corticosteroids can alter the local flora in the mouth, leading to an overgrowth of Candida albicans (oral thrush/candidiasis), which presents as white patches.

                                <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C. The patient will experience a brief, very sharp pain during aspiration of the bone marrow.</p>
                                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While local anesthesia numbs the skin and periosteum, it cannot numb the inside of the bone. When the marrow is aspirated (suctioned), patients typically feel a sudden, sharp pain that lasts only for the duration of the suction.</p>
