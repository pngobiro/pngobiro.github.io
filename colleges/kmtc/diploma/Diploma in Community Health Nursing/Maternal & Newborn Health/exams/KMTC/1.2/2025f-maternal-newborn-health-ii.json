Manual Elevation: Insert a gloved hand into the vagina and gently push the presenting part (fetal head) UP and AWAY from the cord. DO NOT HANDLE THE CORD (to prevent vasospasm). Keep hand in place until C-section is underway. Bladder Filling: If manual elevation is difficult or delay is expected, fill the bladder with 500ml saline via catheter to lift the presenting part. Resuscitation & Monitoring: Oxygen: Administer O2 to the mother (8-10L/min by mask) to improve fetal oxygenation. Fetal Heart Rate: Monitor FHR continuously to assess distress. Tocolysis: Administer a tocolytic (e.g., Terbutaline) if prescribed to stop contractions and relieve pressure. Definitive Management: Immediate Caesarean Section: Prepare for emergency C-section (Category 1). This is the standard delivery method for cord prolapse with a living fetus. Consent & Prep: Obtain informed consent quickly, establish IV access, take blood for grouping/cross-match. Transport: Transfer to theatre maintaining the relieving position/manual elevation.

Assessment & Investigation: History: Check maternal blood group (Rh/ABO incompatibility), family history of jaundice, birth trauma (cephalohaematoma). Labs: Urgent Serum Bilirubin (Total/Direct), Blood Group & Coombs test, Full Blood Count (infection/hemolysis), Reticulocyte count. 2. Phototherapy (Primary Treatment): Initiation: Start intensive phototherapy immediately. Exposure: Expose maximum skin surface area (baby naked except for diaper). Protection: Cover baby's eyes with opaque eye patches to prevent retinal damage. Cover genitals. Distance: Ensure lights are at the correct distance (usually 30-45cm). Turning: Turn the baby every 2 hours to expose different skin areas. 3. Hydration & Feeding: Breastfeeding: Encourage frequent breastfeeding (every 2-3 hours) to promote bowel movements and bilirubin excretion. Fluids: If dehydrated or bilirubin is very high, IV fluids may be needed to flush out bilirubin and prevent dehydration from phototherapy heat. 4. Monitoring: Temperature: Monitor temp every 2-4 hours (risk of hyperthermia from lights or hypothermia if naked). Hydration Status: Check skin turgor, sunken fontanelle, urine output. Bilirubin Levels: Re-check serum bilirubin every 4-6 hours to assess effectiveness. 5. Exchange Transfusion (If indicated): Prepare for exchange transfusion if bilirubin rises to toxic levels (risk of Kernicterus) or fails to drop with phototherapy. 6. Infection Control: Observe strict asepsis. Administer antibiotics if sepsis is suspected as a cause.",
