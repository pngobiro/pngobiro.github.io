                                    <strong>A Disaster:</strong> A disaster is a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected community/society to cope using its own resources.

                                    <strong>Vulnerability:</strong> The characteristics and circumstances of a community, systemor asset that makes it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard.

                            <p>Disaster occurs when a hazard results in devastation that leaves communities or even whole nations unable to cope unaided but disasters are neither inevitable nor 'natural'. There is no such thing as a 'natural' disaster. Many hazards are natural and usually inevitable, like cyclones, floods, droughts and earthquakes. They are 'hazards' in that they can potentially harm people, economies and the environment if they are not adequately prepared.</p>
                            
                            <p>Moreover, the world has witnessed an alarming increase in the frequency and severity of disasters. Disaster cases are rising throughout the world due to a number of factors that include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>more frequent extreme weather events</li>
                                <li>agricultural production systems that increase risk</li>
                                <li>population growth combined with demographic change and movements leading, for instance, unplanned urbanization, growing demand for food, industrial goods and services; and</li>
                                <li>Over-exploitation of natural resources.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>While better emergency response systems will save lives and properties, many of these losses can be avoided – or reduced – if appropriate policies and programmes are instituted to address the root causes and set in place mitigation, preparedness and response mechanisms that are effectively integrated into overall development planning.</p>
                            <p>These issues were debated during the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan (January 2005). It was therefore insisted on the need to move from theory to concrete action in disaster risk reduction.</p>

                            <h3>Hazard and Disaster:</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>closely related terms</li>
                                <li>However, a hazard is a natural event while the disaster is its consequence</li>
                                <li>Hazard refers to the event which may cause disaster</li>
                                <li>They could be either man-made or naturally occurring hazards in our environment</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Disaster is combination of two words: 'des' meaning evil and 'astre' meaning star</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Disaster therefore means evil star. A complete definition of disaster provided by Turner (1976) as 'an event, concentrated in time and space, which threatens a society or a subdivision of a society with major unwanted consequences as a result of the collapse of precautions which had hitherto been culturally accepted as adequate'</li>
                                <li>Common definition: major misfortune which disrupts the normal functioning of the society</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Emergency:</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The term 'emergency' is used to describe the crisis which a community has great difficulty to cope with</li>
                                <li>External assistance is needed to cope with the emergencies</li>
                                <li>political emergency, drought, famine etc.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Calamity:</h3>
                            <p>Calamity is defined as deep distress, disaster to a lesser degree of damage, which disrupts the normal functioning of the people of a society</p>

                            <h3>Vulnerability:</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>"Vulnerability" basically means susceptibility of a population or system (e.g., a hospital, water supply and sewage system, or aspects of infrastructure) to the effects of the hazard</li>
                                <li>"The extent to which a community, structure, service or geographic area is likely to be damaged or disrupted by the impact of particular disaster hazard..."</li>
                                <li>Its magnitude is expressed on a scale from 0.0 (No damage or loss) to 1.0 (total loss).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Risk:</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The probability that a particular system or population will be affected by hazards is known as the "risk."</li>
                                <li>Risk is a function of the vulnerability and the hazard, and is expressed as follows:</li>
                                <li>Risk = Vulnerability x Hazard. It means, the risk increases if the vulnerability of the population or the systems is more; and also of the magnitude of the hazard is more.</li>
                            </ul>

                                    The objective of prevention is to prevent the disaster from occurring.

                            <p>a. An existing and enforceable system of control<br>
                            b. Acceptance by the affected community of the objectives and the authority imposing the controls<br>

                            <p>a. Aim to create a self-perpetuating safety culture in areas of weak authority or poor ability to comply with existing controls.<br>
                            b. Require large budgets, skilled manpower and extensive administration.<br>
                            c. Are useful in areas of low income, rural areas or elsewhere where there is no external jurisdiction over land use or building activity.</p>

                            <h3>Risk Management Process</h3>
                            <p>Risk management has three components namely:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Risk identification</li>
                                <li>Risk reduction</li>
                                <li>Risk transfer</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Risk identification has to be done through mapping and using other available technological options</p>
                            <p>It is usual to allocate risk management to special body at national level. Usually, it is a national disaster management organization at national level. Others support should be obtained within a National Action Plan for disaster management.</p>
                            <p>At local, it may be the responsibility of a disaster mitigation committee, which administers risk management.</p>

                            <h3>Risk reduction:</h3>
                            <p>Effective risk reduction involves mitigation measures in hazard prone areas. It may also involve overcoming the socio-economic, institutional and political barriers to the adoption of effective risk reduction strategies and measures in developing countries.</p>

                            <h3>Risk Management:</h3>
                            <p>This is the process by which assessed risks are mitigated, minimized or controlled through engineering, management of land use prances or other operational means. This involves the optimal allocation of available resources in support of group goals</p>

                            <h3>Risk Transfer:</h3>
                            <p>Effective risk transfer involves different tools such as insurances; tax policies special measures focused on land management. Organizational structures, policies, legislation etc is required for effective implementation of risk transfer strategies for a country or local government areas.</p>

                            <h3>Steps in Hazard analysis</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>Understand the type and nature of hazard</li>
                                <li>Collect the data from history about frequency, duration, controllability etc.</li>
                                <li>Vulnerability analysis: physical, economic etc.</li>
                                <li>Strategies to minimize vulnerability</li>
