                            <p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a social process of managing all networks of communication to ensure mutual understanding between the service provider (health worker) and the customer (e.g. patient from OPD or Nurse in the Theatre).</p>
                            
                            <p>Relationships are preceded by social communication for both internal and External Customers. Communication in this context relates to both verbal and nonverbal. In order to achieve effective communication there is a need to ensure the existence of the ‘integrated marketing system’ (Triangular model).</p>

                            <p>Internal customers include all individuals, departments, sections within the organization who use the output of your job (e.g. Pharmacist & the Accountant of the Hospital). The satisfaction of the internal customers is crucial to the achievement of the organizational goals and positive image. Internal customer relationship is a crucial part of CRM as when it fails it gives room for Gossip that distorts the image of the organization.</p>

                            <h3>External Customers</h3>
                            <p>External customers include individuals, organizations and anybody outside the organization who buy/use/ the goods and services provided by the organization. In the case of Health service; suppliers, patients, regulatory bodies and the like form the external customers.</p>
                            
                            <p>The concept of Integrated Marketing targets the employees, employers & external Customers given that it highlights the roles of each of the above mentioned. It is important to note that a customer may belong to various categories.</p>

Integrating psychological contract built from social capital reduces insecurity by filling in the gaps in the relationship not covered by a formal written employment contract. It is important to display commitment on the part of the organization to care for the personal and social needs of the employees who are customers of the managers who wish to carry out the firm's objectives.</p>
