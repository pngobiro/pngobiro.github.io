                            <p>Communication is the process by which we interact with each other. It is the flow – transmission and reception – of information, ideas, feelings, attitudes, perceptions and understanding, both verbally and non-verbally, between two or more parties. Communication is much more than the use of words, whether spoken or written. It embodies attitudes, behaviour, dress, body language, style and method of presentation, quality of listening and perceptions, and interpretation.</p>
                            
                            <p>Communication refers to the process of relaying messages in a way that is effective and results in a response. Communication is crucial in any organization and for all programmes. The communication process is inseparable from the management aspects of an organization and is a fundamental part of the everyday functions of a manager. Good and effective communication promotes teamwork. Personal relationships within a team can be difficult, but poor communication can worsen them.</p>
                            
                            <p>Good communication enhances managerial and leadership skills, as well as personal effectiveness. Managers must understand:</p>

                            <p>These are any aspects of or conditions in a place that interfere with effective exchange of ideas or thoughts. Therefore, a communication barrier is anything that stops a message from reaching its destination. Barriers may be physical or psychological, including:</p>

                                <li><strong>Culture, background and bias</strong>: We allow our past experiences to change the meaning of the message. Our culture, background and bias can be good as they allow us to use our past experiences to understand something new. It is when they change the meaning of the message that they interfere with the communication process.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ourselves</strong>: Focusing on ourselves, rather than the other person, can lead to confusion and conflict. Some of the factors that cause this are defensiveness (we feel someone is attacking us), superiority (we feel we know more than the other) and ego (we feel we are the centre of the activity).</li>
                                <li><strong>Perception</strong>: Our preconceived attitudes affect our ability to listen. We listen uncritically to persons of high status and dismiss those of low status. If we feel the person is talking too fast, or not fluently, or does not articulate clearly, or is speaking with an undesirable accent, etc., we may dismiss the person out of hand.</li>

                                    Often, we talk more than we should without giving the other person a chance to respond. If we are thinking about what we will say when we talk, we cannot focus attention on the person we wish to listen to. Do not interrupt.

                                    Do not allow yourself to be distracted by thinking about something else. Often, we need to make an active effort to pay attention when others are speaking.

                                <li><strong>Establish rapport:</strong> Because communication is an ongoing process that involves the active participation of all concerned, people communicate effectively when they are at ease with one another.

                                <li><strong>Avoid ambiguity:</strong> The lack of specificity is one of the barriers to good communication. To avoid this it is necessary to be very clear when giving instructions or explanations. Vague statements such as "take appropriate action" or "make suitable arrangements" should be avoided; rather, the instructions should state exactly what needs to be done.</li>
                                <li><strong>Be brief:</strong> It is best to be direct and to the point and to reinforce the main points with examples if necessary.</li>
                                <li><strong>Language:</strong> Special terms that may be unfamiliar to the listener should be explained and jargon avoided. If the language being used to communicate is a foreign or second language, it is best to use simple words and sentences, and to verify understanding.</li>
                                <li><strong>Develop listening skills:</strong> Since communication is a two-way process, it is as important to listen carefully as it is to speak properly. Sometimes we do not listen well for a number of reasons, such as boredom, bias, fear of being influenced and interruptions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Feedback from the listener needs to be recognized by the sender, even when it is non-verbal (example yawning, being distracted, checking text messages). If what you are saying is not being registered or has the wrong effect, change your communication approach.</li>
                                <li><strong>Timing and situation:</strong> Effective communications requires enough time to cover the subject adequately without unnecessary interruptions. If interruption is unavoidable, it is important to set a formal date for continuing the discussion in the not too distant future.</li>
                                <li><strong>Verification:</strong> This goes back to the definition of communication as a two-way process involving both transmission and reception. To ensure accurate communication, it is important to ask questions to verify that your communication has been received in the way it was intended and that you heard the message that was intended.</li>
                                <li><strong>Use of different communication methods:</strong> A mix of formal and informal methods may facilitate understanding between the sender and the receiver of the message within an organization.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Channels of communication are mechanisms for linking one person to the other/others and vice versa. The channels vary, but those most commonly used to communicate with staff may be divided into organizational and interpersonal.</p>

                            <h3>Organizational</h3>
                            <p>Organizational communication is the consideration, analysis and criticism of the role of communication in organizational contexts; it may be formal or informal. For example, written communication becomes important when certain proceedings or instructions need to be recorded and guidelines/procedures need to be followed. Staff meetings may be called to give staff an opportunity to exchange information or solve problems, or to give instructions about a new skill that may need a detailed explanation or demonstration</p>

                            <h3>Interpersonal</h3>
                            <p>This is the process of face-to-face communication between individuals. Such communication may take several forms. Messages may be verbal (that is, expressed in words), or they may not involve words at all but consist of gestures, facial expressions and certain postures. For example, managers often communicate verbally with staff members on a one-to-one basis to discuss good or poor performance, to motivate and counsel them, to discuss and solve problems arising at the workplace, and to understand better the individual problems of their staff. They may also communicate in writing, to give instructions, get suggestions and document actions for disciplinary purposes.</p>

                            <h3>Communication Networks</h3>
                            <p>A network consists of a set of interconnected devices, nodes, hosts or computers linked across a communication medium. Communication networks, specifically, are links and nodes especially set so that messages may be passed from one part of the network to another through multiple links and various nodes. A network can offer a choice of services including voice transfer, file transfer, remote login and message passing. Therefore, networks, or patterns, are aspects of direction and flow of communication.</p>

                            <h3>Direction of Organizational Communication</h3>
                            <p>There are basically three directions in which communication operates – up, down and sideways:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li><strong>Downward communication:</strong> From supervisor to subordinate (e.g., job instructions, information on organization policies, performance feedback, information about the organization's goals and changes).</li>
                                <li><strong>Upward communication:</strong> From subordinate to supervisor (e.g., grievance procedures, department meetings, participation in decisions, others).</li>
                                <li><strong>Horizontal communication:</strong> This is communication between/among staff at the same level.</li>
