                            <h4>8.1 Introduction</h4>
                            <p>In the preceding lectures, we discussed the various concepts, principles and functions of management which a nurse manager utilizes in day to day running of a unit.</p>
                            <p>To some extent we have already referred to some of the most important resources eg. Manpower, and materials. Nursing management takes place in situations of scarce resources and therefore the main role of the nurse manager is to achieve greatest results with the resources available.</p>
                            <p>This topic will focus on management of resources which will include: human, financial and materials. It will also discuss time management which is an important resource.</p>

                            <p>The effective functioning of an organization depends upon various resources. Human resources or manpower is one of the most vital for the labor intensive health institutions. Human resource management can be said to be part of the role of every person who is responsible for the work of others. However, in this discussion it will refer to the personnel specialists concerned with the increasing effectiveness of performance in any organization.</p>

                            <h4>8.3 Objectives of Human Resource Management</h4>
                            <p>According to Basawanthappa (2002) the main objectives of human resources management are the following:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Effective utilization of human resources to the achievement of organizational goals.</li>

                                <li>Securing integration of the individual and informal groups with the organization ad thereby ensuring their commitment, involvement and loyalty.</li>
                                <li>Recognition and satisfaction of individual needs and group goals.</li>
                                <li>Provision of maximum opportunities for individual development and advancement.</li>
                                <li>Maintenance of high morals in organizations.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>With the above objectives in mind, the following are the main responsibilities in the management of the Human Resources.</p>

                            <h4>8.3.1 Main Responsibilities in Management of Human Resources</h4>
                            <!-- Content continues in 8.3.2 per source structure -->

                            <h4>8.3.2 Human Resource Planning</h4>
                            <p>The human resource planning consists of the following activities:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Forecasting future manpower requirements</strong>: Estimating the institutions demand for labor, matching this with what is available and identifying whether there are shortfalls or more than required. Such planning is accomplished through analysis of current and expected skill needs, vacancies and department expansions and reductions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Formulating and proposing policies</strong>: Policy formulation is carried out in Human Resources Department. The policies have to be agreed by the top management team. The key areas of personnel policy include recruitment and selection; terms and conditions of employment, training and development. These personnel policies are guidelines for behavior stating what the organization will do or will not do in relation to employees and employee affairs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Recruitment</strong>: This involves preparing job descriptions and specifications, drafting job advertisements, interviewing candidates and assessing appropriate salary levels for new employees. As discussed earlier a job description states the principal duties, responsibilities and the scope of authority while A job specification refers to human quality or personnel. Specifications which are necessary to perform a job adequately eg. The knowledge details, skills, ability and behavior.</li>
                                <li><strong>Training and Development</strong>: Once the employees join the organization, they require training. Induction or orientation of new employees is an integral part of training</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Training and Development of human resources is the most dynamic of all the organization's resources. The process aims at increasing the ability of employees to contribute to organizational effectiveness. Training and development is important in order to maintain the key skills within the organization and motivate the staff. This is to enable them to realize their full potential in their work. The human resource department has the responsibility of assessing the training needs, designing methods of training needs, designing methods of training to be employed and evaluating the training to determine how effective it was.</p>

                            <h4>8.3.3 Reasons for Training and Development</h4>
                            <p>The following are some reasons for training and development:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>A change in working methods eg. Team nursing Vs Primary nursing</li>
                                <li>Realization that performance is poor, inadequate and not up to the standards.</li>
                                <li>Manpower shortage necessitating the upgrading of some employees to new positions.</li>
                                <li>Desire to improve the quality</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>8.3.4 Role of Nurse Manager in training and development:</h4>
                            <p>The manager must analyze the job to be performed and establish standards of performance. He/she identifies the "gaps" that exist in terms of skills or knowledge to perform the job.</p>
                            <p>The next step involves devising a training program or approach to meet training needs.</p>
                            <p>Then the training is conducted followed by an evaluation on the impact of training on the service.</p>

                            <h4>8.3.5 Approaches to training and development</h4>
                            <p>Different approaches to training can be used which may include:</p>
                            
                            <h5>i. On The -Job-Training</h5>
                            <p>This is informal training which employees, receive while performing the job.</p>

                            <h5>ii. Off -the -Job Training</h5>
                            <p>This is internal training by other personnel. It is done through coordination of human resources department or a trainer in the organization with expertise in the subject</p>

                            <h5>iii. Internal Training by External Consultants</h5>
                            <p>The Organization may lack expertise and therefore has to source elsewhere. The training is held either inside or outside the organization and facilitated by external consultants. The course(s) are tailored to specific needs of the organization.</p>

                            <h4>8.3.6 Retaining</h4>
                            <p>It is essential to retain employees within an organization. One way of retaining is through promotion. This is advancing from one given grade to a higher one. Promotions are based on whether an individual meets the requirements as specified in the job description. The career structure (recognized promotional path) should provide the opportunity for all workers to gain promotion.</p>

                            <h4>8.3.7 Health and Safety</h4>
                            <p>The employees should be informed about their rights and duties, identification of hazards, accident prevention and provision of first aid facilities.</p>

                            <h4>8.3.8 Welfare</h4>
                            <p>Employees should be provided with welfare services to cater for social responsibility, improve employee morale and feelings of belonging to the organization. The services include: counseling, social and recreation facilities, employee loans and advice on administration of pension schemes etc.</p>

                            <h5>8.4.1 Motivating</h5>
                            <p>This is important because nurse managers work with and through people.</p>
                            <p>There is need to understand why people behave as they do in order to influence them to perform.</p>
                            <p>Motivation is a hypothetical construct and is puzzling because motives cannot be directly observed or measured but they can be inferred from people's behavior.</p>

                            <h5>8.4.2 Definition</h5>
                            <p>Motivation: Those processes both instinctive and rational by which people seek to satisfy the basic drives, perceived needs and personal goals which trigger human behavior. They are the entire class of wants, drives, desires, needs, wishes which people strive to satisfy.</p>
                            <p>Motive: Inner state which energizes, activates, moves and directs human behavior toward fulfillment of the desire etc.</p>
                            <p>Motivator: Something which influences body's behavior to perform a task with a certain degree of enthusiasm e.g. rewards or penalties.</p>

                            <h5>8.4.3 Basic Model of Motivation</h5>
                            <p>The theory suggests that a stimulus (e.g. Physical drive, social or intellectual need) gives rise to a response (e.g. behavior of some kind) which leads to an outcome which either satisfies or fails to satisfy the original stimulus and leads to satisfaction frustration.</p>

                            <p>Motivation theories are classified into two:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                <li>Content theories- these focus on the needs that motivate people to behave in certain ways e.g Maslows and McGregors theories (Topic 1)</li>
                                <li>Process theories- These seek to explain specific actions focusing on the thought process that people experience prior to behaving in a particular manner e.g H. Vroom (Topic 1)</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>8.5 Motivation at Work</h4>
                            <p>As discussed above, the theory of motivation largely depends on human needs and attempts to satisfy these affects human activity. As a result, motivation influences work performance. A manager utilizes both content and process theories.</p>
                            <p>Similarly, Systems perspective on motivation identifies three variables that affect motivation: Individual characteristics (interest, attitudes, needs); job characteristics (attitudes inherent in the task); and work situation characteristic (organization reward system, culture, policies).</p>

                            <h5>8.5.1 Practical Steps in Motivation</h5>
                            <p>A manager must be aware of how to get people to work willingly and well to increase the individual’s motivation and hence satisfaction in the job. All this leads to the organization’s efficiency. The following are some practical steps which a nurse manager can use to motivate people at work.</p>

                            <h4>8.6 Performance Appraisal</h4>
                            <p>Appraising the performance of employees is a responsibility of every manager as well as an important component of human resource administration. It should take place at every level of the organization and should consider the judgment of an employee’s performance or individual evaluations of work performance.</p>
                            <p>Ideally should be concluded on an ongoing basis or at a conclusion of predetermined period of time.</p>

                            <h5>8.6.1 Purpose of appraisal</h5>
                            <p>The main reasons include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>To indicate training and development needs – where improvements are required.</li>
                                <li>To help employee a manager decide what increases of pay shall be given on grounds of merit.</li>
                                <li>To determine the future use of an employee eg. Promotions, transfers, demotions or dismissal.</li>
                                <li>To identify strengths and weaknesses.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>8.6.2 Types of appraisal</h5>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>i. Formal</strong> – This Involves written documentation according to specific organizational guidelines.</li>
                                <li><strong>ii. Informal</strong> – It involves e.g. praising the individual for good performance in a job or a compliment from a supervisor, customer /patient.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The key is that the praise or corrections be made as close to time to the episode as possible.</p>

                            <h5>8.6.4 Appraisal Methods</h5>
                            <p>There are many kinds’ appraisal methods but only two will be covered.</p>

                            <h6>1. Rating Scale</h6>
                            <p>A common method which consists of a list of personal characteristics or factors against each of which is a scale. This focuses on attributes and not targets or job. One of the weaknesses is that there is an element of subjectivity. It is usually on a 5- point scale where 1 is the lowest and 5 the highest score. The following is example of assessing Initiative on an employee:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>Requires detailed supervision - 1</li>
                                <li>Requires frequent supervision - 2</li>
                                <li>Requires occasional supervision - 3</li>
                                <li>Rarely requires supervision - 4</li>
                                <li>Never requires supervision - 5</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h6>2. Performance Management</h6>
                            <p>This method encompasses objective setting for individuals and departments and performance related pay and training programs. The duties and responsibilities focus on results or targets which are set by individual employees in consultation with their supervisors. The objectives set must be measurable.</p>

                            <h4>8.7 Conflict and Conflict Resolution</h4>
                            <p>Conflict usually arises from a perception of incompatibility. These may stem from differences in beliefs, values, goals, priorities, methods and ideas. Differences in interpretation of reality, personalities and interests may also lead to conflict.</p>

                            <h5>8.7.1 Types of Conflict</h5>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Intrapersonal – within a person. E.g. personal and professional priorities.</li>
                                <li>Interpersonal – among people e.g. best way to ……, information giving.</li>
                                <li>Organizational – e.g. role differentiation, communication, policies and practice, new system or change.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>In organizations conflict may be caused by the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Unclear authority structures</li>
                                <li>Personal disputes</li>
                                <li>Conflicts of interest</li>
                                <li>Competition of resources</li>
                                <li>Poor coordination of activities</li>
                                <li>Incompatibility of group and organizational goals</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>There are some problems that emerge as a result of conflict which include communication problems and poor interpersonal relationships.</p>

                            <h5>8.7.2 Modes of Conflict Resolution</h5>
                            <p>People use different approaches to overcome conflict. These are:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Avoiding or withdrawing- No effort to compromise. This creates a lose-lose situation</li>
                                <li>Accommodating /smoothing- In accommodating one party sacrifices whereas smoothing creates a conducive environment without solving the problem.</li>
                                <li>Competing/coercing – pursuing own needs/goals at expense of others or standing up for your rights, defending important principles.</li>
                                <li>Negotiating/compromising – involves assertiveness and cooperation on part of everyone. It involves give and take. Each person gives up something but both must agree</li>
                                <li>Collaborating- Analyzing situation and discussing about plan. Solving a conflict without avoiding which is a win-win situation.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5>8.7.3 Managing Conflict</h5>
                            <p>Conflict can cause the misdirection of efforts against workmates instead of working towards achievement of organizational goals. The manager may resolve conflicts by imposing solutions or through compromise. The former might encourage retaliation and discourage exchange of ideas but outcomes are certain. Compromises rarely satisfy all parties in conflict. Conflicts are best resolved by relating their particular circumstances to the objectives of the organization. Some of the strategies that a manager can use to resolve conflict among staff include: process.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Communicating to self and others that conflict is a necessary process.</li>
                                <li>Determining similarities and differences in facts, goals, methods and values.</li>
                                <li>Assessing the degree of conflict – ask questions about quality of decisions.</li>
                                <li>Assessing each situation and matching the best approach regardless of which is your favourite.</li>
                                <li>Assisting others in assessing conflict and seeing how best they can approach.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The manager may also overcome organizational conflict through the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Improving team spirit</li>
                                <li>Enhancing effective communication</li>
                                <li>Regular job rotation</li>
                                <li>Employee counseling services</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>8.8 Collective Bargaining</h4>
                            <p>The employee relations are crucial for organizational. These are formal and informal relationships between employers and employees. They contribute towards employee performance and hence organizational survival. In most instances these relationships are formalized through collective bargaining between employers and trade unions in relation to the role, status and working conditions of employees. The manager therefore must be concerned with welfare of employees in relation to their terms and conditions of service.</p>
                            <p>The employees should have information on associations such as unions which negotiate for workers and are independent of employers.</p>
                            <p>The Trade unions are organizations of workers which aim to protect and promote their interests in the workplace mainly by means of collective bargaining and consultation with employees. Collective bargaining recognizes the weakness of the individual worker as a negotiating unit and accepts the existence of conflict of interest between management and employees. Therefore collective bargaining assists both employees and employing organizations.</p>
                            <p>Collective bargaining results in substantive and procedural agreements. The former cover e.g pay and terms and conditions of work, benefits such as pension schemes and insurance. Procedural agreements regulate the methods applied to settlement of disputes e.g union membership, negotiating rights for unions, grievances and disciplinary procedures and procedure to be followed in case of dispute between the parties.</p>

                            <p>The previous discussion was on managing human resources. In this lecture we are going to examine the financial resources management. Managing finances (money) is another important role of a nurse manager. Arguments have been put forward that this function should be left to accountants who are specialized in the area. However, if the nurses do not have the basic requirements to enable them manage finances, they will not go far in providing the nursing services. Most of the resources you will be managing are purchased with money.</p>
                            <p>Nurses as direct care givers and managers are constantly involved in determining the type and quantity of resources used for patients. This includes money, materials and manpower. Nurses need to know what things cost and how they are paid for in the organization so as to make cost-effective decisions.</p>
                            <p>Nurses help to contain costs by making sure all possible charges are captured. He/she must know which supplies are charged to patients and which are charged to units. Procedures and equipment used should be accurately documented.</p>
                            <p>The planning pertaining to finance requires the manager to determine objectives, policies and procedures.</p>

                            <h4>9.1 Budgeting</h4>
                            <p>Budgeting is not a new term to you because in your day to day life, you have been involved in budgeting eg. at the end of the month, based on your income you come up with a list of items you intend to spend money on. In simple terms budgeting involves dealing with money and how it is used to maintain other resources.</p>
                            <p>Budgeting has been defined as the process of planning and controlling future operations by comparing actual results with planned budgetary expectations.</p>

                            <h4>9.1.1 Definitions of a budget</h4>
                            <p>The budget is one of the tools of the financial management and is a basic financial document in most health care organizations. The following are some of the definitions of a budget:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>A detailed financial plan for carrying out activities an organization wants to accomplish for a certain period of time.</li>
                                <li>A budget is a means of control which reflects the plan against which actual performance is measured.</li>
                                <li>A means of checking the progress made in keeping the expenses and costs in compliance with an organization's financial plans.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>9.1.2 Purposes of Budgeting</h4>
                            <p>An organization develops a budget for various purposes which include the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>To prevent spending more than an organization can afford.</li>
                                <li>To aid in planning and controlling.</li>
                                <li>To assist in assessing the financial requirement of the institution.</li>
                                <li>To indicate the areas on which money raised or received will be spent.</li>
                                <li>To facilitate comparison of actual performance with budgeted targets.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>9.1.3 Types of Budgets</h4>
                            <p>Several types of interrelated budgets are used in organizations.</p>
                            <p>There are three major types of budgets which the nurse may be involved in preparing. These are operating, capital and cash budget.</p>

                            <h5>i. Operating Budget (Annual Budget)</h5>
                            <p>This is the financial plan for the day to day activities of the organization.</p>
                            <p>It is the organization's statement of expected revenues (income) and expenses for the coming year.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>It coincides with the fiscal year. <strong>Fiscal year</strong> is a specified 12 month period during which the operational and financial performance of the organization is measured this usually coincides with calendar year e.g. January - December or another time frame e.g. Government fiscal year is from July - June.</li>
                                <li>The operational budget includes the accumulated estimates of operating revenues and expenses.</li>
                                <li><strong>Revenues:</strong> In nursing situations, revenue comes from money the patients pay for services or actual payments generated by a given service or procedure e.g admission fee or drugs sold</li>
                                <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> These may consist of salary and non-salary items eg.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Personnel emoluments.</li>
                                        <li>Education - inservice, on-job training, educational leaves and travel scholarships.</li>
                                        <li>Uniforms for personnel</li>
                                        <li>Medical equipment and maintenance</li>
                                        <li>Drugs and pharmaceuticals</li>
                                        <li>Non-pharmaceutical supplies</li>
                                        <li>Stationary</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>ii. Capital Budget</h5>
                            <p>This is the next type of budget. It reflects expenses related to purchase of major capital items. The major equipment or physical changes in the organization requiring large sums of money are outlined eg. physical renovations, new constructions, new or replacement equipment like CT Scan.</p>
                            <p>The organizations define capital items based on certain criteria or connotations eg. must have an expected performance of a minimum of 1 year or more and exceed a certain shilling value eg. 50,000/=. The meaning varies from hospital to another.</p>
                            <p>Requests for capital items are usually on a special form or letter accompanied by a written justification for the item. If the number of items requested are more, a priority list should be set. Where possible, the times when items are needed should be specified. Capital costs consider long term goals and must complement the organizational objectives.</p>

                            <h5>iii. Cash Budget</h5>
                            <p>This brings together the organizations budgeted estimates for revenue, expenses and new capital expenditures.</p>
                            <p>The budget reveals information about the level of funds flowing through the organization and about the pattern of cash disbursements and receipts. It is developed after unit budget. Cash budget is used as operating plan for monthly cash receipts and disbursements.</p>

                            <h4>9.1.4 Requirements for a Meaningful Budget</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The hospital should have a clearly defined organizational structure with responsibilities defined and assigned.</li>
                                <li>All responsible personnel at all levels of management should participate in budget development.</li>
                                <li>The personnel involved should have an understanding of the ideas and financial goals of the hospital.</li>
                                <li>There must be an adequate system which provides reliable financial and statistical information to the responsible person.</li>
                                <li>Budget should allow enough freedom to accomplish departmental objectives.</li>
                                <li>Budget must be flexible enough to allow for unpredictable expenditures.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>9.1.5 Budget Allocation Methods</h4>
                            <p>Organizations use different methods to determine the budget.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Rolling approach</strong><br>
                                    In this method the budget allocated for the next year is set equal to actual expenditures during the previous 12 months, updated on a month to month basis.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Profit level approach</strong><br>
                                    The departmental budgets are automatically increased when profits are high and vice versa.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Operational approach</strong><br>
                                    Individuals are asked how much they need in order to achieve predetermined objectives. Resources are then distributed and the individuals assume responsibility for administering the resulting budgets.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Zero-base approach</strong><br>
                                    Each department is initially set at zero assuming no funds will be available in the future. Therefore each manager must identify each and every activity and cost them and argue for a new allocation at the start of every year. This attempts to overcome the problem of managers deliberately overspending to increase future allocations. There is no presumption that the amount given during one budgetary period will be repeated.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>9.2 Budgeting Process</h4>
                            <p>All the nurse managers are involved in budgeting process. A specific time table with specific dates for implementing budget process is developed which may spread over a period of 3-9 months. This allows for careful preparation. The major steps include:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>It is important to review the policies, standards, objectives of the organization to enable the manager align the budget appropriately.</li>
                                <li>The Top level management provides the projections for the future and prepares guidelines. These include, external environmental analysis in terms of e.g growth and interest rates.</li>
                                <li>Nurse Managers then prepare the unit/ departmental annual budgets which they forward and discuss with the administrator of nursing services.</li>
                                <li>The administrator of nursing services and the Finance Director/Manager review the budget.</li>
                                <li>Budget is accepted or modified appropriately.</li>
                                <li>Finally the Budget is implemented and regularly evaluated.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>To maintain efficient operations, the control function of management is necessary. This is to ensure that the unit is operating within the approved budget.</p>
                            <p>An illustration of an annual budget for a unit in a hospital is shown below:</p>

                            <p><strong>NB:</strong> Since the income and expenditure have same totals, there is a balance</p>
                            <p>As you can see from the illustration, the income and expenditure parts of the budget have the same totals, that is, they balance. A budget which has a higher income than expenditure is said to show a "surplus" while the one with a higher expenditure shows a "deficit". If there is a deficit in the budget it means you have spent more money which you do not have. This may require you to borrow or owe to your supplies of goods and services. You should avoid to be in debt because it is unpleasant.</p>

                            <p>So far we have managed human resources and finances. The other resources a manager is concerned with in the organization are materials and time. For our purposes, materials will refer to drugs, supplies and equipment needed by the nurses and other health personnel to deliver the services.</p>
                            <p>Time is an important resource although in many cases it is not thought of as such</p>

                            <h4>Objectives</h4>

                            <h4>10.1 Managing Materials</h4>
                            <p>Materials are essential resources to achieve the objectives of the health care institution. For quality and efficient services, the materials must be in the right place, at the right time when needed and in right quantity.</p>
                            <p>The nurse manager should know the policies and procedures for materials management.</p>

                            <p>The following activities pertain to materials and the nurse manager should be familiar with them.</p>

                            <h4>10.1.1 Activities Which Pertain to Materials Management</h4>
                            
                            <h5>i. Demand estimation</h5>
                            <p>Since a large quantity of materials are used in hospitals and in specific units/wards, you need to identify your requirements or needs.</p>

                            <h5>ii. Procurement</h5>
                            <p>Having come up with your list the next step is procurement or ordering. Some institutions have laid rules and regulations regarding procurement. This is aimed at reducing wastage and maximizing the value of money.</p>

                            <h5>iii. Receipt and Inspection</h5>
                            <p>The materials received should be subjected to either physical or chemical inspection. This ensures that you receive the right quality of material supplied to the organization.</p>

                            <h5>iv. Storage</h5>
                            <p>The materials should be in a store within or near the institution. The store should be of adequate size to accommodate the materials required for different types of usages eg. Fridges, shelves, cupboards.</p>

                            <h5>v. Inventory Control (Issue and use)</h5>
                            <p>This means stocking adequate numbers so that materials are available whenever required. Close supervision of movement of materials or consumption rate is a good tool for proper control.</p>
                            <p>It is therefore important that the nurse manager adopts the proper procedures for materials management.</p>

                            <h4>10.2 Managing Time</h4>
                            <p>From your experience you can recall times when you have wished that a day had more than 24 hours so that you can accomplish the tasks you had set out to do or that a week was more than 7 days. All this comes in when we are not managing time well.</p>
                            <p>It has been said that no one manages time. What is managed is how time is used. The demands on time as a manager and a health care provider fall into three (3) categories (Nduba, 1999).</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Tasks which have to be done. These relate to key responsibilities eg. Clinical or administrative duties.</li>
                                <li>Tasks into which you are pressurized by other people.
                                Some of these are important and must be done while others you do because you do not want to say no.</li>
                                <li>Tasks which you do because you want to.
                                These are usually your own choices and include tasks which someone else could do well e.g. Attending a nurses' association meeting.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>10.2.1 Time Wasters</h4>
                            <p>This is something that prevents a person from accomplishing a job or achieving a goal. Let us look at some of the common time wasters.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Interruptions such as telephone calls and drop-in visitors.</li>
                                <li>Lack of clear cut goals, objectives and priorities.</li>
                                <li>Meetings both scheduled and unscheduled.</li>
                                <li>Lack of daily and/or weekly plans.</li>
                                <li>Lack of self discipline.</li>
                                <li>Failure to delegate.</li>
                                <li>Ineffective communication.</li>
                                <li>Inability to say no.</li>
                            </ul>

                            </div>

                            <h4>10.2.2 Principles of Time Management</h4>
                            <p>The following are techniques to deal with time management constraints:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Goal Setting</strong><br>
                                The nurse manager sets both organizational and personal goals. The goals are either short or long term and provide direction and vision for actions as well as time frames in which activities will be accomplished.</li>
                                <li><strong>Time Analysis</strong><br>
                                The manager should conduct a survey of how she/he spends a day. Reviewing the daily schedule and keeping it accurate may demonstrate how time is used.</li>
                                <li><strong>Priority Setting</strong><br>
                                Time frames for achievement of goals are identified by the nurse manager. The "to do" list should be prioritized by classifying activities as e.g. "1" for urgent or "2" not urgent but important and "3" less important.</li>
                                <li><strong>Delegation</strong><br>
                                A number of activities may be delegated by the nurse manager.</li>
                                <li><strong>Controlling Interruptions</strong><br>
                                Identify causes of interruptions and plan to reduce them. Some could become a planned and scheduled activity.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Nurse Managers must therefore use time wisely to accomplish everything that is expected of them. This takes a lot of planning.</p>

                            <p>In this topic we learned that a nurse plays a vital role in managing resources. The performance of day-to-day work requires many elements including human, financial, materials and time which are all coordinated to achieve the objectives. The efficiency depends on how these different resources are managed.</p>
                            <p>We saw that the purpose of the human resources management is to ensure that the employer obtains greatest possible benefits from the employee's abilities and then later obtain rewards. The financial management involves budgeting which is a tool used to plan and control future operations of the organization by keeping the expenses and costs in compliance.</p>
                            <p>The other resources a nurse manager should be concerned with for quality and efficient services are the materials and also the manner in which time is managed.</p>
