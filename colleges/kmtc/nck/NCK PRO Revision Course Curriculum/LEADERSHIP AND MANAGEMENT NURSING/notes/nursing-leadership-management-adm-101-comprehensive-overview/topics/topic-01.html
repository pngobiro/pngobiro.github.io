                            <p>You may find that the definition you have written is similar to the ones given by other authors. Different writers have defined management in various ways and there is no generally accepted definition. The most common ones are:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Getting things done through people.</li>

                            <p>As you can see, the above definitions are based on two (2) main principles:</p>
                            <p>The first puts emphasis on people who are the most important resource to get work done. While the next focuses on the achievement of organizational goals and commitment to the goals as an important task of management.</p>

                            <p>Just like in other areas of nursing, you have heard of theories and how we base our practice on them. Management theories also describe how managers conduct activities, and keep institutions operating in an effective way in order to meet the objectives.</p>
                            <p>The different approaches used by managers have gone through an evolutionary process. In practice none of them alone will be sufficient.</p>
                            <p>Most of the managers use a combination of the approaches to create effectiveness within the organization. The three main classifications include:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Classical Theories (Scientific Management)</li>
                                <li>Human Relations (Behavioral Approaches)</li>
                                <li>Systems and Contingency Approaches</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Let us now describe the above and how they influence management.</p>

                            <h4>1.3.1 Classical Theories (Scientific Management)</h4>
                            <p>The scientific approach of management started in the later part of 19th and early 20th centuries. The theories were primarily concerned with structure and activities of formal or official organizations. They laid foundations of ideas about organization of people at work and organization of work.</p>
                            <p>The approach relied on systematic information collection, analysis and identification of causes and effects followed by effective organization of management structure. The objective was to develop basic principles that could guide the design, creation and maintenance of organizations. The emphasis was on efficiency and effectiveness. The following are some of the prominent figures who put forward the ideas.</p>

                            <h5>1. Henri Fayol (1841-1925)</h5>
                            <p>He was a French industrialist and theorist who worked as a mining engineer, spent all his life in that one company, where he rose to the position of managing Director. The Company grew and prospered under his leadership. In 1916 he published major work on management.</p>
                            <p>Fayol outlined the following 6 key activities which a manager is involved in:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Technical activities eg. Production.</li>
                                <li>Commercial activities eg. Buying and selling.</li>
                                <li>Security activities eg. Safeguarding property</li>
                                <li>Accounting activities eg. Providing financial information.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>As the manager carries out these activities, Fayol identified four main functions which enable her/him perform effectively and efficiently. Namely: planning, organizing, coordinating and controlling. These will be discussed in details under topic 4.</p>
                            <p>Similarly, Fayol identified a set of 14 principles which managers might apply as they perform their duties. Some of the important ones include division of labour and specialization, chain of command, centralization and responsibility. These have been adopted by other followers of the classical school of thought and many have been absorbed into modern organizations. They are discussed in more details under Topic 2.</p>

                            <h5>2. Frederic W. Taylor: (1856-1915)</h5>
                            <p>He was an engineer who was instrumental in conducting research on methods of training workers for increased production. In his systematic analysis of work, he observed that few people put more than minimal effort and had a tendency to take things easy. He believed in the principle "best management is a true science". Like Fayol he was a practical manager theorist. He worked on problems of achieving greater efficiency. His idea of "Scientific" Management was born. Tylor was interested in efficiency of working methods. According to Taylor the objective of management is to secure the maximum prosperity for the employer, as well as each employee.</p>
                            <p>Taylor's system for work improvement consisted of the following steps:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>Observing the workers performance through time and motion study. This was done to determine one best way to carry out each task.</li>
                                <li>Scientifically selecting the best worker to perform each job, that is, the person with characteristics and abilities needed to carry out job tasks in an efficient way.</li>
                                <li>Training the selected worker to perform tasks in most efficient manner.</li>
                                <li>Appointing a few highly skilled workers in managerial positions.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>3. Max Weber (1864-1920)</h5>
                            <p>He lived around the same period of history as those early pioneers of management thought. He was an academician and a sociologist.</p>
                            <p>Weber's interest in organization was from the point of view of their structures. He wanted to find out why people in organizations obeyed those in authority over them. His observations and conclusions from studies were published and the term bureaucracy was used to describe a rational form of organization that exists today in every enterprise and business.</p>
                            <p>He identified three types of legitimate authority namely:</p>

                                <li>Traditional – where acceptance of those in authority arises from tradition and custom (eg. Monarchies, tribal hierarchies).</li>
                                <li>Rational – legal-acceptance arises out of the office or position of person in authority as bounded by the rules and procedures of the organization. This exists in many organizations and is the one Weber describes in terms of bureaucracy.</li>
                                <li>Legitimate Authority – implies acceptance of rule by those over whom it is to be exercised. Power is unilateral – enables one person to force another to behave in a certain way whether by means of strength or by rewards.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>4. Main Features of Bureaucracy</h5>
                            <p>The main features of bureaucracy focused on the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>A continuous organization of functions bound by rules. Every organization has rules, regulations and policies that govern the employees.</li>
                                <li>Specified spheres of competence eg. Specialization of work or degree of authority allocated and the rules governing the exercise of authority.</li>
                                <li>A hierarchical arrangement of offices (jobs). This is where one level of jobs is subject to control by the next higher level. Fayol referred to this principle as the chain of command.</li>
                                <li>Appointment to offices is made on grounds of technical competence.</li>
                                <li>Official position exists in their own right and job holder has no rights to a particular position.
Rules, decisions and actions are formulated and recorded in writing.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Weber felt bureaucracy was capable of attaining highest degree of efficiency in organizations. Although Weber meant well, today bureaucracy has been misused to imply slowness, inefficiency and is seen as too rigid to respond to the current rapid changes in society.</p>

                            <p>According to behavioral approach theories, the fundamental idea to management is that people's needs are the decisive factor in achieving organization effectiveness and that human factor determines human motivation, group relations and leadership.</p>
                            <p>These differ from the scientific in that the latter focused on use of people as a support service to machines (and that economic forces are more or less motivators of human performance). The behavior approach theories focus on the manner in which managers interact with subordinates. Managers must know why subordinates behave as they do. The theories are based on analysis of the relationship between human factors and productivity. Besides meeting the economic goals of the organization, the managers must try to improve the physiological, social and psychological needs of workers which in turn improve productivity.</p>
                            <p>The following is a brief discussion of some of these theories which may apply in our situations within our institutions:</p>

                            <h5>1. Elton Mayo</h5>
                            <p>The Human Relations theories began through work of Elton Mayo. He is described as founder of Human relations movement.</p>
                            <p>Mayo was a psychologist, who with others conducted a series of experiments at the Hawthorne plant of general Electrical Company in Chicago – referred to as Hawthorne Experiments (1927-1932). He focused on the workers and not work. He studied people in terms of social relationships at work. He evaluated the effects of changes in physical working conditions which according to scientific management should cause significant variations in productivity.</p>
                            <p>Mayo adjusted physical working conditions like lighting, noise levels and noted the resulting output changes among the workers. Contrary to expectations, the output increased whenever conditions were changed even if they were made worse. The workers tended to interact more and formed informal groupings. The conclusion was that man was a social animal and individuals cannot work in isolation. Thus, at work and outside group membership is important to individuals and leads to establishment of informal groups within the official formal groupings.</p>
                            <p>The findings concluded that group's relationships were found to be far more important in determining employee behavior than were physical conditions and working practices imposed by management.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the above findings, the Research also established the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Employee behavior depends primarily on the social and organizational circumstances of work.</li>
                                <li>Leadership style, group cohesion and job satisfaction are major determinants of the outputs of working groups.</li>
                                <li>Employees work better if they are given a wide range of tasks to complete – Application of division of labor can make work boring and meaningless, and thus decrease productivity.</li>
                                <li>Supervisors and managers need to be aware of these social needs and cater for them if workers are to collaborate with the official organization rather than work against it.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>2. Abraham Maslow's Theory of Hierarchy of Needs:</h5>
                            <p>In your basic training you may have learned about Maslow's human basic needs in relation to patient's needs and priority setting.</p>
                            <p>Maslow, who was a psychologist, made considerable influence on development in Management Theory in 50's and 60's.</p>
                            <p>According to Maslow's, every human being has basic needs and people are motivated by the desire to satisfy these needs. As one need is satisfied another appears to take its place and the individual is then motivated to satisfy the new need. Maslow developed the hierarchy of needs with the physiologic needs at the bottom, which the individuals must satisfy before realizing higher level psychological needs. People tend to satisfy their needs systematically until a particular group of needs is satisfied and a person's behavior will be dominated by them e.g a hungry person will not be motivated by safety shelter, until hunger is satisfied.</p>
                            <p>Maslow visualized needs as arranged in hierarchical order starting with basic and going to higher ones depending on individuals as shown in Figure 1 below.</p>
                            <p>Physiological - need for survival which includes food, oxygen and sleep, sex etc.</p>
                            <p>Safety needs - need for security eg. Job at work place, shelter and stable environment.</p>
                            <p>Love and belonging - need for affectionate relations with others or to a belong to a group.</p>
                            <p>Self esteem - need for self respect and recognition. At this stage people strive for power, achievement and status.</p>
                            <p>Self-actualization - need for self fulfillment or to grow to ones fullest potential. This is a culmination of all other</p>

                            <p>In his contribution to management behavioral theories, McGregor came up with certain assumptions about behavior of employees. He identified these as Theory X and Y. McGregor noted that managers make these assumptions about their subordinates or employees as they supervise them.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>i. Theory X</strong></p>
                            <p>In this first set of assumptions termed as "theory X," the employee is seen as:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>An average human being who has with an inherent dislike for work and will avoid it if possible.</li>
                                <li>As a result of the above most people must be coerced, controlled, directed and threatened with punishment in order to produce.</li>
                                <li>The average human being has to be closely directed and wishes to avoid responsibility and only wants security.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>ii. Theory Y</strong></p>
                            <p>The second set of assumptions "theory Y" regard people in a more favorable way.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Employees are seen, as liking work, which is as natural as rest or play.</li>
                                <li>Human beings do not have to be controlled or coerced as long as commitment to the organization is present.</li>
                                <li>Under proper conditions, people will not only accept but also seek responsibility.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Theory X and Y made impact in Managerial world because they helped to identify forms of management style.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            </ul>
                            <p>Theory "X" and theory Y" are concerned with the attitudes management has towards employee. The manager holding theory X assumptions tends to be tough, authoritarian and supporting tight controls with punishments. As a result he tends to supervise the workers very closely.</p>

                                <li>On the other hand the manager using theory Y believes in self control, is democratic, and consults staff.</li>

                            <h5>4. Fredrick Herzberg's – Two Factor Theory (Motivation – Hygiene Theory)</h5>
                            <p>Herzberg is another theorist who made a lot of contribution to behavioral approaches. His work which was done in 1959 on motivation looked at the employees and the factors which contributed to job satisfaction or dissatisfaction. He came up with the conclusion that the factors, which gave rise to satisfaction, were called "motivators". Those, which contributed towards dissatisfaction, were called "Hygiene factors". Motivators can bring positive satisfaction, hygiene factors can only serve to prevent dissatisfaction.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>i. Motivational Factors</strong></p>
                            <p>According to Herzberg, these are job conditions that, if present, tend to influence high levels of motivation and job satisfaction. He described the motivational factors or satisfiers as some of the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Achievements</li>
                                <li>Recognition</li>
                                <li>Advancements – possibility of growth</li>
                                <li>The work itself</li>
                                <li>Responsibility</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>ii. Hygiene factors (Dissatisfies)</strong></p>
                            <p>These were noted as those factors, which are more related to the environment of the work. The most important factors were:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Company policy and administration</li>
                                <li>Supervision- technical aspect</li>
                                <li>Salary</li>
                                <li>Interpersonal relations</li>
                                <li>Working conditions</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When these were in line with employee requirements, they would smooth the path of a working life, but when out of line with employees' expectations, they could be a source of difficulty and complaints and provide grounds for dissatisfaction.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, if motivators are absent from the job, the employee will experience dissatisfaction. Even if hygiene factors are provided for, they will not in themselves bring about substantial job satisfaction.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Implications of Two Factor Theory to Practice</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The nurse managers need to use both Hygiene and Motivator factors to recruit and retain staff. Hygiene factors do not create job satisfaction but they must be in place for work to get done. If not, the factors will dissatisfy staff.</p>
                            <p>Work performance can be improved by using motivator factors.</p>

                            <h5>5. Expectancy Theory</h5>
                            <p>This is based on the work of V.H Vroom who was an American who came up with the theory in the 60's.</p>
                            <p>It was observed that previous motivation theories were based on content of motivation but Vroom based his theory on process.</p>
                            <p>The Key point is that an individual's behavior is formed NOT on objective reality but on his subjective perception of that reality. The core of theory relates to how a person perceives the relationship between three things: Effort, performance and rewards. It focused mainly on factors involved in stimulating an individual to put effort into something since it is the basis of motivation.</p>
                            <p>As illustrated in Fig.2, Vroom concluded that there are 3 factors each based on the individual's personal perception of the situation. These are:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Expectancy – This refers to the extent to which individual's perception or belief of individual's particular act will produce a particular outcome.</li>
                                <li>Instrumentality - This is the extent to which the individual perceives that effective performance will lead to desired rewards.</li>
                                <li>Valence - This is the strength of belief that attractive rewards are potentially available.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Vroom observed that effort alone may not necessarily lead to effective performance. There are other factors involved like individual characteristics like personality, knowledge and skills. Also the way, in which a person perceives his role e.g for prospect of promotion, there will be attractive prospect or (valence).</p>
                            <p>Rewards are either Intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic rewards are gained from fulfilling higher level personal needs e.g self esteem and personal growth while Extrinsic are provided by organization and outside control of an individual e.g. pay, promotion, working conditions.</p>

                            <h6>- Implications of Expectancy Theory</h6>
                            <p>The theory therefore takes a comprehensive view of the motivational process.</p>
                            <p>It indicates that individuals will only act when they have a reasonable expectancy that their behavior will lead to the desired outcomes.</p>
                            <p>The theory also stresses the importance of individual perceptions of reality in the motivational process and implies that job satisfaction follows effective job performance rather than the other way round.</p>
                            <p>As a result, it has led to development in work redesign where emphasis has been laid on intrinsic job factors.</p>

                            <h5>6. Theory Z – The Japanese Approach</h5>
                            <p>The theory describes an approach to employee motivation based on management practices of Japanese. The phrase was coined by the American exponent to these approaches, W. Ouchi (1981), as he attempted to adapt Japanese practices to western firms. Attention has been given to success of Japanese manufacturing industries and one of the key successes is their approach to their management of resources, especially people.</p>
                            <p>According to Ouchi, the following are features of the theory which are personnel related factors;-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>There is a high degree of mutual trust and loyalty between management and employees.</li>
                                <li>Career paths are non-specialized with life –long job rotation as a central feature of career development.</li>
                                <li>Performance appraisal is long-term (First appraisal takes place 10 years after joining the Company).</li>
                                <li>Decision making is shared at all levels.</li>
                                <li>The approach has a strong sense of collective responsibility for the success of the organization and cooperative effort.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The critics of the theory have identified some weaknesses in this approach. Firstly, there is a slow process of decision-making. People also do not want to take any risks. There is an element of imprisoning effect of lifetime employment in one Company. Lastly there exists docile nature of trade unions where their impact is not felt.</p>

                            <h4>1.3.3 The Systems Approach to Management Theory</h4>
                            <h5>1. Systems Theory</h5>
                            <p>This is a more recent approach which views the organizations as a system of interrelated sets of activities which enable inputs to be converted into outputs. It studies key elements of organization in terms of their interaction with one another and with their external environment.</p>
                            <p>The theory seeks to explain or predict organization behavior in a multidimensional way by studying people, structure technology and environment at one and the same time.</p>
                            <p>A system is defined as a collection of interrelated parts which form some whole. A system may be open or closed. Open systems interact with environment and social systems e.g. Organizations are open systems. Closed systems do not interact with their environment. The organization is therefore defined as a system of consciously coordinated personnel activities or forces (Basawanthappa,2007).</p>
                            <p>The systems theory explains that the organizations come into existence when there are persons able to communicate with each other and will contribute action to accomplish a purpose.</p>
                            <p>There are three major characteristics of open systems as shown in Fig.3</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Receive inputs or energy from environment.</li>
                                <li>Convert these inputs into outputs.</li>
                                <li>Discharge their outputs into environment.</li>

                            <p>In relation to organizations the inputs include – people, materials, information and finances. These are organized and activated so as to convert human skills and raw materials into products, services and other outputs which are discharged into environment.</p>
                            <p>The key feature is the interdependence on the environment which may be relatively stable or relatively uncertain at a particular point in time. This is important because organizations need to adapt to the changing environment.</p>
                            <p>The key variables to those adopting a systems approach to organizations are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>People as individual and in groups.</li>
                                <li>Technology - technical requirements of work.
Organization structures</li>
<li>Environment - external conditions affecting the organization.</li>

                            <p>The Systems theories study the relationship between these variables. The managers who use the Systems Theory study the relationship between these variables. Fig.4</p>

                            <h5>3. Contingency Approaches to Management</h5>
                            <p>It has been observed that there is no clear cut distinction between the systems and contingency approaches.</p>
                            <p>A contingency approach builds on the diagnostic qualities of the systems approach in order to determine the most appropriate organizational design and management style for a given set of circumstances (Bennett, 1997).</p>
                            <p>In this approach, effective management is that which quickly identifies the key factors underlying a particular situation and hence applies measures specifically relevant to the case in question. The manager chooses the best combination in the light of prevailing conditions of the variables including; External environment, Technology factors and Human skills and motivation.</p>

                            <h6>Implications of contingency theory</h6>
                            <p>In terms of nursing management, some of the implications of this approach are:</p>
                            <p>i. Managers should be flexible when designing or choosing a management style.
ii. Certain situations require strict supervision and an authoritarian approach while others call for relaxed and democratic manner.
iii. A Management style suitable for one set of circumstances need not be appropriate elsewhere.</p>

                            <h6>Advantages of contingency approach</h6>
                            <p>The advantages of this approach are:</p>
                            <p>i. Contingency approach does not seek to produce universal prescriptions (unlike Classical and Human Relations) approach to management.
ii. It is a situational approach Management which deals with relativities not absolutes.
iii. The approach adapts other approaches as part of a "mix" – to be applied to an organization in particular circumstances.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Weaknesses of contingency approach</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A number of the weaknesses have been identified. One is lack of unifying general principles might lead to inconsistency when taking decisions. The other is that individual Managers may not like altering their approaches and modes of behavior as circumstances change. There is huge variety of variables which potentially affect each management situation.</p>
                            <p>As a result, extensive training and experience are needed for successful application of contingency approach.</p>

                            <h3>Summary</h3>
                            <p>In this topic we have defined the concept of management which focuses on getting things done through people in order to achieve organizational goals. We also looked at how management has evolved over time through use of different approaches. These approaches were based on the theories of management which are classified as: Classical Theories (scientific management); Behavioral or Human Relations; Systems and Contingency approaches</p>
                            <p>From a practical point of view, the manager uses the approach which is most appropriate for a specific situation. In most cases, we usually use a mixture of all or some of them.</p>
