                            <p>The word leadership is an intriguing one and brings up images of all kinds of people. Some names that come to mind include; former leaders like Presidents Julius Nyerere, President Jomo Kenyatta and Nelson Mandela. In nursing, Florence Nightingale may be considered an example of a leader in the profession. You may also think of a relative or a nurse who had a noticeable effect on one's life and may be considered a leader.</p>

                            <h4>-Who is a Leader?</h4>
                            <p>A leader can be defined as anyone who uses interpersonal skills to influence others to accomplish a specific goal OR A person who exerts influence by using certain personal behaviours and strategies.</p>

                            <h4>- Definition of Leadership</h4>
                            <p>Various people have defined leadership in various ways but all the definitions have a common theme which brings out the idea of influencing others to achieve a goal.</p>
                            <p>Douglas (1996), defines leadership as the use of one's skills to influence others to perform the best of their ability toward achievement of goals. It is the art of getting others to want to do what one deems important.</p>
                            <p>Leadership is not a fixed position; it is a process which changes as situations change. A manager leads by personally and actively working with the subordinates for two main reasons:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>To guide and motivate their behaviour to fit the plans that have been established.</li>
                                <li>To understand the feelings of employees and the problems they face as they translate the plans into actions.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>2.1.1 Types of Leadership</h4>
                            <p>Let us now look at the types of leadership. There are two types of leadership. The first is formal leadership where an appointed leader is chosen by administration and given official or legitimate authority. This has the greatest impact when followers accept the leader.</p>
                            <p>The second is Informal leadership. This type does not have official authority to direct activities of others. A leader is chosen by a group itself eg. social group, church organization or work group. One may become a leader because the members of the group respect her /him due to age, seniority or special competencies or personality.</p>

                            <h4>Types of Leaders</h4>
                            <p>Different types of leaders have been identified. The following are the most important ones:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Charismatic Leader</strong>- This is the one who gains influence mainly from strength of personality and has exceptional qualities required to transform all those around into willing followers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Traditional leader</strong>- A leader whose position is assured by birth e.g. kings or tribal chieftains. In this one few people can aspire to be leaders</li>
                                <li><strong>Appointed leader</strong> – This is the one whose influence arises directly out of his position, e.g. a manager or supervisor</li>
                                <li><strong>Situational leader</strong> – A leader whose influence is effective by being in the right place at the right time. The leader is looked at as someone who can assume leadership of a temporary measure over a specific period of time</li>
                                <li><strong>Functional leader</strong> – This is a leader who gets into a leadership position because of what he or she does rather than what they are.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>2.1.2 Theories of Leadership</h4>
                            <p>Leadership is a concept which has been with us since time immemorial. Various writers have attempted to explain leaders and leadership and some theories have been put forward.</p>
                            <p>We will look at the following two (2) theories:-</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Trait Theory of Leadership</li>
                                <li>Situational / Contingency Theory of Leadership</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5>1. Trait theory of leadership</h5>
                            <p>This is the first theory that was first studied from 1900 - 1950. The theory says that leaders have certain sets of physical and emotional characteristics that are important for inspiring others towards a common goal. Some theorists who subscribe to this theory believe that leaders are born with certain qualities that determine leadership ability and success. The leader is seen as gifted or develops certain characteristics eg. Physical (weight, height); Intellectual (knowledge, judgement); Personality (aggressiveness, dominance, authoritarian etc).</p>
                            <p>According to the theory the leader behaves according to the role expectations of the group.</p>

                            <h5>2. Situational / contingency theory of leadership</h5>
                            <p>In this theory, leadership is seen more as a question of appropriate behavior than of personality or being in the right place at the right time.</p>
                            <p>The theory believes that leadership effectiveness depends on the relationship among the firstly, the leader's task at hand in terms of what requires to be accomplished. Secondly the interpersonal skills. This relates to how well the leader interacts with others. Finally the favorableness of the work situation.</p>
                            <p>However, there are critical factors which must be considered in the above relationship. These factors which will dictate the effectiveness of the leader include:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The degree of trust and respect between the leader and follower.</li>
                                <li>The clarity of goals to be accomplished.</li>
                                <li>The ability of the leader to reward the followers and exert influence.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>As a result of all the above, leaders are viewed as able to adapt their style according to the present situation. For example, if one is faced with a situation, he/she considers its challenges and encourages an adaptive leadership style to understand the issue being faced.</p>
                            <p>The implication here is that, you as a nurse manager must assess each situation and determine appropriate action, based on the people involved.</p>

                            <h4>2.1.3 Leadership Styles</h4>
                            <p>The styles of leadership used by managers vary from organization to organization and are tailored to fit their needs and individual behaviour. There are too many kinds of leaders, personnel, tasks, organizations and environments for any one leadership style to apply.</p>
                            <p>Basically, there are three (3) styles of leadership namely; authoritarian (autocratic), democratic (participative) and laissez faire (permissive).</p>

                            <h5>1. Authoritarian (autocratic)</h5>
                            <p>This is the style where the leader assumes full responsibility for all actions. The autocratic leader behaves in the following manner:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Gives direct, clear and exact orders to his employees with detailed instructions as to what is to be done and how, leaving no or little room for employee initiative.</li>
                                <li>Delegates as little as possible and believes that he can do a better job than his followers. Has little or no confidence in workers.</li>
                                <li>Functions with high concern for task accomplishment but low concern for the people who perform these tasks.</li>
                                <li>Frequently exercises power sometimes with coercion and is dominating and insistent.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h6>- Implications</h6>
                            <p>For the manager who uses this style of leadership, there are implications to the employees. Such leadership may cause employees to lose interest and initiative, stop thinking for themselves because there is no need for independent thought or lose motivation. In addition, employees may find it necessary to adopt an attitude of obedience to the autocratic boss.</p>
                            <p>Due to lack of motivation, the employees may reluctantly give only minimum performance. As a result, less than optimal goals are achieved because the resources utilized are those of the manager only.</p>
                            <p>Some form of authoritarian leadership has been used in nursing - it is particularly suitable in situations of crisis or emergency when clear directions are of highest priority.</p>

                            <h5>2. Democratic leadership (participative or consultative)</h5>
                            <p>As mentioned earlier, there is no one best leadership style. The next one is democratic leadership in which people are free to express themselves. This style is characterized by the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>It is "People oriented" and focuses attention on human aspects and on building effective work groups.</li>
                                <li>It has a collaborative spirit or joint effort which allows for group participation in decision making.</li>
                                <li>The leader assumes that employees are eager to perform their jobs and capable of doing so.</li>
                                <li>The group is seen as having responsibility for goal determination and achievement.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h6>- Implications</h6>
                            <p>Democratic leadership encourages enthusiasm, high morale and increased satisfaction among the employees.</p>
                            <p>Research has shown that this style of leadership leads to high productivity and is the most desirable form of management in a wide variety of work situations.</p>

                            <h5>3. Laissez-faire (free rein, permissive)</h5>
                            <p>The other style of leadership is Laissez-faire which is at the opposite end of the continuum from authoritarian. In this style the leader lets people do what they want. The manager who practices this style of leadership plays down his role in the group's activity and exercises minimum direction or control.</p>
                            <p>Similarly, the manager wants everyone to feel good about what they are doing.</p>
                            <p>He/she also avoids responsibility by relinquishing power to followers and permits them to engage in managerial activities eg. Decision making, planning, setting goals, structuring and controlling the organization.</p>

                            <h6>- Implications</h6>
                            <p>The Laissez-Faire style of leadership exists when a manager is too weak or too threatened to exercise the function of leadership or the manager has great need of approval and does not want to offend anybody. In this case the following can be observed:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Little or no visible leadership.</li>
                                <li>Manager tends to be preoccupied with his own work.</li>
                                <li>No communication and directions to employee.</li>
                                <li>Very little teamwork - employees do as they wish.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The style can be effective in highly motivated professional groups such as in research projects in which independent thinking is rewarded.</p>

                            <p>A nurse manager uses all the styles separately or together depending on his/her flexibility and the circumstances inherent in each situation. There are many similarities and differences in behaviour, attitude and conditions present in the various leadership styles. Not all of the behaviours are evident at any one time.</p>

                            <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
                            <p>In this section we learned about leadership and principles of management. A leader was seen as anyone who uses interpersonal skills to influence others to accomplish a goal while leadership is the art of getting others to do what one deems important.</p>
                            <p>In an attempt to explain leaders and leadership, we looked at two theories.</p>
                            <p>The trait theory which says leaders have certain physical and emotional characteristics that determine leadership. The situational theory emphasizes on a leader being able to assess, consider its challenges and determine appropriate action. The three leadership styles namely; autocratic, democratic and laissez-faire were discussed.</p>
