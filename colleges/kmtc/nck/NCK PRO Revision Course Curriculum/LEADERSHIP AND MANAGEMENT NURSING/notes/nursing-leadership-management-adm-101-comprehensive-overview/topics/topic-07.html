                            <p>Quality management stresses the prevention of client/patient care problems. It focuses on client instead of the provider. The goal of quality management is to improve the system not to assign blame and strives to prevent errors. Managers and workers must be committed to quality improvement</p>

                            <h4>12.2.1 Definition of Quality</h4>
                            <p>Over the years, concern about Quality of Nursing Care has gradually increased and the assurance of quality is one of the major issues facing the health care system today.</p>
                            <p>Coming up with a definition of quality is difficult but nevertheless necessary. This is because it means different things for different people at different times. Generally speaking quality is defined as a degree of excellence.</p>
                            <p>Quality Care has always been an important issue and one of the concerns among professionals. As nurses we have a commitment to give the best service you can in solving problems in health care delivery based on educational preparation. Similarly you are expected to provide acceptable level of care to the people you look after.</p>
                            <p>In order to develop, implement and maintain Quality Management Systems, there is need to have standards.</p>

                            <h4>12.2.2 Standards</h4>
                            <p>The challenge of Nursing today is to become a profession which sets its own standards of performance thereby resulting in effective assurance of quality.</p>

                            <h4>12.2.3 Definitions of standard</h4>
                            <p>A standard is:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>A specific set up established by authority as a rule for the measure of quantity, quality, extent and weight.</li>
                                <li>Yardstick with which to compare your own care. One of the main building blocks in any quality assurance activity.</li>
                                <li>Some value specifies by experts against which reality can be compared when the criterion value is measured.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>12.2.4 Why Do We Need Standards?</h4>
                            <p>As professional nurses we need to have standards for our practice. Generally they provide assurance to patients/customers that their stated or implied needs will be met on time, every time. More specifically the standards:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Provide a common base or unifying force in this diverse profession.</li>
                                <li>Standards are set for the purpose of maintaining a high level of quality in the practice of nursing.</li>
                                <li>Standards identify the elements of nursing that must be met to ensure quality care.</li>
                                <li>Provide a baseline for measuring the quality.</li>
                                <li>Standards delineate the characteristics of patient care evaluation programs.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>12.2.5 Who Sets or Formulates Standards</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Standards should be owned by the nurses who deliver the care. Involvement of the practitioners is also important even if they are not concerned with actual writing of standards.</li>
                                <li>Expertise is important to make sure that the nurses are qualified to set the standards.</li>
                                <li>Representatives of everyone who will be working with the standards should be considered. More than one discipline should be represented in standard setting.</li>
                                <li>Willingness – all members should be willing to take part in and see the value of standard setting.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>12.3 Factors to be Considered When Setting Standards</h4>
                            <p><strong>i. A Source of Concern:</strong><br>
                            Something in the ward that is a problem or a cause of concern eg. Infection that is higher than should be.</p>
                            <p><strong>ii. An area of interest</strong><br>
                            Particular area of interest in something which should be also shared by other staff.</p>
                            <p><strong>iii. An area of quality improvement</strong><br>
                            An area of performance which requires to be improved</p>

                            <h4>12.4 Formulating the Standard Statement and Criteria</h4>
                            <p><strong>Standard Statement</strong> – A broad objective of what you want to achieve.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>It should be a guide to the criteria that you will write to achieve the standard.</li>
                                <li>It is important to write standards in a form that can be operationalised at the practice level.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Example of a standard</strong>: There will be adequate staff to provide quality care.</p>
                            <p><strong>Criteria</strong>: These are crucial active elements of the standard. Criteria are the ones that are measured.</p>
                            <p><strong>Example of criteria for the above standard</strong>: There will be Two (2) senior nursing officers and six nursing officers 111 during the night shift.</p>
                            <p>The information you need to formulate the criteria can be obtained from:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Professional experience eg. May want to change some aspects of practice in order to improve.</li>
                                <li>Values and beliefs eg. Individualized care.</li>
                                <li>Policies, procedures and guidelines for practice.</li>
                                <li>Legal requirements eg. Confidentiality.</li>
                                <li>Management., mission statements, learning objectives</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>12.4.1 Types of Criteria</h4>
                            <p>There are 3 types of criteria used to evaluate the quality of care.</p>
                            
                            <h5>1. Structure Criteria</h5>
                            <p>These are statements about the environmental elements, setting and conditions under which nurse patient relationship occurs.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Describe resources in the systems which are essential for successful completion of task under review.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Examples include:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Philosophy and objectives of the organization.</li>
                                <li>Characteristics and goals of staff.</li>

                            <h4>12.4.2 Points to be Considered When Formulating Criteria</h4>
                            <p>Criteria are crucial active elements of the standard. It is important they are formulated correctly.</p>
                            <p>Therefore they should the following criteria:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Relevant – describe exactly what is desired to be achieved.</li>
                                <li>Understandable – clear, simple and not ambiguous.</li>
                                <li>Measurable – concise and specific in order to measure.</li>
                                <li>Behaviorally stated – Reflect things which need to be provided or carried out in order to achieve a standard.</li>
                                <li>Achievable – avoid unrealistic expectations</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>After development of criteria, they need to be validated. The rationale is to be certain that they are accurate and relevant and that they reflect the realities of the nursing practice in the Institution.</p>

                            <h4>12.5 Quality Assurance</h4>
                            <p>The challenge of nursing today is to become a profession which sets it’s own standards of performance thereby resulting in effective assurance of quality.</p>
                            <p>Quality Assurance is the new formal method developed to monitor the quality of patient care. It is the method used to determine effect and evaluate the quality of care.</p>
                            <p>Quality assurance involves integration of all functions and processes at all levels in an organization in order to achieve continuous improvement of the quality of services.</p>
                            <p>Quality assurance in health refers to the accountability of the care giver for the quality of the care they provide to their patients. It implies that the patient is given a formal guarantee of a degree of excellence.</p>

                            <h4>12.5.1 Quality Assurance Programme (QAP)</h4>
                            <p>This is a formal, systematic programme by which care rendered to patients is measured against established criteria. QAP is a management programme by means of which we assure ourselves and others of the quality of work for which we have a responsibility.</p>
                            <p>To be successful in quality assurance the following must be taken into consideration:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Quality must be seen as a key priority (not an optional extra).</li>
                                <li>It must be comprehensive - Covering all staff groups starting from the top manager to the lowest level.</li>
                                <li>It must be an on-going process.</li>
                                <li>Each quality initiative must have regard for other elements of the care process.</li>
                                <li>A pro-active approach is required – quality must become an inherent part of the planning and management framework.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>12.5.2 Functions of quality assurance (what is the focus)</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Identification of problems in patient care.</li>
                                <li>Designing activities to overcome those problems.</li>
                                <li>Performing follow up monitoring to ensure that no new problems have been introduced and that corrective action has been taken and is effective.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>12.5.3 Quality Assurance Process</h4>
                            <p>Quality assurance process must go hand in hand with what has already been researched on as an area of concern or improvement. Firstly the mission statement, philosophy and objectives of the institution, department or unit must be considered. The next step is</p>
                            <p>Defining the principal functions of the unit/ward which must include the central activities you are responsible for. Finally the process involves selecting the critical components or what should be monitored or evaluated.</p>
                            <p>Various tools have been used to evaluate the quality of care. One of the commonest tool is the nursing audit. The following is a brief discussion on the tool.</p>

                            <h4>12.6 The Nursing Audit</h4>
                            <p>This is a tool used to measure nursing care and to compare that care with predetermined standards. It evaluates the quality of care through appraisal of the Nursing Process as it is reflected in the patient care records.</p>
                            <p>Nursing audit identifies deficiencies in the patient's condition or status and lacking properties of the nursing service that may have led to deficiencies.</p>
                            <p>The evaluation cannot be instituted until the nursing staff has developed and ratified criteria to be used. The criteria can be developed on basis of medical or nursing diagnosis. The criteria can be developed using either STRUCTURE, PROCESS or OUTCOME.</p>
                            <p>The data can be collected using either RETROSPECTIVE AUDITING or CONCURRENT AUDITING.</p>

                            <h4>12.6.1 Retrospective Nursing Audit (Nursing Care Review)</h4>
                            <p>For many years this has been referred to as the "Nursing Audit". Nursing audit encompasses evaluation of care after patient is discharged.</p>
                            <p>The purpose is to identify deficiencies in the organization and delivery of nursing care and to correct such deficiencies through education, administration, change and periodically reassessing performance to assure that improvements have been maintained. It rests upon the assumption that care has not been performed or desired effects achieved unless such care or effects are documented.</p>
                            <p>If audit does not reveal a care component, it must be assumed the component was missing. This calls for efficient documentation and retrieval system.</p>
                            <p>The Nursing audit uses the following methods:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Closed chart auditing- charts of discharged patients</li>
                                <li>Post care patient interviews with patients/clients</li>
                                <li>Post care questionnaires.</li>
                                <li>Post care staff conferences.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>12.7 Concurrent Auditing (Open Chart Audit)</h4>
                            <p>These are processes designed to evaluate care that is still in progress – (in Progress Review). The staff activities and patient outcomes that are currently occurring are observed and assessed.</p>
                            <p>The primary purpose is to identify current strength and weaknesses for immediate staff feedback. This leads to improvement of care while the patient is still in the hospital.</p>
                            <p>This type of auditing has existed formally and informally for quite sometime eg. Making rounds to each patient in a ward in an audit.</p>
                            <p>To avoid a mere bed check or head count, various assessments tools have been developed within individual organization.</p>
                            <p>The tool should not be utilized in a punitive way because it can destroy the commitment of staff.</p>
                            <p>The mechanisms used here include:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Open chart auditing</li>
                                <li>Patients' interviews</li>
                                <li>Observations/inspection</li>
                                <li>Staff interviews/observations</li>
                                <li>Group conferencing</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Questionnaires</strong> – These must be well structured to avoid any ambiguity particularly on part of client.</p>
                            <p>Checklists and audits – One can use a rating scale where a level of performance is assigned to each item and certain points assigned to each area. Total number of points is used to derive the rating. Or just check whether a certain activity/outcome has been performed/achieved or not.</p>

                            <h4>12.8 Data Analysis</h4>
                            <p>The data analysis follows to determine the meaning and significance of the information. It involves the critical review, inspection, interpretation of a set data.</p>
                            <p>Through review of deficient charts, the nurses become aware of what omissions in care or charting are occurring. Sources of deficiency are identified which could be a person, persons or departments OR deficiency could be attributed to an existing policy or procedure.</p>

                            <h4>12.9 Evaluation Results</h4>
                            <p>If data collected looks well – the standard has been met. This means that most of criteria is achieved (Compliance level is high or as expected)</p>
                            <p>If data does not look promising there may be a number of reasons: the standard has not been met and may be expectations set were too high or some criteria has not been achieved because it was not as relevant as should be.</p>
                            <p>The results point out where you need to concentrate your effort to improve care and achieve standard.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Set time limits for each task on your action plan.</li>
                                <li>Consider whether you need outside help to achieve your proposed action plan e.g. do you need to involve the administration –for problem that is more generalized?</li>
                                <li>Re-evaluate your results.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>12.9.1 Reasons for Deficiency Could Be:</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Lack of knowledge and skills which calls for appropriate education, practice and feedback.</li>
                                <li>Lack of performance.</li>
                                <li>Interference.</li>
                                <li>Apathy etc.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>13.0 Formulating and Implementing a Course of Action</h3>
                            <p>Once you have identified the reasons for not achieving the standard decide the next course of action in order to solve the problem.</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Prioritise the possible actions into short term and long term e.g. Education or acquiring of some equipment which is not available.</li>
                                <li>Consider who should take responsibility. This will depend on what is needed to be done, how interested the person is, how knowledgeable and whether they have the right skills for the job.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The action plan must be written to include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>What is to be done?</li>
                                <li>When it should be done- Time frame</li>
                                <li>How it should be done</li>
                                <li>By whom – who should do it</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A reporting frequency should be determined to ensure appropriate feedback on periodic basis</p>

                            <h3>14.0 Health Care Organizations</h3>
                            <p>Nurses practice in many different types of health care organizations where they provide direct and indirect care services to clients/patients.</p>

                            <p>The health care organizations make up the health care system which provides total services offered by all health disciplines. Today many types of health care organizations exist. These differ in terms of: Ownership, Role or services offered, activity and size</p>

                            <h3>15.0 Types of Health Care Organizations</h3>
                            <p>In the foregoing discussion, we have seen how the health care organizations are classified. The following are now the four (4) types: Hospitals, Ambulatory, Home and Health Managed Care.</p>
                            
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Hospitals</strong>: These are institutions whose purpose is to serve the whole community, sick or well. Hospitals play a significant role and the services provided include:- preventive, curative, rehabilitative, promotive, education and research.
                                    <p>Hospitals are classified into:-</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Acute care: This is a facility in which average length of stay is less than 30 days.</li>
                                        <li>Chronic or long term hospitals: These are designated to care for patients whose average length of stay is longer than 30 days.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Ambulatory-based organization</strong>: This is the second type of health care organization. Many health services are provided on ambulatory basis. It is the care mainly given by private physicians or in hospitals as out-patient care. The goal is to focus on out of hospital preventive care and illness follow up care. It also reduces the cost of expensive acute hospital care.</li>
                                <li><strong>Health Managed Organization (HMO)</strong>: The other type of health care organizations are the HMO's. This is a newer concept in our country which is catching up quickly. This is where an organization gets people to enroll and pay a fixed periodic fee to the organization which determines the amount of services used. The HMO company offers hospital and outpatient services. Examples of these include insurance companies who cover medical expenses.</li>
                                <li><strong>Home Health Care Organizations</strong>: The last type of health care organizations is home-based.
                                    <p>The services in this case are offered at home. The care is given by professional nurses with expert skills in assessing patient's self-care abilities and identifying resources to overcome problems and meet patient's needs. These include patients' requiring palliative care, chronically ill, disabled or elderly.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The nurse manager plays a significant role in all the above health care organizations particularly in managing nursing services.</p>

                            <h3>16.0 Managing Nursing Care Services</h3>
                            <p>The nurse as a leader and manager must ensure that the nursing services are run effectively and efficiently.</p>

                            <h4>16.1 What are Nursing Services?</h4>
                            <p>This refers to the coordinating responsibility of the nurse, who, in addition to giving care, also works with members of the health care team in providing a comprehensive program of nursing care (Basavanthappa, 2000).</p>
                            <p>The main roles are to link the team or nursing department/unit to the larger organization and to the resources necessary to achieve the objectives. The following are the main responsibilities:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The nursing service must be maintained throughout the 24 hour period for the whole year.</li>
                                <li>The quality of nursing care is provided to clients/patients taking into consideration their physical, social, psychological and spiritual needs.</li>
                                <li>Resolving the health care delivery problems.</li>
                                <li>Participating in policy development in the organization.</li>
                                <li>Planning, organizing, directing and controlling materials and human resource in order to provide effective care.</li>
                                <li>Utilizing various appropriate methods for patient assignment in order to deliver care to patients/clients.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>17.0 Nursing Care Delivery Systems</h3>
                            <p>The practice of Nursing has emerged as an aggregate of complicated duties and responsibilities. There is therefore need to develop certain systems, methods or modalities to ensure that we deliver quality care. Basically there are four methods of assignment of patient care in a hospital. These are:- Case assignment, Team Nursing, Functional Nursing and Primary Nursing</p>
                            <p>The changes in these modalities (systems) are as a response to ever changing needs. These methods may be used singly or complement one another.</p>

                            <h4>17.1 Case Assignment (method)</h4>
                            <p>This is the first and oldest method which became popular in 1920's. Each patient is assigned to a nurse for total patient care while nurse is on duty (private duty). If she/he goes off duty, the work is handed over promptly to another nurse. The patient has a different nurse each shift.</p>
                            <p>The mode of assignments is made according to severity of illness - mostly used for acutely ill patients eg. In Intensive care unit.</p>

                            <h4>17.2 Functional Nursing</h4>
                            <p>The second method is functional nursing which became the first major deviation from case method. It came in early 1950's when there were few Registered Nurses and more practical nurses available. At the time much of patient care was given by nurse aides.</p>
                            <p>In this modality each nurse has clearly defined set of tasks according to complexity. Consideration is given to individual skills, knowledge and experience</p>
                            <p>Method emphasizes division of labour according to specific tasks. The basis for assignment is "task-oriented" or "thing oriented" where each nurse is assigned a task for example, drug administration, wound dressing, bed baths etc.</p>
                            <p>The assignment is determined by technical aspects of the job to be done.</p>

                            <h4>17.3 Implications for Nursing</h4>
                            <p>The Nurse in charge must have experience and exceptional knowledge of nursing. He/She must know skill levels of her workers in order to make assignments.</p>
                            <p>The Nurse in charge also establishes rigid routines, structures and time scheduling for all the activities and procedures.</p>

                            <h5>17.3.1 Strengths</h5>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The modality emphasis on efficient delivery of care.</li>
                                <li>There is little likelihood of confusion over who will do what.</li>
                                <li>Minimal time spent coordinating activities.</li>
                                <li>Economical - allows use of less skilled personnel.</li>
                                <li>Each member can become highly skilled if he or she does the same tasks repetitively.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>However the modality proves useful when:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Workers have limited knowledge and experience.</li>
                                <li>Facilities and equipment are poor and inadequate.</li>
                                <li>There is shortage of staff.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>17.3.2 Weaknesses</h5>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Nurse tends to lose intimate contact with patients.</li>
                                <li>Fragmentation of care rather than total care. Patient's needs can be overlooked if the need fail to fit in compartments or task categories eg. 'Medication nurse' but no 'anxiety nurse'.</li>
                                <li>Continuity of care is difficult if not possible - since no single staff member has a complete picture of the client's needs and responses to nursing or medical interventions.</li>
                                <li>Little avenue for professional development.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>17.4 Team Nursing</h4>
                            <p>The other method is Team Nursing which was introduced in later 1950's to improve nursing services by utilizing the knowledge and skills of professional nurses and to supervise the increasing number of auxiliary staff. The philosophy supports achieving goal through group action or team spirit.</p>

                            <h5>17.4.1 Basis for Assignment</h5>
                            <p>A group or team of nurses with different levels of skills are assigned to a group of patients - the size and composition are dependent upon the setting. The nurses work together to accomplish a goal.</p>
                            <p>The Focus is on patient-centred assignments as opposed to task-oriented. Assignments are based on client needs and the knowledge, skills and experiences of team members.</p>
                            <p>A member of the work group is assigned as a leader. In the original concept, the team was led by a Registered Nurse. Leadership role may be permanent or rotated</p>
                            <p>The Team works together with each member performing tasks for which she is best prepared.</p>
                            <p>Team members report to team leader who reports to head nurse. The success is dependent upon effective communication.</p>

                            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Individual members make personal and useful suggestions. It combines best thinking of all team members about patients' problems which improves quality of decision making.</li>
                                <li>There is a team spirit which affects climate and continuity of care. There is no fragmentation of care.</li>
                                <li>Better utilization of personnel in the performance of quality care.</li>
                                <li>Potential for leadership development.</li>
                                <li>Individualized care approach - more satisfying to patients. Patient cared for by a limited number of nurses who know him better.</li>
                                <li>Opportunity for more therapeutic, closer nurse - patient relationships.</li>
                                <li>Greater staff satisfaction due to increased guidance and better matching of assignments to skills.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Finding time needed for team planning and conferences which makes care plans not comprehensive.</li>
                                <li>Increased time spent in coordinating delegated work and checking on workers. This can prove expensive.</li>
                                <li>Logistics may hamper Team Nursing eg. 4 or 5 team leaders crowding a medicine cupboard designed to support functional nursing with one.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>17.5 Primary Nursing</h4>
                            <p>This is a newer approach to the delivery of nursing services. The concept was developed in early 1970's. it is used by many institutions in the developed world. People are becoming more aware of it in this country and some institutions are using the method.</p>

                            <h5>17.5.1 Basis for Assignment</h5>
                            <p>A professional nurse (usually RN) is assigned to a patient or to a small group of patients (usually not more than 4 or 5) for their total hospital stay. The nurse assumes responsibility for 24 hours a day for duration of stay in hospital.</p>
                            <p>The primary nurse assesses, plans and executes the plan or may delegate a secondary nurse - (Associate Nurse) to execute the plan during her absence.</p>
                            <p>Every nurse serves as the Primary Nurse for a few patients and as Associate Nurse for the other patients on other shifts.</p>
                            <p>The Primary Nurse communicates with the Physician and co-ordinates care with other health workers.</p>
                            <p>The Charge Nurse functions as a coordinator of the unit and is a resource person for the primary nurses.</p>

                            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>One to one relationship.</li>
                                <li>Reduction of fragmentation of care promotes total patient care by virtue of quality of interactions.
                                Nurse coordinates all aspects of care - physical, social and psychological.</li>
                                <li>The Nursing process is facilitated and continuity of care facilitated.</li>
                                <li>Promotes increased autonomy and responsibility for the nurse leading to job satisfaction because of involvement.</li>
                                <li>There is increased interaction with one nurse who is knowledgeable resulting to client satisfaction.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Limits professional mobility.</li>
                                <li>Associate nurse may find it difficult to follow plans made by another if there is disagreement.</li>
                                <li>Level of expertise and commitment required of all nurses - patient care may suffer it the nurse is not quite competent to perform all tasks.</li>
                                <li>Primary nursing requires competent practitioners who can function independently when utilizing the Nursing Process - not all nurses are comfortable in accepting this responsibility.</li>
                                <li>May be less economical than the other modalities since it may require a larger percentage of Registered Nurses.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>18.0 Legal and Ethical Issues in Nursing</h3>
                            <p>So far in this topic we have examined quality management, the different types of health care organizations and the responsibilities of the nurse manager in the management of nursing services within these organizations. As the manager works and supervises the work of employees, there are certain laws and ethics that govern the nursing practice which she must be knowledgeable and conversant about for guidance and appropriate action.</p>

                            <h4>18.1 Legal Issues</h4>
                            <p>The legal responsibility is the way in which nurses are obligated to obey the law in professional activities. The professional nurse should understand legal responsibility when taking care of patients/clients and be aware of their limitations. This is because the clients have a right to expect professionals to perform at a safe level and must demonstrate responsibility and accountability.</p>
                            <p>The scope of nursing practice is defined and guided by the Nursing Practice Acts and the common law. The Nursing Practice Act provides legal regulation for licensure while common law is derived from principles and consists of both broad and comprehensive principles based on justice, reason and common sense. The two are responsible for educational and examination requirements, providing licensing for those who meet requirements and define functions of each category eg. Registered Nurse or Enrolled Nurse.</p>
                            <p>Nursing practice should not give room for Torts eg. negligence or malpractice because this can lead to litigation. Litigation is being taken to court of law by a patient/client and making a claim for damages or compensation.</p>

                            <h4>18.2 Ethical Issues</h4>
                            <p>Ethics have always been an integral part of nursing. Throughout the nursing practice you applied the nursing code of ethics. The ethics provide the standards for professional behaviour in terms of what is expected of nurses. They are based on the principles of what is right or wrong. The nurse's code of ethics serves as a self-regulation and a source of guidelines for individual behaviour and responsibility.</p>

                            <h3>Summary</h3>
                            <p>In this last topic we discussed quality management in nursing services and gave an analysis of the different types of organizations in which nurse managers function. These include hospitals, ambulatory, home and health managed care organizations. The organizations make up the health care system which provides services to the patients/clients.</p>
                            <p>The Nurse as a manager ensures that the nursing services are run effectively by using the various principles and functions of management and the available resources to achieve the objectives. The method(s) used to deliver patient care including functional, Team and Primary Nursing have been covered. The manager examines and applies the most appropriate method. We also examined the legal and ethical issues which a manager should be knowledgeable about in order to guide the employees in their application. These include the Nursing Practice Acts and the Code of Ethics for nurses.</p>
