                            <h4>Objectives</h4>
                            <p>By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Define principles of management</li>
                                <li>Describe the different principles of management</li>

                            </ol>

                            <h4>Definition</h4>
                            <p>Principles of management are referred to as basic truths, general laws, rules or doctrines that are used by managers as a basis for reasoning or a guide to management action, behavior to conduct while executing management functions.</p>
                            <p>To ensure that management practices are carried out consistently with ease by every manager, Henry Fayol (1841-1925) set out fourteen “principles of management” which are the precepts which he applied most frequently during his working life.</p>
                            <p>These principles of management have been adapted by other management experts as they serve as general guidelines to various management practitioners.</p>
                            <p>The following is a brief discussion of the various principles of management which managers may apply as they perform their duties.</p>

                            <h5>1. Division of Labour</h5>
                            <p>This is one of the basic principles applied in nursing practice to a large extent. It is a way of determining who is responsible for what. In an organization no one can do everything and in order to achieve organizational goals different people must be given different jobs according to their skills. The objective of division of work is to produce more and better work with the same effort. The tasks people perform must be related to each other and integrated. This calls for adequate definition of duties which is duly communicated to all the people concerned.</p>
                            <p>The idea of division of labour in an organization makes it possible for work to proceed quickly and smoothly. For example in a hospital, we have a chief nurse, senior nursing officers and nursing officers, each of these people have a specific job to perform for the success of the organization. Each person has the responsibility to perform in coordination with the other people's jobs.</p>

                            <h5>2. Authority and Responsibility</h5>
                            <p>Once the employees have been given different jobs to perform, the leader is responsible for the work to be done. Similarly the employees are responsible for the particular tasks of their special jobs. Both the leader and the employees have accountability over their tasks and responsibilities. Appropriate authority to perform certain functions is also necessary.</p>

                                    <span class="callout-icon">✍️</span>
                                    <h4 class="callout-title">Activity</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>Using your experience define the following two terms :-</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Responsibility</li>
                                        <li>Authority</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>Let us now examine the two terms and see how the nurse manager applies them in nursing practice.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Authority</strong>: Authority has its base in responsibility. According to the dictionary, authority is defined as "legal or rightful power,; a right to command or act; domination, jurisdiction". It is the power given by the organization to direct the work of others. Authority defines which position will be superior and which will be subordinate.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>There are two types of authority namely, formal and functional. The former is where a manager delegates responsibility to a group of employees who exercise the delegated authority in supervising the work of others. Functional authority is when responsibility can be delegated for performance of specific functions based on technical knowledge and personal skills.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Responsibility</strong>: It is a duty or assignment related to a job. It also refers to each person's obligation to perform at an acceptable level. For example, one responsibility common to a nurse incharge is establishing the patient care assignment for a specific area of work that day. Nurse managers should always be assigned responsibilities with accompanying authority because if the latter is not given, role confusion occurs for all individuals involved. For example, a nurse manager may have the responsibility for maintaining high professional standards, but if she is not given the authority to discipline employees as needed, this responsibility may be difficult or impossible to implement.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>3. Unity of Command</h5>
                            <p>This is another important principle of management. The concept of unity of command is described as "one person - one boss" or "one man - one supervisor". Each individual has one manager to whom they report and to whom they are responsible.</p>
                            <p>This is illustrated by the diagram below:</p>

                            <figure class="content-figure">
                                <div class="figure-image-wrapper">
                                    <img src="../assets/images/image-20260119-f36a94c9.jpeg" alt="Unity of command diagram" class="figure-image">
                                    <div class="figure-overlay">
                                        <span class="overlay-icon">🔍</span>
                                        <span class="overlay-text">Click to zoom</span>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <figcaption class="figure-caption">FIG.5. Unity of command</figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <p>This makes manager-employee relationship as simple as possible and puts a limit to confusion, mistakes, excuses and delays in the daily process of duty functions. For example, in a hospital, the nurses in various wards are responsible to those in charge of the departments who in turn are responsible to the Chief Nurse. All problems are channeled through this unity of command.</p>

                            <h5>4. Team Work (Esprit De Corps)</h5>
                            <p>Harmony is a great strength to an organization. Team work has been defined as co-ordinated action by a group of individuals in regular contact wherein members contribute toward task achievement. Team work requires that each member understand and be capable of completing a portion of the team mission. Similarly each member must understand what is required of other team members and of entity in order to achieve success</p>
                            <p>Many areas of our work lives require that we work together in a smooth and efficient manner in order to achieve our objectives. A health care team includes nurses, doctors, allied health professionals and support staff who have to work together in order to deliver quality services to the patients/clients.</p>
                            <p>Openness and acceptance are the prime characteristics of an ideal team situation. The nurse manager has a task to build an effective team in order to accomplish their objectives.</p>

                            <h5>5. Centralization and Decentralization</h5>

                            <p>Let us now define each one of them and see how they differ.</p>

                            <h6>i. Centralization</h6>
                            <p>This is the systematic retention of power and responsibility at higher levels of the organization.</p>
                            <p>Organizations vary greatly in the degree of centralization. The degree may differ for different tasks and responsibilities.</p>
                            <p>The head nurse is responsible for centralized department where major decision making power and responsibility for key functions are centralized in the top level. Thus the Chief Nurse being responsible for eg. budgeting, staffing and quality assurance.</p>

                            <h6>ii. Decentralization</h6>
                            <p>Decentralization is where decision making and responsibility for key functions are delegated to the lowest possible managerial level in the department. Thus, a decentralized nursing department places most decision making at the head nurse level with each running her unit independent of the decisions of her peer head nurses</p>

                            </div>

                            <h5>6. Discipline</h5>
                            <p>You are familiar with the term because you have been involved in disciplining someone eg. Your child or sibling or a worker. On the other hand you may have been disciplined or punished because of violating rules and regulations either at home or work place.</p>
                            <p>The origin of the work "discipline" comes from the latin term "disciplina" which means teaching, learning. As put by Fayol, discipline is respect for agreements which are directed at achieving obedience, application, energy and the outward marks of respect. The primary emphasis in discipline is in assisting employees to behave in a manner that allows them to be self-directed in meeting organizational goals. Punishment may be applied for improper behaviour in constructive discipline which should be carried out in a supportive, corrective manner.</p>
                            <p>Management usually disciplines an employee for some of the following reasons:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Not meeting laid down standards of performance.</li>
                                <li>Violating the rules and policies.</li>
                                <li>Insubordination e.g. lack of respecting authority</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The highest level and most effective form of discipline is self discipline because the roles are internalized and become part of the individual's personality (Curtin, 1996). The manager plays a vital role in this. There are factors that must be present to foster a climate of self discipline. Let us look at the factors cited by Health Care Education Associates (1987). They include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Employee awareness and understanding of rules and regulations that govern behaviour. These must be clearly written and communicated to subordinates.</li>
                                <li>There must exist an atmosphere of mutual trust. The managers must believe that employees are capable of and actively seeking self discipline. Conversely, the employees must perceive the manager as honest and trustworthy.</li>
                                <li>Employees should identify with the goals of the organization. When this happens, they are more likely to accept the standards of conduct deemed acceptable by the organization.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Discipline, therefore is important for the smooth running of the organization. It should be used as a means of helping the employees grow but not as a punitive measure.</p>

                                <div class="callout-header">
                                    <span class="callout-icon">✍️</span>
                                    <h4 class="callout-title">Activity</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>What disciplinary process exists in your organization? Write down all the steps followed in disciplining an employee.</p>

                            </div>

                            <p>The following is a guideline on disciplinary process which can be applied on an employee who has violated e.g. Rules or regulations.</p>
                            
                            <h6>- Disciplinary Process</h6>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>Preliminary investigation.</li>
                                <li>A discussion (cordial) with the offender and a brief warning as to why further violations will not be tolerated.</li>
                                <li>A stronger verbal warning after a further violation of regulation.</li>
                                <li>A formal written warning.</li>
                                <li>A written warning accompanied by suspension from the job for a prescribed number of days.</li>
                                <li>Suspension from the job for a longer period of time.</li>
                                <li>Discharge with opportunity to appeal.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>This process provides an opportunity to make amends for violations of the rules and regulations.</p>
                            <p>Administering discipline is one of the most difficult and resented task but the manager has a responsibility over this. The main concern should focus on are providing staff who can give safe care to patients and helping employees grow as individual human beings.</p>

                            <h5>7. Unity of Direction (Management by Objectives)</h5>
                            <p>Unity of direction or “unity of Management” means there is a specific objective and that all the necessary efforts are co-ordinated under one authority. One head and one plan for a group of activities with the same objective.</p>
                            <p><strong>NB:</strong> This should not be confused with unity of command discussed earlier.</p>

                            <h5>8. Line Authority (The Scalar Principal/Chain)</h5>
                            <p>There should be a Hierarchy channel (structure) to ensure unity of command, efficient communication and the line of authority, from top to bottom in the organization. Superior delegates authority to subordinate who in turn delegates. It is a leader follower relationship. The organizational chart identifies lines of formal communication and authority.</p>

                            <h5>9. Subordination of Individual Interest to the General Interest</h5>
                            <p>This focuses on the notion that the interests of one individual or group should not prevail over that of the organization. If two are in conflict, management must reconcile them.</p>

                            <h5>10. Fair Rewards for Work Done (Remuneration or Compensation)</h5>
                            <p>This principle is concerned with ensuring that the remuneration of all members of an organization is satisfactory. Managers have to decide the most equitable method of calculating wages and what fringe benefits should be rewarded. The emphasis is that pay should be fair to both the employee and to the organization. Remuneration of employees is the price of service rendered.</p>

                            <h5>11. Justice and Fair Play (Order)</h5>
                            <p>The principle assumes a natural arrangement of both things and people. A place for everything and everything in its place; the right man in the right place. This implies good organization and good selection.</p>

                            <h5>12. Stability of Tenure of Personnel (Reasonable Labour Turnover)</h5>
                            <p>Employees need to be given time to settle or get used to new work and succeed in using it assuming he possesses required abilities. Fayol explains the problems and costs of unnecessary staff turnover. Nevertheless changes of personnel are inevitable e.g retirement, illness, death etc.</p>

                            <h5>13. Equity</h5>
                            <p>This is the notion that employee commitment will be gained through a combination of kindness and justice towards employees. All employees should be treated with equal fairness.</p>

                            <h5>14. Initiative</h5>
                            <p>Within the limits of authority and discipline, all levels of staff should be encouraged to show initiative. Initiative is the well-spring of innovative planning and a source of job satisfaction for the intelligent employees. It is a great source of strength in an organization.</p>

                            <h6>- Implications</h6>
                            <p>Henry Fayol endeavored to find rational principles that can be applied to the development and management of organizations. These principles have concentrated on such issues as division of labour, specialization and control of physical and human resources by means of hierarchical structure.</p>
                            <p>Several of the principles put forward by Fayol have been adopted by management in practice. The scalar chain or management hierarchy for example, is an integral part of most organizations today. Similarly, issues such as authority matching responsibility and the clear definitions of job and roles have also been absorbed into the thinking of many management teams. On the other hand, some of the principles advocated by Fayol have not found favor in practice. Questions of unity of command, fair treatment of staff and remuneration are not easy for modern management to install on a unilateral basis.</p>
                            <p>Today, various branches of management disciplines have developed their codes of conduct based on these principles but moderated to suit dynamic society since all employees at all levels are demanding more participation in decision making and more joint control of working conditions.</p>
                            <p>As future managers, you ought to have an open learning mind to contribute the growth in understanding of the human factor at work.</p>

                            <p>In this lecture we learned about principles of management. We briefly discussed about the various 14 principles of management as were put forward by Fayol which must be applied by the nurse manager as a leader. These included the division of labour, responsibility, authority, teamwork and discipline.</p>
