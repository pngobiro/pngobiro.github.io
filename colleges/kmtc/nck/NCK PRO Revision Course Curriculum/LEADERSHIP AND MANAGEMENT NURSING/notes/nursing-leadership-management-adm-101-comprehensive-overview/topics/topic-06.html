                            <p>By now you are able to manage resources within the organization. However, in the current health care system, we are experiencing a lot of changes including social, technological and educational. A lot of changes also have and continue to take place in the field of information, and the development of information technology is the focus in most organizations. All these confront managers and the organizations with many challenges. This topic covers management of both change and information systems as lecture 13: 1 and 13:2 respectively.</p>

                            <p>Change has always and will always be a part of us. During your life time you must have experienced change in one form or the other such as moving from one work station to another, acquisition of new skills or introduction of new methods of nursing care delivery. We live in a world of change.</p>
                            <p>Change is inevitable and nurse managers should understand and anticipate the reactions to change. How well managers meet these challenges can determine whether or not an organization will survive.</p>

                            <h4>11.2.1 What is Change?</h4>
                            <p>Change can be defined as the process of making something different from what it was.</p>

                            <h5>Change Management</h5>
                            <p>Yoder – Wise (2007) defines change management as the overall processes and strategies used to moderate and strategies used to moderate and manage the preparation for, impact of, responses to, and outcomes for conditions new and different than what existed previously.</p>
                            
                            <p>There are two basic approaches to the management of change (Bennett, 1997).</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>To forecast all environmental changes relevant to the organization that might occur and then forecast how the organization will be affected by them.</li>
                                <li>To list all the organization's major functions and follow this by an analysis of environmental factors that might affect the functions.</li>
                            </ol>

                            </div>

                            <p>Once the organization identifies the need for change, it should assess its implications. This may require :- Definition of alterations in operational methods, staffing levels and the employee's attitudes and perspectives necessary to implement alterations; new equipment and systems; Redesigning of jobs; restructuring of jobs or the organization.</p>

                            <h4>11.2.2 Resistance to Change</h4>
                            <p>The employees fear change because of its potential for disruption of existing status in the organization. Some of the reasons why people resist change include:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Insecurity, fear of unforeseen consequences and threats to individual status and financial rewards that it creates</li>
                                <li>Skills and experience acquired may have no further value and retraining may be necessary to cope with new methods</li>
                                <li>Possible breaking up of work groups and interpersonal relationships.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>11.2.3 Overcoming Resistance to Change</h4>
                            <p>To reduce or avoid resistance to change, we can help the employees to go through a change process. Kurt Lewin suggested three steps to overcome resistance:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>i. Unfreezing</strong><br>
                                    Getting rid of existing practices and ideas that stand in the way of change. This requires a high level of communication with employees to convince them that change is necessary.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>ii. Changing</strong><br>
                                    Teaching employees to think and perform differently.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>iii. Refreezing</strong><br>
                                    Establishing new norms and standard practices.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>To implement the above process the following approaches will be necessary:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Education and Communication</strong><br>
                                This is to make employees fully aware of all aspects of the situation and convince them that change is essential.</li>
                                <li><strong>Participation and Involvement</strong><br>
                                The employees should actively participate and get involved from the beginning so as to stimulate commitment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Patience and Tolerance</strong><br>
                                Give support and assistance needed.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A nurse manager has an important role in initiating and managing change. He/she should recognize the obstacles and assist the employees to go through the change process.</p>

                            <h4>11.2.4 Change Agents</h4>
                            <p>The role of change agents has been advocated by some managers. A change agent is a person who fosters change within an organization. More often than not, the change agent is an external management consultant who specializes in this type of work. However, Institutions can identify one of their own as a change agent. Outsiders might be more objective though they may lack the detailed knowledge of the day to day operations of the organization that the latter may have.</p>
                            <p>The change agent may advise on job and organization design, need for retraining and management development.</p>

                            <p>Most of our health institutions have massive information about the clients/patients who are the consumers of their services.</p>
                            <p>They also have information on administrative matters related to staff, equipment, supplies, etc. All this information is kept in records which are either in written documents, tapes or computers. Records are an important tool in controlling and assessing the work and therefore should be accurate, accessible and useful.</p>
                            <p>An effective health information system is important in order to get health information required for appropriate planning and decision making. It also assists in monitoring and evaluating the various activities within the organization.</p>
                            <p>In this lecture, we will briefly discuss Information Technology (IT) and management of health information systems</p>

                            <h4>11.3.1 Information Technology (IT)</h4>
                            <p>This is the acquisition, processing and dissemination of information using computers. Whereas in the past and even today in some institutions, information handling involved dependence on paper, the emphasis now is shifting to creation, storage and transmission of information through tiny electrical impulses.</p>
                            <p>Paper no doubt will continue to be important as tangible product of interchange of information. Nevertheless the computers are likely to dominate the scene.</p>
                            
                            <p>The advantages of use of IT include:</p>

                            <h4>11.4 Health Information Systems</h4>
                            <p>This is an integrated system used in health care settings to manage patient information. It is primarily a centralized patient record of demographics, health and financial information. (Yoderwise, 2007).</p>
                            <p>The information is entered, stored, retrieved, displayed and communicated. A major function is to communicate and integrate patient care data and information and provide management support.</p>
                            <p>Health data are entered into the system from computer stations located in the various departments in the organization and stored in a central computer to be accessed by all patient care services. The systems contain a central data base that is written to and accessed by all departments; Nursing, Laboratory, Pharmacy, Radiology, Physiotherapy and so on. The programs that link the individual departments must be able to "talk" to one another in order to exchange patient data. For example the wards need access to Laboratory results or Pharmacy may need access to ward to access information like height, weight and allergy information entered by nursing.</p>

                            </div>

                            <p>The nurse managers and staff must understand the patient care process from a data information knowledge perspective. They must be aware of the data collected, reasons why it is collected and decisions made based on the data.</p>
                            
                            <p>The type of information tracked in this system includes:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Appointments, admissions, discharges and transfers.</li>
                                <li>Medication profiles - prescriptions, allergy reports</li>
                                <li>Care planning.</li>
                                <li>Patient acuities.</li>
                                <li>Human resource eg. pay roll, staff performance, incident reports and staff scheduling.</li>
                                <li>Plans eg. budgeting information.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The information system must provide the following (Yoder-Wise, 2007):</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Information confidentiality and security.</li>
                                <li>Uniform data definitions.</li>
                                <li>Standard format for transmitting data.</li>
                                <li>Sharing of information between departments.</li>
                                <li>Linking of clinical and financial information.</li>
                                <li>Patient specific data.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>An effective health information system is important in order to get health information required for appropriate planning and decision making. It also assists in monitoring and evaluating the various activities within the organization.</p>

                            <h3>Summary</h3>
                            <p>This lecture covered management of change and health information systems</p>
                            <p>Although change is inevitable, the main reasons why people resist are insecurity and fear of unforeseen. The three steps to overcome these include unfreezing, changing and refreezing. The importance of health information systems cannot be overemphasized. The system is used in health settings to manage patient information in a centralized manner. It involves use of computers where data is entered, stored, retrieved, displayed and communicated.</p>

                            <h3>Self Assessment Question (SAQ)</h3>
