                            <p>In the previous chapter, we covered the topics of leadership and principles of management. Under this topic we will discuss the functions of management which are frequently applied by the nurse manager. These will include: planning, organizing, controlling, staffing and delegating. Other concepts which will be discussed include decision making and problem solving.</p>

                            <p>In your training, you learned about the nursing process and the various stages involved and how you are apply it in practice. Planning is also a continuous process which involves going through similar stages.</p>

                            <h4>4.2 What is Planning</h4>
                            <p>This is simply defined as deciding in advance what will and will not be done in the next minute, hours, days, months or years.</p>
                            <p>Planning is advance thinking as a basis for doing. It involves what needs to be done, how it will be done and whether it was done. Planning therefore is having a specific objective or purpose and mapping out a method before hand.</p>
                            <p>Plans affect how people will work and for how long.</p>
                            <p>When planning we should consider the seen and unseen and consider that all factors influence one another.</p>
                            <p>We live in an era of change and therefore we need to plan our activities.</p>

                            <p>The planning process includes a series of activities which the nurse manager sets out to do. The process is subject to change as new facts are known. If plans are fixed and unchangeable, then they may fail.</p>
                            <p>The nurse plans and develops specific goals and objectives for his/her area of responsibility.</p>
                            <p>The process of planning is comprised of four stages. These are :- (Figure 6)</p>

                            <p>Let us discuss each of these stages:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Assessment</strong>: This is the first stage in the process. It involves identifying and clarifying the problem, that is, diagnosing a problem. A good diagnosis says what is wrong eg. a situation which needs improvement, like the standards of nursing care. The question to be asked is: where is the problem and what are the hindrances that are affecting achievement?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Setting Goals</strong>: The next stage of planning process is establishing goals to be achieved. These determine the direction of activities and serve as guides for action. It is important to determine the goals in terms of short term, medium or long term.
                                    <p>Developing a set of actions for achieving objectives and selecting promising solutions from alternatives. One should be concerned with what could be done to overcome problems identified. This requires imagination and originality. Alternatives must be analyzed and compared.</p>
                                    <p>The alternatives can range from doing nothing or finding a means around the problem.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Implementation</strong>: is the third stage which is very important because if plans are not implemented they remain theoretical. Some of the principles of management discussed in chapter 2 eg. division of labour, responsibility and accountability are put into practice.
                                    <p>Implementation involves decision making which is the core of planning. These decisions deal with the following issues:-</p>
                                    <p>Activities: Are they carried out as planned and are services delivered as intended?</p>
                                    <p>People (manpower): Are they adequate, at the right place and right time to perform the activities?</p>
                                    <p>Resources: What are the physical, financial and information resources needed to perform the activities?</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Evaluation</strong>: This is the last stage in the planning process. It involves determining the extent to which objectives were achieved. The concern for the nurse is to find out the effectiveness or achievement of results, efficiency in the performance of its activities and the economic use of resources. The two questions one would ask are:-
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Are the results as intended?</li>
                                        <li>Are the results of value?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>If the above answer is 'yes' to both questions then the decision would be likely to carry on as planned. If negative, the decision will be to re-open the objectives or activities or both.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>4.2.2 Purposes of Planning (Significance)</h4>
                            <p>Planning has many important purposes which include some of the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Contributes to a purposeful organization.</li>
                                <li>Reduces costs. Efforts will be better directed toward desired results.</li>
                                <li>Provides for integration and coordination of activities.</li>
                                <li>Haphazard approaches can be minimized and duplications avoided.</li>
                                <li>Provides for consistency of action which is necessary so that both internal and external people can anticipate the organizations performance.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>4.2.3 Planning Period</h4>
                            <p>A manager usually makes a distinction between long-range and short range planning. The definitions of these depend on manager's level in the organizational hierarchy and the type of organization.</p>
                            <p>Most managers define short term planning as that which covers a period of up to one year.</p>
                            <p>Long term involves a time interval of three, five or ten years or more. A nurse supervisor's planning period is usually within the short range. For many activities planning will be for a week, a day or a shift e.g scheduling of nurses to work in a ward or department.</p>

                            <h4>4.2.4 Difficulties Encountered In Planning</h4>
                            <p>The manager needs to anticipate and recognize that difficulties arise during planning e.g. planning for a nurse to go on night duty and the same calling that she is sick.</p>
                            <p>Problems come up continuously, usually without any sequence of priority and importance.</p>
                            <p>The manager needs to consider how to overcome the difficulties. One method used is to "sort and grade" which involves:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Deciding which matters the supervisor /manager should handle personally and those which should be delegated to someone else.</li>
                                <li>Classifying problems according to priority – most urgent to be attended first.</li>
                                <li>Flexibility in time schedules is important – in case of emergencies which arise. This allows to take care of these situations without significantly disrupting personal time schedules.</li>

                            <h5>Examples of Difficulties</h5>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Plans tend to be slow when joint efforts of several individuals are needed.</li>
                                <li>There is friction as people bring together their ideas to make a decision.</li>

                            <h5>Overcoming Difficulties</h5>
                            <p>Many techniques have been used to help managers control their time schedules. Time management is of essence here. The manager can do the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Use desk calendars – This is one of the simplest methods. Note those items which need major attention e.g. meetings, appointments, reports, discussions. Schedule events as far in advance as practicable.</li>
                                <li>Keep a planning sheet for each week – prepare at the end of one week for the week to follow.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>4.3 Strategic Planning</h4>
                            <p>Strategic planning has grown in importance over the last 10 or so years.</p>
                            <p>This is the process directed by top management to determine the fundamental aims or goals of the organization and ensure a range of decisions which will allow for the achievement of those goals in the long term while providing for adaptive responses in the shorter term ( Bennet,2004). Strategic management has come as a result of increased complexity in modern organizations due to many factors. Some of these are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Increased expectations of customers for quality</li>
                                <li>Rapid advance in technology – This has revolutionalised many processes and services.</li>
                                <li>Competitions by organizations</li>
                                <li>Emphasis on consumer rights which the clients are demanding</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It is important to design organizational structures that will respond to changes taking place in the current health care e environment. The key factors influencing organizations are the vision, mission and philosophy statements and objectives.</p>
                            <p>The key management issues for strategic management focus on importance of establishing a vision, mission, goals of the organization and development of shared values or philosophy and developing a culture. The need to understand external environment is also essential. All these play a significant role in relation to customers, competitors, suppliers, technological, economical and political trends.</p>

                            <dl class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <dt>Vision</dt>
                                <dd>Vision statements are future oriented, purposeful and are designed to identify the desired future of the organization e.g. the hospital intends to be the best in terms of quality services delivered.</dd>
                                
                                <dt>Mission</dt>
                                <dd>This is the statement that communicates the reason for the organization's existence or being. It identifies the organization's customers, types of services offered. It enacts the vision statement.</dd>
                                
                                <dt>Philosophy</dt>
                                <dd>It states what values, beliefs held about the nature of work it is required to accomplish, the mission and the nature and rights of both the customers and employees.</dd>
                                
                                <dt>Objectives or Goals</dt>
                                <dd>The ends that an organization must achieve in order to carry out its mission. Objectives are considered as translation of the mission into specific, concrete terms against which actual result can be measured more easily.</dd>
                            </dl>

                            <p>Strategic planning should address the following questions:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>What is our core business?</li>
                                <li>Where do we want to be in 5, 10, 20 years time? And what do we have to do in order to get there?</li>
                                <li>What resources are we likely to acquire?</li>
                                <li>What change are we likely to have and how can we cope with our operating environment?</li>
                                <li>How can we gain and retain competitive advantage over others?</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>In devising strategic plans, the organization should analyze itself and plan activities according to the needs. One of the common approaches used is the SWOT (Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis. The strengths and weaknesses are assessed in relation to availability of e.g existing staff and skill levels; resources like supplies, materials; services available in terms of quality and delivery. Opportunities and threats are usually in the external environment. Opportunities are e.g. prospects of new products or services like a new x-ray machine or new outpatient services. The threats come from e.g competitors, change in public taste or economic depression. The manager should try to seize the opportunities and remove the threats.</p>
                            <p>Top management is challenged to ensure it has a healthy and prosperous future for the continuous growth and development of the organization.</p>

                            <h4>4.4.1 Definition of Organizing</h4>
                            <p>It is the process of grouping the necessary responsibilities and activities into workable units, determining the lines of authority, communication, developing patterns of coordinating and giving feedback.</p>
                            <p>By organizing we are attempting to answer the question: How will the work be divided and accomplished? To answer the question the manager must define, group and assign duties.</p>
                            <p>There are certain basic issues to consider. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Setting up structure – structured aspects of the organization must be set up which indicate the activities to be performed and lines of responsibility and authority.</li>
                                <li>Developing procedures and policies.</li>
                                <li>Determining organizational requirements and deciding how duties will be performed.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>4.4 Organizations and Organizational Structure</h4>
                            <p>Organization refers to the structure that is designed to support organizational process. It is important to design organizational structures that will respond to changes taking place in the current health care environment.</p>
                            <p>The key factors influencing organizations are the vision, mission and philosophy statements and objectives (Discussed in previous topic).</p>

                            <h4>4.5.1 Types of Organizations</h4>
                            <p>An organization is made up of a group of people who have united together to pursue and accomplish a common purpose as one team. This collective effort and the pooling of resources to achieve a common aim is what is termed as organization e.g business firms, hospitals, clubs, and churches. There are two different types of organizations, namely formal and informal.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Formal</strong> – Those organizations whose membership and activities are governed by certain specified rules and procedures which determine the degree of authority and behavior of each participating member e.g government ministries, non-profit making organization, business companies.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When designing the departmental organizational structure, the manager should plan for an ideal organization</p>
                            <p>The ideal organization is defined as that structure which the manager believes is most desirable for the achievement of the Departmental objectives.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Informal</strong> – These are social groups or “cliques” which develop within formal organizations in order to fulfill individual social needs e.g. according to social interests like welfare society.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>No formal organization will operate efficiently without an accompanying informal organization.</p>

                            <h4>4.5.2 Organizational Structure</h4>
                            <p>Organizational structure refers to how work is organized, where decisions are made and the authority and responsibility of workers. Structure is a map of communication and decision making paths. Organization structure is an important tool through which managers can increase organization efficiency.</p>
                            <p>It depicts the expression of responsibility relationships among people and jobs. The organizational structure is graphically portrayed by the organizational chart. This is a pattern to show how parts are put together to accomplish a particular purpose.</p>
                            <p>Individual positions are shown as rectangular boxes each representing a job. The chart shows:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Areas of responsibility.</li>
                                <li>To whom and for whom each person is accountable.</li>
                                <li>Major channels of formal communication.</li>
                                <li>Interdepartmental relationships.</li>

                            <h4>4.6 Organizational Communication</h4>
                            <p>In your communication course, you discussed the principles and importance of communication.</p>
                            <p>There is no organization that can exist without communication. Communication is referred to as the lifeblood of an organization.</p>
                            <p>Communication is the need of creating common understanding. It is therefore the process of transmitting ideas and information from one person (sender) to another or group of people (receivers).</p>
                            <p>Organizational communication is the exchange of information within the organization. While employees' communications are the responsibilities of the managers, the manager's work may be supplemented through already established means of communication within an organization. In any organization, there exists both formal and informal communication.</p>
                            <p>The formal communication system mainly used is based on the chain of command from the top of the organization to the bottom. This is used for all official messages including directives, procedures, policies, job instructions etc.</p>
                            <p>The informal communication – System is usually oral and not crucial to the functioning of the organization. It generates from informal groupings e.g associations or welfare. In most cases, messages are transmitted through “grapevine” or rumors and sometimes the communication is distorted or groundless. Since it can cause fear and anxiety among staff, the manager should be aware of them to reinforce the formal system.</p>
                            <p>The role of the manager is to use positive informal communication to the maximum for the benefit of organization. He/she must discourage any which may not work in the interest of organization success. There is need to establish proper formal channels and use them for all information that employees need to know.</p>

                            <h4>4.6.1 Flow of Communication in an Organization</h4>
                            <p>The Manager is responsible for passing information through vertical channels of communication which includes both downward and upward flow of communication.</p>

                            <h5>I. Vertical Flow:</h5>
                            <p>The Manager is responsible for passing information through vertical channels of communication which includes both downward and upward flow of communication.</p>

                            <h6>a) Downward Communication:</h6>
                            <p>Most information within organizations move from top downward, that is, top management to employees. This may be through face to face, written materials e.g memos or circulars. The purpose is mainly to inform employees of their job responsibilities, commitment to the objectives and any other relevant information.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Some barriers to this include:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Manager may withhold information.</li>
                                <li>The employee may fail to understand the message.</li>
                                <li>Employee may get information not relevant to their needs and do not get information they need.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h6>b) Upward Communication:</h6>
                            <p>This is the flow of information from bottom – up or subordinates to supervisor. Ideally information should pass freely up the chain of command so that management gets the feedback needed to evaluate results and initiate improvements.</p>
                            <p><strong>Barriers to upward communication may include:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>If employees feel management is not interested in their ideas, they will not offer them.</li>
                                <li>Sometimes, bad news get blocked and is not communicated to the top management.</li>
                                <li>Delays in relying messages.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Therefore a two way exchange of information is essential in organizations and managers must ensure that there is feedback at all levels.</p>

                            <h5>2. Horizontal Flow</h5>
                            <p>This is the flow of information where managers communicate with each other at a professional level or employees of equal rank exchange information including opinions or news.</p>

                            <h4>5.1.2 Staffing Process</h4>
                            <p>The process of staffing involves: Recruitment, Selection, Induction and Scheduling</p>
                            <p>Let us examine the meaning of each of the above terms:</p>

                            <h5>i. Recruitment</h5>
                            <p>This is the first part of the process and it involves filling a vacancy. It is the drafting or revision of the job specification for the vacant position, outlining the qualifications, experience, skills and the responsibilities involved.</p>
                            <p>The vacancy is then advertised to source suitable candidates. The sources could be internal, that is, from within the organization or external.</p>

                            <h5>ii. Selection</h5>
                            <p>Selecting is the next stage which involves matching the requirements of the job with the attributes of the candidate. The process includes assessing the candidate by various means eg. Interviewing and screening. The purpose of this is to obtain information. Selection testing including achievement, aptitude, intelligence and personality may also be used. These are followed by offer of employment</p>

                            <h5>iii. Induction</h5>
                            <p>This is the process of receiving employees when they begin work, introducing them to the organization and to their colleagues and informing them of the activities, and the culture of the organization. This may be regarded as the orientation or beginning of training.</p>

                            <h5>iv. Scheduling(Duty Roster)</h5>
                            <p>After induction is given, the employee is assigned the tasks to be performed. The schedules for work and time off should meet organizational goals with fairness and equality among personnel. A schedule should adhere to following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Policies, standards and practices of the organization on the use of professional and paraprofessional personnel (Supportive staff).</li>
                                <li>Appropriate ratio or balance between professional and supportive staff. This is in order to deliver continuity of services nursing care.</li>
                                <li>Approved budget. The manager should consider the financial resources within the organization.</li>
                                <li>Consideration of vacations and consideration of allowance of adjustment in case of illness, emergencies or changes in patient care needs.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It is important to inform staff members of their work schedules at least 1-3 weeks in advance. This allows time for planning.</p>

                            <h4>5.1.3 Factors Affecting Staffing</h4>
                            <p>Various factors affect nursing staffing or determinations. The manager needs to be sensitive about these in order to achieve the objectives of staffing. One is the need to provide hospital and nursing services 24 hours a day.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Patient factors e.g Unpredictability of the patient census, variety of patient conditions, patient population, and care needs.</li>
                                <li>Staff factors including, experiences and expectations of the organization, job descriptions, education level and personnel requirements.</li>
                                <li>Health care organization factors e.g. policies and procedures, resources available and number of beds per unit</li>
                                <li>Since each setting is unique, there is no guide that can stipulate the correct number of personnel needed to provide quality care but systems have been developed for guidance eg. patient classification system which is a method of grouping patients according to the amount and complexity of their nursing care requirements. In this case patients are grouped according to the nursing time, effort and ability required to provide care.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>5.1.4 Types of Schedules (Rosters)</h4>
                            <p>The two types of schedules frequently used are centralized and decentralized.</p>

                            <h5>i. Centralized Schedules</h5>
                            <p>These are completed by matron (Chief Nurse) or designate who develops a master plan for nursing personnel in the hospital or health facility.</p>
                            <p>The advantages for these are that they:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Provide overall picture of the staffing situation.</li>
                                <li>Enable easier adjustments in case of illness or emergencies or changes in patient care needs among the departments.</li>
                                <li>Eliminate personnel biases or prejudices</li>
                                <li>Reduce frequent requests by staff for special privileges.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Some of the disadvantages include:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Denies manager the right to make scheduling decision.</li>
                                <li>The person making them has limited knowledge of workers abilities, interests or needs and also limited knowledge of nursing needs in separate departments.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>ii. Decentralized Schedules</h5>
                            <p>These schedules have a more personal approach than the previous ones.</p>
                            <p>The middle and lower level of management determine scheduling e.g ward in charges.</p>
                            <p>The advantages for this are that the Nurse Manager is accountable. Secondly, the scheduling based on knowledge of personnel and patient needs. There is greater control of activities such that the manager can rearrange schedules as needed.</p>
                            <p>There are also some disadvantages of this type of schedule. These are</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Increased number of requests for special privileges.</li>
                                <li>Many result in insufficient numbers of qualified personal to meet unforeseen needs.</li>
                                <li>May be time consuming.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Once you are responsible and accountable for patient care activities, you will find that there are times when a job gets too big and part of it must be entrusted to someone else. In doing so, the manager is supposed to make decisions. Decision making is an important element of management</p>

                            <p>What is delegation?</p>

                            <h4>6.1 Definition</h4>
                            <p>Delegation is defined as the purpose by which responsibility and authority for performing a task (function, activity or decision) is transferred to another individual who accepts that authority and responsibility (Sullivan and Decker, 1992, pg 216).</p>
                            <p>Although the delegator remains accountable for the task, the delegate is also accountable to the delegator for responsibilities assumed.</p>

                            <h5>Delegation is a dynamic process which involves 3 factors:-</h5>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Responsibility for work delegated - willingness to do the assigned work or an obligation to accomplish a task.</li>
                                <li>Accountability - obligation to carry out the responsibility or authority or act of accepting ownership for the results or lack thereof.</li>
                                <li>Authority - the right to act or empower.</li>
                            </ol>

                                    <p>In delegation, responsibility and authority are transferred while accountability is shared. The principle to remember about delegation is :- You can delegate only those tasks for which you are responsible.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>To clearly understand who is responsible, the manager must consider the following;</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Practice acts – These determine the scope of nursing practice.</li>
                                <li>Policy statements regarding the quality of care and the standards of care</li>
                                <li>Job descriptions for various positions- This is to enable delegate specific responsibilities</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>6.1.1 Delegation Process</h4>
                            <p>The process of delegation involves the following activities which a manager requires to do:</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>i. Defining the task</strong> – The manager should first determine what can and should be delegated eg.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Routine tasks</li>
                                <li>Tasks for which you do not have time</li>
                                <li>Tasks that have moved down in priority</li>
                                <li>Problem solving issues</li>
                                <li>Staff development</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>ii. Evaluating the task</strong></p>
                            <p>What technical skill or cognitive abilities does the task require? e.g Performance of specific procedures, knowledge level.</p>

                            <p><strong>iii. Determining who should do it</strong></p>
                            <p>Once the abilities for the task is determined, the manager identifies the right person for the job. This is done through matching the tasks to the individual and analyzing individual skills and capabilities, experiences and individual characteristics eg. Initiative, enthusiasm, knowledge.</p>

                            <p><strong>iv. Providing clear communication about expectations regarding the task.</strong></p>
                            <p>It is important to communicate effectively with the delegate. To do this the manager must:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Plan a meeting with the delegate</li>
                                <li>Describe the task</li>
                                <li>Give reasons for the task</li>
                                <li>Inform the delegate by what standard the task will be evaluated</li>
                                <li>Identify any constraints for completing the tasks</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>v. Reaching agreement</strong></p>
                            <p>The manager then seeks agreement from delegate that he/she is accepting responsibility and authority for the task.</p>

                            <p><strong>vi. Monitoring performance and providing feedback</strong></p>
                            <p>Monitoring provides a mechanism for feedback and control that ensures that delegated tasks are carried out as agreed. The manager should analyze performance according to established goals.</p>

                            <h4>6.1.2 Some Problems That Hinder Delegation</h4>
                            <p>Delegation is good because it frees the manager to do the most important tasks. Some of the problems which may affect both the delegator are:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Manager is reluctant to delegate adequately to his/her subordinates. In some cases some will delegate responsibility and <strong>not</strong> authority.</li>
                                <li>A manager will fail to delegate because she can do a better job.</li>
                                <li>A manager may lack the ability to communicate to people what is to be done.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>On the other hand, the subordinate or delegate may:</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Not accept delegated tasks because it is easier to ask the manager than to decide for themselves how to deal with a problem.</li>
                                <li>Fear criticism for mistakes made. This keeps subordinates from accepting responsibility.</li>
                                <li>Lack necessary information and resources or non-supportive environment which creates an attitude that might make a person reject further assignments).</li>
                                <li>Lack self confidence.</li>
                                <li>Fear liability - some individuals do not like to take risks.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>6.1.3 Effective delegation</h4>
                            <p>For delegation to be effective the following must be considered:-</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The manager and her immediate subordinate must have good interpersonal relationship.</li>
                                <li>The manager must have good administrative skills to be able to delegate.</li>
                                <li>The assigned duties should be well understood, well defined and well written to both of them.</li>
                                <li>The person to whom work is to be delegated must be assisted to become self sufficient.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>6.1.4 Benefits of delegation</h4>
                            <p>Every activity we perform has some benefits to the people involved as well as the organization. The benefits of delegation to the delegator are that she/he will be able to devote more time to those tasks that cannot be delegated and also have more time available to enable develop new skills and abilities.</p>
                            <p>The delegate also has some benefits. He/she gets an opportunity to build self esteem, - confidence and exercise initiative resulting in job motivation and satisfaction. The delegate similarly gains new skills and abilities and learns to make decisions independently. These enable to facilitate upward mobility.</p>
                            <p>The organization benefits because teamwork improves and the goals are achieved more efficiently.</p>
                            <p>The quality of care improves leading to increased patient satisfaction.</p>

                            <h5>6.2.1 Definition</h5>
                            <p>Decision making is defined as a reasoning or emotional process which can be rational or irrational. It is an accepted part of everyday human life. It can be regarded as an outcome of mental processes leading to the selection of a course of action among several alternatives.</p>
                            <p>Individuals make decisions at the spur of the moment, after much thought or at some point between these two.</p>
                            <p>Managers are expected to make decisions as part of their responsibilities.</p>
                            <p>Decision making and problem solving are important skills for management and life. Problem solving involves decision making. The two are closely linked and require creativity in identifying and developing options.</p>

                            <h5>6.2.2 Types of Decisions</h5>
                            <p>These range from a vital once-for-all nature to those of routine and trivial nature. The following have been identified as some of the types of decisions made by managers:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Strategic Decisions – Long term decisions based on principal goals and objectives eg. Major policy statements</li>
                                <li>Operating Decisions – Short term decisions routine and repetitive – e.g. schedules or inventory levels.</li>
                                <li>Administrative Decisions – Concerned with organization structure eg. Communication.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Nurse Managers/Supervisors make many types of decisions mainly related to e.g. Staffing and deployment of staff, Patient care, Disciplinary, Training and development.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The other important function of management is controlling. The manager must ensure that the work is done according to the objectives set and activities planned within the allocated time and with resources provided.</p>

                            <h4>Objectives</h4>
                            <p>By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:</p>

                            </ol>

                            <h4>7.1 Definition</h4>
                            <p>Controlling is the managerial function concerned with making sure plans succeed. It means measuring and correcting performance of employees to ensure that the planned objectives of an organization are achieved. Controlling involves regulation of activities so that some targeted element of performance remains within acceptable limits.</p>

                            <h4>7.2 Importance of Control</h4>
                            <p>In the control function, the nurse manager needs to take into account both external and internal environments because they will influence the way she/he functions.</p>
                            <p>i. <strong>External Environment</strong>: This will include laws and acts which regulate institutions eg. the Nursing Practice Act, which regulates nursing practice in terms of registration and licensure. This is in order to maintain standards of nursing care services.</p>
                            <p>ii. <strong>Internal Environment</strong>: This is part of self regulation within the organization or nursing department eg. quality care of patients, staffing, budget reports.</p>
                            <p>The nurse manager uses the function of control in order to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Ensure work is done according to objectives set and activities as planned within the allocated time and with resources provided.</li>
                                <li>Enable supervisors to recognize gaps in staff's knowledge and understanding and arrange for appropriate training.</li>
                                <li>Ensure that the resources provided by management for the work are adequate and are being properly used.</li>
                                <li>Enable management to identify the cause of work deficiencies.</li>
                                <li>Enable management to recognize and reward good work and recognize suitable staff.</li>
                                <li>Catch mistakes before they are critical - bear in mind that prevention is better than cure.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>7.3 Elements of Control</h4>
                            <p>These are very important and the nurse manager must ensure that all staff is conversant with them.</p>

                            <h5>7.3.1 Establishing the Standards</h5>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The first step involves formulating standards.</li>
                                <li>Standards are yardsticks against which nurse managers devise controls.</li>
                                <li>They are a way to measure and evaluate quality and quantity of performance.</li>
                                <li>Closely related to organizational goals but are more specific.</li>
                                <li>People must understand the results desired to avoid confusion.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The standards will be tangible and objective. They are physical standards which pertain to actual operation of the department. These can be quantitative or qualitative eg. Number of nurses to cover the duty per shift and quality of care expected.</p>
                            <p>The intangible Standards include such things as reputation of the hospital, the morale of employees whether high or low, attitudes and relationships or complaints. These are difficult to measure but can be assessed with a degree of confidence.</p>

                            <h5>7.3.2 Measuring actual performance</h5>
                            <p>After setting standards, they must be measured to identify their achievement.</p>
                            <p>This can be done by personally observing the work through direct observation and checking on employees. The manager should assume questioning attitude not necessarily fault finding. Observations for control should include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Inadequate output or improperly performed jobs.</li>
                                <li>Detection of deviations from expected standards.</li>
                                <li>Comparing actual performance with the standards.</li>
                            </ul>

                                    <p>It is important to interpret the deviations from standards eg. Some deviations may be due to temporary circumstances. Patients may not have had bed baths done due to fewer nurses on duty than due to poor performance.</p>

                            <h5>7.3.3 Corrective action</h5>
                            <p>This stage focuses on correction following identification of deviation from the norm. If performance falls short of standards, then analysis indicates that action is required. Managers/Supervisors must decide what remedial action is necessary to get improved results in the near future.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <h3>Summary of Topic</h3>
                            <p>In this topic, we discussed the various functions of management which are crucial for a nurse manager. The first function was planning which involves having a specific objective or purpose and mapping out the method of achieving beforehand. The process of planning includes assessment, setting goals, implementation and evaluation. Staffing was the next function where the manager allocates human resource in the day to-day operation of the ward/unit. It is also concerned with recruitment, selection, and induction and scheduling.</p>
                            <p>The other functions discussed included organizing and controlling. The former is where the manager groups responsibilities and activities into workable units and determines patterns of coordination. Controlling is where the manager ensures that the plans succeed. This involves measuring and correcting performance of employees in order to achieve organizational objectives. Finally delegating and decision making were discussed as important elements of management.</p>
