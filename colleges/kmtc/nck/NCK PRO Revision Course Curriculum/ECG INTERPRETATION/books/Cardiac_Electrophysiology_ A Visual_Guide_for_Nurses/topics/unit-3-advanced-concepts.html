                            <p>Tachycardias are caused by one of three underlying mechanisms: reentry, enhanced automaticity, and triggered activity. Conceptually, it helps to categorise these mechanisms into one of two major categories:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Macro-reentrant circuits</li>
                                <li>Focal tachycardias</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Macro reentry is essentially a self-perpetuating loop of electrical activity that often incorporates a large area of the atrium, ventricle, or both. In a reentrant circuit, there is a leading "head" of depolarization and a trailing "tail" of recovery where the head is constantly chasing the tail (depicted by the circular black arrows). Examples include atrial flutter, AVNRT, and AVRT. These tachycardias require a zone of fast conduction and a zone of slow conduction.</p>
                            <p>In contrast, focal tachycardias emanate from a point source in the heart (depicted by the green star) and are not dependent on a large circuit of electrical activity. A typical example of a focal tachycardia is atrial tachycardia. Two possible mechanisms of a focal tachycardia are automaticity and triggered activity, both of which lead to abnormal spontaneous depolarizations of a myocardial cell.</p>
                            <p>Automaticity is a normal property of some specialized cells such as the sinus node. Automaticity can be an unexpected property in abnormal cells such as those found in a focal atrial tachycardia. Triggered activity is the abnormal spontaneous depolarization of cells during or immediately following the normal recovery period of the cell (called "after-depolarizations"). Triggered activity can be initiated by excess calcium in the cell.</p>

                                    <p>The mechanism of the tachycardia is relevant to the EP study because it affects the manner in which the tachycardia is induced and studied. Macro-reentrant rhythms are more readily induced using extra-stimuli pacing, whereas triggered or automatic rhythms are less readily induced using pacing maneuvers.</p>

                            <p>By convention, most of the intracardiac EGMs are bipolar recordings. However, there are differences between unipolar and bipolar recordings that can be exploited. A bipolar recording refers to the use of two poles (a positive and negative electrode) in close proximity to one another. A unipolar recording must also use two poles to generate an EGM but refers to the use of a single pole (by convention, the positive electrode) in contact with the area of interest and a distant second electrode (by convention, the negative electrode).</p>
                            <p>A unipolar EGM tends to represent more of a global picture of the cardiac depolarization, whereas a bipolar EGM tends to represent depolarization in a specific area (between the two bipoles). Since we are usually primarily interested in the timing of local electrical activity, bipolar EGMs are generally recorded.</p>
                            <p>However, specific situations, such as mapping for a point source of activity, can call for unipolar recordings. For example, when mapping for a left-sided AP, the mapping catheter is moved along the mitral annulus. As the ventricle is paced, the earliest part of the atrium to be activated localizes the AP. This figure shows the mitral valve as seen from the left atrium. The unipolar EGM is useful because any electrical activity propagating in a direction toward a unipolar recording pole will create a positive deflection (an R-wave).</p>
                            <p>Any electrical activity propagating away from a unipolar recording pole will create a negative deflection (a Q-wave). Only when the catheter tip is placed at the site of the AP will all electrical activity emanate away from the unipolar electrode (green arrows). Therefore, when the unipolar EGM begins with a Q-wave, this suggests that the catheter is at the source of earliest activity and will likely be a good target to ablate.</p>

                            <p>With respect to pacing, the latent period is defined as the time period between delivery of the pacing stimulus and the local depolarization of the myocardium. Typically, the latent period is very small and the local depolarization immediately follows the pacing stimulus. An increase in latency refers to an increase in the delay of local capture of the myocardium from a paced impulse.</p>
                            <p>Latency increases when the pacing cycle length approaches the absolute refractory period of the myocardial cells. For example, when an S2 is delivered very tightly coupled to the last S1, there is an increased delay before the resulting EGM is seen. In this figure, the orange arrow indicates local capture immediately after the pacing spike during the S1 drive train. The green arrow points to the local capture following the S2. Notice that the time delay between the pacing spike and the EGM is much longer.</p>

                                    <p>There are two relevant consequences of latency. The first is that when increasing latency is seen, one can expect that with slightly shorter coupling intervals the myocardium will likely lose capture. In other words, the coupling interval is approaching the absolute refractory period of the myocardial cells.</p>
                                    <p>The second consequence is that the latency period affects the EP response of the heart. For example, when delivering an atrial extra-stimulus with a coupling interval of 600-300 msec, due to increased latency after the S2, the atrium may only capture at a coupling interval of 600-310 msec (ie, 10 msec of latency). This delay in atrial depolarization, although apparently minor, can lead to effects such as the gap phenomenon described on the next page.</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, the delay also affects the measurement of intervals. For example, when attempting to measure the ERP of the AV node, the pacing stimulus may be delivered at 600-300 msec, but this interval is not relevant to the AV node. What is relevant to the AV node is the coupling interval of the atrial depolarization reaching the AV node. Differences between the S1 and S2 with respect to latency and other factors, such as delay in transatrial conduction time, may result in atrial depolarization at the AV node of 600-315 msec. Therefore, if the AV node blocks with this delivered extra-stimulus, the ERP of the node is not 600-300 msec. Rather, it is 600-315 msec.</p>
                                    <p>Always measure the ERP of any structure using the catheter closest to that structure!</p>

                            <p>Gap phenomenon refers to the observation of unexpected resumption of conduction when delivering incrementally shorter S1-S2 coupled extra-stimuli. It is a phenomenon that can be seen in any tissue but was first observed during the testing of AV nodal conduction using a single extra-stimulus. This figure demonstrates an example of gap phenomenon. In the left panel, the AV node does not conduct to the ventricle with a coupling interval of 600-300 msec—the ERP of the AV node has been reached. However, as shorter coupling intervals were incrementally delivered, unexpected resumption of AV nodal conduction occurred at 600-270 msec (right panel). How does this occur?</p>
                            <p>Gap phenomenon occurs because the coupling of the pacing stimuli (S1-S2) does not necessarily reflect the received coupling interval of the conducting myocardial tissue (AV node). The presence of conduction delay related to the S2 can paradoxically increase the received coupling interval at the level of previous block and thus conduction may resume.</p>
                            <p>This complicated phenomenon is best described by example. When pacing from the right atrium and testing AV nodal conduction, as shown here, delay can manifest from two main sources: latency and intra-atrial conduction delay.</p>
                            <p>As mentioned earlier, latency refers to local delay in myocardial capture (arrow). This local delay translates into a lengthening of the effective coupling interval that is delivered to the AV node.</p>
                            <p>Intra-atrial conduction time refers to the time for conduction to transit from the atrial pacing site to the AV node. While generally fixed, intra-atrial conduction time can lengthen at tight coupling intervals, also causing lengthening of the effective coupling interval delivered to the AV node. When the delay is long enough to allow the refractory period of the AV node to pass, AV nodal conduction may resume.</p>

                            <p>When an SVT is induced during an EP study, various diagnostic maneuvers can be performed to assist in diagnosing the SVT. One helpful maneuver is the introduction of ventricular extra-stimuli (PVCs or S2s) into the tachycardia beginning slightly faster than the TCL. The response of a ventricular extra-stimulus during AVNRT is explained here; see the next page for an explanation of the response during AVRT.</p>
                            <p>As previously described, AVNRT is a small reentrant circuit in the AV node. By delivering PVCs from the ventricle, it is generally difficult to penetrate such a small circuit and conduct to the atrium. Therefore, the atrial cycle length is not often affected by the ventricular extra-stimulus.</p>
                            <p>In this figure, the diagnosis of AVRT is already excluded because the V-A time is too short; therefore, AVNRT is the likely diagnosis. With delivery of the ventricular extra-stimulus, the subsequent AEGM is not affected and remains at the TCL (380 msec).</p>

                                    <p>In this example, the diagnosis of AVNRT was already known prior to the pacing maneuver. However, the ventricular extra-stimulus during AVNRT has a second purpose. During AVNRT, the AEGM and VEGM are often superimposed. Therefore, it is difficult to analyze the atrial activation sequence. By stimulating the ventricle early, the VEGM no longer overlaps the AEGM and the true atrial activation sequence can be analyzed properly. Determining whether the atrial activation is earliest on the HIS catheter (anterior, arrow) versus the proximal CS catheter (posterior) is helpful for the physician in judging the risk of inadvertently ablating the AV nodal fast pathway.</p>

                                        <li>The tachycardia continues and the subsequent atrial cycle length is unaffected. This is the least informative response. This response would be expected with AVNRT since the atrium cannot be affected because the His (or AV node) is refractory. However, AVRT is not excluded by this response.</li>
                                        <li>The tachycardia continues and the subsequent atrial cycle length becomes earlier (the atrium is "advanced"). This proves the presence of an AP. A PVC introduced while the His is refractory cannot affect the atrium unless there is a secondary route to the atrium (ie, an AP). However, this response does not confirm that the AP is necessarily participating in the tachycardia. This figure demonstrates what we call "advancing the next A."</li>
                                        <li>The tachycardia continues and the subsequent atrial cycle length becomes later or "delayed." When the tachycardia slows down because of the PVC, this can only be explained by slowed conduction through the AP ("decremental" properties) and proves it is an active participant in the tachycardia circuit.</li>
                                        <li>The tachycardia terminates without conduction to the atrium. When a PVC is introduced while the His is refractory, the PVC has no way to affect the AV node. If the PVC does not conduct to the atrium, it cannot affect an atrial tachycardia. Therefore, a His-refractory PVC that terminates the tachycardia without conducting the atrium proves AVRT (by exclusion).</li>

                            <p>"Entrainment" of a tachycardia refers to a specific response of a macro-reentrant tachycardia to a pacing rate that is slightly faster than the tachycardia. This complex concept was superficially discussed on page 88. The main purpose of entrainment is to determine the proximity of the pacing catheter to the tachycardia circuit.</p>
                            <p>During tachycardia, an attempt can be made to entrain the tachycardia by pacing at a cycle length that is slightly shorter (10 to 20 msec) than the TCL. The goal is to penetrate the tachycardia circuit, speed it up to the pacing rate, and then stop pacing and observe the response. Once pacing is stopped, the timing of the first return EGM in the pacing channel typically provides important information.</p>
                            <p>The interval between the last pacing stimulus and the first return EGM (measured in the pacing channel) is the PPI. For this measurement to be useful, the pacing must not terminate the tachycardia. Simply, the longer the PPI, the farther away the pacing catheter is to the tachycardia circuit. The shorter the PPI (the closer the PPI approximates the TCL), the closer the pacing catheter is to the tachycardia circuit.</p>
                            <p>This figure shows an example of AVNRT, entrained from the right ventricular apical catheter. Keep in mind how far away the RVA catheter is from the AVNRT circuit. Once pacing is stopped, the PPI is measured (white arrow) and compared with the TCL (yellow arrow). The PPI is relatively long, suggesting that the RVA catheter is far from the tachycardia circuit. This finding is expected and compatible with AVNRT.</p>

In this situation, the PPI would be shorter. Studies have shown that a PPI-TCL difference of 115 msec is a useful cutoff to differentiate AVNRT (>115 msec) and AVRT (&lt;115 msec) due to the principles explained above. The principle of entrainment can be used for any macro-reentrant tachycardia. However, there are pitfalls to entrainment that are beyond the scope of this text.

                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>When an AP is located away from the septum, the diagnosis is usually obvious due to the abnormal atrial activation sequence during ventricular pacing. However, when the AP is located close to the septum (near the AV node), the diagnosis is less obvious because it is difficult to differentiate between retrograde AV nodal conduction and retrograde AP conduction.</p>
                            <p>The "para-Hisian" pacing maneuver was developed to assist in the diagnosis of septal APs. Para-Hisian pacing refers to pacing beside or close to the bundle of His (para = beside or next to). The performance of this maneuver involves two steps: pacing near the His bundle at a high output (which captures the HIS signal) and pacing near the His bundle at a low output (which only captures the para-Hisian myocardium).</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Step 1 (high output):</strong> The catheter is placed near the His bundle (large His potential should be seen). Since the His bundle is protected by the surrounding myocardium, a higher output (typically 20 mA) is required to capture the His signal. His bundle capture is diagnosed when the QRS is narrow since the ventricles are depolarized normally through the specialized His-Purkinje system.</li>
                                <li><strong>Step 2 (low output):</strong> The pacing output is then decreased until capture of the His bundle is lost but the output is still sufficient to capture the adjacent myocardium. Myocardial capture is diagnosed by a widening of the QRS since the ventricle is now being paced without the use of the specialized His-Purkinje system.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Capturing the His bundle during high-output pacing will generate a relatively short V-A time (measured from the pacing stimulus to the atrial signal) since the wave of depolarization will travel retrogradely through the AV node and into the atrium directly.</p>
                            <p>At low output and loss of His capture, the V-A interval will depend on whether a septal AP is present. When no septal AP is present, capturing the myocardium generates a much longer V-A time since the stimulus captures only local ventricular myocardium. The wave of depolarization needs to reach the Purkinje system near the apex of the ventricle then travel up the bundle branches and finally retrogradely through the AV node. The difference in V-A time between His bundle capture and ventricular-only capture should be approximately 45 to 50 msec.</p>
