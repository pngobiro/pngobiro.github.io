                                    <p>A key concept in this unit is reentry. Many, if not most, of the clinically important tachycardias are reentrant tachycardias, at least in part. The classic reentrant tachycardia requires two potential pathways of conduction that can be dissociated. These pathways are commonly thought of as a zone of fast conduction and a zone of slower conduction. The circuit is facilitated by this zone of slow conduction. Tachycardia is initiated by an ectopic beat that blocks in one zone and "reenters" via the other zone to initiate a "circus" or circular movement.</p>

                            <h3>Typical AVNRT Pathways</h3>
                            <p>AVNRT is possible in patients who have two routes over the AV node (dual AV nodal pathways). The exact anatomic substrate and location of these two pathways is not known with certainty, but it is undoubtedly true in theory and provides an excellent working concept.</p>
                            <p>Panel A shows a representation of the AV node with two routes through it, a fast pathway (F) and a slow pathway (S). This is known as longitudinal dissociation. During sinus rhythm, the wave of depolarization will travel quickly down the fast pathway to depolarize the ventricles. The same wave also travels down the slow pathway but finds the lower common pathway (LCP) refractory due to the preceding wavefront over the fast pathway.</p>
                            <p>Panel B introduces a premature atrial contraction (PAC) (S2) that blocks in the fast pathway due to the fast pathway's longer refractory period. Therefore, the S2 conducts to the ventricle using the slow pathway. Conduction using the slow pathway rather than the fast pathway means that there will be a sudden lengthening of the A-V interval (more specifically, lengthening of the A-H interval) or a jump.</p>
                            <p>As the wave of depolarization continues toward the ventricles, it also has the opportunity to travel retrogradely back up the fast pathway (red arrows in panels B and C) since the fast pathway has had sufficient time to recover.</p>
                            <p>This completes the circuit and initiates AVNRT, which is the continual "spinning" down the slow pathway and up the fast pathway.</p>

                                    <p>This is a good stylistic concept, but there are probably many mechanistic variants. For example, the diagram shows a common upper pathway entering the AV node when there is considerable evidence that there are two upper pathways entering the nodal area distinctively. An important practical point for ablation is that the slow pathway usually enters the AV node inferiorly near the CS orifice.</p>

                            <h3>Jump</h3>
                            <p>During sinus rhythm, in patients with dual AV nodal pathways, the two pathways are usually not apparent since fast pathway conduction preempts slow pathway conduction.</p>
                            <p>As you perform extra-stimulus testing (the S1-S2 extra-stimulus study), continue to measure the A-H interval generated by the S2. You will notice the A-H interval gradually lengthening as the fast AV nodal pathway decrements. A sudden, abrupt prolongation of the A-H interval signals a block in the fast pathway and transition to the slow pathway (arrows). This jump is an indication that we have reached the ERP of the fast pathway and conduction to the ventricles is now occurring via the slow pathway. By arbitrary definition we consider at least a 50-msec prolongation in the A-H interval with a 10-msec shortening of the S1-S2 coupling interval to be a significant jump.</p>
                            <p>This dual AV nodal physiology is the substrate for AVNRT. Generally, slow pathways are associated with A-H intervals ranging from 250 to 700 msec or longer.</p>

                                    <p>Dual AV nodal pathways may exist without AVNRT, and AVNRT may exist without apparent dual pathways. In addition, AVNRT may be quite difficult to initiate. Using two extra-stimuli (S2-S3) or more and pacing at multiple sites may help. Isoproterenol or atropine may facilitate induction as well.</p>

                            <h3>AV Nodal Echo</h3>
                            <p>Before any tachycardia is induced, we often see an AV nodal "echo" (white arrows). An echo is defined as a beat that returns to its origin (back to the atrium from the paced atrial cycle in this context) and is, in actuality, a single beat of reentrant tachycardia.</p>
                            <p>In this example, we are pacing the right atrium. The first three beats (S1) are paced at a constant interval followed by an S2. We can see that each atrial pacing artifact is associated with atrial capture and subsequent conduction to the ventricle. However, on the fourth paced beat (S2), following conduction to the ventricle, we see another AEGM. In other words, we paced the A, which led to the expected V, and then an extra, unexpected A returned to the atrium. Hence, the term "echo beat." This can be thought of as one beat of AVNRT.</p>

                                    <p>Notice the A-H interval is relatively short and constant for the first three paced beats. On the fourth paced beat, notice that the A-H interval is much longer. This indicates that conduction has blocked in the antegrade fast AV nodal pathway and now is conducting over a slower AV nodal pathway.

                            <h3>Onset of Tachycardia</h3>
                            <p>This image shows the typical onset of AVNRT. Note of the length of the A-H interval on the HIS channel during the drive train. Focus on the S2 (the last red paced beat immediately under the magenta V). It generates the green A signals on the CS channels. We then see a rather lengthy flat line. This represents the transit time through the AV node via the slow pathway (long yellow arrow). When the wave of depolarization finally exits the AV node, the yellow HIS channel displays an H signal followed by a large yellow V signal.</p>
                            <p>While the wave of depolarization is traveling from the HIS channel to the ventricle (short white arrow), it also travels back up to the right atrium via a retrograde fast pathway (short red arrow), thus generating the red A that can be seen immediately under the magenta V. If this happens once or twice, we call these cycles "AV nodal echo beats." If these cycles continue, we have initiated AVNRT. In this example, we can see two echo beats.</p>
                            <p>Because this particular reentrant circuit allows conduction antegradely down the slow AV nodal pathway and retrogradely up the fast pathway, it is often referred to as "slow-fast" or "typical" AVNRT. It is the most common form of AV nodal reentry seen clinically.</p>
                            <p>The S1-S2 coupling interval blocks in the fast pathway (antegrade ERP of the AV nodal fast pathway) and continues over the slow pathway. Tachycardia is cured with successful ablation of the slow pathway, which is an obligatory link in the circuit.</p>

                            <p>Wolff, Parkinson, and White are the three physicians who first described a syndrome in a group of patients who showed a widened, slurred QRS complex and suffered from recurrent bouts of tachycardia. WPW syndrome refers to patients who have pre-excitation and suffer from tachycardias. Patients who display ventricular pre-excitation on the ECG but don't have tachycardias are said to have a WPW pattern.</p>
                            <p>In the normal individual, the only electrical connection between the atria and ventricles is the AV node. APs are electrically conducting myocardial tissues that bridge the atria and ventricles in addition to the normal AV node. When this connection conducts electrical activity from the atria to the ventricles earlier than expected (pre-excitation), it manifests on the surface ECG as a widened, slurred QRS. This "delta wave" refers to the initial part of this widened QRS that represents conduction directly into the ventricle.</p>
                            <p>Some APs cannot conduct electrical activity from the atria to the ventricles (antegrade conduction). They can only conduct from the ventricles to the atria (retrograde conduction). If the pathway conducts retrogradely only, there will be no pre-excitation on the ECG even though the AP is present (see lower panel). This is not WPW (by classic definition), but these APs still can cause reentrant tachycardia by virtue of their retrograde conduction alone.</p>

                                    <p>In AVNRT, the reentry occurs over two pathways in close proximity to the AV node itself.

The circuit can also go down the AP and back up the AV node. If more than one AP is present, the possibility of a "pathway to pathway" reentrant tachycardia exists.</p>

                            <h3>Accessory Pathway Locations</h3>
                            <p>APs can occur anywhere along the AV rings: They may be right-sided, left-sided, peri-nodal, or septal. They can conduct antegradely only, retrogradely only or, more commonly, bidirectionally. In an antegradely conducting AP, the atrial activation wavefront has two routes to the ventricles, the AV node and the AP. If the atrial impulse conducts over the AP to depolarize a part of the ventricular myocardium in advance of the AV nodal—His bundle depolarization wavefront, then the AP is "pre-exciting" the ventricles; hence the term "ventricular pre-excitation" or simply "pre-excitation." Ventricular pre-excitation appears on the surface ECG as an initial slurring of the QRS upstroke or delta wave. Delta waves may be subtle or obvious, depending on a number of factors that determine how much of ventricular activation is due to the AP versus the AV node.</p>
                            <p>If a pathway conducts retrogradely only, we consider it "concealed" since there is no pre-excitation on the ECG and the presence of a pathway is not apparent. This implies that the only way the AP can be involved in a tachycardia is if the reentrant circuit involves conduction from the atrium, down the AV node to the ventricles, and back up to the atria using the AP (generating a narrow QRS tachycardia). This mechanism is called "orthodromic" AVRT. If the pathway conducts antegradely only, the ECG will show various degrees of pre-excitation. These pathways can only become involved in "antidromic" AVRT, meaning that the circuit goes from the atrium, down the AP to the ventricles, and back up to the atria using the AV node (generating a wide QRS tachycardia).</p>
                            <p>Most pathways exhibit bidirectional conduction properties and therefore will exhibit various degrees of pre-excitation; thus tachycardia can potentially be orthodromic or antidromic. Orthodromic tachycardia is much more common.</p>

                            <h3>Accessory Pathway Echo</h3>
                            <p>When delivering programmed extra-stimuli, we often see a single echo beat prior to initiating tachycardia. Recall that an echo beat is essentially one beat of reentrant tachycardia (see page 42 to review echo beats).</p>
                            <p>In this example, we are pacing in the ventricle. Notice how the atrial activation is eccentric, indicating a left lateral AP (CS 1-2 is the earliest AEGM). The S2 continues to be conducted to the atrium via the AP as diagnosed by the early atrial signal in CS 1-2.</p>
                            <p>After the AEGM (on the HIS channel), we then see a long A-H interval (yellow arrow) followed by a VEGM. This indicates that after conduction to the atrium using the AP, there is conduction back over the AV node to the ventricle, likely using a slow pathway. This is a single echo beat using the AP and the AV node as the circuit. In fact, there is conduction back to the atrium one more time using the AP (white arrows). So we really have one and a half cycles of AVRT before it stops by blocking in the AV node.</p>

                                    <p>Why did the AP echo not initiate AVRT? To answer this, we simply need to consider what the weak link is in this reentrant circuit. The last activity was an AEGM received from the AP. The tachycardia was prevented because of blocking in the AV node. This makes the AV node the "weak link." Starting the patient on isoproterenol to improve AV nodal conduction may allow AVRT initiation.</p>

                            <h3>AVRT Initiation</h3>
                            <p>This is a typical onset of AVRT. Recall the really slow pathway that initiated AVNRT on page 44. On this tracing there is a similar slow pathway over the AV node (see the A-H interval on the HIS channel and the yellow arrow). However, in this example, there is no retrograde fast pathway up the AV node. Instead, there is retrograde conduction via a left lateral AP to the left atrium (green arrow). If we examine the CS activation, we see that CS 1-2 has the first A, followed by CS 3-4, CS 5-6, CS 7-8, then the HIS A, and finally the HRA A. This atrial activation sequence is known as eccentric atrial activation. The AP joins the atrium and ventricle in the vicinity of CS 1-2, and hence the atria are activated from the left atrium to the right atrium. This is, of course, the exact opposite of normal atrial activation.</p>
                            <p>All reentrant tachycardia circuits require a zone of relatively slow conduction. In AVRT, this zone is generally the AV node and the alternate pathway is the AP.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, in the common orthodromic AVRT, the circuit is from the atrium, down the node (yellow arrow) to the ventricles, and back to the atrium via the AP (green arrow). The tachycardia then continues. The usual cure is to ablate the AP. With your most common approach (transseptal or retrograde aortic), an ablation catheter will be advanced into the left atrium and placed directly on the pathway. Radiofrequency energy is applied and the pathway is eliminated. In this example, the pathway is in the lateral left atrium as suggested by the earliest atrial signal in CS 1-2.</p>

                            <p>In this tracing, similar to the previous tracing, a left lateral AP is revealed and tachycardia initiated. But how? Where is the zone of slow conduction?</p>
                            <p>The required conduction delay when AVRT is initiated (by an S2) is provided by a delay in the A-H interval in most instances. Initiation of this tachycardia is unique in that it is a long H-V interval (white arrows) that provides the required conduction delay.</p>

                                    <p>H-V interval prolongation is due to a slowing of conduction in the His-Purkinje system. Decrement in the His-Purkinje system can be observed normally after a "long-short" sequence; that is, the stimulation results in a long cycle (the last S1-S1) followed by a short cycle (S1-S2), especially if the A-H interval is very short as in this individual.

                            <h3>ACRT Initiation</h3>
                            <p>In this example, the AVRT is initiated by quite a different mechanism. The S2 from the HRA is conducted to the ventricles, but the surface ECG shows that the QRS complex has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern.</p>
                            <p>Normally, the ventricular activation would get to the left-sided AP via the left bundle branch. Since the S2 was given at a time when the left bundle branch system was refractory (thus the LBBB pattern), the wave of depolarization had to get there via the right bundle, then transseptally to the left ventricle and finally to the left lateral AP.</p>
                            <p>Propagation of the impulse through muscle is not as rapid as over the normal conduction system, hence the impulse gets to the AP much later than expected. The AP is now recovered fully due to this delay and is able to propagate to the atrium and initiate tachycardia.</p>

                                    <p>This only occurs when the AP is on the same side (ipsilateral) as the bundle branch block. With a right-sided AP, a RBBB would facilitate initiation of tachycardia. The wave of depolarization would travel down the left bundle, then transseptally to the right ventricle and up the right-sided pathway. So the next logical question would be, "Would an RBBB cause initiation of AVRT that uses a left lateral AP?" The answer is no. A contralateral bundle branch block will not facilitate initiation of tachycardia since that bundle is not part of the circuit.</p>

                            <h3>Effective Refractory Period of an Accessory Pathway</h3>
                            <p>During the atrial drive (S1), the QRS complex shows pre-excitation (WPW pattern). It is a left lateral AP since lead I is mostly negative and V1 shows an RBBB-like pattern.</p>
                            <p>Notice that during the atrial drive train the QRS is markedly pre-excited with no contribution of ventricular activation from the normal conduction system. This "maximum pre-excitation" is due to the wave of depolarization reaching the left lateral AP earlier than the AV node, which obviously must have a long conduction time.</p>
                            <p>After the S2, the A-H interval (yellow arrow) is very long and the QRS is no longer pre-excited. At this S1-S2 coupling interval, the antegrade ERP of the AP has been reached, allowing conduction exclusively over the AV node over a slow pathway, thus displaying a long A-H interval.</p>
                            <p>After traveling over the AV node via a slow pathway, the wave of depolarization then "echoes" back up to the left atrium via the left lateral AP (green arrow). This might initiate ongoing AVRT, but in this example we have only a single AP echo.</p>

                            <h3>Ablation of Accessory Pathways</h3>
                            <p>The overall principle of AP localization is quite simple. When the AP is being used to activate either the atrium or the ventricle, the part of that chamber that is activated first will identify the location of the AP. During ventricular pacing (as in this example), we are moving our mapping or ablation catheter looking for the earliest atrial activation. Similarly, during atrial pacing, we would be looking for the earliest ventricular activation.</p>
                            <p>The concept is more easily clarified by this diagram, which illustrates the morphology of the EGMs during ventricular pacing. Therefore, the earliest atrial signal should identify where the AP inserts into the left atrium.</p>
                            <p>In the left panel, we move the catheter to a location where we believe the AP inserts into the atrium. The ablation channels show the V and A signals on both the distal and proximal poles. Notice that the signals are separated by several milliseconds. At this point in the mapping sequence, we don't know whether this is the earliest and will not know until we have finished mapping, but the separation of the V and A signals suggests we can do better.</p>
                            <p>In the right panel, we have moved the catheter to a slightly different location. Notice now that the A signal is much earlier and that the VEGM and AEGM are fused together and frankly overlapping. This looks to be a promising ablation site perhaps directly over the AP, but this is only established by careful mapping of the region.</p>

                                    <p>Notice as well in the left panel that the AEGM is biphasic with an initial "shoulder" of far-field activity prior to the rapid downslope indicating local activation. This also suggests that this is not an ideal ablation site. The A is so early on the right panel that it actually merges with the V, so one can't really comment on the AEGM morphology.</p>

                            <p>Focal atrial tachycardias originate from a small area or point source in either atrium (pink star). They are not as common as WPW or AVNRT and are often more challenging to ablate. The first challenge is to reproducibly initiate the tachycardia in the lab. Unlike a slow pathway ablation, which has a known anatomic target or an AP that can be localized without initiating tachycardia, atrial tachycardia can only be localized and targeted for ablation during ongoing tachycardia. The mechanism of initiation is variable (automaticity versus triggered versus micro-reentry) and often difficult to determine, but the key clinical consideration is whether it is present during the study or can be induced by programmed stimulation or isoproterenol.</p>
                            <p>Once initiated, detailed activation mapping is the necessary prerequisite to successful ablation. This involves determining the atrial activation sequence and finding the earliest atrial signal during the tachycardia (similar to WPW).</p>
                            <p>An activation sequence map is obtained with an electroanatomic mapping system. It is very useful and frequently employed with focal AT. Pace mapping and entrainment mapping are additional techniques that may be helpful, but the whole ablation exercise is very difficult without activation mapping.</p>

                            <h3>Typical Catheter Placement</h3>
                            <p>Atrial flutter is a specific atrial tachycardia characterized by an atrial rate in range of 250 bpm. In the great majority of patients, atrial flutter is related to a large reentrant circuit in the right atrium that has to pass through a relatively small area, namely the narrow band of muscle between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve known as the CTI.</p>
                            <p>This image shows a commonly seen placement of catheters for CTI-dependent atrial flutter ablation. The red arrows point to a duo-decapolar ("duo-deca") catheter positioned around the right atrium, anterior to the crista terminalis. The white arrow points to the ablation catheter positioned at the CTI. The magenta arrow indicates the RVA catheter for ventricular pacing if needed. The green arrows point to a CS catheter for atrial pacing. The arrow colors correspond to the colors of the EGMs on our monitor.</p>
                            <p>The CTI in this projection (dotted yellow line) is positioned so that the distal electrode pair is at the ventricular part of the "isthmus" near the tricuspid valve ring. The catheter would have to be withdrawn to cover the isthmus and reach the inferior vena cava end. The line of ablation will proceed along this curved yellow line.</p>

                                    <p>Catheter placement is again important. The duo-deca catheter should ideally be placed anterior to the crista terminalis to obtain useful mapping of the direction of activation. For proper signal interpretation, the catheter operator needs to establish this using multi-plane fluoroscopy or a mapping system.</p>

                            <h3>Cavo-tricuspid Isthmus Ablation</h3>
                            <p>In this example, the patient arrived in sinus rhythm but has had documented typical atrial flutter clinically. The ablation strategy will be to block conduction over the CTI to prevent tachycardia. There is no compelling need to induce the tachycardia in the laboratory if we are confident about the diagnosis from the clinical ECGs, although some clinicians may choose to induce atrial flutter and verify the mechanism.</p>
                            <p>To evaluate CTI conduction, it is helpful to pace at one end of the isthmus. We start by pacing the proximal CS (CS 7-8). The red channels are displaying a 20-pole duo-deca catheter. In the left panel, the duo-deca displays a chevron shape (arrows). The wave of depolarization spreads from the CS os toward the right atrial lateral wall inferiorly over the CTI (starting at low right atrial [LRA] catheter 1-2) and superiorly up the atrial septum (starting at HRA 17-18). The wavefronts meet somewhere in the atrium in the vicinity of mid right atrial (MRA) catheter 9-10. This double-wavefront pattern is characteristic of intact CTI conduction.</p>
                            <p>After successful ablation (right panel), the chevron or double-wavefront shape is replaced with a straight single-wavefront activation line (arrow). The sequence of activation shows the wavefront circulating counter-clockwise around the right atrium beginning at HRA 17-18 with LRA 1-2 last. This would be expected if the isthmus were blocked in the clockwise direction, allowing the right atrium to be activated only up the septum. Note also that LRA 1-2, LRA 3-4, and LRA 5-6 EGM polarity has reversed. This is further proof that the wave of depolarization has arrived at these poles from the opposite direction.</p>
                            <p>Finally, we will pace from LRA 1-2 to observe CTI block from the other direction. CS pacing confirms clockwise block. LRA pacing confirms counterclockwise block. Bidirectional block is critical!</p>

                                    <p>If the duo-deca catheter is positioned properly with poles 1-2 in the lateral LRA relatively close to the CTI, the CS to LRA time with an intact CTI is approximately 80 msec. The LRA to CS os time is similar. When CTI block is achieved, these times generally will double since conduction from the CS to LRA is no longer directly over the CTI but goes circumferentially around the right atrium. It is important to note that slow conduction through the CTI can be present and mimic total block. There is no absolute number that is diagnostic of CTI block. Other maneuvers are necessary to confirm complete block.</p>

                            <h3>Split A's</h3>
                            <p>A “split” A refers to an AEGM with two apparent depolarizations or components. The recording electrodes of an ablation catheter cover a relatively large area so that it is possible to record depolarizations from more than one region in that area. Seeing an early and a later A in this context suggests two waves of depolarization, one on each side of the ablation line. The early component represents atrial activation on one side of the line, and the late component represents the delayed activation as it arrives at the other side of the line. As the ablation proceeds and tissue along the CTI is damaged, the split may appear due to slower, injury-related conduction. The split will lengthen during ablation, sometimes abruptly but often gradually, until total block is achieved. The late A arrives by an entirely different route (by going around the right atrium rather than over the blocked isthmus). In general, atrial conduction time around the right atrium, in either direction, is at least 80 msec so that a split of less than 80 msec suggests that the CTI is not blocked. The wider the split, the more likely that block is present; but no absolute number is entirely reliable to distinguish complete block from slow isthmus conduction. Other maneuvers are necessary.</p>
                            <p>Notice on the distal ablation channel, after the CS pacing spike on beats 1 and 2, there are two narrowly split A-waves with a split of 40 msec (shorter red arrows). On beats 3 and 4, the A-waves have split further (140 msec; longer red arrows). This occurred during ablation.</p>

                                    <p>Distinguishing slow conduction over the CTI from total block can be difficult. A maneuver sometimes called “differential pacing” may be helpful. Simply pacing at a site closer to the line will delay arrival at the other side (widen the split) if complete block is present, while it will do the opposite if in fact conduction is still occurring, albeit slowly, over the CTI.</p>

                            <h3>Basic Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>AF entails disorganized electrical activity throughout the atria, typically causing palpitations and lasting hours (paroxysmal), days, or longer (persistent). Unlike atrial flutter, AVNRT, AVRT, or atrial tachycardia, AF is disorganized atrial activity involving the entire left and right atria and there is no simple target for ablation. However, we now know that AF usually requires a trigger to start it and sufficient substrate to maintain it. Therefore, we attempt to reduce the frequency of AF episodes by eliminating the most common triggers that arise from the four pulmonary veins (PVs) in the back of the left atrium.</p>
                            <p>Our goal for ablation, therefore, is to electrically isolate the PVs so that ectopy from the veins does not enter the left atrium and cause AF. In this image, we have positioned a lasso-shaped duo-decapolar catheter (Lasso™ Circular Mapping Catheter, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, California, USA; green arrow) in the left inferior PV. The yellow arrow points to the ablation catheter, the magenta arrow points to the CS catheter, and the black arrow points to an esophageal temperature probe.</p>
                            <p>In this example, we will pace from CS 1-2 and observe the wave of depolarization traveling into the left inferior PV. With ablation around the veins, the EGMs recorded on the Lasso catheter will disappear once we have achieved PV entrance block. To test for exit block, we pace one or more of the poles on the Lasso and observe whether conduction reaches the left atrium. Exit block is defined as local capture within the PV while observing that it does not exit into the left atrium and thus generate a P-wave on the surface ECG.</p>

                                    <p>PV entrance block can be observed occasionally while conduction remains intact from vein to atrium (ie, lack of exit block). It seems intuitive that exit block is the more important goal since ectopy in the veins exits to initiate AF. Therefore, most labs target bidirectional block, although there can be technical challenges in achieving capture in the vein in some patients.</p>

                            <h3>Near-Field Versus Far-Field Electrograms</h3>
                            <p>It is important to appreciate the different morphologies of EGMs and the relationship with distance from the recording catheter. When conduction passes directly under the tip of the catheter, the EGM will be very narrow and sharp, sometimes described as "near-field." Conduction seen at a distance from the catheter will result in an EGM that is wider and often not as sharp, which can be described as "far-field."</p>
                            <p>In this example, we are pacing in the CS. We have a Lasso catheter positioned inside a PV (blue tracings). Note that the three distinct EGM morphologies in each of the four channels displayed.</p>

The green arrow points to far-field EGMs, which represent left atrial activity. Their morphology is considered far-field because they are recorded from within the PV. Since we are pacing in the CS, it is reasonable to expect that the Lasso catheter will "see" far-field left atrial activity before near-field PV activity.</p>

                            <h3>Entrance Block</h3>
                            <p>Entrance block refers to the absence of electrical conduction from the left atrium into the PVs. In this tracing, we are pacing the left atrium using CS 1-2. The white arrows indicate far-field EGMs recorded from the left atrium. The wave of depolarization successfully enters the PV (first yellow arrow) and gives rise to near-field PV potentials. A series of ablations are applied outside the PV in an attempt to separate it from the left atrium. During the last ablation lesion, as seen on the third beat, these local PV EGMs disappear (third yellow arrow). This indicates successful achievement of entrance block into that vein.</p>
                            <p>Also note the timing between the far-field left atrial potentials and the local PV potentials. The PV potentials got progressively later (see the first two beats) just before block occurred. The gradual progressive delay of these signals indicates the slowing of conduction into the PV as the ablation lesions are created. This is a great example of watching the EGMs "walk out" just before block occurs.</p>

                            <h3>Exit Block</h3>
                            <p>In the case of PV ablation, exit block refers to conduction block in the opposite direction (ie, the absence of electrical conduction from within the PV to the left atrium). Theoretically, you may achieve exit block only or entrance block only (called unidirectional block). However, bidirectional block is our goal.</p>
                            <p>In this tracing, we are pacing the Lasso catheter positioned within a PV. The pacing spike has successfully captured the PV (see the small EGMs at the arrows). This demonstrates local capture within the PV.</p>
                            <p>Notice the surface ECG. It continues to show sinus rhythm uninterrupted by the pacing and capture within the PV. Also notice that the A and V signals on the CS catheter correspond to the surface P-wave and QRS, respectively. Therefore, we must have exit block. The local capture within the PV does not exit the PV and thus does not generate a P-wave on the surface ECG. If the PV had not been isolated, the local capture would have exited the PV into the left atrium and thus would have generated a P-wave on the surface ECG.</p>
                            <p>Combined with the previous tracing, we have confirmed bidirectional block in that vein.</p>

                                    <p>When pacing Lasso poles, it is often challenging to see local capture in the PV. Changing pacing poles will often solve this problem.

                            <h3>Pulmonary Vein Fibrillation</h3>
                            <p>This example reinforces the concept that successful ablation can "fence in" the electrical activity of the PVs and surrounding tissue, preventing exit into the atrium and initiation of AF. The blue Lasso signals here indicate that fibrillation is ongoing inside the PV. However, sinus rhythm continues (as seen on the surface ECG), unperturbed by the ongoing arrhythmia inside the vein.</p>
                            <p>In paroxysmal AF, the usual goal of ablation is electrical isolation of all four PVs to prevent ectopy in the veins from starting AF. In chronic AF, however, the ablation target is usually more complicated since the problem is not only the initiating beats from the veins but also the areas in the atrium that allow AF to persist.</p>
                            <p>In chronic AF, the first target is often isolation of the PVs. The second step is then some combination of ablating complex fractionated EGMs (CFEs), which are areas thought to contribute to sustaining the AF, as well as creating lines of conduction block in the left atrium across the roof and/or from mitral annulus to left PV (through the mitral isthmus). Another effect of creating these linear ablation lesion sets is to prevent flutter circuits from developing and the occurrence of left atrial flutter after the ablation. If a patient returns for a second ablation due to recurrent AF or left atrial flutter, the second procedure usually entails checking the veins for return of conduction, with further ablation applied to re-isolate them if necessary. If left atrial flutter is seen, then ablation is also directed at interrupting these circuits.</p>

                                    <p>Extra lines and targeting complex fractionated EGMs are all part of substrate modification. However, incomplete lines may, paradoxically, increase the substrate for left atrial flutter. Incomplete lines are worse than no lines at all. It is often very difficult to ablate patients returning with left atrial flutter because of the challenge in identifying the circuit and its critical zone.</p>

                            <p>Another sign of exit block from the PVs is sometimes seen without the need for pacing the Lasso catheter within the PV. Occasionally, following PV isolation, the PV may continue to have ectopy within it. This is a good example of PV independent activity.</p>

The yellow arrow points to a far-field left atrial AEGM, and the green arrow points to a far-field VEGM. The white arrows point to independent activity within the PV that spontaneously generated a wave of depolarization within the PV but does not exit into the left atrium since no PACs are seen on the surface ECG.</p>

                            <h3>Basic Diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>The SVTs discussed in the preceding pages are largely benign rhythms, although they can be highly symptomatic. In contrast, VT is an arrhythmia that originates in the ventricles and can be life-threatening. VT is most often associated with structural heart disease, such as prior myocardial infarction or poor ventricular function. Less commonly, VT can occur in structurally normal hearts.</p>
                            <p>On a 12-lead ECG, VT is recognized by its appearance as a wide-complex tachycardia. When a patient is having episodes of VT, acute management includes the basic principles of patient stabilization, such as assessing the "ABCs"—airway, breathing, and circulation. Treatment includes addressing reversible causes of VT, such as coronary heart disease or electrolyte disturbances, initiating antiarrhythmic medications, and possibly inserting an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. For selected patients with recurrent VT refractory to antiarrhythmic medications, an EP study and ablation can assist in decreasing the burden of VT.</p>
                            <p>Several strategies are used to localize and ablate VT:</p>

                                    <p>VT is a wide-complex tachycardia as seen on this 12-lead ECG.

Careful examination of the QRS morphology and for the presence of P-waves on the ECG can often help distinguish between these diagnoses.

                            <h3>Activation Mapping</h3>
                            <p>As previously described for activation mapping of atrial tachycardia, activation mapping is a strategy that can also be utilized for certain types of VT. This strategy involves recording of the relative timing of the ventricular depolarization in different areas of the ventricle, usually with the assistance of a 3D electroanatomic mapping system. Such a strategy is helpful when the VT is thought to originate from a focal point in the ventricle. In this situation, finding the earliest ventricular activity will identify the site of origin of the VT.</p>
                            <p>In this image, a shell representing the right ventricle was created with our 3D electroanatomic mapping system (Carto™, Biosense Webster) during VT. The color scheme is a visual representation of the activation sequence in the ventricle. Magenta represents areas with relatively late activation. Red represents areas with the earliest activation. The rainbow of colors represents intermediate areas of activation. In this example, the earliest activation is coming from a point source near the apex of the right ventricle. Therefore, the VT appears to be originating from the right ventricular apex where the activation is the earliest.</p>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--tip">

                                    <p>Activation mapping is useful primarily when the mechanism of the VT is thought to be focal (when the VT is originating from a point source). In this situation, the earliest activation is the source of the VT. However, VT is often not focal but rather is caused by a reentrant circuit in the ventricle (more on this later). In this situation, activation mapping is not as helpful because the VT is caused by a loop or circuit of activation with no true beginning and no true end.</p>

                            <p>Pace mapping is a method that uses the QRS morphology on the ECG as a guide to locate the site of origin of the VT. This strategy is carried out using the catheter to pace several locations within the ventricle. The VT QRS morphology is studied, and there is an attempt to mimic the morphology of the clinical VT with that of the pacing morphology. This strategy is based on the concept that the QRS morphology of the VT will be reproduced by pacing the ventricle at the site of origin of the VT.</p>
                            <p>The ablation catheter is moved to different parts of the ventricle and pacing is performed. The closer the paced morphology matches the VT morphology, the closer the pacing site is to the origin or exit site of the VT. In this example, different locations in the right ventricular outflow tract were paced. The VT morphology is shown in the middle, and two different pacing sites are highlighted. One demonstrates a good morphology match, while the other shows a poor morphology match.</p>

                            <h3>Entrainment Mapping</h3>
                            <p>While activation mapping and pace mapping strategies are ideal for focal VTs, such strategies are less useful for VT caused by a large reentrant circuit. In this situation, entrainment maneuvers can be used to guide ablation. Entrainment is a difficult concept, and a comprehensive discussion is beyond the scope of this book.</p>
                            <p>However, the practical application of entrainment involves pacing the ventricle during VT at a slightly faster rate (eg, 20 to 30 msec) than the VT. If the VT persists following the paced beats, the response of the VT to the maneuver can give valuable information. The VT morphology during the pacing maneuver and the length of the interval following the last paced beat (the PPI) are two of the characteristics that are studied. This information can help ascertain whether the pacing site is within a critical portion of the VT circuit that may be a good target for ablation.</p>

                                    <p>Here are examples of entrainment of the same VT from two different pacing sites. Note that in both examples, the VT is accelerated slightly with pacing and that the VT persists following the pacing maneuver. The PPI has been measured in the ablation channel since it was the catheter we used for pacing. The PPI is the time from the last paced beat to the first EGM of the persisting VT.</p>
                                    <p>Without going through the complexities of entrainment, the top panel shows a PPI that is long compared with the cycle length of the VT. The bottom panel shows a PPI that is essentially the same as the cycle length of the VT. When the PPI is relatively long, the pacing site is not a part of the VT circuit. When the PPI is similar to that of the VT cycle length, the pacing site is a within the VT circuit and may be an area of interest to ablate.</p>

                            <h3>Scar-dependent Ventricular Tachycardia</h3>
                            <p>VT associated with structural heart disease is often dependent on the presence of scar tissue. Areas of scar tissue contain myocardial cells that have various degrees of damage. Some cells are completely dead and are a part of true scar that is unable to depolarize. Other cells are damaged but are still alive and able to depolarize, although conduction through these cells can be very slow. Typically, damaged areas of myocardium are zones of slow conduction that can give rise to reentrant VT circuits.</p>
                            <p>This image presents a simplified representation of scar within the ventricular myocardium. Note the paths of slowly conducting cells within the scar tissue. These areas of slowly conducting cells can form a circuit (as depicted by the arrows), which gives rise to a reentrant VT.</p>
                            <p>With successful targeted ablation of slowly conducting cells within or adjacent to the scar, VT circuits are less likely to form.</p>

                            <h3>Voltage Mapping</h3>
                            <p>The purpose of voltage mapping is to identify healthy versus scarred heart tissue and the transition zone between these two areas. In patients with structural heart disease, myocardial damage (following a myocardial infarction, for example) creates areas of scar that can be the substrate for VT caused by a reentrant circuit. By identifying the scar, the locations of possible VT circuits are ascertained.</p>
                            <p>Voltage mapping is performed using a 3D electroanatomic mapping system. The mapping catheter is moved to different locations in the ventricles, and the amplitude of the associated EGM is noted. The computerized mapping system generates a visual representation of the ventricle and depicts large, healthy EGMs as magenta. Small EGMs likely representing scar are shown in red. Transition zones are depicted by a rainbow pattern.</p>

                            <h3>Substrate Modification</h3>
                            <p>Substrate modification is an anatomic-based, empiric ablation approach that does not focus on mapping the location of a specific VT. Instead, the strategy is based on finding the areas in the ventricle that are most susceptible to maintaining a VT circuit and attempting to ablate such areas. The principle is that VT circuits form in areas of damaged but living heart tissue. An attempt is made to ablate the damaged tissue so that it can no longer be involved in forming VT circuits.</p>
                            <p>Substrate modification is therefore an empiric ablation strategy that is used for VT when the VT is non-inducible or not hemodynamically tolerated. In this setting, it is not possible to use other strategies such as pace mapping, activation mapping, or entrainment mapping. Areas of scar are identified by creating a voltage map, as described previously. The hallmark of scar includes low-voltage and/or fractionated EGMs. Often, the damaged tissue responsible for the VT circuit involves the border zones of the scar.</p>
