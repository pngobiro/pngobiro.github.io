Examining the normal sequence of signal conduction and measuring various basic intervals establishes a baseline for the patient. These measurements will vary depending on the clinical problem.</p>

                            <p>Multi-electrode catheters are exclusively used in clinical EP. Electrical signals are detected and recorded from the individual electrodes and from adjacent electrodes (bipole). By convention, the most distal electrode (at the tip of the catheter) is numbered 1. Subsequent electrodes are numbered in a sequential fashion, as shown in the coronary sinus (CS) decapolar catheter here (labeled in green).</p>
                            <p>The high right atrial (HRA) catheter is labeled in red. It will record an atrial (A) signal on the red HRA channel on our tracings throughout this book. The HIS catheter is labeled in yellow. It is positioned in the region of the atrioventricular (AV) node guided by both the signals and fluoroscopic images. Since the AV node is in close proximity to both the atria and the ventricles, it will have both an A signal as well as a ventricular (V) signal. In addition, the HIS catheter will have a third electrogram (EGM) representing the bundle of His, which is the electrical conduit from the AV node to the specialized conduction system within the ventricles. This EGM is often referred to simply as an "H." So the properly positioned HIS catheter will display three EGMs—atrial (A), HIS (H), and ventricular (V)—on our yellow HIS channel. The right ventricular apex (RVA) catheter is labeled in magenta. It will display a V signal on our magenta RVA channel.</p>
                            <p>The CS catheter is labeled in green. The CS is the vein situated between the left atrium and the left ventricle. Therefore, this catheter, for the most part, identifies signals from the left atrium and left ventricle when properly positioned within the CS. It is our custom that CS 9-10 should be positioned at the left edge of the spine in the left anterior oblique (LAO) projection. This "neutral" position places these poles at the junction of the right atrium and the CS opening. CS 1-2 will display signals from the lateral aspect of the left atrium. Most CS signals will have two components, A and V, on our green CS channel. Currently, we use a 10-pole (decapolar) CS catheter.</p>

                                    <p>Atrial activation sequence proceeds from proximal to distal in the normal heart assuming a normally positioned (neutral or central) CS catheter. If the CS catheter is not in the neutral position, atrial activation during ventricular pacing may appear eccentric and thus be very misleading (ie, mimicking APs). If the CS catheter is advanced too far into the CS, the signals may appear as a chevron (ie, CS 1-2 activation is as early as CS 9-10 activation). This early activation is due to detection of Bachmann's bundle.</p>

                            <p>All intracardiac catheters are plugged into patient interface blocks via connecting cables. The electrical signals detected from the catheters are sent to these blocks. From here, the signals are sent to the amplifier and then on to the recording system and monitors.</p>
                            <p>How your computer/recording system displays these signals is quite customizable. The colors of individual EGMs, signal location on the screen, order of the catheters displayed on the screen, gains, and filters are entirely modifiable.</p>
                            <p>In this image, we have our CS catheter plugged into the interface block on the far right. To see these signals, we instruct the computer to display Block A >> pins 1 to 10 >> and color them green. We then position these bipole signals (CS 1-2, CS 3-4, CS 5-6, CS 7-8, CS 9-10) at the bottom of our screen.</p>
                            <p>When troubleshooting, keep in mind that problems often stem from a "connectology" issue. Be sure catheters are connected securely to the connection cables, cables to the interface boxes, and boxes to the amplifier. Also check that channel gains are appropriate, filters have not been changed, and someone didn't turn off the signal display. It is not uncommon to accidentally plug the catheters into the wrong pins on these blue interface boxes and thus display no signals at all.</p>

                            <p>Gain simply increases the amplitude, or size, of the signal. It only amplifies whatever is on that channel, including (unfortunately) noise. Clipping is simply constraining the size of a signal to a geographic location on the monitor such that two adjacent signals don't overlap each other.</p>
                            <p>High-pass and low-pass filters are often confused. The high-pass filter allows any signals higher than the preset frequency (Hz) to be passed through to the monitor. Therefore, it filters out low-frequency signals, such as a wandering baseline. In this example, any intracardiac signal with a frequency higher than 30 Hz will be allowed to pass through to the monitor and any signal lower than 30 Hz will be blocked. The low-pass filter allows any signals less than the preset frequency to be passed through to the monitor. It, therefore, filters out high-frequency signals. In this example, any intracardiac signal with a frequency lower than 500 Hz will be allowed to pass through to the monitor and any signal higher than 500 Hz will be blocked.</p>
                            <p>The total effect is to allow signals between 30 and 500 Hz to be displayed. Signals outside this range are blocked from view.</p>
                            <p>The notch pass is a special and a relatively specific 60-Hz noise filter.</p>

                                    <p>Changing the high-pass filter on the ECG can markedly change its morphology. Try it and see the result. Highly filtered signals look "cleaner" but remove information, possibly important information. There is always a compromise between obtaining a clean signal and maintaining the information required. The filter settings displayed here are nominal and consistent across most recording systems.</p>

                                <li><strong>1st:</strong> The HRA A electrogram (AEGM) is the earliest since this catheter is closest to the sino-atrial (SA) node. Note that it corresponds to the onset of the surface P-wave.</li>
                                <li><strong>2nd:</strong> HIS A is the next AEGM to appear in sequence. The wave of atrial depolarization has successfully arrived at the AV node.</li>
                                <li><strong>3rd:</strong> CS A signals appear next as the wave spreads from the proximal CS distally into the left atrium.</li>
                                <li><strong>4th:</strong> The H deflection on the HIS catheter is next. This indicates that the wave has propagated over the atrioventricular (AV) node and arrived at the bundle of His.</li>
                                <li><strong>5th:</strong> The RVA V electrogram (VEGM) is generally next as it is near to the right bundle branch exit, which is usually the first part of the ventricles to be activated. Note that it is before the HIS V or CS V signals since the wave of depolarization travels down the bundle branches, past the apex, and arrives at the base of the ventricles last.</li>

                                    <p>Take careful note that the RVA V signal is ahead of the HIS V and CS V signals in sinus rhythm since the right ventricle is activated early in normal depolarization without bundle branch block. On the other hand, the HIS or CS V signal may precede the right ventricle with right bundle branch block (RBBB), where the left ventricle will be activated before the right. This relationship could change if an AP is present and may give a clue as to the insertion site of the AP into the ventricles.</p>

                                <li><strong>A-H interval:</strong> Measure on the HIS channel as the A signal to the onset of the H deflection. (See the white calipers.)

                                <li>Conduction velocity</li>
                                <li>Refractoriness</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Tissue conduction velocity refers to the speed at which the electrical signals travel between cells in a specific part of the heart. In contrast, the refractory period measures recovery time of the tissue before it can conduct electrical signals again.</p>
                            <p>Tissues with rapid conduction time may or may not have short refractory periods and vice versa. The usual measurement we cite is the effective refractory period (ERP). For example, the ERP of the AV node is the longest atrial extra-stimulus (or A1-A2) that fails to conduct to the His bundle as the extra-stimuli are gradually decremented, that is, brought progressively closer to the last paced beat (last A signal of the eight-beat drive cycle). Another common measure that also essentially gauges refractoriness is the block cycle length. The block cycle length is determined via incremental pacing (pacing progressively faster in small increments) and is the longest cycle that blocks. This is usually referred to as the Wenckebach cycle length. A short block cycle length indicates tissue capable of sustaining rapid rates during a tachycardia.</p>

                                    <p>This image is a schematic illustration of the extra-stimulus technique using the example of an atrial stimulation site. Time is represented horizontally, and the passage of the impulse through the heart is represented vertically. The heart is paced at a defined rate (generally eight beats), designated S1. In successive runs, an extra-stimulus (S2) is made progressively more premature to the last S1 and thus "scans" the cardiac cycle. S2 is progressively decreased until it fails to capture the atrium.</p>
                                    <p>The top row shows a drive with conduction occurring over a "fast" AV nodal pathway. The second row shows block of the impulse at the fast pathway with conduction over the "slow" AV nodal pathway. In the third row, the S2 is sufficiently premature to block to the slow pathway. The fourth row shows an S2 that is sufficiently premature to prevent atrial capture. In this way, the ERPs of the various structures can be determined (ie, the longest coupling interval that doesn't make it to the next level).</p>

                            <h3>Incremental Ventricular Pacing</h3>
                            <p>Our diagnostic study begins with incremental ventricular pacing to establish the retrograde block cycle length (Wenckebach cycle length) of the A-V conduction system. Pacing begins 100 msec faster than the patient's intrinsic rate and decreases by 10 to 20 msec every eight beats until 1:1 ventriculo-atrial (V-A) conduction is no longer maintained. We do not pace faster than 250 msec because ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) may be induced at higher rates. There are four basic questions to consider:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Did the pacing capture the ventricle?</strong> Inspect the ECG and EGMs to confirm that the pacing stimulus did indeed capture the ventricle.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Is there V-A conduction?</strong> Look at the RVA channel (magenta) and the HRA channel (red) and establish the relationship between ventricular activation and atrial activation. This example shows each VEGM followed by an AEGM, or 1:1 conduction (arrows). At any given pacing rate, there may be no V-A conduction at all (the A signals will have no relationship to the V signals) or there may be V-A conduction that is 2:1 or some other ratio.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>What is the pattern of retrograde atrial activation?</strong> In the normal heart, retrograde conduction to the atrium occurs via the AV node so that atrial activation will occur here first. This is referred to as "central" or "concentric" atrial activation and is seen as the yellow HIS A being the first A seen following the large V. It is generally slightly ahead of any CS A. The proximal CS is close to the AV node and is thus activated next. That is, the CS AEGMs activate at CS 7-8 first, followed by CS 5-6, CS 3-4, and finally CS 1-2. This central pattern is the expected pattern when retrograde conduction is through the AV node. When the earliest A signal is not at the HIS A, the pattern is referred to as "eccentric" atrial activation, which suggests that there may be another connection between the ventricles and the atrium other than the AV node (ie, an AP).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Does the V-A time stay constant or become prolonged (decrements) as we increase the pacing rate?</strong> The expected behavior of the AV node is that conduction slows at higher pacing rates. Therefore, at higher rates, the V-A time should be longer if conduction is going through the AV node (due to its decremental properties). This is readily obvious on the CS channels. Most APs do not decrement. Therefore, the absence of V-A time prolongation at higher pacing rates suggests conduction using an AP.

                                    <p>The fifth question is "What is the V-A time?" A long V-A time could indicate a retrograde slow pathway or a decremental AP. Since both demonstrate a long V-A time, making an accurate diagnosis of the tachycardia circuit may be quite challenging! More pacing maneuvers are required.</p>

                            <p>This tracing illustrates the loss of 1:1 V-A conduction. The pacing interval at which this occurs is referred to as the retrograde block cycle length or the retrograde Wenckebach point.</p>
                            <p>Notice that the V capture in the magenta RVA channel is followed by a red A in the HRA channel for the first three paced beats. The fourth paced beat (third arrow) shows a magenta V but no associated red A. This loss of an HRA A signal confirms that we have reached the Wenckebach point of the retrograde A-V conduction system.</p>
                            <p>Also notice in the yellow HIS and green CS channels that the time from the V signal to the A signal has lengthened compared with the tracing on the previous page, implying decrement in the AV node as we increase our pacing rate. The level of block with incremental pacing is generally at the AV node.</p>
                            <p>This is normal AV nodal physiology.</p>

                                    <p>A common mistake is not appreciating minimal decrement. You must measure the V-A time at the beginning of this pacing maneuver and monitor throughout the run as well as at the end. You measure a V-A time from the onset of ventricular activation to the earliest A signal on any channel. Absence of decrement may be seen with the normal V-A conduction system but should raise the suspicion of an AP (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome).</p>

                            <h3>Ventricular Extra-stimulus Pacing</h3>
                            <p>This pacing sequence frequently induces the culprit clinical tachycardia in addition to establishing the conduction properties of the retrograde conduction system. An extra-systole (S2) is introduced after a drive train of eight S1s. The timing between the last S1 and the S2 is known as the S1-S2 coupling interval, and this is progressively decreased with each pacing sequence.</p>
                            <p>We generally do two runs at different drive cycle lengths, usually 600 and 400 msec. For example, at a drive train of 600, the coupling intervals are 600-580, 600-560...600-200 msec.</p>
                            <p>We do a second drive train with coupling intervals of 400-380, 400-360...400-200 msec. Be aware that there is no consistent relationship between antegrade and retrograde conduction over the A-V conduction system or indeed any other cardiac tissue.</p>
                            <p>As one shortens the S1-S2 coupling interval, the V-A conduction time following the S2 will lengthen, usually due to decrement in the AV node. This can be clearly seen on the CS channels following the S2 in this example.</p>

                            <p>As we continue to shorten the S1-S2 coupling interval, we reach the point at which V-A conduction fails to conduct to the atrium since it has not had sufficient time to recover after conducting the last S1. We have thus reached the retrograde ERP of the V-A conduction system (usually due to block in the AV node).</p>
                            <p>In this tracing, note that the magenta S2 is not followed by a red A on the HRA channel (third arrow). We document this as V-A conduction block. This is also apparent from a lack of A signals on the other channels.</p>
                            <p>V-A conduction is quite variable from individual to individual. It may be completely absent or the retrograde ERP may be very short.</p>
                            <p>As mentioned earlier, some individuals have two retrograde pathways over the AV node, one with fast conduction and one with slow conduction. We may see the V-A time suddenly "jump" from a short V-A time to a much longer V-A time, possibly reflecting the switch from the fast to the slow pathway. This jump should be noted and may suggest the substrate for a reentrant circuit.</p>

                            <h3>Ventricular Effective Refractory Period</h3>
                            <p>As we shorten the S1-S2 coupling interval, we reach the point at which the myocardium itself can no longer respond to the S2 since it is still refractory from the previous S1. We have now reached the ERP of the ventricular myocardium.</p>
                            <p>We document this as "no capture" (NC) or ventricular effective refractory period (VERP). Note that the S2 pacing artifact or "spike" (as seen on the surface ECG or the magenta RVA channel) does not generate a QRS on the surface ECG. Be sure that this is truly NC, as this loss of capture may also be caused by catheter movement inside the heart with failure to make contact with the myocardium. If you are unsure, repeat the drive and coupling interval to confirm that the NC is reproducible.</p>
                            <p>NC typically occurs with the S2 coupling interval in range of 250 to 200 msec.</p>

                                    <p>NC can also occur due to an insufficient pacing current. Before the study begins, you must establish the pacing threshold for the atria and the ventricles. The study is generally conducted while pacing at two or three times this threshold. Typically, if the catheters are positioned securely, both atria and ventricles will capture at 2 mA and a pulse width of 2 msec. The CS catheter, being along the A-V ring, may capture either the atrium (usually more proximally) or the ventricle (more distally in CS). The CS catheter typically needs more current to capture either the atrium or the ventricle due to poorer tissue contact.</p>

                            <h3>Atrial Extra-stimulus Pacing</h3>
                            <p>The next step in our diagnostic study is atrial extra-stimulus testing (S1-S2). This frequently induces our target tachycardia and allows us to evaluate the antegrade properties of the normal A-V conduction system (or AP if present). Since the AV node normally demonstrates decremental conduction, the A-H interval (yellow arrows) is a major focus of interest. Decremental conduction refers to the AV node's unique property of prolonging its conduction time in response to a shorter S1-S2 coupling interval. Hence, the A-H interval will become progressively longer as we shorten the S1-S2 coupling interval.</p>
                            <p>Note in this tracing that the A-H interval following the S2 is longer (second arrow) than the A-H interval during the S1 drive train (first arrow). An A-H interval typically begins at approximately 80 to 100 msec and lengthens (decrements) to slightly over 200 msec. An A-H interval longer than about 210 to 220 msec is often an indication that a second "slow" pathway is present. Typically, when a slow pathway is present, there is a sudden increase in the A-H interval as conduction blocks in the fast pathway and conducts more slowly over the slow pathway. This sudden increase in the A-H interval (>50 msec) with a 10-msec shortening of the S1-S2 coupling interval is often called a jump. See page 40.</p>

                                    <p>A jump reflects that we have reached the ERP of the fast pathway and conduction has shifted to a slower pathway. Absence of a jump does not preclude the presence of a slow pathway. A more sensitive way of discerning a jump is to plot a graph of A-H intervals against the S1-S2 coupling intervals to look for a more subtle discontinuity in the curve relating the A-H to prematurity of the extra-stimulus.</p>

                            <h3>Incremental Atrial Pacing</h3>
                            <p>The final pacing maneuver in our routine diagnostic study is incremental atrial pacing. It establishes the antegrade block cycle length or antegrade Wenckebach point of the AV node. We do this last since incremental atrial pacing has the greatest potential to induce AF.</p>
                            <p>Note in this tracing that a red A pacing artifact is followed by a magenta VEGM in the RVA channel—until beat number 7. This atrial beat is not followed by a ventricular response. We therefore have reached the antegrade Wenckebach point of the AV node.</p>
                            <p>Also notice that the AV node is decrementing (A-H is progressively increasing), as visualized by a longer distance between the A pace and the RVA response (progressively longer arrows). You can also see in the CS channels that the A-V distance is increasing.</p>
