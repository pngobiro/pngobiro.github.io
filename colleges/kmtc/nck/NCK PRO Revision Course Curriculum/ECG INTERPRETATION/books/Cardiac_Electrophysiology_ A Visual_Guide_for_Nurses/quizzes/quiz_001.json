      "question": "Match the standard Electrophysiology abbreviation to its correct anatomical definition.",

        { "id": "p1", "left": "CS", "right": "Coronary Sinus" },

      "explanation": "Standard EP abbreviations: CS (Coronary Sinus) is the vein draining the heart; HRA (High Right Atrium) is near the sinus node; RVA (Right Ventricular Apex) is the tip of the RV; CTI (Cavo-Tricuspid Isthmus) is the target for flutter ablation.",

      "question": "What is the definition of 'Antidromic' in the context of Atrioventricular Reentrant Tachycardia (AVRT)?",
      "points": 10,
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Conduction down the accessory pathway and up the AV node", "isCorrect": true },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Conduction down the AV node and up the accessory pathway", "isCorrect": false },
        { "id": "c", "text": "Conduction going in the same direction as the predominant wave", "isCorrect": false },
        { "id": "d", "text": "Conduction that blocks in both directions simultaneously", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Antidromic means 'against the current'. In AVRT, it refers to the circuit going down the accessory pathway (causing a wide QRS due to pre-excitation) and up the AV node, which is opposite to the normal physiological conduction direction.",
      "hint": "Does this conduction direction result in a narrow or wide QRS complex?"
    },

      "question": "An 'Echo' beat in an EP study is defined as an unexpected return of a wave of depolarization to the chamber where the wave originated.",
      "points": 10,
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "True. An echo beat is essentially a single beat of reentrant tachycardia returning to its origin (e.g., an atrial beat traveling down the AV node and returning to the atrium).",
      "hint": "Think of how sound returns to its source."

        { "id": "b1", "acceptedAnswers": ["Wenckebach", "wenckebach"] }
      ],
      "caseSensitive": false,
      "explanation": "The Wenckebach cycle length is the pacing interval (shortest cycle length) where the AV node (or other tissue) can no longer conduct every beat 1:1, usually displaying progressive delay before the block.",
      "hint": "Named after a famous cardiologist describing progressive block."

        { "id": "d", "text": "It has very slow decremental conduction properties", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "A concealed pathway conducts only from ventricle to atrium. Since it doesn't conduct antegradely, there is no pre-excitation (delta wave) on the surface ECG during sinus rhythm, effectively 'concealing' its presence until tachycardia starts.",
      "hint": "If it doesn't show up on the ECG during sinus rhythm, why is that?"
