      "explanation": "Typical AVNRT is 'Slow-Fast': signals go DOWN the Slow pathway (causing a long AH interval) and UP the Fast pathway (causing a short VA interval/echo).",

      "explanation": "Bidirectional block means the signal cannot cross the line; it must go all the way around the tricuspid annulus, resulting in late activation on the other side regardless of pacing direction (medial-to-lateral or lateral-to-medial).",

      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "False. Antidromic AVRT conducts down the accessory pathway (pre-excitation) and up the node. Because ventricular activation is fully via the AP, the QRS is wide (maximally pre-excited).",

      "explanation": "Focal VT spreads out from a single spot (centrifugal). Reentrant VT spins around an obstacle (like scar), often having an identifiable isthmus.",
