                            <p>In this unit we present some representative tracings illustrating the thinking process that one uses during the course of the study. Correct interpretation requires both a fundamental knowledge of facts and the ability to use them in deductive reasoning. The learning process is life-long and this is but a small sampling.</p>
                            <p>There are other points of interest that are not discussed and even other possible explanations. Some issues are quite black and white, while others may be more open to alternate explanations or speculation. Try to sort out this tracing before reading the commentary. In this tracing, a premature atrial beat (arrow) is programmed into the tachycardia. What is the mechanism of this tachycardia?</p>

                                    <p>This is a “wide-complex” tachycardia, a common clinical interpretative dilemma. The differential diagnosis includes VT, SVT with bundle branch block aberrancy, and SVT with pre-excitation (WPW).</p>
                                    <p>There is one atrial deflection for each ventricular deflection, but one does not know whether it is an SVT leading the QRS or a VT conducting retrogradely to the atrium. The HIS catheter, properly positioned, does not show a His bundle deflection, ruling out SVT with aberrancy. This leaves VT or pre-excited tachycardia.</p>
                                    <p>If you caliper carefully, you will see that this PAC advances the next QRS. This would not be expected with VT, where a change in the ventricular timing after a PAC would be very rare. You might ponder why this is so. We are now only left with the correct diagnosis of pre-excited antidromic tachycardia.</p>

                                    <p>The first, second, and last cycles have no preceding atrial activity. The QRS is narrow and atrial activation is essentially simultaneous with the QRS. This is most compatible with a junctional rhythm that probably originates within the AV node/His bundle region and is a common escape rhythm with sinus bradycardia. The third and fourth beats are preceded by atrial activity and a surface P-wave. Atrial activity begins in the distal CS (1-2). These are most compatible with PACs coming from the left atrium, possibly as a result of pressure from the CS catheter.</p>

                            <p>This figure shows the last two beats of a drive (S1). The A-H interval is prolonged after the premature stimulus S2 since it is early and AV nodal conduction is rate-dependent. However, it shortens again after the second extra-stimulus, the S3. One might expect it to prolong even further after a second extra-stimulus.</p>

                            <p>In this tracing, we tried inducing an SVT with a ventricular extrastimulus (S2). It blocked in the left lateral AP as well as the AV node. However, a spontaneous PVC did successfully initiate AVRT. Each QRS during tachycardia is followed closely by eccentric atrial activation starting in the distal CS (1-2). This can only be AVRT over a left lateral AP (you may consider why). Interestingly, the TCL is irregular, which is related to a changing A-H interval. Why is the A-H interval changing?</p>

                                    <p>The concept of dual AV nodal pathways has been discussed, and the slow AV nodal pathway is usually the antegrade limb of the circuit in AVNRT. However, patients with A-V tachycardias may also have dual pathways.</p>
                                    <p>In this example, antegrade conduction utilizes either the slow pathway or the fast pathway with some decrement. Since the right ventricular PVC takes much longer to travel to the AP, the A-H interval is shorter. Once the tachycardia is under way, the circuit is smaller, shortening the A-A time and thus lengthening the A-H interval.</p>

                                    <p>The right atrial and right ventricular signals are very useful here since there is no atrial activation on the right ventricular lead and only a tiny far-field ventricular activation on the right atrial lead.

                                    <p>This unexpected cycle can be a random His extra-systole or can be related to the A signal following the S2. Since the observation was highly reproducible, it is most probably related to the A following S2. This is called a “2 for 1” phenomenon, or “twofer,” where the atrial beat after an S2 goes initially over a fast AV nodal pathway with a short PR interval but also goes over a slow AV nodal pathway resulting in two QRS cycles from a single atrial extra-stimulus. You should also note the atrial activation simultaneous with that second QRS (HRA channel). What do you think that would be? It is an AV nodal echo caused by retrograde conduction back up the fast pathway. Hence, the “2 for 1” was followed by an AV nodal echo beat!</p>

There is a subsequent pause and the sinus node provided an escape cycle (see the early A at the HRA channel just before the QRS). Due to its close proximity to the QRS, it could not have been conducted to the QRS. It then seems reasonable that the QRS is a result of a junctional escape beat.</p>

                                    <p>The desired goal of PV ablation is complete block of conduction out of the vein (exit block) and block of conduction into the vein (entrance block). Each stimulus is followed by a near-field EGM in the multipolar (Lasso) catheter indicating capture of the PV musculature inside the PV. These EGMs don't affect the sinus rhythm evident on the surface ECG or the other intracardiac channels. Clearly we have exit block.</p>
                                    <p>In the middle of this tracing, we see a conducted sinus beat. Note that the PV signals are "silent," indicating no conduction into the vein either (entrance block). This vein is now completely isolated.</p>
