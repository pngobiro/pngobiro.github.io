                            <h3>Classification of Causes</h3>
                            <p>The causes of mental illness can be classified into three categories:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Predisposing Factors</strong><br>
                                    These factors determine the likelihood of one getting a mental illness. Usually they are adverse experiences one undergoes in early life. They include physical, psychological and social factors in infancy and early childhood.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Precipitating Factors</strong><br>
                                    These are events that take place shortly before the onset of a disorder. Physical precipitants include cerebral tumours, malaria or drug abuse. Social and psychological precipitants include misfortunes such as loss of a job, losing a loved person, or sudden change in routine activities.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Perpetuating Factors</strong><br>
                                    Once the disorder has been triggered, these factors do prolong the course of the disease. They are secondary in nature since they may appear long after the original predisposing factors have been treated. Examples include secondary demoralisation and withdrawal from social activities.
                                </li>

                            <h3>Factors that Influence Attitudes towards Mental Health and Mental Illness</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Culture</strong>: The way people think, behave or feel is shaped by their culture. Culture also determines the features of insanity, for example, who is labelled as insane and under what circumstances. What is considered insane in one culture may be considered perfectly normal in another. Culture also gives guidelines on the nature of treatment and the identity of the helper.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Education</strong>: The level of education also influences attitudes towards mental health and mental illness. An educated person has a better understanding of health and mental illness, thus making their attitude more positive.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Health Beliefs</strong>: These will determine whether the individual’s attitude is positive or negative. It will depend on how the patient explains the illness to themselves, that is, whether they believe in germ theory, evil spirits or an imbalance of some kind.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Religion</strong>: A patient’s reaction to mental illness will often depend on whether or not the patient believes in God or a particular religion, for example, some religions believe that ill health is caused by evil spirits. Usually, religion encourages the followers to be empathetic to sick people.
