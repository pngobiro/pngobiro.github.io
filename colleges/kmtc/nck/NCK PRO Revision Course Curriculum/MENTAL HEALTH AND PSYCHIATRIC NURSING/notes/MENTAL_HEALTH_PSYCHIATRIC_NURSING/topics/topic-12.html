                                <strong>Crisis definition by Caplan:</strong> Psychological disequilibrium in a person who confronts a hazardous circumstance that for him constitutes an important problem which he can for the time being neither escape nor solve with his customary problem solving resources.

                                <li>
                                    <strong>PHASE 1</strong>: The individual is exposed to the precipitating stressor. Anxiety increases. Previous problem solving techniques are employed.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>PHASE 2</strong>: When previous problem solving techniques do not relieve the stressor, anxiety increases further. The individual begins to feel a great deal of discomfort at this point. Coping techniques that have worked in the past are attempted, only to create feelings of helplessness when they are not successful. Feelings of confusion & disorganization prevail.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>PHASE 3</strong>: All possible resources, both internal & external are called upon to resolve the problem & relieve discomfort. The individual may try to view the problem from a different perspective or even to overlook certain aspects of it. New problem solving techniques may be employed, and if effectual, resolution may occur at this phase, with the individual returning to higher, lower or previous level of premorbid functioning.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>PHASE 4</strong>: If the problem is not solved & new coping skills are ineffective, anxiety can overwhelm the person & lead to serious personality disorganization, depression, confusion, violence against others or suicidal behaviour.
                                </li>

                            <h3>Types of Crises</h3>
                            <p>Baldwin (1978) identified 6 classes of emotional crises, which progress by degree of severity. The type of crisis determines the method of intervention selected.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>1. Dispositional crises</strong><br>
                                    An acute response to an external situational stressor.<br>
                                    <em>Example:</em> Mary & Tom married 3 years ago with 1 year old daughter. Tom has difficulties with his boss at work. This makes him to explode in anger at home & abusive to his wife, because dinner is not ready. He batters the wife & throws away the child. Wife moves to the emergency department in nearest hospital.<br>
                                    <em>Intervention:</em> Treat the physical wounds for the wife. Send her to a counsellor for guidance & counselling.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>2. Crises of anticipated life transitions</strong><br>
                                    These are normal life cycle transitions that may be anticipated, but over which the individual may feel a lack of control.<br>
                                    <em>Example:</em> marriage life with the presence of a new baby.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>3. Crises resulting from traumatic stress</strong><br>
                                    These crises are precipitated by unexpected, external stresses over which the individual has little or no control, & from which he or she feels emotionally overwhelmed & defeated.<br>
                                    <em>Example:</em> Gang rape when someone is on night shift or travelling at night.<br>
                                    <em>Intervention:</em> Talk to the client about the experience & ventilate feelings associated with it. Offer reassurance & support. Discuss stages of grief & how rape causes loss of self worth. Identify support systems that can help client resume normal activities. Explore new methods of coping with emotions arising from a situation with which she has had no previous experience.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>4. Maturational / developmental crises</strong><br>
                                    These types of crises occur in response to situations that trigger emotions related to unresolved conflicts in ones life. These crises are of internal origin & reflect underlying developmental issues that involve dependency, value conflicts, sexual identity & capacity for emotional intimacy.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>5. Crises reflecting psychopathology</strong><br>
                                    Emotional crises in which preexisting psychopathology has been instrumental in precipitating the crises or in which psychopathology significantly impairs or complicate adaptive resolution.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> Severe neuroses, schizophrenia.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>6. Psychiatric emergencies</strong><br>
                                    Crises situations in which general functioning has been severely impaired & the individual rendered incompetent or unable to assume personal responsibility.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> Acute suicide, Drug overdoses, Acute psychosis, Uncontrollable anger, Alcohol intoxication, Aggressive behaviour/violence.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><strong>Hopeful</strong>: People may be left feeling demoralized as a result of their condition. Rehabilitation focuses on helping clients feel hopeful about the future</li>
                                <li><strong>Empowered</strong>: Each individual needs to feel that they are able to set their own goals and have the power and autonomy to pursue those aims.</li>
                                <li><strong>Skilled</strong>: Rehabilitation helps teach people skills to help them manage their condition and live the life they want to live. This includes living skills, work skills, social skills, and others.</li>
                                <li><strong>Supported</strong>: Mental health professionals should offer support and help clients build relationships and social connections in their community.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>Professional services should be committed and take place in as normalized an environment as possible.</li>
                                <li>There is a focus on a social model of care (as opposed to a medical model).</li>
                                <li>It is centered on the present rather than fixated on the past.</li>

                                <li><strong>Reduction of impairments</strong>: Rehabilitation interventions with psychiatric patients require reduction or elimination of the symptoms and cognitive impairments that interfere with social and vocational performance.

                                <li><strong>Remediation of disabilities through skill training</strong>: Skill training is used to remediate disabilities in social, family and vocational functioning. Patients generally require training in self-care skills, interpersonal skills, vocational and employment pursuits, recreational and leisure skills.</li>
                                <li><strong>Remediating disabilities through supportive interventions</strong>: When restoration of social and vocational functioning through skills training is limited by continuing deficits, rehabilitation strategies aim at helping the individuals compensate for handicap by learning skills in living and working environments, adjusting the individual and family expectations to a level of functioning that is realistically attainable.</li>
                                <li><strong>Remediation of handicaps</strong>: In addition to clinical rehabilitation interventions, the disabled persons can be helped to overcome their handicaps through social rehabilitation interventions, e.g. community support programs.</li>

Measures are taken to enhance the person’s acceptance of his illness; encourage the client and family members to actively participate in care related activities and adopt coping strategies to overcome the problems occurring related to disease process and to live more productively within the community.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Evaluation of psychiatric rehabilitation services usually takes place at the level of impact on the patient, family and the effectiveness of the community service system.</p>
