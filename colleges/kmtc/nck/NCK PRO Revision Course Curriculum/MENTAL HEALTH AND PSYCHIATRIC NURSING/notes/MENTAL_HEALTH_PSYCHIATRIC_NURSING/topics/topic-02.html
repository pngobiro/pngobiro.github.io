                            <h3>Overview</h3>
                            <p>There are two primary theories discussed in this unit:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Psychoanalytic theory by Sigmund Freud</li>
                                <li>Social learning theory by Erik Erickson</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Psychoanalytic Theory (Sigmund Freud)</h3>
                            <p>The theory posits that all human behaviour is determined by earlier life events and that human behaviour is driven by energy known as libido. It is also argued that people function at three levels of awareness:</p>
                            
                            <h4>Levels of Awareness</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Conscious level</strong> where immediate events and perceptions are stored</li>
                                <li><strong>Pre-conscious level</strong> where thoughts and feelings are not accessible with ease</li>
                                <li><strong>Unconscious level</strong> where material is not accessible most of the time</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Developmental Stages</h4>
                            <p>According to the proponents of psychoanalysis, people develop through five stages:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Oral phase (Birth to 1 year)</strong>: Sexual satisfaction is obtained through the mouth by actions of sucking or biting.</li>
                                <li><strong>Anal phase (1 year to 3 years)</strong>: Sexual satisfaction is obtained through the anus.</li>
                                <li><strong>Phallic phase (3 years to 6 years)</strong>: During which interest in the genitalia is developed and the individual acquires gender roles.</li>
                                <li><strong>Latent phase (7 years to 11 years)</strong>: Where there is no sexual interest, this divides boys and girls into different groups.</li>
                                <li><strong>Genital phase (12 years and onwards)</strong>: When the capacity for objective and mature sex is developed.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>Personality Structures</h4>
                            <p>According to this theory, the human personality is made up of three hypothetical structures:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Id</strong><br>
                                    The id is the most primitive and is driven by impulses. It demands immediate gratification of the needs.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Ego</strong><br>
                                    The ego, which unlike the id, is in contact with reality. It is able to delay the satisfaction of a need until an appropriate time, place, or object is available. It mediates between the id and the super ego.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Super Ego</strong><br>
                                    The super ego, whose main function is to oppose the id. It contains values, legal, moral regulations, and social expectations.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Socio-learning Theory (Erik Erickson)</h3>
                            <p>Erikson postulated eight human developmental stages which one has to go through in normal life. He called them psychosocial stages. Each stage is characterised by tasks or ego qualities, which one has to develop in normal life.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Trust versus Mistrust (0 - 18 months)</strong><br>
                                    This is attained during infancy. Trust is developed when the mother breastfeeds the infant as well as meeting other needs of the infant such as changing wet diapers.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Autonomy versus Shame and Doubt (18 months - 3 years)</strong><br>
                                    During this period the child wants some independence from the mother. This period is referred to as toddlerhood.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Initiative versus Guilt (3 - 6 years)</strong><br>
                                    Otherwise known as the pre-school years. The child is able to initiate action on its own in an effort to manipulate the environment.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Industry versus Inferiority (6 - 12 years)</strong><br>
                                    This takes place during school years. The child is able to acquire skills in sports, calculate in figures and language skills are well developed.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Identity versus Role Confusion (12 - 20 years)</strong><br>
                                    Referred to as adolescence. During this time an individual acquires an identity as a male or female corresponding to specific roles in the society.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Intimacy versus Isolation (20 - 40 years)</strong><br>
                                    Here, one has productive work and has satisfactory sexual relations with an intimate member of the opposite sex.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Generativity versus Stagnation (45 - 65 years)</strong><br>
                                    During this period, one is involved in establishing and guiding the next generation. Productivity and creativity is at its peak.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Integrity versus Despair (65 - death)</strong><br>
                                    During this time one develops new and different love for one’s parents. One also develops emotional integration and is able to defend the dignity of one’s own life-style against threat. The individual is capable of fellowship and will often take leadership responsibilities in the community.
                                </li>
