                            <h3>Definition</h3>
                            <p>Disturbance in the normally well integrated continuum of consciousness, memory, identity and perception. Dissociation is an unconscious defence mechanism that protects the individual against overwhelming anxiety.</p>

                                    <strong>Depersonalization Disorder</strong><br>
                                    A persistent or recurrent alteration in perception of the self while reality testing remains intact (they are not delusional or hallucinating). The person may feel mechanical, dreamy and detached from the body. May experience a sense of deadness of the body or seeing oneself from a distance. Does not respond to medication or any therapy.

                                    <strong>Dissociative Amnesia</strong><br>
                                    Marked by the inability to recall important personal information, often of a traumatic or stressful nature. This lack of memory is too pervasive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness.

                                        <li><em>General amnesia</em>: unable to recall information about entire lifetime.</li>

                                        <li><em>Selective amnesia</em>: able to recall some but not all events in a certain period.</li>

                                    <strong>Dissociative Fugue</strong><br>
                                    Characterized by sudden, unexpected travel away from the customary locale and inability to recall one’s identity and information about some or all of the past.
                                </li>

                                    Is the presence of two or more distinct personality states that recurrently take control of behavior.
