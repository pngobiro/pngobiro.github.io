                            <p>Previously known as mental retardation in DSM IV. Mental retardation is defined as 'significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning, that is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning' in such areas like self-care, work and safety.</p>
                            <p>For one to be diagnosed as having mental retardation, the problem should have started before the age of seventeen years. If it occurs thereafter, it is considered as dementia.</p>
                            <p>Mental retardation occurs among children throughout the world. It tends to increase in severity with age starting at five to six and reaches the peak at aged 15.</p>

                                <li><strong>Biological</strong>: Some studies suggest that defects or injuries to certain areas of the brain can lead to behavior disorders. Conduct disorder has been linked to particular brain regions involved in regulating behavior, impulse control, and emotion.</li>
                                <li><strong>Genetics</strong>: Many children and teens with conduct disorder have close family members with mental illnesses, including mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and personality disorders.</li>
                                <li><strong>Environmental</strong>: Factors such as a dysfunctional family life, childhood abuse, traumatic experiences, a family history of substance abuse, and inconsistent discipline by parents may contribute to the development of conduct disorder.</li>
                                <li><strong>Psychological</strong>: Some experts believe that conduct disorders can reflect problems with moral awareness (notably, lack of guilt and remorse) and deficits in cognitive processing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Social</strong>: Low socioeconomic status and not being accepted by their peers appear to be risk factors for the development of conduct disorder.</li>
