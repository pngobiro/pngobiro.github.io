                            <p>The following techniques facilitate communication and understanding:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Accepting</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Indicating reception<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Yes”, “I follow what you said”, Nodding<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> An accepting response indicates the nurse has heard and followed the train of thought. It does not indicate agreement but is nonjudgmental. Facial expression, tone of voice, and so forth also must convey acceptance or the words will lose their meaning
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Broad Openings</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Allowing the client to take the initiative in introducing the topic<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Is there something you’d like to talk about?”, “Where would you like me to begin?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Broad openings make explicit that the client has the lead in the interaction. For the client who is hesitant about talking, broad openings may stimulate him or her to take the initiative
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Consensual Validation</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Searching for mutual understanding, for accord in the meaning of the words.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Tell me whether my understanding of it agrees with yours.”, “Are you using this word to convey that . .”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> For verbal communication to be meaningful, it is essential that the words being used should have the same meaning for all participants. Sometimes words, phrases, or slang terms have different meanings and can be easily misunderstood.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Encouraging Comparison</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Helping the client to understand by looking at similarities and differences.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Was it something like. . . ?”, “Have you had similar experiences?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Comparing ideas, experiences, or relationships brings out many recurring themes. The client benefits from making these comparisons because he or she might recall past coping strategies that were effective or remember the he or she has survived a similar situation
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Encouraging Description of Perceptions</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Asking client to verbalize what he or she perceives.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Tell me when you feel anxious”, “What is happening?”, “What does the voice seem to be saying?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> To understand the client, the nurse must see things from his or her perspective. Encouraging the client to describe ideas fully may relieve the tension the client is feeling, and he or she might be less likely to take action on ideas that are harmful or frightening.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Encouraging Expression</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Asking client to appraise the quality of his or her experience.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “What are your feelings in regard to. . ?”, “Does this contribute to your distress?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> The nurse asks the client to consider people and events in light of his or her own values. Doing so encourages the client to make his or her own appraisal rather than accepting the opinion of others.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Exploring</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Delving further into a subject or idea.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Tell me more about that.”, “Would you describe it more fully?”, “What kind of work?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> When clients deal with topics superficially, exploring can help them examine the issue more fully. Any problem or concern can be better understood if explored in depth. If the client expresses an unwillingness to explore a subject, however, the nurse must respect his or her wishes.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Focusing</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Concentrating on a single point.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “This point seems looking at more closely.”, “Of all the concerns you have mentioned, which is most troublesome?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> The nurse encourages the client to concentrate his or her energies on a single point, which may prevent a multitude of factors or problems from overwhelming the client. It is also a useful technique when a client jumps from one topic to another.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Formulating a Plan of Action</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Asking the client to consider kinds of behavior likely to be appropriate in future situations.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “What could you do to let your anger out harmlessly?”, “Next time this comes up, what might you do to handle it?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> It may be helpful for the client to plan in advance what he or she might do in future similar situations. Making definite plans increases the likelihood that the client will cope more effectively in a similar situation
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>General Leads</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Giving encouragement to continue.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Go on.”, “And then?”, “Tell me about it.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> General leads indicate that the nurse is listening and following what the client is saying without taking away the initiative for the interaction. They also encourage the client to continue if he or she is hesitant or uncomfortable about the topic.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Giving Information</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Making available the facts that the client needs.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “My name is. . .”, “Visiting hours are. . .”, “My purpose in being here is. . .”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Informing the client of facts increases his or her knowledge about a topic or lets the client know what to expect. The nurse is functioning as a resource person. Giving information also builds trust with the client.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Giving Recognition</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Acknowledging, indicating awareness.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Good Morning Ms. A. . .”, “You’ve finished your list of things to do.”, “I notice that you’ve combed your hair.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Greeting the client by name, indicating awareness of change, or noting efforts the client has made all show that the nurse recognizes the client as a person, as an individual. Such recognition does not carry the notion of value, that is, of being “good” or “bad”.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Making Observations</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Verbalizing what the nurse perceives.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “You appear tense.”, “Are you uncomfortable when . . ?”, “I notice that you are biting your lip.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Sometimes clients cannot verbalize or make themselves understood. Or the client may not be ready to talk.

                                    <em>Definition:</em> Making oneself available.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “I will sit with you awhile.”, “I will stay here with you.”, “I am interested in what you think.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> The nurse can offer his or her presence, interest, and desire to understand. It is important that this offer is unconditional, that is, the client does not have to respond verbally to get the nurse’s attention.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Placing Event in Time Sequence</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Clarifying the relationship of events in time.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “What seemed to lead up to. . ?”, “Was this before or after?”, “When did this happen?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Putting events in proper sequence helps both the nurse and client to see them in perspective. The client may gain insight into cause-and-effect behavior and consequences, or perhaps some things are not related. The nurse may gain information about recurrent patterns or themes in the client’s behavior relationship.

                                    <em>Definition:</em> Offering for consideration that which is real.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “I see no one else in the room.”, “That sound was a car backfiring.”, “Your mother is not here. I am a nurse.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> When it is obvious that a client is misinterpreting reality, the nurse can indicate what is real. The nurse does this by calmly and quietly expressing the nurse’s perceptions of the facts not by way of arguing with the client or belittling his or her experience. The intent is to indicate an alternative line of thought for the client to consider, not to “convince” the client that he or she is wrong.

                                    <strong>Reflecting</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Directing client actions, thoughts, and feelings back to the client.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> Client: “Do you think I should tell the doctor?” Nurse: “Do you think you should?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Reflection encourages the client to recognize and accept his or her own feelings. The nurse indicates that the client’s point of view has value, and that the client has the right to have opinions, make decisions, and think independently

                                    <strong>Restating</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Repeating the main idea expressed.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> Client: “I can’t sleep. I stay awake all night.” Nurse: “You have difficulty sleeping.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> The nurse repeats what the client has said in approximately or nearly the same words the client has used. This restatement lets the client know that he or she communicated the idea effectively. This encourages the client to continue. Or if the client has been misunderstood, he or she can clarify his or her thoughts.

                                    <strong>Seeking Information</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Seeking to make clear that which is not meaningful or that which is vague.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “I am not sure that I follow.”, “Have I heard you correctly?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> The nurse should seek clarification throughout interactions with clients. Doing so can help the nurse to avoid making assumptions that understanding has occurred when it has not. It helps the client to articulate thoughts, feelings, and ideas more clearly.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Silence</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Absence of verbal communication, which provides time for the client to put thoughts or feelings into words, regain composure, or continue talking.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> Nurse says nothing but continues to maintain eye contact and conveys interest<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Silence often encourages the client to verbalize provided that it is interested and expectant. Silence gives the client time to organize thoughts, direct the topic of interaction, or focus on issues that are most important. Much nonverbal behavior takes place during silence, and the nurse needs to be, aware of the client and his or her own nonverbal behavior.

                                    <em>Definition:</em> Offering to share, to strive, to work with the client for his or her benefit.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Perhaps you and I can discuss and discover the triggers for your anxiety.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> The nurse seeks to offer a relationship in which the client can identify problems in living with others, grow emotionally, and improve the ability to form satisfactory relationships. The nurse offers to do things with, rather than for, the client

                                    <strong>Summarizing</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Organizing and summing up that which has gone before.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Have I got this straight?”, “You’ve said that. .”, “During the past hour, you and I have discussed..”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Summarization seeks to bring out the important points of the discussion and to increase the awareness and understanding of both participants. It omits the irrelevant and organizes the pertinent aspects of the interaction. It allows both client and nurse to depart with the same ideas and provides a sense of closure at the completion of each discussion.

                                    <strong>Translating into Feelings</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Seeking to verbalize client’s feelings that he or she expresses only indirectly.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> Client: “I am dead.” Nurse: “Are you suggesting that you feel lifeless?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Often the client says, when taken literally, seems meaningless or far removed from reality. To understand, the nurse must concentrate on what the client might be feeling to express himself or herself this way.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Verbalizing the Implied</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Voicing what the client has hinted at or suggested.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> Client: “I can’t talk to you or anyone. It is a waste of time.” Nurse: “Do you feel that no one understands?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Putting into words what the client has implied or said indirectly tends to make the discussion less obscure. The nurse should be as direct as possible without being unfeelingly blunt or obtuse. The client may have difficulty communicating directly. The nurse should take care to express only what is fairly obvious; otherwise the nurse may be jumping to conclusions or interpreting the client’s communication
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Voicing Doubt</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Expressing uncertainty about the reality of the client’s perceptions.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Isn’t that unusual?”, “Really?”, “That is hard to believe.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Another means of responding to distortions of reality is to express doubt. Such expression permits the client to become aware that others do not necessarily perceive events in the same way or draw the same conclusions. This does not mean the client will alter his or her point of view, but at least the nurse will encourage the client to reconsider or reevaluate what has happened. The nurse neither agreed nor disagreed; however, he or she has not let the misperceptions and distortions pass without comment.

                                    <em>Definition:</em> Telling the client what to do.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “I think you should.”, “Why don’t you?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Giving advice implies that only the nurse knows what is best for the client.

                                    <em>Examples:</em> “That is right.”, “I agree.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Approval indicates the client is “right” rather than “wrong.” This gives the client the impression that he or she is “right” because of agreement with the nurse. Opinions and conclusions should be exclusively the client’s. When the nurse agrees with the client, there is no opportunity for the client to change his
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Belittling Feelings Expressed</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Misjudging the degree of the client’s discomfort.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> Client: “I have nothing to live for. . . I wish I was dead” Nurse: “Everybody gets down in the dumps.” OR “I have felt that way myself.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> When the nurse tries to equate the intense and overwhelming feelings the client has expressed to “everybody” or to the nurse’s own feelings, the nurse implies that the discomfort is temporary, mild, self-limiting, or not very important. The client is focused on this or her own worries and feelings; hearing the problems or feelings of others is not helpful.
                                </li>

                                    <em>Definition:</em> Demanding proof from the client.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “But how can you be the President of the United States?”, “If you are dead, why is your heart beating?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Often the nurse believes that if he or she can challenge the client to prove unrealistic ideas, the client will realize there is no “proof” and then will recognize reality. Actually challenging causes the client to defend the delusions or misperceptions more strongly than before.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Defending</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Attempting to protect someone or something from verbal attack.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “This hospital has a fine reputation.”, “I am sure your doctor has your best interests in mind.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Defending what the client has criticized implies that he or she has no right to express impressions, opinions, or feelings. Testing the client that his or her criticism is unjust or unfounded does not change the client’s feelings but only serves to block further communication

                                    <em>Definition:</em> Opposing the client’s ideas.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “That is wrong.”, “I definitely disagree with. . .”, “I do not believe that. . .”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Disagreeing implies the client is “wrong”. Consequently the client feels defensive about his or her point of view or ideas.

                                    <strong>Giving Approval</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Sanctioning the client’s behavior or ideas.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “That is good.”, “I am glad that. . ”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Saying what the client thinks or feels if “good” implies that the opposite is “bad”. Approval then, tends to limit the client’s freedom to think, speak, or act in a certain way. This can lead to the client’s acting in a particular way just to please the nurse.

                                    <em>Definition:</em> Responding to a figurative comment as though it were a statement of fact.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> Client: “They are looking in my head with a television camera.” Nurse: “Try not to watch television.” OR “What channel?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Often the client is at a loss to describe his or her feelings, so such comments are the best he or she can do. Usually it is helpful for the nurse to focus on the client’s feelings in response to such statements.

                                    <strong>Indicating the Existence of an External Source</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Attributing the source of thoughts, feelings, and behavior to others or to outside influences.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “What makes you say that?”, “What made you do that?”, “Who told you that you were a prophet?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> The nurse can ask, “What happened?” or “What events led you to draw such a conclusion?” But to question “What made you think that?” implies that the client was made or compelled to think in a certain way. Usually the nurse does not intend to suggest that the source is external but that is often what the client thinks.

                                    <strong>Interpreting</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Asking to make conscious that which is unconscious; telling the client the meaning of his or her experience.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “What you really mean is. . .”, “Unconsciously you are saying. . .”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> The client’s thoughts and feelings are his or her own, not to be interpreted by the nurse or for hidden meaning. Only the client can identify or confirm the presence of feelings.

                                    <strong>Introducing an Unrelated Topic</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Changing the subject.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> Client: “I would like to die.” Nurse “Did you have visitors last night?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> The nurse takes the initiative for the interaction away from the client. This usually happens because the nurse is uncomfortable, does not know how to respond, or has a topic he or she would rather discuss.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Making Stereotyped Comments</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Offering meaningless cliches or trite comments.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “It is for your own good.”, “Just keep your chin up”, “Just have a positive attitude and you will be better in no time.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Social conversation contains many cliches and much meaningless chit-chat. Such comments are of no value in the nurse-client relationship. Any automatic responses will lack the nurse‘s consideration or thoughtfulness.

                                    <strong>Probing</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Persistent questioning of the client.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Now tell me about this problem. You know I have to find out.”, “Tell me your psychiatric history.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Probing tends to make the client feel used or invaded. Clients have the right not to talk about issues or concerns if they choose. Pushing and probing by the nurse will not encourage the client to talk.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Reassuring</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Indicating there is no reason for anxiety or other feelings of discomfort.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “I would not worry about that.”, “Everything would be alright.”, “You are coming along just fine.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> Attempts to dispel the client’s anxiety by implying that there is not sufficient reason for concern completely devalues the client’s feelings. Vague reassurances without accompanying facts are meaningless to the client.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Rejecting</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Refusing to consider or showing contempt for the client’s ideas or behaviors.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Let us not discuss. . .”, “I do not want to hear about. . .”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> When the nurse rejects any topic, he or she closes it off from exploration. In turn, the client will feel personally rejected along with his or her ideas.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Requesting an Explanation</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Asking the client to provide reasons for thoughts, feelings, behaviors, events.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Why do you think that?”, “Why do you feel that way?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> There is a difference between asking the client to describe what is occurring or has taken place and asking him to explain why. Usually a “why” question is intimidating. In addition, the client is unlikely to know “why” and may become defensive trying to explain himself or herself.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Testing</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Appraising the client’s degree of insight.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> “Do you know what kind of hospital this is?”, “Do you still have the idea that. . ?”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> These types of questions force the client to try to recognize his or her problems. The client’s acknowledgement that he or she does not know these things may meet the nurse’s needs but is not helpful for the client
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Using Denial</strong><br>
                                    <em>Definition:</em> Refusing to admit that a problem exists.<br>
                                    <em>Examples:</em> Client: “I am nothing.” Nurse: “Of course you are something. Everybody is something.” Client: “I am dead.” Nurse: “Do not be silly.”<br>
                                    <em>Rationale:</em> The nurse denies the client’s feelings or the seriousness of the situation by dismissing his or her comments without attempting to discover the feelings or meaning behind them.

                            <p>This is transmitted with or without verbal communication. It is essential that the nurse become aware of her own non-verbal communication in addition to becoming skillful in identifying the client’s non-verbal communication.</p>
                            
                            <p>Non-verbal communication provides clues about the validity of the spoken words and congruency with the client’s behavior. The phrase “Actions speak louder than words” is generally accurate.</p>

                                <strong>What to Remember:</strong> Be empathetic and not just sympathetic!
                            </div>

                            <h3>Empathy</h3>
                            <p>Is the <span style="color: red;">ability</span> of the nurse <span style="color: blue;">to perceive</span> the meanings and feelings of the client <span style="color: red;">and</span> to <span style="color: blue;">communicate</span> that <span style="color: blue;">understanding</span> to the client.</p>
                            <p>It is considered one of the essential skills a nurse must develop.</p>
                            <p>Both the client and the nurse give a “gift of self” when empathy occurs – the client by <span style="color: red;">feeling</span> safe enough to <span style="color: red;">share feelings</span>, and <span style="color: red;">the nurse</span> by <span style="color: red;">listening closely</span> enough to <span style="color: red;">understand</span>.</p>
                            <p>Empathy has been shown to positively influence client outcomes. Clients tend to feel better about themselves when the nurse is empathetic.</p>

                            <h4>Example of Empathy</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Client:</strong> “I am so confused! My son just visited and wants to know where the safety deposit box key is.”</li>
                                <li><strong>Nurse:</strong> “<span style="color: blue;">You’re</span> confused because your son asked for he safety deposit key.” (Using <span style="color: blue;">reflection</span>)</li>
                                <li><strong>Nurse:</strong> “Are you confused about the purpose of your son’s visit?” (Using clarification)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Note that from these empathetic moments, a bond can be established to serve as the foundation for the nurse-client relationship.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Sympathy</h3>
                            <p><span style="color: red;">Feelings</span> of <span style="color: blue;">concern</span> or <span style="color: blue;">compassion</span> one shows for another.</p>
                            <p>By expressing sympathy, the nurse may project his or her personal concerns onto the client, thus inhibiting the client’s expression of feelings.</p>

                            <h4>Example of Sympathy</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Client:</strong> “I am so confused! My son just visited and wants to know where the safety deposit box key is.”</li>
                                <li><strong>Nurse:</strong> “<span style="color: red;">I know</span> how confusing sons can be. My son confuses me, too, and <span style="color: red;">I know</span> how bad that makes you feel.”</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Note that the nurse’s feelings of sadness or even pity could influence the relationship and hinder the nurse’s abilities to focus on the client’s needs. Sympathy often shifts the emphasis on the nurse’s feelings, hindering the nurse’s ability to view the client’s needs more objectively.</p>

                            <h3>Problems Affecting the Nurse-Patient Relationship</h3>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Transference</strong><br>
                                    Occurs when the <span style="color: blue;">client displaces</span> onto the <span style="color: blue;">nurse attitudes</span> and <span style="color: red;">feelings</span> that the <span style="color: red;">client</span> originally experience in other relationships. These patterns are automatic and unconscious.<br>
                                    <em>Example:</em> An adolescent female client working with a nurse who is about the same age as the teen’s parents might react to the nurse like she reacts to her parents. She might experience intense feelings of rebellion or make sarcastic remarks.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Countertransference</strong><br>
                                    Occurs when the <span style="color: blue;">nurse displaces</span> onto the <span style="color: blue;">client attitudes</span> or <span style="color: red;">feelings</span> from <span style="color: red;">his or her past</span>.<br>
                                    <em>Example:</em> A female nurse who has teenage children and who is experiencing extreme frustration with an adolescent client may respond by adopting a parental or chastising tone. The nurse is countertransfering her own attitudes and feelings toward her children onto the client.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Resistance</strong><br>
                                    Development of ambivalent feelings toward self-exploration
                                </li>
