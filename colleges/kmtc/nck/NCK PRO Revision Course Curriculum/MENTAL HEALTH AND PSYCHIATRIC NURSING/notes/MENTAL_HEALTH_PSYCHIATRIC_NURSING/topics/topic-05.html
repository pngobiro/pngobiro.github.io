                            <h3>Definitions</h3>
                            <p>The word "psychosis" is used to describe conditions that affect the mind, in which there has been some loss of contact with reality.</p>
                            <p>The terms "early psychosis" or "first episode psychosis" mean that an individual is experiencing psychosis for the first time.</p>
                            <p>Hallucinations, delusions (false beliefs), paranoia and disorganized thoughts and speech are symptoms of psychosis. These symptoms can seem so real that often the person does not realize that they are experiencing psychosis. Psychosis also affects feelings and behaviour.</p>

                            <h3>Phases of a Psychotic Episode</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Prodromal Phase</strong><br>
                                    This is the period before the psychosis becomes more obvious. There are often changes in feelings, thoughts, perceptions and behaviours. Prodromal symptoms vary from person to person and some people may not experience a prodrome. The duration of this phase is quite variable, although it usually spans several months.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Acute Phase</strong><br>
                                    This is the stage when the typical psychotic symptoms emerge. It is also the stage that is easiest to recognize and diagnose. Therefore the acute phase is when most people begin receiving treatment.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Recovery</strong><br>
                                    Some of the symptoms that are apparent in the Acute Phase may linger in Recovery. With appropriate treatments, the great majority of people successfully recover from their first episode of psychosis. In the recovery stage, the acute symptoms mentioned above will lessen and start to fade; however, some symptoms may linger. Even after the psychosis has responded to treatment, problems such as depression, anxiety, decreased self esteem, social problems and difficulties with work or school may occur.

                            <h4>Definite Psychotic Symptoms (Acute Phase)</h4>
                            <p>These symptoms are frequently separated into "positive" and "negative" categories.</p>

                            <p><strong>Positive symptoms</strong> are referred to as "positive" because they are viewed as an excess or distortion of the person's normal functioning. Some of the positive symptoms include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Delusions (Fixed false beliefs)</strong>: Such as being followed or monitored, being plotted against, having special abilities or "powers", certain songs or comments are specifically directed toward oneself or communicating a hidden message, being controlled by forces or other individuals, having one's thoughts broadcast so others can hear them.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hallucinations</strong>: Hallucinations involve seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling or tasting something that is not actually there.</li>
                                <li><strong>Disorganized Speech or Behaviour</strong>: The speech of individuals with psychosis may be disorganized in such a way that the person moves quickly from one topic to the next, or to the point where the person's speech may not be understandable. The behaviour of individuals with psychosis also may be disorganized. The person may have difficulties performing activities of daily living (e.g., cooking, self-care) or display inappropriate behaviours or responses (e.g., laughing while describing a personal tragedy).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>Negative symptoms</strong> reflect a decrease in, or loss of, normal functions. These symptoms are often less evident than positive symptoms and require careful assessment. Some examples of negative symptoms include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>little display of emotions</li>
                                <li>not speaking very much</li>
                                <li>difficulties in thinking or coming up with ideas</li>
                                <li>decreased ability to initiate tasks</li>
                                <li>lowered levels of motivation or drive</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>It is also common for other symptoms or problems to occur along with the psychotic symptoms. Some examples of other problems include: depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts or behaviours, substance abuse, difficulties functioning, sleep disturbance.</p>

                            <h3>Causes of Psychosis</h3>
                            <p>Psychosis occurs in a variety of mental and physical disorders; therefore, it likely has multiple causes. Biology, stress and drug use are three of the most common theories.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Biology</strong>: Neurotransmitters. There is strong evidence that some psychoses involve a dysfunction in neurotransmitters in the brain.-dopamine. Genetics. Individuals whose close relatives experience psychosis are themselves at increased risk. Brain Changes. Changes have been found in the brains of some individuals with schizophrenia, which appear to have been present since birth or early childhood. Possible causes of the changes include: genetic transmission, abnormal neurodevelopment and pregnancy or birth complications (e.g. exposure of mother to a virus during the second trimester of pregnancy).</li>
                                <li><strong>Stress</strong>: Some psychoses appear to occur primarily in response to stress. Stresses can be such things as significant life events (e.g. death of a loved one, moving to a new city, etc.)</li>
                                <li><strong>Drugs</strong>: Psychosis can be induced by drugs or can be drug assisted. For example, it appears that amphetamines can cause a psychotic episode, while other drugs, including marijuana, can increase a person's natural vulnerability to psychosis resulting in a psychotic episode.</li>
                                <li><strong>Other causes</strong>:
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li>Neurological causes E.g.CVA, brain tumors, brain abscess.</li>
                                        <li>Infections-Acute meningitis, malaria, HIV.</li>
                                        <li>Metabolic causes- Hypoglycaemia.</li>
                                        <li>Psychiatric causes- schizophrenia, depression, manic episode.</li>

                            <h3>Definition</h3>
                            <p>Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric condition that affects both behavior and motor function, and results in unresponsiveness in someone who otherwise appears to be awake.</p>
                            <p>Although often associated with schizophrenia and other affective disorders, catatonia may be a result of, or due to, any number of psychotic disorders, mood disorders or general medical conditions.</p>
                            <p>Catatonia is sometimes referred to as catatonic syndrome, because there is not just one identifying sign or symptom associated with this condition or symptoms that appear separately from one another, but rather a collection of several symptoms that appear together at the same time.</p>

                            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                            <p>According to the DSM-5, at least three out of twelve symptoms must be present for a diagnosis of catatonia. These symptoms include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Stupor (oblivious inability to move or respond to stimuli), catalepsy (rigid body posture)</li>
                                <li>Mutism (little to no verbal communication)</li>
                                <li>Waxy flexibility (body remains in whatever position it is placed by another)</li>
                                <li>Negativism (lack of verbal response)</li>
                                <li>Posturing (holding a posture or position that goes against gravity)</li>
                                <li>Mannerisms (extreme or odd movements and mannerisms)</li>
                                <li>Stereotypy (frequent repetitive movements for no reason)</li>
                                <li>Agitation (for no reason), grimacing (distorted facial expressions)</li>
                                <li>Echolalia (repeating others’ words)</li>
                                <li>Echopraxia (repeating others’ movements)</li>
                                <li>Other common symptoms include rigidity and automatic obedience.</li>

                            <p class="callout callout--note">When catatonia is associated with schizophrenia, stupor may continue for long periods.</p>
