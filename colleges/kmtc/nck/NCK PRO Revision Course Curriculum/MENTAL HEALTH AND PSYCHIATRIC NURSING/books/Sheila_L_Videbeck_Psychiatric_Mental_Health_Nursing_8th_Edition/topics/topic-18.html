                        <p>Personality can be defined as an ingrained, enduring pattern of behaving and relating to the self, others, and the environment; it includes perceptions, attitudes, and emotions. Personality disorders are diagnosed when there is impairment of personality functioning and personality traits that are maladaptive. Individuals have identity problems such as egocentrism, or being self-centered, and their sense of self-esteem comes from gaining power or pleasure that is often at the expense of others.</p>
                        <p>Maladaptive or dysfunctional personality traits exhibited by individuals with a personality disorder may include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Negative behaviors toward others, such as being manipulative, dishonest, deceitful, or lying</li>

                            <li><strong>Borderline personality disorder (BPD):</strong> Characterized by instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Histrionic personality disorder:</strong> Characterized by excessive emotionality and attention seeking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Narcissistic personality disorder:</strong> Characterized by grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy.</li>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Etiology</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Biologic Theories</h3>
                        <p>Personality develops through the interaction of hereditary dispositions and environmental influences. <strong>Temperament</strong> refers to the biologic processes of sensation, association, and motivation that underlie the integration of skills and habits based on emotion. The four temperament traits are:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Harm avoidance:</strong> Fear of uncertainty, social inhibition, shyness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Novelty seeking:</strong> Quick-tempered, curious, easily bored, impulsive.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reward dependence:</strong> Tenderhearted, sensitive, sociable, dependent on approval.</li>
                            <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Hardworking, ambitious, overachiever.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Psychodynamic Theories</h3>
                        <p><strong>Character</strong> consists of concepts about the self and the external world. It develops over time as a person comes into contact with people and situations. Three major character traits have been distinguished:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Self-directedness:</strong> Responsible, reliable, resourceful, goal-oriented.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cooperativeness:</strong> Empathic, tolerant, compassionate, supportive.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-transcendence:</strong> Spiritual, unpretentious, humble, fulfilled.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Treatment -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="treatment">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Treatment</h2>
                        <p>Personality disorders are often difficult to treat because personality characteristics are deeply ingrained. Combinations of medication and group and individual therapies are more likely to be effective than any single treatment.</p>

                        <h3>Psychopharmacology</h3>
                        <p>Pharmacologic treatment focuses on the client's symptoms rather than the particular subtype. Four symptom categories underlie personality disorders:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Cognitive-perceptual distortions:</strong> Magical thinking, odd beliefs, illusions, suspiciousness, ideas of reference, and low-grade psychotic symptoms. Usually respond to low-dose antipsychotic medications.</li>
                            <li><strong>Affective symptoms and mood dysregulation:</strong> Emotional instability, detachment, depression, and dysphoria. Treated with lithium, carbamazepine, valproate, or low-dose neuroleptics. Emotional detachment often responds to SSRIs or atypical antipsychotics.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aggression and behavioral dysfunction:</strong> Impulsivity, predatory aggression. Treated with lithium, anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anxiety:</strong> Chronic cognitive or somatic anxiety. Treated with SSRIs, MAOIs, or low-dose antipsychotics.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
                        <p>Individual and group psychotherapy goals focus on building trust, teaching basic living skills, providing support, decreasing distressing symptoms, and improving interpersonal relationships. <strong>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong> helps clients recognize negative thoughts and feelings and replace them with positive patterns. <strong>Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)</strong> was designed specifically for clients with BPD to focus on distorted thinking and behavior based on the assumption that poorly regulated emotions are the underlying problem.</p>

                        <h3>Paranoid Personality Disorder</h3>
                        <p><strong>Clinical Picture:</strong> Pervasive mistrust and suspiciousness of others. Clients interpret others' actions as potentially harmful. They appear aloof, withdrawn, guarded, and hypervigilant. They use the defense mechanism of projection.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Interventions:</strong> Approach in a formal, business-like manner. Be on time, keep commitments, and be straightforward. Involve the client in formulating the care plan. Help clients validate ideas before taking action.</p>

                        <h3>Schizoid Personality Disorder</h3>
                        <p><strong>Clinical Picture:</strong> Pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and restricted emotional expression. Clients appear aloof, indifferent, and emotionally cold. They have a rich fantasy life but lack the desire for involvement with others.</p>
