                        <p>Nursing philosophies often describe the person or individual as a biopsychosocial being who possesses unique characteristics and responds to others and the world in various and diverse ways. This view of the individual as unique requires nurses to assess each person and his or her responses to plan and provide nursing care that is personally meaningful. This uniqueness of response may partially explain why some people become ill and others do not. Understanding why two people raised in a stressful environment (e.g., one with neglect or abuse) turn out differently is difficult; one person becomes reasonably successful and maintains a satisfying marriage and family, while the other feels isolated, depressed, and lonely; is divorced; and abuses alcohol. Although we do not know exactly what makes the difference, studies have begun to show that certain personal, interpersonal, and cultural factors influence a person's response.</p>
                        <p><strong>Culture</strong> is all the socially learned behaviors, values, beliefs, customs, and ways of thinking of a population that guide its members' views of themselves and the world. This view affects all aspects of the person's being, including health, illness, and treatment. <strong>Cultural diversity</strong> refers to the vast array of differences that exist among populations.</p>
                        <p>This chapter examines some of the personal, interpersonal, and cultural factors that create the unique individual response to both illness and treatment. In determining how a person copes with illness, we cannot single out one or two factors. Rather, we must consider each person as a combination of all these overlapping and interacting factors.</p>

                        <h3>Age, Growth, and Development</h3>
                        <p>A person's age seems to affect how he or she copes with illness. For instance, the age at onset of schizophrenia is a strong predictor of the prognosis of the disease (Sikich &amp; Chandrasekhar, 2017). People with a younger age at onset have poorer outcomes, such as more negative signs (apathy, social isolation, and lack of volition) and less effective coping skills than do people with a later age at onset. A possible reason for this difference is that younger clients have not had experiences of successful independent living or the opportunity to work and be self-sufficient and have a less well-developed sense of personal identity than older clients.</p>
                        <p>A client's age can also influence how he or she expresses illness. A young child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may lack the understanding and ability to describe his or her feelings, which may make management of the disorder more challenging. Nurses must be aware of the child's level of language and work to understand the experience as he or she describes it.</p>
                        <p>Erik Erikson described psychosocial development across the life span in terms of developmental tasks to accomplish at each stage (Table 7.1). Each stage of development depends on the successful completion of the previous stage. In each stage, the person must complete a critical life task that is essential to well-being and mental health. Failure to complete the critical task results in a negative outcome for that stage of development and impedes completion of future tasks. For example, the infancy stage (birth to 18 months) is the stage of "trust versus mistrust," when infants must learn to develop basic trust that their parents or guardians will take care of them, feed them, change their diapers, love them, and keep them safe. If the infant does not develop trust in this stage, he or she may be unable to love and trust others later in life because the ability to trust others is essential to establishing good relationships. Specific developmental tasks for adults are summarized in Table 7.2.</p>

                        <p>According to Erikson’s theory, people may get “stuck” at any stage of development. For example, a person who never completed the developmental task of autonomy may become overly dependent on others. Failure to develop identity can result in role confusion or an unclear idea about who one is as a person. Negotiating these developmental tasks affects how the person responds to stress and illness. Lack of success may result in feelings of inferiority, doubt, lack of confidence, and isolation—all of which can affect how a person responds to illness.</p>

                        <h3>Genetics and Biologic Factors</h3>
                        <p>Heredity and biologic factors are not under voluntary control. We cannot change these factors. Research has identified genetic links to several disorders. For example, some people are born with a gene associated with one type of Alzheimer disease. Although specific genetic links have not been identified for several mental disorders (e.g., bipolar disorder, major depression, alcoholism), research has shown that these disorders tend to appear more frequently in families. Genetic makeup tremendously influences a person’s response to illness and perhaps even to treatment (see Chapter 2, Cultural Considerations on page 34). Hence, family history and background are essential parts of the nursing assessment.</p>

                        <h3>Physical Health and Health Practices</h3>
                        <p>Physical health can also influence how a person responds to psychosocial stress or illness. The healthier a person is, the better he or she can cope with stress or illness. Poor nutritional status, lack of sleep, or a chronic physical illness may impair a person’s ability to cope. Unlike genetic factors, how a person lives and takes care of him or herself can alter many of these factors. For this reason, nurses must assess the client’s physical health even when the client is seeking help for mental health problems.</p>
                        <p>Personal health practices, such as exercise, can influence the client’s response to illness. Exercising is one self-help intervention that can diminish the negative effects of depression and anxiety. Further, when individuals participate with others in exercise, the members of the group often experience increased social support, improved sense of well-being, and happiness (Firth et al., 2016). This suggests that continued participation in exercise is a positive indicator of improved health, while halting exercise might indicate declining mental health.</p>

                        <h3>Response to Drugs</h3>
                        <p>Biologic differences can affect a client's response to treatment, specifically to psychotropic drugs. Ethnic groups differ in the metabolism and efficacy of psychoactive compounds. Some ethnic groups metabolize drugs more slowly (i.e., the serum level of the drug remains higher), which increases the frequency and severity of side effects (Ruan et al., 2019). Therefore, clients who metabolize drugs more slowly generally may need lower doses of a drug to produce the desired effect. When evaluating the efficacy of psychotropic medications, the nurse must be alert to side effects and serum drug levels in clients from different ethnic backgrounds.</p>

                        <h3>Self-Efficacy</h3>
                        <p>Self-efficacy is a belief that personal abilities and efforts affect the events in one's life. A person who believes that his or her behavior makes a difference is more likely to take action. People with high self-efficacy set personal goals, are self-motivated, cope effectively with stress, and request support from others when needed. People with low self-efficacy have low aspirations, experience much self-doubt, and may be plagued by anxiety and depression. For some, focusing treatment on developing a client's skills to take control of his or her life (developing self-efficacy) so that he or she can make life changes may be beneficial. Four main ways to do so include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Experience of success or mastery in overcoming obstacles</li>
                            <li>Social modeling (observing successful people instills the idea that one can also succeed)</li>
                            <li>Social persuasion (persuading people to believe in themselves)</li>
                            <li>Reducing stress, building physical strength, and learning how to interpret physical sensations positively (e.g., viewing fatigue as a sign that one has accomplished something rather than as a lack of stamina)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Clients returning to the community with higher self-efficacy are more confident and have positive expectations about their personal success. Therapeutic interventions designed to promote the client's self-efficacy can have positive effects on interpersonal relationships, coping skills, functional living skills, and integration into the community.</p>

                        <h3>Hardiness</h3>
                        <p>Hardiness is the ability to resist illness when under stress. First described by Kobasa (1979), hardiness has three components:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Commitment: active involvement in life activities</li>
                            <li>Control: ability to make appropriate decisions in life activities</li>
                            <li>Challenge: ability to perceive change as beneficial rather than just stressful</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Hardiness has been found to have a moderating or buffering effect on people experiencing stress. Kobasa (1979) found that male executives who had high stress but low occurrence of illness scored higher on the hardiness scale than executives with high stress and high occurrence of illness. Study findings suggested that stressful life events caused more harm to people with low hardiness than those with high hardiness.</p>
                        <p>Personal hardness is often described as a pattern of attitudes and actions that helps the person turn stressful circumstances into opportunities for growth. Persons with high hardiness perceive stressors more accurately and are able to problem-solve in the situation more effectively. Hardiness has been identified as an important resilience factor for families coping with the mental illness of one of their members as well as a characteristic that assists individuals in dealing with psychological stress and adversity (Reknes, Harris, &amp; Einarsen, 2018). Some believe that the concept of hardness is vague and indistinct and may not help everyone. In addition, hardness may be useful only to those who value individualism. For people and cultures who value relationships over individual achievement, hardness may not be beneficial.</p>

                        <h3>Resilience and Resourcefulness</h3>
                        <p>Two closely related concepts, resilience and resourcefulness, help people cope with stress and minimize the effects of illness. Resilience is defined as having healthy responses to stressful circumstances or risky situations. This concept helps explain why one person reacts to a slightly stressful event with severe anxiety, while another person does not experience distress even when confronting a major disruption.</p>
                        <p>High resilience is associated with promoting and protecting one's mental health, described as flourishing. Family resilience refers to the successful coping of family members under stress. Factors that are present in resilient families include positive outlook, spirituality, family member accord, flexibility, family communication, and support networks. Resilient families also spend time together, share recreational activities, and participate in family rituals and routines together.</p>
                        <p>Resourcefulness involves using problem-solving abilities and believing that one can cope with adverse or novel situations. People develop resourcefulness through interactions with others, that is, through successfully coping with life experiences. Examples of resourcefulness include performing health-seeking behaviors, learning self-care, monitoring one's thoughts and feelings about stressful situations, and taking action to deal with stressful circumstances.</p>

                        <h3>Spirituality</h3>
                        <p>Spirituality involves the essence of a person's being and his or her beliefs about the meaning of life and the purpose for living. It may include belief in God or a higher power, the practice of religion, cultural beliefs and practices, and a relationship with the environment. Although many clients with mental disorders have disturbing religious delusions, for many in the general population, religion and spirituality are a source of comfort and help in times of stress or trauma. Studies have shown that spirituality is a genuine help to many adults with mental illness, serving as a primary coping device and a source of meaning and coherence in their lives or a way to gain a social network (Hugelet et al., 2016).</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>Religious activities, such as church attendance and praying, and associated social support have been shown to be important for many people and are linked with better health and a sense of well-being. These activities have also been found to help people cope with poor health. Hope and faith have been identified as critical factors in psychiatric and physical rehabilitation (Stearns, Nadorff, Lantz, &amp; McKay, 2018). Religion and spirituality can also be helpful to families who have a relative with mental illness, providing support and solace to caregivers. Because spiritual or religious beliefs and practices help many clients cope with stress and illness, the nurse must be particularly sensitive to and accepting of such beliefs and practices. Incorporating those practices into the care of clients can help them cope with illness and find meaning and purpose in the situation. Doing so can also offer a strong source of support.</p>
                        <p>A study of the relationship between hope and symptoms found that persons having more hope experienced fewer actual symptoms. A significant relationship between hopelessness and increased symptoms was also demonstrated. This may indicate that one of the ways to help clients manage and decrease symptoms is having a wellness plan that includes a positive future outlook and support for the development of hope (Schiavon, Marchetti, Gurgel, Busnello, &amp; Reppold, 2016).</p>

                        <h3>Sense of Belonging</h3>
                        <p>A sense of belonging is the feeling of connectedness with or involvement in a social system or environment of which a person feels an integral part. Abraham Maslow described a sense of belonging as a basic human psychosocial need that involves feelings of both value and fit. Value refers to feeling needed and accepted. Fit refers to feeling that one meshes or fits in with the system or environment. This means that when a person belongs to a system or group, he or she feels valued and worthwhile within that support system. Examples of support systems include family, friends, coworkers, clubs or social groups, and even health care providers.</p>
                        <p>A person's sense of belonging is closely related to his or her social and psychological functioning. A sense of belonging was found to promote health, while a lack of this sense impaired health. An increased sense of belonging was also associated with decreased levels of anxiety. Persons with a sense of belonging are less alienated and isolated, have a sense of purpose, believe they are needed by others, and feel productive socially. Hence, the nurse should focus on interventions that help increase a client's sense of belonging.</p>

                        <h3>Social Networks and Social Support</h3>
                        <p>Social networks are groups of people one knows and with whom one feels connected. Studies have found that having a social network can help reduce stress, diminish illness, and positively influence the ability to cope and adapt (Levula, Harre, &amp; Wilson, 2017). Social support is emotional sustenance that comes from friends, family members, and even health care providers who help a person when a problem arises. It is different from social contact, which does not always provide emotional support. An example of social contact is the friendly talk that goes on at parties.</p>
                        <p>Persons who are supported emotionally and functionally have been found to be healthier than those who are not supported (Levula et al., 2017). Meaningful social relationships with family or friends were found to improve the health and well-being outcomes for older adults. An essential element of improved outcomes is that family or friends respond with support when it is requested. In other words, the person must be able to count on these friends or family for help or support with visits or talking on the phone. Thus, the primary components of satisfactory support are the person's ability and willingness to request support when needed and the ability and willingness of the support system to respond.</p>
                        <p>Two key components are necessary for a support system to be effective: the client's perception of the support system and the responsiveness of the support system. The client must perceive that the social support system bolsters his or her confidence and self-esteem and provides such stress-related interpersonal help as offering assistance in solving a problem. The client must also perceive that the actions of the support system are consistent with the client's desires and expectations—in other words, the support provided is what the client wants, not what the supporter believes would be good for the client. Also, the support system must be able to provide direct help or material aid (e.g., providing transportation or making a follow-up appointment). Some people have the capacity to seek help when needed, while a lack of well-being may cause others to withdraw from potential providers of support. The nurse can help the client find support people who will be available and helpful and can teach the client to request support when needed.</p>

                        <h3>Family Support</h3>
                        <p>Family as a source of social support can be a key factor in the recovery of clients with psychiatric illnesses. Although family members are not always a positive resource in mental health, they are most often an important part of recovery. Health care professionals cannot totally replace family members. The nurse must encourage family members to continue to support the client even while he or she is in the hospital and should identify family strengths, such as love and caring, as a resource for the client.</p>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Cultural Factors -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="cultural-factors">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Cultural Factors</h2>
                        <p>The need for health care practitioners to provide culturally competent care has continually increased in the American health care system. The diversity of the U.S. population has resulted in new, larger ethnocultural groups, a mosaic rather than a melting pot (Cultural Savvy, 2019). Culturally competent nursing care means being sensitive to issues related to culture, race, gender, sexual orientation, social class, economic situation, and other factors.</p>
                        <p>Nurses and other health care providers must learn about other cultures and become skilled at providing care to people with cultural backgrounds that are different from their own. Finding out about another's cultural beliefs and practices and understanding their meanings are essential to providing holistic and meaningful care to the client.</p>

                        <h3>Beliefs about Causes of Illness</h3>
                        <p>Culture has the most influence on a person's health beliefs and practices. It has been shown to influence one's concept of disease and illness. Two prevalent types of beliefs about what causes illness in non-Western cultures are natural and unnatural or personal. Unnatural or personal beliefs attribute the cause of illness to the active, purposeful intervention of an outside agent, spirit, or supernatural force or deity. The natural view is rooted in a belief that natural conditions or forces, such as cold, heat, wind, or dampness, are responsible for the illness (Giger, 2016). A sick person with these beliefs would not see the relationship between his or her behavior or health practices and the illness. Thus, he or she would try to counteract the negative forces or spirits using traditional cultural remedies rather than taking medication or changing his or her health practices.</p>
                        <p>Stigma may still exist in situations in which the cultural or personal beliefs about mental illness or seeking help are cause for guilt or shame. A person may experience shame for having mental health issues or for needing to seek outside help (Yakeley, 2018). Suicidal ideation is often an issue that is stigmatized and associated with weakness or failure of personal or religious beliefs (Keller, McNeill, Honea, &amp; Paulson Miller, 2019).</p>

                        <h3>Factors in Cultural Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Giger (2016) identifies a model for assessing clients using six cultural factors: communication, physical distance or space, social organization, time orientation, environmental control, and biologic variations (Box 7.1).</p>

                                <li>Biologic variations</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><em>Source: Giger, J. N. (2016). Transcultural nursing: Assessment and intervention (7th ed.). St. Louis, MO: Mosby.</em></p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>Verbal communication can be difficult when the client and nurse do not speak the same language. The nurse should be aware that nonverbal communication has different meanings in various cultures. For example, some cultures welcome touch and consider it supportive, while other cultures find touch offensive. Some people avoid shaking hands, believing that vigorous handshaking is aggressive, while others consider a firm handshake a sign of strength and good character.</p>
                        <p>Although some people view direct eye contact as positive, others may find it rude and may avoid looking strangers in the eye when talking to them. Some people maintain intense eye contact, which may be perceived as glaring to others. These differences are important to note because many people make inferences about a person's behavior based on the frequency or duration of eye contact. Chapter 6 provides a detailed discussion of communication techniques.</p>

                        <h3>Physical Distance or Space</h3>
                        <p>Various cultures have different perspectives on what is considered a comfortable physical distance from another person during communication. For some people, 2 to 3 ft is a comfortable distance while others tend to stand closer to one another. And yet others are more comfortable with distances greater than 2 or 3 ft. The nurse should be conscious of these cultural differences in space and should allow enough room for clients to be comfortable (Giger, 2016).</p>

                        <h3>Social Organization</h3>
                        <p>Social organization refers to family structure and organization, religious values and beliefs, ethnicity, and culture, all of which affect a person's role and therefore his or her health and illness behavior. Some people may seek the advice of a friend or a family member or may make most decisions independently. Many people strongly value the role of family in making health care decisions and may delay making decisions until they can consult appropriate family members. Autonomy in health care decisions is often an unfamiliar and undesirable concept because the focus is the collective rather than the individual.</p>

                        <h3>Time Orientation</h3>
                        <p>Time orientation, or whether one views time as precise or approximate, differs among cultures. Many countries focus on the urgency of time, valuing punctuality, and precise schedules. Clients from other countries or cultures may not perceive the importance of adhering to specific follow-up appointments or procedures or time-related treatment regimens. Health care providers can become resentful and angry when clients miss appointments or fail to follow specific treatment regimens such as taking medications at prescribed times. Nurses should not label such clients as noncompliant when their behavior may be related to a different cultural orientation to the meaning of time. When possible, the nurse should be sensitive to the client's time orientation, as with follow-up appointments. When timing is essential, as with some medications, the nurse should explain the importance of more precise timing.</p>

                        <h3>Environmental Control</h3>
                        <p>Environmental control refers to a client’s ability to control the surroundings or direct factors in the environment (Giger, 2016). People who believe they have control of their health are more likely to seek care, change their behaviors, and follow treatment recommendations. Those who believe that illness is a result of nature or natural causes are less likely to seek traditional health care because they do not believe it can help them.</p>

                        <h3>Biologic Variations</h3>
                        <p>Biologic variations exist among people from different cultural backgrounds, and research is just beginning to help us understand these variations. For example, we now know that differences related to ethnicity/cultural origins cause variations in response to some psychotropic drugs (discussed earlier). Biologic variations based on physical makeup are said to arise from one’s race, while other cultural variations arise from ethnicity. For example, sickle cell anemia is found almost exclusively in African Americans, and Tay–Sachs disease is most prevalent in the Jewish community.</p>

                        <h3>Socioeconomic Status and Social Class</h3>
                        <p>Socioeconomic status refers to one’s income, education, and occupation. It strongly influences a person’s health, including whether or not the person has insurance and adequate access to health care or can afford prescribed treatment. People who live in poverty are also at risk for threats to health, such as inadequate housing, lead paint, gang-related violence, drug trafficking, or substandard schools.</p>
                        <p>Social class has less influence in the United States than in some other countries because barriers among the social classes are loose and mobility is common; people can gain access to better schools, housing, health care, and lifestyle as they increase their income. In many other countries, however, social class is fixed and can be a powerful influence on social relationships and can determine how people relate to one another, even in a health care setting. For example, a caste system exists in India, and people in the lowest caste may feel unworthy or undeserving of the same level of health care as people in higher castes. The nurse must determine whether social class is a factor in how clients relate to health care providers and the health care system.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Patterns and Differences</h3>
                        <p>Knowledge of cultural patterns provides a starting point for the nurse to begin to relate to people with ethnic backgrounds different from his or her own (Andrews &amp; Boyle, 2015). Being aware of differences can help the nurse know what to ask or how to assess preferences and health practices. Nevertheless, variations among people from any culture are wide; not everyone fits the general pattern. Individual assessment of each person and family is necessary to provide culturally competent care that meets the client's needs. The nurse must learn about greetings, acceptable communication patterns and tone of voice, and beliefs regarding mental illness, healing, spirituality, and medical treatment in order to provide the best care possible.</p>

                        <h3>Nurse's Role in Working with Clients of Various Cultures</h3>
                        <p>To provide culturally competent care, the nurse must find out as much as possible about a client's cultural values, beliefs, and health practices. Often, the client is the best source for that information, so the nurse must ask the client what is important to him or her—for instance, "How would you like to be cared for?" or "What do you expect (or want) me to do for you?" (Andrews &amp; Boyle, 2015).</p>
                        <p>At the initial meeting, the nurse must be alert for the client's preferences for greeting, eye contact, and physical distance. Based on the client's behavior, the nurse can decide what approach is best. For example, if a client offers the nurse his or her hand, the nurse should return the handshake. If the client does not offer a hand, the nurse should refrain from initiating a handshake. Variation among members of any cultural group is wide, and the nurse must remain alert for these individual differences.</p>
                        <p>A client's health practices and religious beliefs are other important areas to assess. The nurse can ask, "Do you follow any dietary preferences or restrictions?" and "How can I assist you in practicing your religious or spiritual beliefs?" The nurse can also gain an understanding of the client's health and illness beliefs by asking, "How do you think this health problem came about?" and "What kinds of remedies have you tried at home?"</p>

                        <p>The nurse must always ask the client and/or family about cultural beliefs and practices. Assuming a patient prefers what is known to be "usual" in his or her culture can be an error and lead to misunderstanding. This is also true concerning the dominant culture of the area or the nurse's own culture. It is never a good idea to make assumptions about another person's ideas, beliefs, and practices. The nurse will demonstrate respect for the person by asking.</p>
                        <p>An open and objective approach to the client is essential. Clients will be more likely to share personal and cultural information if the nurse is genuinely interested in knowing and does not appear skeptical or judgmental. The nurse should ask these same questions even to clients from his or her own cultural background. Again, people in a cultural group vary widely, so the nurse should not assume that he or she knows what a client believes or practices just because the nurse shares the same culture.</p>

                            <p>Cultural competence is an important aspect of health care in all settings.

                        <p>The nurse must be aware of the factors that influence a client’s response to illness, including the individual, interpersonal, and cultural factors discussed earlier. Assessment of these factors can help guide the planning and implementation of nursing care. Biologic and hereditary factors cannot be changed. Others, such as interpersonal factors, can be changed but only with difficulty. For instance, helping a client develop a social support system requires more than simply giving him or her a list of community contacts. The client needs to feel that these resources are valuable to him or her; must perceive them as helpful, responsive, and supportive; and must be willing to use them.</p>
                        <p>Nurses with limited experience in working with various ethnic groups may feel anxious when encountering someone from a different cultural background and worry about saying “the wrong thing” or doing something offensive or disrespectful to the client or family. Nurses may have stereotypical concepts about some ethnic groups and be unaware of them until they encounter a client from that group. It is a constant challenge to remain aware of one's feelings and to handle them effectively.</p>
