                        <p>Anxiety is a vague feeling of dread or apprehension; it is a response to external or internal stimuli that can have behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and physical symptoms. Anxiety is distinguished from fear, which is feeling afraid or threatened by a clearly identifiable external stimulus that represents danger to the person. Anxiety is unavoidable in life and can serve many positive functions such as motivating the person to take action to solve a problem or to resolve a crisis. It is considered normal when it is appropriate to the situation and dissipates when the situation has been resolved.</p>
                        <p>Anxiety disorders comprise a group of conditions that share a key feature of excessive anxiety with ensuing behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and physiological responses. Clients suffering from anxiety disorders can demonstrate unusual behaviors such as panic without reason, unwarranted fear of objects or life conditions, or unexplainable or overwhelming worry. They experience significant distress over time, and the disorder significantly impairs their daily routines, social lives, and occupational functioning.</p>
                        <p>This chapter discusses anxiety as an expected response to stress. It also explores anxiety disorders, with particular emphasis on panic disorder. Other disorders that include excessive anxiety are discussed in other chapters: obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is in Chapter 15, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is in Chapter 13.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Anxiety as a Response to Stress</h2>
                        <p>Stress is the wear and tear that life causes on the body (Selye, 1956). It occurs when a person has difficulty dealing with life situations, problems, and goals. Each person handles stress differently; one person can thrive in a situation that creates great distress for another. For example, many people view public speaking as scary, but for teachers and actors, it is an everyday enjoyable experience. Marriage, children, airplanes, snakes, a new job, a new school, and leaving home are examples of stress-causing stimuli.</p>
                        <p>Hans Selye (1956, 1974), an endocrinologist, identified the physiological aspects of stress, which he labeled general adaptation syndrome. He used laboratory animals to assess biologic system changes; the stages of the body's physical responses to pain, heat, toxins, and later the mind's emotional responses to real or perceived stressors. He identified three stages of reaction to stress:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Alarm reaction stage:</strong> Stress stimulates the body to send messages from the hypothalamus to the glands (such as the adrenal gland, to send out adrenaline and norepinephrine for fuel) and organs (such as the liver, to reconvert glycogen stores to glucose for food) to prepare for potential defense needs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Resistance stage:</strong> The digestive system reduces function to shunt blood to areas needed for defense. The lungs take in more air, and the heart beats faster and harder so that it can circulate this highly oxygenated and highly nourished blood to the muscles to defend the body by fight, flight, or freeze behaviors. If the person adapts to the stress, the body responses relax, and the gland, organ, and systemic responses abate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exhaustion stage:</strong> Occurs when the person has responded negatively to anxiety and stress; body stores are depleted or the emotional components are not resolved, resulting in continual arousal of the physiological responses and little reserve capacity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Autonomic nervous system responses to fear and anxiety generate the involuntary activities of the body that are involved in self-preservation. Sympathetic nerve fibers "charge up" the vital signs at any hint of danger to prepare the body's defenses. The adrenal glands release adrenaline (epinephrine), which causes the body to take in more oxygen, dilate the pupils, and increase arterial pressure and heart rate while constricting the peripheral vessels and shunting blood from the gastrointestinal (GI) and reproductive systems and increasing glycogenolysis to free glucose for fuel for the heart, muscles, and central nervous system. When the danger has passed, parasympathetic nerve fibers reverse this process and return the body to normal operating conditions until the next sign of threat reactivates the sympathetic responses.</p>

                        <p>Anxiety causes uncomfortable cognitive, psychomotor, and physiological responses, such as difficulty with logical thought, increasingly agitated motor activity, and elevated vital signs. To reduce these uncomfortable feelings, the person tries to reduce the level of discomfort by implementing new adaptive behaviors or defense mechanisms. Adaptive behaviors can be positive and help the person learn, for example, using imagery techniques to refocus attention on a pleasant scene, practicing sequential relaxation of the body from head to toe and breathing slowly and steadily to reduce muscle tension and vital signs. Negative responses to anxiety can result in maladaptive behaviors such as tension headaches, pain syndromes, and stress-related responses that reduce the efficiency of the immune system.</p>

                        <p><strong>Mild anxiety</strong> is a sensation that something is different and warrants special attention. Sensory stimulation increases and helps the person focus attention to learn, solve problems, think, act, feel, and protect him or herself. Mild anxiety often motivates people to make changes or engage in goal-directed activity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Moderate anxiety</strong> is the disturbing feeling that something is definitely wrong; the person becomes nervous or agitated. In moderate anxiety, the person can still process information, solve problems, and learn new things with assistance from others. He or she has difficulty concentrating independently but can be redirected to the topic.</p>
                        <p>As the person progresses to <strong>severe anxiety</strong> and panic, more primitive survival skills take over, defensive responses ensue, and cognitive skills decrease significantly. A person with severe anxiety has trouble thinking and reasoning. Muscles tighten, and vital signs increase. The person paces; is restless, irritable, and angry; or uses other similar emotional–psychomotor means to release tension.</p>
                        <p>In <strong>panic</strong>, the emotional–psychomotor realm predominates with accompanying fight, flight, or freeze responses. Adrenaline surge greatly increases vital signs. Pupils enlarge to let in more light, and the only cognitive process focuses on the person's defense.</p>

                        <p>Nurses encounter anxious clients and families in a wide variety of situations. First and foremost, the nurse must assess the person's anxiety level because that determines what interventions are likely to be effective.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Mild Anxiety:</strong> Requires no direct intervention. Teaching can be effective.</li>
                            <li><strong>Moderate Anxiety:</strong> Nurse must ensure the client is following what is said. Speak in short, simple sentences. Redirect client if needed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Severe Anxiety:</strong> Client cannot pay attention. Goal is to lower anxiety to moderate/mild. Remain with the person. Talk in a low, calm, soothing voice. Walk with them if needed. Help take deep breaths.</li>
                            <li><strong>Panic Anxiety:</strong> Safety is primary concern. Client cannot perceive potential harm or think rationally. Keep talking in a comforting manner. Go to a small, quiet, nonstimulating environment. Reassure them they are safe. Remain with the client until panic recedes (5-30 mins).</li>

                            <p>Joan is a 24-year-old single mother whose 2-year-old child has a chronic respiratory disease, cystic fibrosis. Every time her child has an acute exacerbation of symptoms, Joan misses work, stays long hours at the hospital, and becomes increasingly worried about the prognosis for her child. With each acute episode, Joan is less able to cope effectively with her situation. She often sits alone or paces in the ICU waiting room. Today, she becomes overwhelmed by her situation and is crying, pacing, and mumbling incoherently. She is admitted to the hospital for her own safety.</p>

                        <h3>Anxiolytic Drugs</h3>
                        <p>Short-term anxiety can be treated with anxiolytic medications (Table 14.2). Most of these drugs are benzodiazepines, which are commonly prescribed for anxiety. Benzodiazepines have a high potential for abuse and dependence, however; so their use should be short term, ideally no longer than 4 to 6 weeks. These drugs are designed to relieve anxiety so that the person can deal more effectively with whatever crisis or situation is causing stress.</p>

                        <p>Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when anxiety no longer functions as a signal of danger or a motivation for needed change but becomes chronic and permeates major portions of the person's life, resulting in maladaptive behaviors and emotional disability. Types of anxiety disorders include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Agoraphobia</li>
                            <li>Panic disorder</li>
                            <li>Specific phobia</li>
                            <li>Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)</li>
                            <li>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Incidence:</strong> Anxiety disorders have the highest prevalence rates of all mental disorders in the United States for both children and adults. Nearly one in four adults is affected. They are more prevalent in women, people younger than 45, those divorced or separated, and those of lower socioeconomic status.</p>

                        <h3>Related Disorders</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Selective mutism:</strong> Diagnosed in children when they fail to speak in social situations even though they are able to speak.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition:</strong> Prominent symptoms of anxiety judge to result directly from a physiological condition (e.g., endocrine dysfunction, COPD, CHF).</li>
                            <li><strong>Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder:</strong> Anxiety directly caused by drug abuse, a medication, or exposure to a toxin.</li>
                            <li><strong>Separation anxiety disorder:</strong> Excessive anxiety concerning separation from home or attachment figures.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Etiology</h3>
                        <p><strong>Genetic Theories:</strong> Panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias have moderate heritability. GAD and OCD tend to be more common in families.</p>
                        <p><strong>Neurochemical Theories:</strong> Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the amino acid neurotransmitter believed to be dysfunctional in anxiety disorders. Serotonin is believed to play a distinct role in OCD, panic disorder, and GAD. An excess of norepinephrine is suspected in panic disorder, GAD, and PTSD.</p>
                        <p><strong>Psychodynamic Theories:</strong> Freud viewed anxiety as the stimulus for behavior and described defense mechanisms as attempts to control it. Sullivan viewed anxiety as generated from problems in interpersonal relationships. Behavioral theorists view anxiety as learned through experiences.</p>

                        <p>Panic disorder is composed of discrete episodes of panic attacks, that is, 15 to 30 minutes of rapid, intense, escalating anxiety in which the person experiences great emotional fear as well as physiological discomfort. During a panic attack, the person has overwhelmingly intense anxiety and displays four or more of the following symptoms: palpitations, sweating, tremors, shortness of breath, sense of suffocation, chest pain, nausea, abdominal distress, dizziness, paresthesias, chills, or hot flashes.</p>

                        <p>Panic disorder is diagnosed when the person has recurrent, unexpected panic attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern or worry about future attacks or their meaning or a significant behavioral change related to them. Slightly more than 75% of people with panic disorder have spontaneous initial attacks with no environmental trigger.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Panic disorder is treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), deep breathing and relaxation, and medications such as benzodiazepines, SSRI antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants, and antihypertensives such as clonidine (Catapres) and propranolol (Inderal).</p>

People with phobias develop anticipatory anxiety even when thinking about possibly encountering the dreaded phobic object or situation. They engage in avoidance behavior that often severely limits their lives.</p>

                        <p>A person with GAD worries excessively and feels highly anxious at least 50% of the time for 6 months or more. Unable to control this focus on worry, the person has three or more of the following symptoms: uneasiness, irritability, muscle tension, fatigue, difficulty thinking, and sleep alterations. Buspirone (BuSpar) and SSRI or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are the most effective treatments.</p>
