                        <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Experiences of loss are normal and essential in human life. Letting go, relinquishing, and moving on are unavoidable passages as a person moves through the stages of growth and development. People frequently say goodbye to places, people, dreams, and familiar objects. Examples of necessary losses accompanying growth include abandoning a favorite blanket or toy, leaving a first-grade teacher, and giving up the adolescent hope of becoming a famous rock star. Loss allows a person to change, develop, and fulfill innate human potential. It may be planned, expected, or sudden. Although it can be difficult, loss is sometimes beneficial. Other times, it is devastating and debilitating.</p>
                        <p>Grief refers to the subjective emotions and affect that are a normal response to the experience of loss. Grieving, also known as bereavement, refers to the process by which a person experiences the grief. It involves not only the content (what a person thinks, says, and feels) but also the process (how a person thinks, says, and feels). All people grieve when they experience life's changes and losses. Often, grieving is one of the most difficult and challenging processes of human existence; rarely is it comfortable or pleasant. Anticipatory grieving is when people facing an imminent loss begin to grapple with the possibility of the loss or death in the near future. Mourning is the outward expression of grief. Rituals of mourning include having a wake, sitting shiva, holding religious ceremonies, and arranging funerals.</p>
                        <p>This chapter examines the human experience of loss and the process by which a person moves through bereavement and integrates loss into his or her life. To support and care for the grieving client, the nurse must understand the grieving process as well as cultural responses to loss. At times, grief is the focus of treatment. The nursing process section outlines the nurse's role in grieving and gives guidelines for offering support and for teaching coping skills to clients. The chapter also outlines the importance of the nurse's self-awareness and competency in helping clients and families during bereavement.</p>

                    <section class="content-section" id="types-of-losses">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Types of Losses</h2>
                        <p>One framework to examine different types of losses is Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of human needs. According to Maslow (1954), a hierarchy of needs motivates human actions. The hierarchy begins with physiologic needs (food, air, water, sleep), safety needs (a safe place to live and work), and security and belonging needs (satisfying relationships). The next set of needs includes self-esteem needs, which lead to feelings of adequacy and confidence. The last and final need is self-actualization, the ability to realize one's full innate potential. When these human needs are taken away or not met for some reason, a person experiences loss. Examples of losses related to specific human needs in Maslow's hierarchy are as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Physiologic loss:</strong> Examples include amputation of a limb, a mastectomy or hysterectomy, or loss of mobility.</li>
                            <li><strong>Safety loss:</strong> Loss of a safe environment is evident in domestic violence, child abuse, or public violence. A person's home should be a safe haven with trust that family members will provide protection, not harm or violence. Some public institutions, such as schools and churches, are often associated with safety as well. That feeling of safety is shattered when violence occurs on campus or in a holy place.</li>
                            <li><strong>Loss of security and a sense of belonging:</strong> The loss of a loved one affects the need to love and the feeling of being loved. Loss accompanies changes in relationships, such as birth, marriage, divorce, illness, and death; as the meaning of a relationship changes, a person may lose roles within a family or group.</li>
                            <li><strong>Loss of self-esteem:</strong> Any change in how a person is valued at work or in relationships or by him or herself can threaten self-esteem. It may be an actual change or the person's perception of a change in value. Death of a loved one, a broken relationship, loss of a job, and retirement are examples of change that represent loss and can result in a threat to self-esteem.</li>
                            <li><strong>Loss related to self-actualization:</strong> An external or internal crisis that blocks or inhibits striving toward fulfillment may threaten personal goals and individual potential. A person who wanted to go to college, write books, and teach at a university reaches a point in life when it becomes evident that those plans will never materialize or a person loses hope that he or she will find a mate and have children. These are losses that the person will grieve.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <!-- The Grieving Process -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="grieving-process">
                        <h2 class="section-title">The Grieving Process</h2>
                        <p>Nurses interact with clients responding to myriad losses along the continuum of health and illness. Regardless of the type of loss, nurses must have a basic understanding of what is involved to meet the challenge that grief brings to clients. By understanding the phenomena that clients experience as they deal with the discomfort of loss, nurses may promote the expression and release of emotional as well as physical pain during grieving. Supporting this process means ministering to psychological—and physical—needs.</p>

                        <h3>Theories of Grieving</h3>
                        <p>Among well-known theories of grieving are those posed by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, John Bowlby, George Engel, and Mardi Horowitz.</p>

                        <h4>Kübler-Ross's Stages of Grieving</h4>
                        <p>Elisabeth Kübler-Ross (1969) established a basis for understanding how loss affects human life. As she attended to clients with terminal illnesses, a process of dying became apparent to her. Through her observations and work with dying clients and their families, Kübler-Ross developed a model of five stages to explain what people experience as they grieve and mourn:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Denial</strong> is shock and disbelief regarding the loss.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anger</strong> may be expressed toward God, relatives, friends, or health care providers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bargaining</strong> occurs when the person asks God or fate for more time to delay the inevitable loss.</li>
                            <li><strong>Depression</strong> results when awareness of the loss becomes acute.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acceptance</strong> occurs when the person shows evidence of coming to terms with death.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Bowlby's Phases of Grieving</h4>
                        <p>John Bowlby, a British psychoanalyst, proposed a theory that humans instinctively attain and retain affectional bonds with significant others through attachment behaviors. These attachment behaviors are crucial to the development of a sense of security and survival. People experience the most intense emotions when forming a bond such as falling in love, maintaining a bond such as loving someone, disrupting a bond such as in a divorce, and renewing an attachment such as resolving a conflict or renewing a relationship (Bowlby, 1980). An attachment that is maintained is a source of security; an attachment that is renewed is a source of joy. When a bond is threatened or broken, however, the person responds with anxiety, protest, and anger.</p>
                        <p>Bowlby described the grieving process as having four phases:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Experiencing numbness and denying the loss</li>
                            <li>Emotionally yearning for the lost loved one and protesting the permanence of the loss</li>
                            <li>Experiencing cognitive disorganization and emotional despair with difficulty functioning in the everyday world</li>
                            <li>Reorganizing and reintegrating the sense of self to pull life back together</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Engel’s Stages of Grieving</h4>
                        <p>George Engel (1964) described five stages of grieving as follows:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Shock and disbelief:</strong> The initial reaction to a loss is a stunned, numb feeling accompanied by refusal to acknowledge the reality of the loss in an attempt to protect the self against overwhelming stress.</li>
                            <li><strong>Developing awareness:</strong> As the individual begins to acknowledge the loss, there may be crying, feelings of helplessness, frustration, despair, and anger that can be directed at self or others, including God or the deceased person.</li>
                            <li><strong>Restitution:</strong> Participation in the rituals associated with death, such as a funeral, wake, family gathering, or religious ceremonies that help the individual accept the reality of the loss and begin the recovery process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Resolution of the loss:</strong> The individual is preoccupied with the loss, the lost person or object is idealized, and the mourner may even imitate the lost person. Eventually, the preoccupation decreases, usually in a year or perhaps more.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> The previous preoccupation and obsession ends, and the individual is able to go on with life in a way that encompasses the loss.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Horowitz’s Stages of Loss and Adaptation</h4>
                        <p>Mardi Horowitz (2001) divides normal grief into four stages of loss and adaptation:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Outcry:</strong> First realization of the loss. Outcry may be outward, expressed by screaming, yelling, crying, or collapse. Outcry feeling can also be suppressed as the person appears stoic, trying to maintain emotional control. Either way, outcry feelings take a great deal of energy to sustain and tend to be short-lived.</li>
                            <li><strong>Denial and intrusion:</strong> People move back and forth during this stage between denial and intrusion. During denial, the person becomes so distracted or involved in activities that he or she sometimes isn't thinking about the loss. At other times, the loss and all it represents intrudes into every moment and activity, and feelings are quite intense again.</li>
                            <li><strong>Working through:</strong> As time passes, the person spends less time bouncing back and forth between denial and intrusion, and the emotions are not as intense and overwhelming. The person still thinks about the loss, but also begins to find new ways of managing life after loss.</li>
                            <li><strong>Completion:</strong> Life begins to feel "normal" again, though life is different after the loss. Memories are less painful and do not regularly interfere with day-to-day life. Episodes of intense feelings may occur, especially around anniversary dates but are transient in nature.</li>

                            <p>According to Horowitz’s stages of loss and adaptation, outcry is the stage in which people first realize their loss. This may be suppressed; the person may appear stoic as he or she tries to maintain emotional control. During denial, a patient can become so distracted that he or she often does not think about the loss. At other times, the loss and all it represents intrude into every moment and activity, and feelings are quite intense again.</p>

                        <h3>Tasks of Grieving</h3>
                        <p>Grieving tasks, or mourning, that the bereaved person faces involve active rather than passive participation. It is sometimes called “grief work” because it is difficult and requires tremendous effort and energy to accomplish.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Rando (1984) describes tasks inherent to grieving that she calls the “six Rs:”</strong></p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Recognize:</strong> Experiencing the loss, understanding that it is real, and that it has happened</li>
                            <li><strong>React:</strong> Emotional response to loss, feeling the feelings</li>
                            <li><strong>Recollect and reexperience:</strong> Memories are reviewed and relived</li>
                            <li><strong>Relinquish:</strong> Accepting that the world has changed (as a result of the loss) and that there is no turning back</li>
                            <li><strong>Readjust:</strong> Beginning to return to daily life; loss feels less acute and overwhelming</li>
                            <li><strong>Reinvest:</strong> Accepting changes that have occurred; reentering the world, forming new relationships and commitments</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>People have many and varied responses to loss. They express their bereavement in their thoughts, words, feelings, and actions as well as through their physiologic responses. Therefore, nurses must use a holistic model of grieving that encompasses cognitive, emotional, spiritual, behavioral, and physiologic dimensions.</p>

                        <h3>Cognitive Responses to Grief</h3>
                        <p>In some respects, the pain that accompanies grieving results from a disturbance in the person’s beliefs. The loss disrupts, if not shatters, basic assumptions about life’s meaning and purpose. Grieving often causes a person to change beliefs about him or herself and the world, such as perceptions of the world’s benevolence, the meaning of life as related to justice, and a sense of destiny or life path. Other changes in thinking and attitude include reviewing and ranking values, becoming wiser, shedding illusions about immortality, viewing the world more realistically, and reevaluating religious or spiritual beliefs.</p>

                        <h3>Emotional Responses to Grief</h3>
                        <p>Anger, sadness, and anxiety are the predominant emotional responses to loss. The grieving person may direct anger and resentment toward the dead person and his or her health practices, family members, or health care providers or institutions. Guilt over things not done or said in the lost relationship is another painful emotion. Feelings of hatred and revenge are common when death has resulted from extreme circumstances, such as suicide, murder, or war.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">CLINICAL VIGNETTE: Grief</h3>
                            <p>"If I had known what the grief process was like, I would never have married, or I would have prayed every day of my married life that I would be the first to die," reflects Margaret, 9 years after the death of her husband.</p>
                            <p>She recalls her initial thought, denying and acknowledging reality simultaneously, when James was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in October 1987: "It's a mistake. But I know it isn't."</p>
                            <p>For 2½ years, Margaret and James diligently followed his regimen of treatment while taking time for work and play, making the most of their life together in the moment. "We were not melodramatic people. We told ourselves, 'This is what's happening; we'll deal with it.'"</p>
                            <p>When James died, Margaret remained "level-headed and composed" until one day shortly after the funeral when she suddenly became aware of her exhaustion. While shopping, she found herself in protest of the emotional pain and wanting to shout, "Doesn't anybody know that I have just lost my husband?" Surprised with how overwhelmed she felt, one of her hardest moments was putting her sister on the plane and going home to "an empty house." It was at this time that she began to feel the initial shock of her loss. Her body felt as though it was "wired with electricity." She felt as though she was "just going through the emotions," doing routine chores like grocery shopping and putting gas in the car, all the while feeling numb.</p>
                            <p>Crying spells lasted 6 months. She became "tired of mourning" and would ask herself, "When is this going to be relieved?" She also felt anger. "I was upset with James, wondering why he didn't go for his complete physical. Maybe James's death might not have happened so soon."</p>
                            <p>After a few months and well into the grief process, Margaret knew she needed to “do something constructive.” She did. She attended support groups, traveled, and became involved with church activities.</p>
                            <p>Nearly a decade after James’s death, Margaret views the grief process as a profound and poignant “search for meaning in life. If he had not gone, I would not have come to where I am in life. I am content, confident, and happy with how authentic life is.” Even so, a sense of James’s presence remains with her as she pictures the way he was before he became ill. She states, “This is good for me.”</p>

                        <h3>Physiologic Responses to Grief</h3>
                        <p>Physiologic symptoms and problems associated with grief responses are often a source of anxiety and concern for the grieving person as well as for friends or caregivers. Those grieving may complain of insomnia, headaches, impaired appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, palpitations, indigestion, and changes in the immune and endocrine systems. Sleep disturbances are among the most frequent and persistent bereavement-associated symptoms.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Cultural Considerations</h2>
                        <p>Although all people grieve for lost loved ones, rituals and habits surrounding death vary among cultures. Each culture defines the context in which grieving, mourning, and integrating loss into life are given meaningful expression. The context for expression is consistent with beliefs about life, death, and an afterlife. Certain aspects of the experience are more important than other aspects for each culture.</p>
                        <p>Universal reactions include the initial response of shock and social disorientation, attempts to continue a relationship with the deceased, anger with those perceived as responsible for the death, and a time for mourning. Each culture, however, defines specific acceptable ways to exhibit shock and sadness, display anger, and mourn. Cultural awareness of rituals for mourning can help nurses understand an individual's or a family's behavior.</p>

                        <h3>Culture-Specific Rituals</h3>
                        <p>As people immigrate to the United States and Canada, they may lose rich ethnic and cultural roots during the adjustment of <strong>acculturation</strong> (altering cultural values or behaviors as a way to adapt to another culture). Because cultural bereavement rituals have roots in several of the world's major religions, religious or spiritual beliefs and practices regarding death frequently guide the client's mourning. In the United States, various mourning rituals and practices exist. A few of the major ones are summarized next.</p>
                        
                        <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                            <li><strong>African Americans:</strong> Many mourning rituals are tied to religious traditions. In Catholic and Episcopalian services, hymns may be sung, poetry read, and a eulogy spoken; less formal Baptist and Holiness traditions may involve singing, speaking in other languages, and liturgical dancing. Typically, the deceased is viewed in church before being buried in a cemetery. Mourning may also be expressed through public prayers, black clothing, and decreased social activities. The mourning period may last a few weeks to several years.</li>
                            <li><strong>Muslim Americans:</strong> Islam does not permit cremation. It is important to follow the five steps of the burial procedure, which specify washing, dressing, and positioning of the body. The first step is traditional washing of the body by a Muslim of the same gender (Ahaddour, Van den Branden, &amp; Broeckaert, 2017).</li>
                            <li><strong>Haitian Americans:</strong> Some Haitian Americans practice vodun (voodoo), also called “root medicine.” Derived from Roman Catholic rituals and cultural practices of western Africa (Benin and Togo) and Sudan, vodun is the practice of calling on a group of spirits with whom one periodically makes peace during specific events in life. The death of a loved one may be such a time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chinese Americans:</strong> The Chinese have strict norms for announcing death, preparing the body, arranging the funeral and burial, and mourning after burial. Burning incense and reading scripture are ways to assist the spirit of the deceased in the afterlife journey. If the deceased and his or her family are Buddhists, meditating before a shrine in the room is important. For 1 year after death, the family may place bowls of food on a table for the spirit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Japanese Americans:</strong> Buddhist Japanese Americans view death as a life passage. Close family members may bathe the deceased with warm water and dress the body in a white kimono after purification rites. For 2 days, family and friends bearing gifts may visit or offer money for the deceased while saying prayers and burning incense.</li>
                            <li><strong>Filipino Americans:</strong> Most Filipino Americans are Catholic, and depending on how close one was to the deceased, wearing black clothing or armbands is customary during mourning. Family and friends place wreaths on the casket and drape a broad black cloth on the home of the deceased.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vietnamese Americans:</strong> Vietnamese Americans are predominately Buddhists, who bathe the deceased and dress him or her in black clothes. They may put a few grains of rice in the mouth and place money with the deceased so that he or she can buy a drink as the spirit moves on in the afterlife. The body may be displayed for viewing in the home before burial.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hispanic Americans:</strong> Hispanic or Latino Americans are predominately Roman Catholic. They may pray for the soul of the deceased during a novena (9-day devotion) and a rosary (devotional prayer). They manifest <em>luto</em> (mourning) by wearing black or black and white while behaving in a subdued manner. Friends and relatives bring flowers and crosses to decorate the grave. Guatemalan Americans may include a marimba band in the funeral procession and services.</li>
                            <li><strong>Native Americans:</strong> Ancient beliefs and practices influence the more than 500 Native American tribes. A tribe's medicine man or priestly healer, who assists the friends and family of the deceased to regain their spiritual equilibrium, is an essential spiritual guide. Ceremonies of baptism for the spirit of the deceased seem to help ward off depression of the bereaved. To designate the end of mourning, a ceremony at the burial grounds is held during which the grave is covered with a blanket or cloth for making clothes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Orthodox Jewish Americans:</strong> Jewish custom is for a relative to stay with a dying person so that the soul does not leave the body while the person is alone. To leave the body alone after death is disrespectful. Although organ donation is permitted, autopsy is not (unless required by law); burial must occur within 24 hours unless delayed by the Sabbath. Shiva is a 7-day period that begins on the day of the funeral. It represents time for mourners to step out of day-to-day life and to reflect on the change that has occurred.</li>

                            <li>The loss itself is not recognized</li>
                            <li>The griever is not recognized</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>In each situation, there is an attachment followed by a loss that leads to grief. The grief process is more complex because the usual supports that facilitate grieving and healing are absent (Schultz &amp; Videbeck, 2013).</p>
                        <p>In the U.S. culture, kin-based relationships receive the most attention in cases of death. Relationships between lovers, friends, neighbors, foster parents, colleagues, and caregivers may be long-lasting and intense, but people suffering loss in these relationships may not be able to mourn publicly with the social support and recognition given to family members. In addition, some relationships are not always recognized publicly or sanctioned socially. Possible examples include same-sex relationships (Patlamazoglou, Simmonds, &amp; Snell, 2017), cohabitation without marriage, and extramarital affairs.</p>
                        <p>Nurses, physicians, and hospital chaplains may experience disenfranchised grief when their need to grieve is not recognized. For example, nurses who work in areas involving organ donation or transplantation are involved intimately with the death of clients who may donate organs to another person. The daily intensity of relationships between nurses and clients/families creates strong bonds among them. The emotional effects of loss are significant for these nurses; however, there is seldom a socially ordained place or time to grieve. Physicians are prone to burnout symptoms as they experience losses over the course of their careers which they rarely discuss with others (Lathrop, 2017). Hospital chaplains often feel that they are expected to be strong and skilled in dealing with death, and their own need to grieve is unrecognized or unsupported. The solitude in which the grieving occurs usually provides little or no comfort.</p>

                    <section class="content-section" id="complicated-grieving">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Complicated Grieving</h2>
                        <p>Some believe complicated grieving to be a response outside the norm, occurring when a person is void of emotion, grieves for prolonged periods, or has expressions of grief that seem disproportionate to the event. People may suppress emotional responses to the loss or become obsessively preoccupied with the deceased person or lost object. Others may actually suffer from clinical depression when they cannot make progress in the grief process. Previously existing psychiatric disorders may also complicate the grief process, so nurses must be particularly alert to clients with psychiatric disorders who are grieving. Grief can precipitate major depression in a person with a history of the disorder. These clients can also experience grief and a sense of loss when they encounter changes in treatment settings, routine, environment, or even staff.</p>

                        <h3>Characteristics of Susceptibility</h3>
                        <p>People who are vulnerable to complicated grieving include those with the following characteristics:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Low self-esteem</li>
                            <li>Low trust in others</li>
                            <li>A previous psychiatric disorder</li>
                            <li>Previous suicide threats or attempts</li>
                            <li>Absent or unhelpful family members</li>
                            <li>An ambivalent, dependent, or insecure attachment to the deceased person</li>
                            <li>An especially strong, rewarding relationship with the deceased person</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Risk Factors Leading to Vulnerability</h3>
                        <p>Some experiences increase the risk of complicated grieving for the vulnerable parties. These experiences are related to trauma or individual perceptions of vulnerability and include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Death of a spouse or child</li>
                            <li>Death of a parent (particularly in early childhood or adolescence)</li>
                            <li>Sudden, unexpected, and untimely death</li>
                            <li>Multiple deaths</li>
                            <li>Death by suicide or murder</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The person with complicated grieving can also experience physiologic and emotional reactions. Physical reactions can include an impaired immune system, increased adrenocortical activity, increased levels of serum prolactin and growth hormone, psychosomatic disorders, and increased mortality from heart disease. The Center for Complicated Grief at Columbia University (2018) identifies the following difficulties:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Maladaptive thoughts, such as rumination, catastrophizing, and worry about doing the right thing</li>
                            <li>Dysfunctional behaviors, such as avoiding all reminders of the deceased person or immersing oneself in the lost loved one's possessions, pictures, and daydreaming about being together to the exclusion of any other coping strategies</li>
                            <li>Inadequate emotional regulation, or focusing exclusively on negative emotions, not taking a break for more soothing or calming pursuits, and ignoring regular routines for eating, sleeping, activities and social contact</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>For the nurse to support and facilitate the grief process for clients, he or she must observe and listen for cognitive, emotional, spiritual, behavioral, and physiologic cues. Although the nurse must be familiar with the phases, tasks, and dimensions of human response to loss, he or she must realize that each client's experience is unique. Skillful communication is key to performing assessment and providing interventions.</p>

                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Effective assessment involves observing all dimensions of human response: what the person is thinking (cognitive), how the person is feeling (emotional), what the person's values and beliefs are (spiritual), how the person is acting (behavioral), and what is happening in the person's body (physiologic). Effective communication skills during assessment can lead the client toward understanding his or her experience. Thus, assessment facilitates the client's grief process.</p>

                                    <p>Culturally bound reactions to loss are often lost in the acculturation to dominant societal norms. Both universal and culture-specific rituals facilitate grieving.</p>

                                    <p>Disenfranchised grief often involves deaths, mourners, or situations that are not socially supported or sanctioned, or carry a stigma for the mourners.</p>

                                    <p>Complicated grieving is a response that lies outside the norm. The person may be void of emotion, grieve for a prolonged period, or express feelings that seem out of proportion.</p>

                                    <p>Situations considered risk factors for complicated grief in those already vulnerable include death of a spouse or child, a sudden unexpected death, and murder.</p>

                                    <p>During assessment, the nurse observes and listens for cues in what the person thinks and feels and how he or she behaves, and then uses these relevant data to guide the client in the grieving process.</p>

                                    <p>Interventions focused on the perception of loss include exploring the meaning of the loss and allowing adaptive denial, which is the process of gradually adjusting to the reality of a loss.</p>

                                    <p>To earn the client's trust, the nurse must examine his or her own attitudes about loss and periodically take a self-awareness inventory.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Unfolding Patient Stories: G.P. • Part 1</h4>
                            <p>G.P., 90 years old, was diagnosed 6 months ago with minor neurocognitive disorder, Alzheimer type. He lives independently in an apartment within a retirement community. His wife of 65 years died 3 years ago. He was managing well until the recent loss of his 13-year-old dog. What responses and behaviors associated with bereavement should the nurse consider when assessing G.P.? How can his cognitive disorder complicate the process of grieving? How can the nurse guide his progression through grief and bereavement? G.P.'s story continues in Chapter 24.</p>
