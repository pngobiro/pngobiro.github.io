                        <p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was previously classified as an anxiety disorder, but with the DSM-5, it has been reclassified into a new category called Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders. This category includes OCD, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition, and other specified or unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.</p>
                        <p>Obsessions are recurrent, persistent, intrusive, and unwanted thoughts, images, or impulses that cause marked anxiety and interfere with interpersonal, social, or occupational function. The person knows these thoughts are excessive or unreasonable but believes he or she has no control over them. Compulsions are ritualistic or repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person carries out continuously in an attempt to neutralize anxiety. Usually, the theme of the ritual is associated with that of the obsession, such as repetitive hand washing when someone is obsessed with contamination or repeated prayers or confession for someone obsessed with blasphemous thoughts. Common compulsions include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Checking rituals (repeatedly making sure the door is locked or the coffee pot is turned off)</li>
                            <li>Counting rituals (each step taken, ceiling tiles, concrete blocks, or desks in a classroom)</li>
                            <li>Washing and scrubbing until the skin is raw</li>
                            <li>Praying or chanting</li>
                            <li>Touching, rubbing, or tapping</li>
                            <li>Ordering (arranging and rearranging furniture or objects on a desk or shelf into perfect order)</li>
                            <li>Exhibiting rigid performance (getting dressed in an unvarying pattern)</li>
                            <li>Having aggressive urges (for instance, to throw one's child against a wall)</li>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Clinical Course</h2>
                        <p>OCD can start in childhood, especially in males. In females, it more commonly begins in the 20s. Overall, distribution between the sexes is equal. Onset is usually gradual, with symptom exacerbation during periods of stress. OCD is a chronic progressive disease. Symptoms wax and wane over time, increasing during periods of stress.</p>

                        <p>Etiology of OCD is not specifically known but includes genetic influences and environmental experiences. OCD is universal across countries with some variation in symptoms.</p>
                        <p><strong>Treatment</strong> includes medications, specifically SSRIs (see Chapter 2), and behavioral therapy. Behavioral therapy techniques include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Exposure:</strong> Deliberately confronting the situations and stimuli that the client usually tries to avoid.</li>
                            <li><strong>Response Prevention:</strong> Delaying or avoiding performance of rituals.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that encompasses exposure and response prevention may be the first-line best practice in the treatment of OCD.</p>

                        <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
                        <p>Nursing diagnoses commonly used for clients with OCD include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Anxiety</li>
                            <li>Ineffective coping</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Outcome Identification</h3>
                        <p>Outcomes for clients with OCD include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The client will complete daily routine activities within a realistic time frame.</li>
                            <li>The client will demonstrate effective use of relaxation techniques.</li>
                            <li>The client will discuss feelings with another person.</li>
                            <li>The client will demonstrate effective use of behavioral therapy techniques.</li>
                            <li>The client will spend less time performing rituals.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Intervention</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Using Therapeutic Communication</h4>
                        <p>Offering support and encouragement to the client is important to help him or her manage anxiety responses. The nurse can validate the overwhelming feelings the client experiences while indicating the belief that the client can make needed changes and regain a sense of control. The nurse encourages the client to talk about the feelings and describe them in as much detail as the client can tolerate. Because many clients try to hide their rituals and keep obsessions secret, discussing these thoughts, behaviors, and resulting feelings with the nurse is an important step. Doing so can begin to relieve some of the "burden" the client has been keeping to him or herself.</p>

                        <h4>Teaching Relaxation and Behavioral Techniques</h4>
                        <p>The nurse can teach the client about relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery. This intervention should take place when the client's anxiety is low so he or she can learn more effectively. Initially, the nurse can demonstrate and practice the techniques with the client. Then, the nurse encourages the client to practice these techniques until he or she is comfortable doing them alone. When the client has mastered relaxation techniques, he or she can begin to use them when anxiety increases. In addition to decreasing anxiety, the client gains an increased sense of control that can lead to improved self-esteem.</p>
                        <p>To manage anxiety and ritualistic behaviors, a baseline of frequency and duration is necessary. The client can keep a diary to chronicle situations that trigger obsessions, the intensity of the anxiety, the time spent performing rituals, and the avoidance behaviors. This record provides a clear picture for both client and nurse. The client then can begin to use exposure and response prevention behavioral techniques. Initially, the client can decrease the time he or she spends performing the ritual or delay performing the ritual while experiencing anxiety. Eventually, the client can eliminate the ritualistic response or decrease it significantly to the point that interference with daily life is minimal. Clients can use relaxation techniques to assist them in managing and tolerating the anxiety they are experiencing.</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that the client must be willing to engage in exposure and response prevention. These are not techniques that can be forced on the client.</p>

                        <h4>Completing a Daily Routine</h4>
                        <p>To accomplish tasks efficiently, the client initially may need additional time to allow for rituals. For example, if breakfast is at 8 AM and the client has a 45-minute ritual before eating, the nurse must plan that time into the client's schedule. It is important for the nurse not to interrupt or to attempt to stop the ritual because doing so will escalate the client's anxiety dramatically. Again, the client must be willing to make changes in his or her behavior. The nurse and client can agree on a plan to limit the time spent performing rituals. They may decide to limit the morning ritual to 40 minutes, then to 35 minutes, and so forth, taking care to decrease this time gradually at a rate the client can tolerate. When the client has completed the ritual or the time allotted has passed, the client then must engage in the expected activity. This may cause anxiety and is a time when the client can use relaxation and stress reduction techniques. At home, the client can continue to follow a daily routine or written schedule that helps him or her to stay on tasks and accomplish activities and responsibilities.</p>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>For Families</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Avoid giving advice such as, "Just think of something else."</li>
                            <li>Avoid trying to fix the problem; that never works.</li>
                            <li>Be patient with your family member's discomfort.</li>
                            <li>Monitor your own anxiety level, and take a break from the situation if you need to.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>It is important for both the client and family to learn about OCD. They are often relieved to find the client is not "going crazy" and that the obsessions are unwanted, rather than a reflection of any "dark side" to the client's personality. Helping the client and family talk openly about the obsessions, anxiety, and rituals eliminates the client's need to keep these things secret and to carry the guilty burden alone. Family members can also give the client needed emotional support when they are fully informed.</p>
                        <p>Teaching about the importance of medication compliance to combat OCD is essential. The client may need to try different medications until his or her response is satisfactory. The chances for improved OCD symptoms are enhanced when the client takes medication and uses behavioral techniques.</p>

                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>Treatment has been effective when OCD symptoms no longer interfere with the client's ability to carry out responsibilities. When obsessions occur, the client manages resulting anxiety without engaging in complicated or time-consuming rituals. He or she reports regained control over his or her life and the ability to tolerate and manage anxiety with minimal disruption.</p>

                        <h3>Elder Considerations</h3>
                        <p>Onset of OCD after age 50 is extremely rare. Recently acquired obsessive or compulsive behavior by an elder person should alert the physician to a possible organic cause for the behavior, such as infections, degenerative disorders, brain injury, and cerebrovascular lesions, particularly in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia. Treatment then is directed at the underlying cause, and the obsessive-compulsive behaviors can improve if the underlying cause can be successfully resolved. Hoarding disorder often has a late-age onset. Multiple community agencies may be needed to deal with hoarding in the older adult. Treatment for hoarding in older adults may need to continue over a long period of time to reach successful outcomes.</p>

                        <h3>Community-Based Care</h3>
                        <p>Treatment for OCD involves both medication and CBT. The therapist or treatment team can teach the client exposure and response prevention techniques, but the client will need to continue to practice those techniques at home in the community over an extended time. Successful outcomes of treatment require consistent use of the techniques on a daily basis.</p>
                        <p>One of the promising newer developments for clients is technology-enhanced delivery. Though in its infancy, a few small studies have tried various technology-delivered techniques: bibliotherapy, telephone-delivered CBT, and computerized CBT. These technologies have promise and should be implemented in large studies to evaluate their effectiveness over time. In addition, self-help and online therapy can be an effective add-on to standard therapy. While online self-help methods alone may not produce optimal results, they might be the only type of treatment that people who are shamed and stigmatized by their OCD symptoms will be willing to seek.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">BEST PRACTICE: OCD Treatment</h4>
                            <p>CBT that encompasses exposure and response prevention may be the first-line best practice in the treatment of OCD. Treatment can be delivered in a variety of settings, and initially, the results seem to be enduring. The next step is to implement this combination therapy with different age groups, in various settings, and using different delivery methods to determine whether the enduring positive results will continue under the varying circumstances.</p>

                        <p>It may be difficult for nurses and others to understand why the person cannot simply stop performing the bizarre behaviors interfering with his or her life. Why does the hand washer who has scrubbed himself raw keep washing his sore hands every hour on the hour? People with OCD are usually aware that their ritualistic behavior appears senseless or even bizarre to others. Given that, family and friends may believe that the person "should just stop" the ritualistic behavior. "Just find something else to do" or other unsolicited advice only adds to the guilt and shame that people with OCD experience.</p>
                        <p>It is important for the nurse (and other health professionals) to avoid taking that same point of view. Most times, people with OCD appear "perfectly normal" and therefore capable of controlling their own behaviors. The nurse must remember that overwhelming fear and anxiety interfere with the person's ability to monitor or control their own actions.</p>
                        <p>In addition, OCD is often chronic in nature, with symptoms that wax and wane over time. Just because the client has some success in managing thoughts and rituals doesn't mean they will never again need professional help in the future.</p>

                        <h3>CLINICAL EXAMPLE</h3>
                        <p>Susan is a 24-year-old, married, mother of two children, aged 2 and 5. She has always described herself as a "neat freak," cleaning and scrubbing the car, the house, and even her children repeatedly. Susan has always secretly worried that lack of cleanliness would lead to disease or contamination and that she or her family might become deathly ill due to her negligence in protecting them from germs.</p>
                        <p>In the past few months, Susan's thoughts of contamination and disease have increased as have her cleaning activities. Her children complain, and Susan’s husband believes her cleaning is “getting out of control.” He finds Susan cleaning in the middle of the night, and when he tries to interfere with her cleaning, she explodes. She is sobbing and yelling and extremely agitated. Susan is taken to the emergency department of the local hospital, given a tentative diagnosis of OCD, and admitted to the inpatient unit.</p>
