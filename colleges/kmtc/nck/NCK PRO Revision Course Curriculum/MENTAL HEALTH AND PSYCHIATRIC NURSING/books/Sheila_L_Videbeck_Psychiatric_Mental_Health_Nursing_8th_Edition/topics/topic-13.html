                        <p>People may experience events in their lives that are extraordinary in intensity or severity, well beyond the stress of daily life (see Chapter 14). These traumatic events or stressors would be expected to disrupt the life of anyone who experienced them, not just individuals at risk for mental health problems or issues. The trauma or event may affect a single individual, such as a person with a history of childhood abuse, a child newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, or an adult with an acute coronary syndrome such as a myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Large numbers or groups of people may be affected by a traumatic event, such as war, terrorist attacks, or a natural disaster like a flood, hurricane, or tsunami. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is seen in countries around the world (Shalev &amp; Marmar, 2017).</p>
                        <p>While all persons experiencing events such as these manifest anxiety, insomnia, difficulty coping, grief, or any variety of responses, most work through the experience and return to their usual levels of coping and equilibrium, perhaps even enhanced coping as a result of dealing with the event. However, some individuals continue to have problems coping, managing stress and emotions, or resuming the daily activities of their lives. They may develop an adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, PTSD, or a dissociative disorder as discussed in this chapter.</p>

                        <p>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disturbing pattern of behavior demonstrated by someone who has experienced, witnessed, or been confronted with a traumatic event such as a natural disaster, combat, or an assault. A person with PTSD was exposed to an event that posed actual or threatened death or serious injury and responded with intense fear, helplessness, or terror.

                        <h3>Clinical Course</h3>
                        <p>The four subcategories of symptoms in PTSD include reexperiencing the trauma through dreams or recurrent and intrusive thoughts, avoidance, negative cognition or thoughts, being on guard, or hyperarousal (Shalev &amp; Marmar, 2017). The person persistently reexperiences the trauma through memories, dreams, flashbacks, or reactions to external cues about the event and therefore avoids stimuli associated with the trauma. The victim feels a numbing of general responsiveness and shows persistent signs of increased arousal such as insomnia, hyperarousal or hypervigilance, irritability, or angry outbursts. He or she reports losing a sense of connection and control over his or her life. This can lead to avoidance behavior or trying to avoid any places or people or situations that may trigger memories of the trauma. The person seeks comfort, safety, and security, but can actually become increasingly isolated over time, which can heighten the negative feelings he or she was trying to avoid.</p>

                        <p>In PTSD, the symptoms occur 3 months or more after the trauma, which distinguishes PTSD from acute stress disorder, which may have similar types of symptoms but lasts 3 days up to 1 month. The onset can be delayed for months or even years. Typically, PTSD is chronic in nature, though symptoms can fluctuate in intensity and severity, becoming worse during stressful periods. Often, other life events can exacerbate PTSD symptoms. In addition, many clients with PTSD develop other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, or alcohol and drug abuse (Shalev &amp; Marmar, 2017).</p>

                        <h3>Related Disorders</h3>
                        <p><strong>Adjustment disorder</strong> is a reaction to a stressful event that causes problems for the individual. Typically, the person has more than the expected difficulty coping with or assimilating the event into his or her life. Financial, relationship, and work-related stressors are the most common events. The symptoms develop within a month, lasting no more than 6 months.</p>
                        <p><strong>Acute stress disorder</strong> occurs after a traumatic event and is characterized by reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal that occur from 3 days to 4 weeks following a trauma. It can be a precursor to PTSD.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reactive attachment disorder (RAD)</strong> and <strong>disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED)</strong> occur before the age of 5 in response to the trauma of child abuse or neglect. The child with RAD exhibits minimal social and emotional responses to others, while the child with DSED exhibits unselective socialization, allowing social interaction with caregivers and strangers alike.</p>

                        <h3>Etiology</h3>
                        <p>PTSD is a disorder associated with event exposure, rather than personal characteristics, especially with the adult population. However, lack of social support, peri-trauma dissociation, and previous psychiatric history or personality factors can further increase the risk of PTSD when they are present pretrauma. Adolescents are more likely to develop PTSD than children or adults. Age, gender, type of trauma, and repeated trauma are related to increased PTSD rates.</p>

                        <p>Dissociation is a subconscious defense mechanism that helps a person protect his or her emotional self from recognizing the full effects of some horrific or traumatic event by allowing the mind to forget or remove itself from the painful situation or memory. Dissociative disorders have the essential feature of a disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or environmental perception.</p>
                        
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Dissociative Amnesia:</strong> The client cannot remember important personal information (usually of a traumatic or stressful nature). Includes dissociative fugue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID):</strong> Formerly multiple personality disorder. The client displays two or more distinct identities or personality states that recurrently take control of his or her behavior.</li>
                            <li><strong>Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder:</strong> Persistent feeling of being detached from one's mental processes or body (depersonalization) or sensation of being in a dream-like state (derealization).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Repressed Memories:</strong> Many professionals believe that memories of childhood abuse can be buried deeply in the subconscious mind or repressed because they are too painful for the victims to acknowledge. However, there is a danger of inducing false memories through imagination in psychotherapy (False Memory Syndrome).</p>

                            <p>Julie sat up in bed. She felt her heart pounding, she was perspiring, and she felt like she couldn't breathe. She was gasping for breath and felt pressure on her throat. The picture of that dark figure knocking her to the ground and his hands around her throat was vivid in her mind. Her heart was pounding, and she was reliving it all over again, the pain and the terror of that night. It had been 2 years since she was attacked and raped in the park by a man she thought was her friend, but sometimes it felt like just yesterday.</p>
                            <p>Lately, the dread of reliving the nightmare made Julie afraid to fall asleep, and she wasn't getting much sleep. She felt exhausted. She didn't feel much like eating and was losing weight. This ordeal had ruined her life. She was missing work more and more. Even while at work, she often felt an overwhelming sense of dread. Sometimes even in the daytime, memories and flashbacks of that night would come.</p>

                        <p><strong>Coping with Stress and Emotions:</strong> Use <strong>grounding techniques</strong> to help the client who is dissociating or experiencing flashbacks. Remind the client they are in the present, are an adult, and are safe. Validate feelings but increase contact with reality. Encourage the client to change positions but do not force them. Use a log or journal to identify feelings and triggers.</p>
