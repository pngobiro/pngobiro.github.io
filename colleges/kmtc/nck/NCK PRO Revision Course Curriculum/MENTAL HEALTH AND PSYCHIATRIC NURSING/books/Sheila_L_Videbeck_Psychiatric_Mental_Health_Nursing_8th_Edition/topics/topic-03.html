                        <p>Today’s mental health treatment has an eclectic approach, meaning one that incorporates concepts and strategies from a variety of sources. This chapter presents an overview of major psychosocial theories, highlights the ideas and concepts in current practice, and explains the various psychosocial treatment modalities. The psychosocial theories have produced many models currently used in individual and group therapy and various treatment settings. The medical model of treatment is based on the neurobiologic theories discussed in Chapter 2.</p>

                        <p>Many theories attempt to explain human behavior, health, and mental illness. Each theory suggests how normal development occurs based on the theorist's beliefs, assumptions, and view of the world. These theories suggest strategies that the clinician can use to work with clients. Many theories discussed in this chapter were not based on empirical or research evidence; rather, they evolved from individual experiences and might more appropriately be called conceptual models or frameworks.</p>
                        <p>This chapter discusses the following types of psychosocial theories:</p>

                        <h3>Psychoanalytic Theories</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Sigmund Freud: The Father of Psychoanalysis</h4>
                        <p>Sigmund Freud (1856–1939; Fig. 3.1) developed psychoanalytic theory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Vienna, where he spent most of his life. Several other noted psychoanalysts and theorists have contributed to this body of knowledge, but Freud is its undisputed founder. Many clinicians and theorists did not agree with much of Freud's psychoanalytic theory and later developed their own theories and styles of treatment.</p>

                        <p>Psychoanalytic theory supports the notion that all human behavior is caused and can be explained (deterministic theory). Freud believed that repressed (driven from conscious awareness) sexual impulses and desires motivate much human behavior. He developed his initial ideas and explanations of human behavior from his experiences with a few clients, all of them women who displayed unusual behaviors such as disturbances of sight and speech, inability to eat, and paralysis of limbs. These symptoms had no diagnosed physiologic basis, so Freud considered them to be "hysterical" or neurotic behaviors of women. After several years of working with these women, Freud concluded that many of their problems resulted from childhood trauma or failure to complete tasks of psychosexual development. These women repressed their unmet needs and sexual feelings as well as traumatic events. The "hysterical" or neurotic behaviors resulted from these unresolved conflicts.</p>

                        <p><strong>Personality Components: Id, Ego, and Superego.</strong> Freud conceptualized personality structure as having three components: the id, ego, and superego (Freud, 1923, 1962). The id is the part of one's nature that reflects basic or innate desires such as pleasure-seeking behavior, aggression, and sexual impulses. The id seeks instant gratification, causes impulsive unthinking behavior, and has no regard for rules or social convention. The superego is the part of a person's nature that reflects moral and ethical concepts, values, and parental and social expectations; therefore, it is in direct opposition to the id. The third component, the ego, is the balancing or mediating force between the id and the superego. The ego represents mature and adaptive behavior that allows a person to function successfully in the world. Freud believed that anxiety resulted from the ego's attempts to balance the impulsive instincts of the id with the stringent rules of the superego.</p>

                        <p><strong>Behavior Motivated by Subconscious Thoughts and Feelings.</strong> Freud believed that the human personality functions at three levels of awareness: conscious, preconscious, and unconscious (Freud, 1923, 1962). Conscious refers to the perceptions, thoughts, and emotions that exist in the person's awareness, such as being aware of happy feelings or thinking about a loved one. Preconscious thoughts and emotions are not currently in the person's awareness, but he or she can recall them with some effort—for example, an adult remembering what he or she did, thought, or felt as a child. The unconscious is the realm of thoughts and feelings that motivates a person even though he or she is totally unaware of them. This realm includes most defense mechanisms (see discussion to follow) and some instinctual drives or motivations. According to Freud's theories, the person represses the memory of traumatic events that are too painful to remember into the unconscious.</p>
                        <p>Freud believed that much of what we do and say is motivated by our subconscious thoughts or feelings (those in the preconscious or unconscious level of awareness). A Freudian slip is a term we commonly use to describe slips of the tongue—for example, saying "You look portly today" to an overweight friend instead of "You look pretty today." Freud believed that these slips are not accidents or coincidences, but rather are indications of subconscious feelings or thoughts that accidentally emerge in casual day-to-day conversation.</p>

                        <p><strong>Freud's Dream Analysis.</strong> Freud believed that a person's dreams reflect his or her subconscious and have significant meaning, though sometimes the meaning is hidden or symbolic. Dream analysis, a primary technique used in psychoanalysis, involves discussing a client's dreams to discover their true meaning and significance. For example, a client might report having recurrent frightening dreams about snakes chasing her. Freud's interpretation might be that the woman fears intimacy with men; he would view the snake as a phallic symbol, representing the penis.</p>
                        <p>Another method used to gain access to subconscious thoughts and feelings is free association, in which the therapist tries to uncover the client's true thoughts and feelings by saying a word and asking the client to respond quickly with the first thing that comes to mind. Freud believed that such quick responses would be likely to uncover subconscious or repressed thoughts or feelings.</p>

                        <p><strong>Ego Defense Mechanisms.</strong> Freud believed that the self, or ego, uses ego defense mechanisms, which are methods of attempting to protect the self and cope with basic drives or emotionally painful thoughts, feelings, or events. Defense mechanisms are explained in Table 3.1. For example, a person who has been diagnosed with cancer and told he has 6 months to live but refuses to talk about his illness is using the defense mechanism of denial, or refusal to accept the reality of the situation. If a person dying of cancer exhibits continuously cheerful behavior, he could be using the defense mechanism of reaction formation to protect his emotions. Most defense mechanisms operate at the unconscious level of awareness, so people are not aware of what they are doing and often need help to see the reality.</p>

                        <p><strong>Five Stages of Psychosexual Development.</strong> Freud based his theory of childhood development on the belief that sexual energy, termed libido, was the driving force of human behavior. He proposed that children progress through five stages of psychosexual development: oral (birth to 18 months), anal (18-36 months), phallic/oedipal (3-5 years), latency (5-11 years or 13 years), and genital (11-13 years). Table 3.2 describes these stages and the accompanying developmental tasks. Psychopathology results when a person has difficulty making the transition from one stage to the next or when a person remains stalled at a particular stage or regresses to an earlier stage. Freud's open discussion of sexual impulses, particularly in children, was considered shocking for his time (Freud, 1923, 1962).</p>

                        <p><strong>Transference and Countertransference.</strong> Freud developed the concepts of transference and countertransference. Transference occurs when the client displaces onto the therapist attitudes and feelings that the client originally experienced in other relationships (Freud, 1923, 1962). Transference patterns are automatic and unconscious in the therapeutic relationship. For example, an adolescent female client working with a nurse who is about the same age as the teen's parents might react to the nurse like she reacts to her parents. She might experience intense feelings of rebellion or make sarcastic remarks; these reactions are actually based on her experiences with her parents, not with the nurse.</p>
                        <p>Countertransference occurs when the therapist displaces onto the client attitudes or feelings from his or her past. For example, a female nurse who has teenage children and who is experiencing extreme frustration with an adolescent client may respond by adopting a parental or chastising tone. The nurse is countertransferring her own attitudes and feelings toward her children onto the client. Nurses can deal with countertransference by examining their own feelings and responses, using self-awareness, and talking with colleagues.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Current Psychoanalytic Practice</h4>
                        <p>Psychoanalysis focuses on discovering the causes of the client’s unconscious and repressed thoughts, feelings, and conflicts believed to cause anxiety and on helping the client gain insight into and resolve these conflicts and anxieties. The analytic therapist uses the techniques of free association, dream analysis, and interpretation of behavior.</p>
                        <p>Psychoanalysis is still practiced today but on a limited basis. Analysis is lengthy, with weekly or more frequent sessions for several years. It is costly and not covered by conventional health insurance programs; thus, it has become known as “therapy for the wealthy.”</p>

                        <p>Erik Erikson (1902–1994) was a German-born psychoanalyst, who extended Freud’s work on personality development across the life span while focusing on social and psychological development in the life stages. In 1950, Erikson published <em>Childhood and Society</em>, in which he described eight psychosocial stages of development. In each stage, the person must complete a life task that is essential to his or her well-being and mental health. These tasks allow the person to achieve life’s virtues: hope, purpose, fidelity, love, caring, and wisdom (Erikson, 1963). The stages, life tasks, and virtues are described in Table 3.3.</p>

                        <p>Erikson’s eight psychosocial stages of development are still used in a variety of disciplines. In his view, psychosocial growth occurs in sequential phases and each stage is dependent on completion of the previous stage and life task. For example, in the infant stage (birth to 18 months), trust versus mistrust, the infant must learn to develop basic trust (the positive outcome) such as that he or she will be fed and taken care of. The formation of trust is essential; mistrust, the negative outcome of this stage, will impair the person’s development throughout his or her life.</p>

                        <h4>Jean Piaget and Cognitive Stages of Development</h4>
                        <p>Jean Piaget (1896–1980) explored how intelligence and cognitive functioning develop in children. He believed that human intelligence progresses through a series of stages based on age, with the child at each successive stage demonstrating a higher level of functioning than at previous stages. In his schema, Piaget strongly believed that biologic changes and maturation were responsible for cognitive development.</p>
                        <p>Piaget’s four stages of cognitive development are as follows:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                            <li>Sensorimotor—birth to 2 years: The child develops a sense of self as separate from the environment and the concept of object permanence, that is, tangible objects do not cease to exist just because they are out of sight. He or she begins to form mental images.</li>
                            <li>Preoperational—2 to 6 years: The child develops the ability to express self with language, understands the meaning of symbolic gestures, and begins to classify objects.</li>
                            <li>Concrete operations—6 to 12 years: The child begins to apply logic to thinking, understands spatiality and reversibility, and is increasingly social and able to apply rules; however, thinking is still concrete.</li>
                            <li>Formal operations—12 to 15 years and beyond: The child learns to think and reason in abstract terms, further develops logical thinking and reasoning, and achieves cognitive maturity.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Piaget's theory suggests that individuals reach cognitive maturity by middle to late adolescence. Some critics of Piaget believe that cognitive development is less rigid and more individualized than his theory suggests. Piaget's theory is useful when working with children. The nurse may better understand what the child means if the nurse is aware of his or her level of cognitive development. Also, teaching for children is often structured with their cognitive development in mind.</p>

                        <h3>Interpersonal Theories</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Harry Stack Sullivan: Interpersonal Relationships and Milieu Therapy</h4>
                        <p>Harry Stack Sullivan (1892–1949) was an American psychiatrist who extended the theory of personality development to include the significance of interpersonal relationships. Sullivan believed that one's personality involves more than individual characteristics, particularly how one interacts with others. He thought that inadequate or nonsatisfying relationships produce anxiety, which he saw as the basis for all emotional problems (Sullivan, 1953). The importance and significance of interpersonal relationships in one's life is probably Sullivan's greatest contribution to the field of mental health.</p>
                        <p><strong>Five Life Stages.</strong> Sullivan established five life stages of development—infancy, childhood, juvenile, preadolescence, and adolescence, each focusing on various interpersonal relationships (Table 3.4). He also described three developmental cognitive modes of experience and believed that mental disorders are related to the persistence of one of the early modes. The prototaxic mode, characteristic of infancy and childhood, involves brief, unconnected experiences that have no relationship to one another. Adults with schizophrenia exhibit persistent prototaxic experiences. The parataxic mode begins in early childhood as the child begins to connect experiences in sequence. The child may not make logical sense of the experiences and may see them as coincidence or chance events. The child seeks to relieve anxiety by repeating familiar experiences, though he or she may not understand what he or she is doing. Sullivan explained paranoid ideas and slips of the tongue as a person operating in the parataxic mode. In the syntaxic mode, which begins to appear in school-aged children and becomes more predominant in preadolescence, the person begins to perceive him or herself and the world within the context of the environment and can analyze experiences in a variety of settings. Maturity may be defined as predominance of the syntaxic mode (Sullivan, 1953).</p>

                        <p><strong>Therapeutic Community or Milieu.</strong> Sullivan envisioned the goal of treatment as the establishment of satisfying interpersonal relationships. The therapist provides a corrective interpersonal relationship for the client. Sullivan coined the term <strong>participant observer</strong> for the therapist's role, meaning that the therapist both participates in and observes the progress of the relationship.</p>
                        <p>Sullivan is also credited with developing the first <strong>therapeutic community or milieu</strong> with young men with schizophrenia in 1929 (although the term <strong>therapeutic community</strong> was not used extensively until Maxwell Jones published <em>The Therapeutic Community</em> in 1953). In the concept of therapeutic community or milieu, the interaction among clients is seen as beneficial, and treatment emphasizes the role of this client-to-client interaction. Until this time, it was believed that the interaction between the client and the psychiatrist was the one essential component to the client's treatment. Sullivan and later Jones observed that interactions among clients in a safe, therapeutic setting provided great benefits to clients. The concept of <strong>milieu therapy</strong>, originally developed by Sullivan, involved clients' interactions with one another, including practicing interpersonal relationship skills, giving one another feedback about behavior, and working cooperatively as a group to solve day-to-day problems.</p>
                        <p>Milieu therapy was one of the primary modes of treatment in the acute hospital setting. In today's health care environment, however, inpatient hospital stays are often too short for clients to develop meaningful relationships with one another. Therefore, the concept of milieu therapy receives little attention. Management of the milieu, or environment, is still a primary role for the nurse in terms of providing safety and protection for all clients and promoting social interaction.</p>

                        <h4>Hildegard Peplau: Therapeutic Nurse–Patient Relationships</h4>
                        <p>Hildegard Peplau (1909-1999; Fig. 3.2) was a nursing theorist and clinician who built on Sullivan's interpersonal theories and also saw the role of the nurse as a participant observer. Peplau developed the concept of the therapeutic nurse-patient relationship, which includes four phases: orientation, identification, exploitation, and resolution (Table 3.5).</p>

                            <li>In the exploitation phase, the client makes full use of the services offered.</li>
                            <li>In the resolution phase, the client no longer needs professional services and gives up dependent behavior. The relationship ends.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Peplau’s concept of the nurse–client relationship, with tasks and behaviors characteristic of each stage, has been modified but remains in use today (see Chapter 5).</p>

                        <p><strong>Roles of the Nurses in the Therapeutic Relationship.</strong> Peplau also wrote about the roles of the nurses in the therapeutic relationship and how these roles help meet the client’s needs. The primary roles she identified are as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Stranger—offering the client the same acceptance and courtesy that the nurse would to any stranger</li>
                            <li>Resource person—providing specific answers to questions within a larger context</li>
                            <li>Teacher—helping the client learn either formally or informally</li>
                            <li>Leader—offering direction to the client or group</li>
                            <li>Surrogate—serving as a substitute for another, such as a parent or sibling</li>
                            <li>Counselor—promoting experiences leading to health for the client, such as expression of feelings</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Peplau also believed that the nurse could take on many other roles, including consultant, tutor, safety agent, mediator, administrator, observer, and researcher. These were not defined in detail but were "left to the intelligence and imagination of the readers" (Peplau, 1952, p. 70).</p>

                        <p><strong>Four Levels of Anxiety.</strong> Peplau defined anxiety as the initial response to a psychic threat. She described four levels of anxiety: mild, moderate, severe, and panic (Table 3.6). These serve as the foundation for working with clients with anxiety in a variety of contexts (see Chapter 13).</p>

                        <h3>Humanistic Theories</h3>
                        <p>Humanism represents a significant shift away from the psychoanalytic view of the individual as a neurotic, impulse-driven person with repressed psychic problems and away from the focus on and examination of the client's past experiences. Humanism focuses on a person's positive qualities, his or her capacity to change (human potential), and the promotion of self-esteem. Humanists do consider the person's past experiences, but they direct more attention toward the present and future.</p>

                        <h4>Abraham Maslow: Hierarchy of Needs</h4>
                        <p>Abraham Maslow (1921–1970) was an American psychologist who studied the needs or motivations of the individual. He differed from previous theorists in that he focused on the total person, not just on one facet of the person, and emphasized health instead of simply illness and problems. Maslow (1954) formulated the hierarchy of needs, in which he used a pyramid to arrange and illustrate the basic drives or needs that motivate people. The most basic needs—the physiologic needs of food, water, sleep, shelter, sexual expression, and freedom from pain—must be met first. The second level involves safety and security needs, which include protection, security, and freedom from harm or threatened deprivation. The third level is love and belonging needs, which include enduring intimacy, friendship, and acceptance. The fourth level involves esteem needs, which include the need for self-respect and esteem from others. The highest level is self-actualization, the need for beauty, truth, and justice.</p>
                        <p>Maslow hypothesized that the basic needs at the bottom of the pyramid would dominate the person's behavior until those needs were met, at which time the next level of needs would become dominant. For example, if needs for food and shelter are not met, they become the overriding concern in life; the hungry person risks danger and social ostracism to find food.</p>
                        <p>Maslow used the term <strong>self-actualization</strong> to describe a person who has achieved all the needs of the hierarchy and has developed his or her fullest potential in life. Few people ever become fully self-actualized.</p>

                        <p>Maslow's theory explains individual differences in terms of a person's motivation, which is not necessarily stable throughout life. Traumatic life circumstances or compromised health can cause a person to regress to a lower level of motivation. For example, if a 35-year-old woman who is functioning at the "love and belonging" level discovers she has cancer, she may regress to the "safety" level to undergo treatment for the cancer and preserve her own health. This theory helps nurses understand how clients' motivations and behaviors change during life crises (see Chapter 7).</p>

                        <h4>Carl Rogers: Client-Centered Therapy</h4>
                        <p>Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was a humanistic American psychologist who focused on the therapeutic relationship and developed a new method of client-centered therapy. Rogers was one of the first to use the term client rather than patient. Client-centered therapy focuses on the role of the client, rather than the therapist, as the key to the healing process. Rogers believed that each person experiences the world differently and knows his or her own experience best (Rogers, 1961). According to Rogers, clients do "the work of healing," and within a supportive and nurturing client–therapist relationship, clients can cure themselves. Clients are in the best position to know their own experiences and make sense of them, to regain their self-esteem, and to progress toward self-actualization.</p>
                        <p>The therapist takes a person-centered approach, a supportive role, rather than a directive or expert role, because Rogers viewed the client as the expert on his or her life. The therapist must promote the client's self-esteem as much as possible through three central concepts:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Unconditional positive regard—a nonjudgmental caring for the client that is not dependent on the client's behavior</li>
                            <li>Genuineness—realness or congruence between what the therapist feels and what he or she says to the client</li>
                            <li>Empathetic understanding—in which the therapist senses the feelings and personal meaning from the client and communicates this understanding to the client</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Unconditional positive regard promotes the client's self-esteem and decreases his or her need for defensive behavior. As the client's self-acceptance grows, the natural self-actualization process can continue.</p>
                        <p>Rogers also believed that the basic nature of humans is to become self-actualized, or to move toward self-improvement and constructive change. We are all born with a positive self-regard and a natural inclination to become self-actualized. If relationships with others are supportive and nurturing, the person retains feelings of self-worth and progresses toward self-actualization, which is healthy. If the person encounters repeated conflicts with others or is in nonsupportive relationships, he or she loses self-esteem, becomes defensive, and is no longer inclined toward self-actualization; this is not healthy.</p>

                        <h3>Behavioral Theories</h3>
                        <p>Behaviorism grew out of a reaction to introspection models that focused on the contents and operations of the mind. Behaviorism is a school of psychology that focuses on observable behaviors and what one can do externally to bring about behavior changes. It does not attempt to explain how the mind works.</p>
                        <p>Behaviorists believe that behavior can be changed through a system of rewards and punishments. For adults, receiving a regular paycheck is a constant positive reinforcer that motivates people to continue to go to work every day and to try to do a good job. It helps motivate positive behavior in the workplace. If someone stops receiving a paycheck, he or she is most likely to stop working. If a motorist consistently speeds (negative behavior) and does not get caught, he or she is likely to continue to speed. If the driver receives a speeding ticket (a negative reinforcer), he or she is likely to slow down. However, if the motorist does not get caught for speeding for the next 4 weeks (negative reinforcer is removed), he or she is likely to resume speeding.</p>

                        <h4>Ivan Pavlov: Classical Conditioning</h4>
                        <p>Laboratory experiments with dogs provided the basis for the development of Ivan Pavlov's theory of classical conditioning: Behavior can be changed through conditioning with external or environmental conditions or stimuli. Pavlov's experiment with dogs involved his observation that dogs naturally began to salivate (response) when they saw or smelled food (stimulus). Pavlov (1849–1936) set out to change this salivating response or behavior through conditioning. He would ring a bell (new stimulus), then produce the food, and the dogs would salivate (the desired response). Pavlov repeated this ringing of the bell along with the presentation of food many times. Eventually, he could ring the bell, and the dogs would salivate without seeing or smelling food. The dogs had been "conditioned," or had learned a new response, to salivate when they heard the bell. Their behavior had been modified through classical conditioning, or a conditioned response.</p>

                        <h4>B.F. Skinner: Operant Conditioning</h4>
                        <p>One of the most influential behaviorists was B.F. Skinner (1904–1990), an American psychologist. He developed the theory of <strong>operant conditioning</strong>, which says people learn their behaviors from their history or past experiences, particularly those experiences that were repeatedly reinforced. Although some criticize his theories for not considering the role that thoughts, feelings, or needs play in motivating behavior, his work has provided several important principles still used today. Skinner did not deny the existence of feelings and needs in motivation; however, he viewed behavior as only that which could be observed, studied, and learned or unlearned. He maintained that if the behavior could be changed, then so could the accompanying thoughts or feelings. Changing the behavior was what was important.</p>
                        <p>The following principles of operant conditioning described by Skinner (1974) form the basis for behavior techniques in use today:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>All behavior is learned.</li>
                            <li>Consequences result from behavior—broadly speaking, reward and punishment.</li>
                            <li>Behavior that is rewarded with reinforcers tends to recur.</li>
                            <li>Positive reinforcers that follow a behavior increase the likelihood that the behavior will recur.</li>
                            <li>Negative reinforcers that are removed after a behavior increase the likelihood that the behavior will recur.</li>
                            <li>Continuous reinforcement (a reward every time the behavior occurs) is the fastest way to increase that behavior, but the behavior will not last long after the reward ceases.</li>
                            <li>Random intermittent reinforcement (an occasional reward for the desired behavior) is slower to produce an increase in behavior, but the behavior continues after the reward ceases.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These behavioral principles of rewarding or reinforcing behaviors are used to help people change their behaviors in a therapy known as <strong>behavior modification</strong>, which is a method of attempting to strengthen a desired behavior or response by reinforcement, either positive or negative. For example, if the desired behavior is assertiveness, whenever the client uses assertiveness skills in a communication group, the group leader provides <strong>positive reinforcement</strong> by giving the client attention and positive feedback.</p>
                        <p>Negative reinforcement involves removing a stimulus immediately after a behavior occurs so that the behavior is more likely to occur again. For example, if a client becomes anxious when waiting to talk in a group, he or she may volunteer to speak first to avoid the anxiety.</p>
                        <p>In a group home setting, operant principles may come into play in a token economy, a way to involve residents in performing activities of daily living. A chart of desired behaviors, such as getting up on time, taking a shower, and getting dressed, is kept for each resident. Each day the chart is marked when the desired behavior occurs. At the end of the day or the week, the resident gets a reward or token for each time each of the desired behaviors occurred. The resident can redeem the tokens for items such as snacks, TV time, or a relaxed curfew.</p>
                        <p>Conditioned responses, such as fears or phobias, can be treated with behavioral techniques. Systematic desensitization can be used to help clients overcome irrational fears and anxiety associated with phobias. The client is asked to make a list of situations involving the phobic object, from the least to the most anxiety-provoking. The client learns and practices relaxation techniques to decrease and manage anxiety. He or she is then exposed to the least anxiety-provoking situation and uses the relaxation techniques to manage the resulting anxiety. The client is gradually exposed to more and more anxiety-provoking situations until he or she can manage the most anxiety-provoking situation.</p>
                        <p>Behavioral techniques can be used for a variety of problems. In the treatment of anorexia nervosa, the goal is weight gain. A behavioral contract between the client and the therapist or physician is initiated when treatment begins. Initially, the client has little unsupervised time and is restricted to the hospital unit. The contract may specify that if the client gains a certain amount of weight, such as <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0.2</mn><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">k</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">g</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">y</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0.2\mathrm{kg/day}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: -0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">0.2</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm" style="margin-right: 0.01389em;">kg/day</span></span></span></span></span></span>, in return, he or she will get increased unsupervised time or time off the unit as long as the weight gain progresses. When working with children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, goals include task completion for homework, hygiene tasks, turn-taking when talking, and so forth. The child is given a "star" or sticker when tasks are completed. Upon reaching a specified numbers of stars, the child receives a reward.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Concept Mastery Alert: Behavioral Therapy</h4>
                            <p>Behavioral theory considers how reinforcement influences behavior. Through reinforcement, a person learns to perform a certain response (behavior) either to receive a reward or to avoid a punishment.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Existential Theories</h3>
                        <p>Existential theorists believe that behavioral deviations result when a person is out of touch with him or herself or the environment. The person who is self-alienated is lonely and sad and feels helpless. Lack of self-awareness, coupled with harsh self-criticism, prevents the person from participating in satisfying relationships. The person is not free to choose from all possible alternatives because of self-imposed restrictions. Existential theorists believe that the person is avoiding personal responsibility and is giving in to the wishes or demands of others.</p>
                        <p>All existential therapies have the goal of helping the person discover an authentic sense of self. They emphasize personal responsibility for oneself, feelings, behaviors, and choices. These therapies encourage the person to live fully in the present and to look forward to the future. Carl Rogers is sometimes grouped with existential therapists. Table 3.7 summarizes existential therapies.</p>

                        <h4>Cognitive Therapy</h4>
                        <p>Many existential therapists use cognitive therapy, which focuses on immediate thought processing—how a person perceives or interprets his or her experience and determines how he or she feels and behaves. For example, if a person interprets a situation as dangerous, he or she experiences anxiety and tries to escape. Basic emotions of sadness, elation, anxiety, and anger are reactions to perceptions of loss, gain, danger, and wrongdoing by others (Beck, 1976). Aaron Beck is credited with pioneering cognitive therapy in persons with depression.</p>

                        <h4>Rational Emotive Therapy</h4>
                        <p>Albert Ellis, founder of rational emotive therapy, identified 11 “irrational beliefs” that people use to make themselves unhappy. An example of an irrational belief is, “If I love someone, he or she must love me back just as much.” Ellis claimed that continuing to believe this patently untrue statement will make the person utterly unhappy, but he or she will blame it on the person who does not return his or her love. Ellis also believes that people have “automatic thoughts” that cause them unhappiness in certain situations. He used the ABC technique to help people identify these automatic thoughts: A is the activating stimulus or event, C is the excessive inappropriate response, and B is the blank in the person’s mind that he or she must fill in by identifying the automatic thought.</p>

                        <h4>Viktor Frankl and Logotherapy</h4>
                        <p>Viktor Frankl based his beliefs in his observations of people in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. His curiosity about why some survived and others did not led him to conclude that survivors were able to find meaning in their lives even under miserable conditions. Hence, the search for meaning (logos) is the central theme in logotherapy. Counselors and therapists who work with clients in spirituality and grief counseling often use the concepts that Frankl developed.</p>

                        <h4>Gestalt Therapy</h4>
                        <p>Gestalt therapy, founded by Frederick “Fritz” Perls, emphasizes identifying the person’s feelings and thoughts in the here and now. Perls believed that self-awareness leads to self-acceptance and responsibility for one’s own thoughts and feelings. Therapists often use gestalt therapy to increase clients’ self-awareness by having them write and read letters, keep journals, and perform other activities designed to put the past to rest and focus on the present.</p>

                        <h4>Reality Therapy</h4>
                        <p>William Glasser devised an approach called reality therapy that focuses on the person's behavior and how that behavior keeps him or her from achieving life goals. He developed this approach while working with persons with delinquent behavior, unsuccessful school performance, and emotional problems. He believed that persons who were unsuccessful often blamed their problems on other people, the system, or the society. He believed they needed to find their own identities through responsible behavior. Reality therapy challenges clients to examine the ways in which their own behavior thwarts their attempts to achieve life goals.</p>

                        <h3>Crisis Intervention</h3>
                        <p>A crisis is a turning point in an individual's life that produces an overwhelming emotional response. Individuals experience a crisis when they confront some life circumstance or stressor that they cannot effectively manage through use of their customary coping skills. Caplan (1964) identified the stages of crisis: (1) the person is exposed to a stressor, experiences anxiety, and tries to cope in a customary manner; (2) anxiety increases when customary coping skills are ineffective; (3) the person makes all possible efforts to deal with the stressor, including attempts at new methods of coping; and (4) when coping attempts fail, the person experiences disequilibrium and significant distress.</p>
                        <p>Crises occur in response to a variety of life situations and events and fall into three categories:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Maturational crises, sometimes called developmental crises, are predictable events in the normal course of life, such as leaving home for the first time, getting married, having a baby, and beginning a career.</li>
                            <li>Situational crises are unanticipated or sudden events that threaten the individual's integrity, such as the death of a loved one, loss of a job, and physical or emotional illness in the individual or family member.</li>
                            <li>Adventitious crises, sometimes called social crises, include natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, or hurricanes; war; terrorist attacks; riots; and violent crimes such as rape or murder.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note that not all events that result in crisis are "negative" in nature. Events like marriage, retirement, and childbirth are often desirable for the individual but may still present overwhelming challenges. Aguilera (1998) identified three factors that influence whether or not an individual experiences a crisis: the individual’s perception of the event, the availability of emotional supports, and the availability of adequate coping mechanisms. When the person in crisis seeks assistance, these three factors represent a guide for effective intervention. The person can be assisted to view the event or issue from a different perspective, for example, as an opportunity for growth or change rather than as a threat. Assisting the person in using existing supports, or helping the individual find new sources of support, can decrease the feelings of being alone or overwhelmed. Finally, assisting the person in learning new methods of coping will help resolve the current crisis and give him or her new coping skills to use in the future.</p>
                        <p>Crisis is described as self-limiting; that is, the crisis does not last indefinitely but usually exists for 4 to 6 weeks. At the end of that time, the crisis is resolved in one of three ways. In the first two, the person either returns to his or her precrisis level of functioning or begins to function at a higher level; both are positive outcomes for the individual. The third resolution is that the person’s functioning stabilizes at a level lower than precrisis functioning, which is a negative outcome for the individual. Positive outcomes are more likely when the problem (crisis response and precipitating event or issue) is clearly and thoroughly defined. Likewise, early intervention is associated with better outcomes.</p>
                        <p>Persons experiencing a crisis are usually distressed and likely to seek help for their distress. They are ready to learn and even eager to try new coping skills as a way to relieve their distress. This is an ideal time for intervention that is likely to be successful. Crisis intervention includes a variety of techniques based on the assessment of the individual. Directive interventions are designed to assess the person’s health status and promote problem-solving, such as offering the person new information, knowledge, or meaning; raising the person’s self-awareness by providing feedback about behavior; and directing the person’s behavior by offering suggestions or courses of action. Supportive interventions aim at dealing with the person’s needs for empathetic understanding, such as encouraging the person to identify and discuss feelings, serving as a sounding board for the person, and affirming the person’s self-worth. Techniques and strategies that include a balance of these different types of intervention are the most effective.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Cultural Considerations</h4>
                            <p>The major psychosocial theorists were white and born in Europe or the United States, as were many of the people whom they treated. What they considered normal or typical may not apply equally well to people with different racial, ethnic, or cultural backgrounds. For example, Erikson's developmental stages focus on autonomy and independence for toddlers, but this focus may not be appropriate for people from other cultures in which early individual independence is not a developmental milestone. Therefore, it is important that the nurse avoids reaching faulty conclusions when working with clients and families from other cultures. Chapter 7 discusses cultural factors in depth.</p>

                        <h3>Benefits of Community Mental Health Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Recent changes in health care and reimbursement have affected mental health treatment because they have all areas of medicine, nursing, and related health disciplines (see Chapter 4). Inpatient treatment is often the last, rather than the first, mode of treatment for mental illness. Current treatment reflects the belief that it is more beneficial and certainly more cost-effective for clients to remain in the community and receive outpatient treatment whenever possible. The client can often continue to work and can stay connected to family, friends, and other support systems while participating in therapy. Outpatient therapy also takes into account that a person's personality or behavior patterns, such as coping skills, styles of communication, and level of self-esteem, gradually develop over the course of a lifetime and cannot be changed in a relatively short inpatient course of treatment. Hospital admission is indicated when the person is severely depressed and suicidal, severely psychotic, experiencing alcohol or drug withdrawal, or exhibiting behaviors that require close supervision in a safe, supportive environment. This section briefly describes the treatment modalities currently used in both inpatient and outpatient settings.</p>

                        <h3>Individual Psychotherapy</h3>
                        <p>Individual psychotherapy is a method of bringing about change in a person by exploring his or her feelings, attitudes, thinking, and behavior. It involves a one-to-one relationship between the therapist and the client. People generally seek this kind of therapy based on their desire to understand themselves and their behavior, to make personal changes, to improve interpersonal relationships, or to get relief from emotional pain or unhappiness. The relationship between the client and the therapist proceeds through stages similar to those of the nurse-client relationship: introduction, working, and termination. Cost-containment measures mandated by health maintenance organizations and other insurers may necessitate moving into the working phase rapidly so that the client can get the maximum benefit possible from therapy.</p>
                        <p>The therapist-client relationship is key to the success of this type of therapy. Both the client and the therapist must be compatible for therapy to be effective. Therapists vary in their formal credentials, experience, and model of practice. Selecting a therapist is extremely important in terms of successful outcomes for the client. The client must select a therapist whose theoretical beliefs and style of therapy are congruent with the client's needs and expectations of therapy. The client may also have to try different therapists to find a good match.</p>
                        <p>A therapist's theoretical beliefs strongly influence his or her style of therapy (discussed earlier in this chapter). For example, a therapist grounded in interpersonal theory emphasizes relationships, while an existential therapist focuses on the client's self-responsibility.</p>
                        <p>The nurse or other health care provider who is familiar with the client may be in a position to recommend a therapist or a choice of therapists. He or she may also help the client understand what different therapists have to offer.</p>
                        <p>The client should select a therapist carefully and ask about the therapist's treatment approach and area of specialization. State laws regulate the practice and licensing of therapists; thus, from state to state, the qualifications to practice psychotherapy, the requirements for licensure, or even the need for a license can vary. A few therapists have little or no formal education, credentials, or experience but still practice entirely within the legal limits of their states. A client can verify a therapist's legal credentials with the state licensing board; state government listings are in the local phone book. The Better Business Bureau can inform consumers if a particular therapist has been reported to them for investigation. Calling the local mental health services agency or contacting the primary care provider is another way for a client to check a therapist's credentials and ethical practices.</p>

                        <h3>Groups</h3>
                        <p>A group is a number of persons who gather in a face-to-face setting to accomplish tasks that require cooperation, collaboration, or working together. Each person in a group is in a position to influence and to be influenced by other group members. Group content refers to what is said in the context of the group, including educational material, feelings and emotions, or discussions of the project to be completed. Group process refers to the behavior of the group and its individual members, including seating arrangements, tone of voice, who speaks to whom, who is quiet, and so forth. Content and process occur continuously throughout the life of the group.</p>

                        <h3>Stages of Group Development</h3>
                        <p>A group may be established to serve a particular purpose in a specified period such as a work group to complete an assigned project or a therapy group that meets with the same members to explore ways to deal with depression. These groups develop in observable stages. In the pregroup stages, members are selected, the purpose or work of the group is identified, and group structure is addressed. Group structure includes where and how often the group will meet, identification of a group leader, and the rules of the group—for example, whether individuals can join the group after it begins, how to handle absences, and expectations for group members.</p>
                        <p>The beginning stage of group development, or the initial stage, commences as soon as the group begins to meet. Members introduce themselves, a leader can be selected (if not done previously), the group purpose is discussed, and rules and expectations for group participation are reviewed. Group members begin to "check out" one another and the leader as they determine their levels of comfort in the group setting.</p>
                        <p>The working stage of group development begins as members begin to focus their attention on the purpose or task the group is trying to accomplish. This may happen relatively quickly in a work group with a specific assigned project but may take two or three sessions in a therapy group because members must develop some level of trust before sharing personal feelings or difficult situations. During this phase, several group characteristics may be seen. Group cohesiveness is the degree to which members work together cooperatively to accomplish the purpose. Cohesiveness is a desirable group characteristic and is associated with positive group outcomes. It is evidenced when members value one another's contributions to the group; members think of themselves as "we" and share responsibility for the work of the group. When a group is cohesive, members feel free to express all opinions, positive and negative, with little fear of rejection or retribution. If a group is "overly cohesive," in that uniformity and agreement become the group's implicit goals, there may be a negative effect on the group outcome. In a therapy group, members do not give one another needed feedback if the group is overly cohesive. In a work group, critical thinking and creative problem-solving are unlikely, which may make the work of the group less meaningful.</p>
                        <p>Some groups exhibit competition, or rivalry, among group members. This may positively affect the outcome of the group if the competition leads to compromise, improved group performance, and growth for individual members. Many times, however, competition can be destructive for the group; when conflicts are not resolved, members become hostile, or the group's energy is diverted from accomplishing its purpose to bickering and power struggles.</p>
                        <p>The final stage, or termination, of the group occurs before the group disbands. The work of the group is reviewed, with the focus on group accomplishments or growth of group members or both, depending on the purpose of the group.</p>
                        <p>Observing the stages of group development in groups that are ongoing is difficult with members joining and leaving the group at various times. Rather, the group involvement of new members as they join the group evolves as they feel accepted by the group, take a more active role, and join in the work of the group. An example of this type of group would be Alcoholics Anonymous, a self-help group with stated purposes. Members may attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings as often or infrequently as they choose; group cohesiveness or competition can still be observed in ongoing groups.</p>

                        <h3>Group Leadership</h3>
                        <p>Groups often have an identified or formal leader—someone designated to lead the group. In therapy groups and education groups, a formal leader is usually identified based on his or her education, qualifications, and experience. Some work groups have formal leaders appointed in advance, while other work groups select a leader at the initial meeting. Support groups and self-help groups usually do not have identified formal leaders; all members are seen as equals. An informal leader may emerge from a "leaderless" group or from a group that has an identified formal leader. Informal leaders are generally members recognized by others as having the knowledge, experience, or characteristics that members admire and value.</p>
                        <p>Effective group leaders focus on group process as well as on group content. Tasks of the group leader include giving feedback and suggestions; encouraging participation from all members (eliciting responses from quiet members and placing limits on members who may monopolize the group's time); clarifying thoughts, feelings, and ideas; summarizing progress and accomplishments; and facilitating progress through the stages of group development.</p>

                        <h3>Group Roles</h3>
                        <p>Roles are the parts that members play within the group. Not all members are aware of their "role behavior," and changes in members' behavior may be a topic that the group will need to address. Some roles facilitate the work of the group, while others can negatively affect the process or outcome of the group. Growth-producing roles include the information seeker, opinion seeker, information giver, energizer, coordinator, harmonizer, encourager, and elaborator. Growth-inhibiting roles include the monopolizer, aggressor, dominator, critic, recognition seeker, and passive follower.</p>

                        <h3>Group Therapy</h3>
                        <p>In group therapy, clients participate in sessions with a group of people. The members share a common purpose and are expected to contribute to the group to benefit others and receive benefit from others in return. Group rules are established, which all members must observe. These rules vary according to the type of group. Being a member of a group allows the client to learn new ways of looking at a problem or ways of coping with or solving problems and also helps him or her learn important interpersonal skills. For example, by interacting with other members, clients often receive feedback on how others perceive and react to them and their behavior. This is extremely important information for many clients with mental disorders, who often have difficulty with interpersonal skills.</p>

                        <p>The therapeutic results of group therapy (Yalom &amp; Leszcz, 2005) include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Gaining new information, or learning</li>
                            <li>Gaining inspiration or hope</li>
                            <li>Interacting with others</li>
                            <li>Feeling acceptance and belonging</li>
                            <li>Becoming aware that one is not alone and that others share the same problems</li>
                            <li>Gaining insight into one's problems and behaviors and how they affect others</li>
                            <li>Giving of oneself for the benefit of others (altruism)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Therapy groups vary with different purposes, degrees of formality, and structures. Our discussion includes psychotherapy groups, family therapy, family education, education groups, support groups, and self-help groups.</p>
                        <p><strong>Psychotherapy Groups.</strong> The goal of a <strong>psychotherapy group</strong> is for members to learn about their behavior and to make positive changes in their behavior by interacting and communicating with others as a member of a group. Groups may be organized around a specific medical diagnosis, such as depression, or a particular issue, such as improving interpersonal skills or managing anxiety. Group techniques and processes are used to help group members learn about their behavior with other people and how it relates to core personality traits. Members also learn they have responsibilities to others and can help other members achieve their goals.</p>
                        <p>Psychotherapy groups are often formal in structure, with one or two therapists as the group leaders. One task of the group leader or the entire group is to establish the rules for the group. These rules deal with confidentiality, punctuality, attendance, and social contact between members outside group time.</p>
                        <p>There are two types of groups: open groups and closed groups. <strong>Open groups</strong> are ongoing and run indefinitely, allowing members to join or leave the group as they need to. <strong>Closed groups</strong> are structured to keep the same members in the group for a specified number of sessions. If the group is closed, the members decide how to handle members who wish to leave the group and the possible addition of new group members (Yalom &amp; Leszcz, 2005).</p>
                        <p><strong>Family Therapy.</strong> <strong>Family therapy</strong> is a form of group therapy in which the client and his or her family members participate. The goals include understanding how family dynamics contribute to the client's psychopathology, mobilizing the family's inherent strengths and functional resources, restructuring maladaptive family behavioral styles, and strengthening family problem-solving behaviors (Spitz &amp; Spitz, 2017). Family therapy can be used both to assess and to treat various psychiatric disorders. Although one family member is usually identified initially as the one who has problems and needs help, it often becomes evident through the therapeutic process that other family members also have emotional problems and difficulties.</p>
                        <p><strong>Family Education.</strong> The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) developed a unique 12-week Family-to-Family Education Course taught by trained family members. The curriculum focuses on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, clinical depression, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The course discusses the clinical treatment of these illnesses and teaches the knowledge and skills that family members need to cope more effectively. The specific features of this education program include emphasis on emotional understanding and healing in the personal realm and on power and action in the social realm. NAMI also conducts Provider Education Programs taught by two consumers, two family members, and a mental health professional who is also a family member or consumer. This course is designed to help providers realize the hardships that families and consumers endure and to appreciate the courage and persistence it takes to live with and recover from mental illness (National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, 2018).</p>
                        <p><strong>Education Groups.</strong> The goal of an education group is to provide information to members on a specific issue—for instance, stress management, medication management, or assertiveness training. The group leader has expertise in the subject area and may be a nurse, therapist, or other health professional. Education groups are usually scheduled for a specific number of sessions and retain the same members for the duration of the group. Typically, the leader presents the information and then members can ask questions or practice new techniques.</p>
                        <p>In a medication management group, the leader may discuss medication regimens and possible side effects, screen clients for side effects, and, in some instances, actually administer the medication (e.g., depot injections of haloperidol [Haldol] decanoate or fluphenazine [Prolixin] decanoate).</p>
                        <p><strong>Support Groups.</strong> Support groups are organized to help members who share a common problem cope with it. The group leader explores members' thoughts and feelings and creates an atmosphere of acceptance so that members feel comfortable expressing themselves. Support groups often provide a safe place for group members to express their feelings of frustration, boredom, or unhappiness and also to discuss common problems and potential solutions. Rules for support groups differ from those in psychotherapy in that members are allowed—in fact, encouraged—to contact one another and socialize outside the sessions. Confidentiality may be a rule for some groups; the members decide this. Support groups tend to be open groups in which members can join or leave as their needs dictate.</p>
                        <p>Common support groups include those for cancer or stroke victims, persons with AIDS, and family members of someone who has committed suicide. One national support group, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, is for family members of someone killed in a car accident caused by a drunk driver.</p>
                        <p><strong>Self-Help Groups.</strong> In a self-help group, members share a common experience, but the group is not a formal or structured therapy group. Although professionals organize some self-help groups, many are run by members and do not have a formally identified leader. Various self-help groups are available. Some are locally organized and announce their meetings in local newspapers. Others are nationally organized, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Parents Without Partners, Gamblers Anonymous, and Al-Anon (a group for spouses and partners of alcoholics), and have national headquarters and internet websites.</p>
                        <p>Most self-help groups have a rule of confidentiality; whomever is seen and whatever is said at the meetings cannot be divulged to others or discussed outside the group. In many 12-step programs, such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Gamblers Anonymous, people use only their first names so their identities are not divulged (although in some settings, group members do know one another’s names).</p>

                        <h3>Complementary and Alternative Therapies</h3>
                        <p>The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is a federal government agency for scientific research on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). This agency is part of the National Institutes of Health in the Department of Health and Human Services and was formerly called the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. <strong>Complementary medicine</strong> includes therapies <em>used with</em> conventional medicine practices (the medical model). <strong>Alternative medicine</strong> includes therapies <em>used in place of</em> conventional treatment. NCCIH conducts clinical research to help determine the safety and efficacy of these practices (National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, 2017). Studying the use of St. John’s wort to treat depression (instead of using antidepressant medication) would be an example of researching alternative medicine. Conducting research on the use of chiropractic massage and antidepressant medication to treat depression is an example of complementary medicine research. <strong>Integrative medicine</strong> combines conventional medical therapy and CAM therapies that have scientific evidence supporting their safety and effectiveness. Box 3.1 illustrates an example of a complementary modality for stress reduction to improve health.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Box 3.1 Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction</h4>
                            <p>Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is one type of complementary practice that has had positive results in a variety of settings. Originally funded for research by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), MBSR started in the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts in 1979. This approach has had positive results for clients with cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic low back pain, and many other conditions. In mental health, MBSR can be combined with cognitive therapy to help treat depression and is offered to caregivers to help deal with the caregiving burden (Nathan et al., 2017). Lastly, MBSR is available as an online course, making it available to people who cannot attend in person or in their local area.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>NCCIH studies a wide variety of complementary and alternative therapies:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Alternative medical systems include homeopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine in Western cultures, and traditional Chinese medicine, which includes herbal and nutritional therapy, restorative physical exercises (yoga and tai chi), meditation, acupuncture, and remedial massage.</li>
                            <li>Mind-body interventions include meditation, prayer, mental healing, and creative therapies that use art, music, or dance.</li>
                            <li>Biologically based therapies use substances found in nature, such as herbs, food, and vitamins. Dietary supplements, herbal products, medicinal teas, aromatherapy, and a variety of diets are included.</li>
                            <li>Manipulative and body-based therapies are based on manipulation or movement of one or more parts of the body, such as therapeutic massage and chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation.</li>
                            <li>Energy therapies include two types of therapy: biofield therapies, intended to affect energy fields that are believed to surround and penetrate the body, such as therapeutic touch, qi gong, and Reiki, and bioelectric-based therapies involving the unconventional use of electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields, magnetic fields, and alternating current or direct current fields. Qi gong is part of Chinese medicine that combines movement, meditation, and regulated breathing to enhance the flow of vital energy and promote healing. Reiki (which in Japanese means “universal life energy”) is based on the belief that when spiritual energy is channeled through a Reiki practitioner, the patient’s spirit and body are healed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Clients may be reluctant to tell the psychiatrist or primary care provider about the use of CAM. Therefore, it is important that the nurse ask clients specifically about use of herbs, vitamins, or other health practices in a nonjudgmental way.</p>

                        <h3>Psychiatric Rehabilitation</h3>
                        <p>Psychiatric rehabilitation involves providing services to people with severe and persistent mental illness to help them to live in the community. These programs are often called community support services or community support programs. Psychiatric rehabilitation focuses on the client’s strengths, not just on his or her illness. The client actively participates in program planning. The programs are designed to help the client manage the illness and symptoms, gain access to needed services, and live successfully in the community.</p>
                        <p>These programs assist clients with activities of daily living, such as transportation, shopping, food preparation, money management, and hygiene. Social support and interpersonal relationships are recognized as a primary need for successful community living. Psychiatric rehabilitation programs provide opportunities for socialization, such as drop-in centers and places where clients can go to be with others in a safe, supportive environment. Vocational referral, training, job coaching, and support are available for clients who want to seek and maintain employment. Community support programs also provide education about the client’s illness and treatment and help the client obtain health care when needed.</p>
                        <p>It is important to include the client in an active role in identifying rehabilitation goals. There is often a disparity between what health care professionals view as the client’s needs and what the client perceives as valuable. Offering services that meet each client’s most important goals can significantly improve his or her quality of life and promote recovery and well-being. Counseling, advocacy, and mentoring by peers are becoming more common in community mental health service programs with positive results (Scanlon, Hancock, &amp; Honey, 2017). Consumer-run mental health programs are less common, but their numbers are on the rise. See Chapter 4 for discussion of recovery.</p>

                        <h3>The Nurse and Psychosocial Interventions</h3>
                        <p>Intervention is a crucial component of the nursing process. <strong>Psychosocial interventions</strong> are nursing activities that enhance the client’s social and psychological functioning and improve social skills, interpersonal relationships, and communication. Nurses often use psychosocial interventions to help meet clients’ needs and achieve outcomes in all practice settings, not just mental health. For example, a medical-surgical nurse might need to use interventions that incorporate behavioral principles such as setting limits with manipulative behavior or giving positive feedback.</p>
                        <p>For example, a client with diabetes tells the nurse,</p>
                        <p>“I promise to have just one bite of cake. Please! It’s my grandson’s birthday cake.” (manipulative behavior)</p>
                        <p>The nurse might use behavioral limit setting by saying,</p>
                        <p>“I can’t give you permission to eat the cake. Your blood glucose level will go up if you do, and your insulin can’t be adjusted properly.”</p>
                        <p>When a client first attempts to change a colostomy bag but needs some assistance, the nurse might give positive feedback and say,</p>
                        <p>“You gave it a good effort. You were able to complete the task with a little assistance.”</p>
                        <p>Understanding the theories and treatment modalities presented in this chapter can help the nurse select appropriate and effective intervention strategies. In later chapters that present particular mental disorders or problems, specific psychosocial interventions that the nurse might use are described.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">BEST PRACTICE: Telehealth Care Delivery</h4>
                            <p>Provision of therapy via electronic devices is growing in popularity, especially with young adults. It is a desirable method of delivery for many clients, cost-effective, convenient, and often spontaneous.</p>
                            <p>The next step is to determine how it compares with more traditional delivery methods to identify best practices. Areas to study include privacy and confidentiality, communicating empathy, building rapport, and achievement of therapy outcomes.</p>

                        <p>The nurse must examine his or her beliefs about the theories of psychosocial development and realize that many treatment approaches are available. Different treatments may work for different clients; no one approach works for everyone. Sometimes the nurse’s personal opinions may not agree with those of the client, but the nurse must make sure that those beliefs do not affect the therapeutic process. For example, an overweight client may be working on accepting herself as being overweight rather than trying to lose weight, but the nurse believes the client really just needs to lose weight. The nurse’s responsibility is to support the client’s needs and goals, not to promote the nurse’s own ideas about what the client should do. Hence, the nurse must support the client’s decision to work on self-acceptance. For the nurse who believes that being overweight is simply a lack of willpower, it might be difficult to support a client’s participation in a self-help weight loss group, such as Overeaters Anonymous, that emphasizes overeating as a disease and accepting oneself.</p>

                                    <p>Psychosocial theories help explain human behavior—both mental health and mental illness. There are several types of psychosocial theories, including psychoanalytic theories, interpersonal theories, humanistic theories, behavioral theories, and existential theories.</p>

                                    <p>Freud believed that human behavior is motivated by repressed sexual impulses and desires and that childhood development is based on sexual energy (libido) as the driving force.</p>

                                    <p>Erik Erikson’s theories focused on both social and psychological developments across the life span. He proposed eight stages of psychosocial development; each stage includes a developmental task and a virtue to be achieved (hope, will, purpose, competence, fidelity, love, caring, and wisdom). Erikson’s theories remain in wide use today.</p>

                                    <p>Harry Stack Sullivan’s theories focused on development in terms of interpersonal relationships. He viewed the therapist’s role (termed participant observer) as key to the client's treatment.</p>

                                    <p>Hildegard Peplau is a nursing theorist whose theories formed much of the foundation of modern nursing practice, including the therapeutic nurse-patient relationship, the role of the nurse in the relationship, and the four anxiety levels.</p>

                                    <p>Abraham Maslow developed a hierarchy of needs stating that people are motivated by progressive levels of needs; each level must be satisfied before the person can progress to the next level. The levels begin with physiologic needs and then proceed to safety and security needs, belonging needs, esteem needs, and, finally, self-actualization needs.</p>

                                    <p>Carl Rogers developed client-centered therapy in which the therapist plays a supportive role, demonstrating unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathetic understanding to the client.</p>

                                    <p>Behaviorism focuses on the client's observable performance and behaviors and external influences that can bring about behavior changes rather than focusing on feelings and thoughts.</p>

                                    <p>Systematic desensitization is an example of conditioning in which a person who has an excessive fear of something, such as frogs or snakes, learns to manage his or her anxiety response through being exposed to the feared object.</p>

                                    <p>B.F. Skinner was a behaviorist who developed the theory of operant conditioning in which people are motivated to learn or change behavior with a system of rewards or reinforcement.</p>

                                    <p>Existential theorists believe that problems result when the person is out of touch with the self or the environment.
