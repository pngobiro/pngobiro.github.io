                        <p>Psychiatric disorders are not diagnosed as easily in children as they are in adults. Children usually lack the abstract cognitive abilities and verbal skills to describe what is happening. This chapter focuses on neurodevelopmental disorders, usually diagnosed in infancy or childhood and sometimes adolescence; many of these disorders persist into adulthood.</p>
                        <p><strong>Intellectual disability</strong> involves below-average intellectual functioning (IQ &lt;70) accompanied by significant limitations in areas of adaptive functioning such as communication skills, self-care, home living, social or interpersonal skills, and health and safety. The degree of disability is based on IQ and cognitive functioning (mild, moderate, severe, or profound).</p>

                        <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by pervasive and usually severe impairment of reciprocal social interaction skills, communication deviance, and restricted stereotypical behavioral patterns. Previous disorders such as Rett disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Asperger disorder are now viewed on the continuum of the autism spectrum.</p>
                        <p>ASD is almost five times more prevalent in boys than in girls and is usually identified by 18 months to 3 years of age. Children with ASD may display little eye contact, few facial expressions, limited gestures, and lack of spontaneous enjoyment. They may engage in <strong>stereotyped motor behaviors</strong> such as hand flapping, body twisting, or head banging.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>The goals of treatment are to reduce behavioral symptoms and to promote learning and development, particularly the acquisition of language skills. Comprehensive and individualized treatment, including special education and language therapy, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety and agitation, is associated with more favorable outcomes. Pharmacologic treatment with antipsychotics, such as haloperidol (Haldol), risperidone (Risperdal), or aripiprazole (Abilify), may be effective for specific target symptoms such as temper tantrums, aggressiveness, self-injury, hyperactivity, and stereotyped behaviors.</p>

                        <h3>Clinical Course</h3>
                        <p>ADHD is usually identified when the child begins preschool or school. Symptoms include fidgeting, inability to sit still, excessive noise, distractibility, inability to listen to directions, and interrupting others. Socially, peers may ostracize the child. Adolescents with ADHD may engage in risky behaviors such as cutting class, speeding, or substance use.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>The most effective treatment combines pharmacotherapy with behavioral, psychosocial, and educational interventions.</p>
