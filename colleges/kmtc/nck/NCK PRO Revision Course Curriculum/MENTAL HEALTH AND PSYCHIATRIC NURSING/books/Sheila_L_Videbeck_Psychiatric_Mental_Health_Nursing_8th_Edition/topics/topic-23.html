                        <p>Disruptive behavior disorders include problems with the person's ability to regulate his or her own emotions or behaviors. They are characterized by persistent patterns of behavior that involve anger, hostility, and/or aggression toward people and property. The primary disorders in this category include <strong>oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)</strong>, <strong>conduct disorder</strong>, and <strong>intermittent explosive disorder (IED)</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Some psychiatrists posit that ODD and conduct disorder can be viewed on a continuum concept that would include antisocial personality disorder (see Chapter 18). Others believe that ODD is a milder variant of conduct disorder. IED is viewed as an impulse control disorder but is included here because it involves aggression toward people and property.</p>

                        <h3>Related Disorders</h3>
                        <p><strong>Kleptomania</strong> is characterized by impulsive, repetitive theft of items not needed by the person, either for personal use or monetary gain. Tension and anxiety are high prior to the theft, and the person feels relief, exhilaration, or gratification while committing the theft.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pyromania</strong> is characterized by repeated, intentional fire-setting. The person is fascinated about fire and feels pleasure or relief of tension while setting and watching the fires. There is no monetary gain or revenge involved.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)</h2>
                        <p>ODD consists of an enduring pattern of uncooperative, defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority figures without major antisocial violations. ODD is diagnosed only when behaviors are more frequent and intense than in unaffected peers and cause dysfunction in social, academic, or work situations. The disruptive, defiant behaviors usually begin at home with parents or parental figures.</p>

                        <h3>Clinical Course and Etiology</h3>
                        <p>The prevalence of ODD is estimated at 3% in the US. It occurs more often in males, though incidence in females has increased. Children with ODD have limited abilities to make associations between their behavior and consequences. They exhibit impaired problem-solving abilities and deficiencies in attention, flexibility of thinking, and decision-making.</p>
                        <p>Early onset, severe symptoms, and comorbid conditions (ADHD, anxiety, mood disorders) are associated with poorer long-term outcomes. Some children with ODD develop conduct disorder and may be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder as adults.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Treatment is based on <strong>parent management training</strong> models of behavioral interventions. Parents learn to ignore maladaptive behaviors, reward positive behaviors with praise, and implement consistent consequences for defiant behavior. Little evidence supports the use of medications for ODD behaviors alone, though treating comorbid conditions like ADHD may help.</p>

                    <!-- Intermittent Explosive Disorder -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="ied">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED)</h2>
                        <p>IED involves repeated episodes of impulsive, aggressive, violent behavior, and angry verbal outbursts, usually lasting less than 30 minutes. The intensity of the emotional outburst is grossly out of proportion to the stressor or situation. Afterward, the individual may be embarrassed and feel guilty or remorseful, but this does not prevent future outbursts.</p>
                        <p>Onset is most common in adolescence and young adulthood. It is more common in males. Many people with IED have a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Potential etiologic factors include neurotransmitter imbalances (especially serotonin) and frontal lobe dysfunction.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Treatment includes medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac), lithium, and anticonvulsant mood stabilizers (valproic acid, phenytoin, topiramate, oxcarbazepine). SSRIs reduce aggressive tendencies because serotonin deficiencies are often linked to causation. Cognitive behavioral therapy, anger management, and avoidance of alcohol are also used.</p>

                        <p>Conduct disorder is characterized by persistent behavior that violates societal norms, rules, laws, and the rights of others. Symptoms are clustered in four areas:</p>

                            <li>Aggression to people and animals</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>Children with conduct disorder often exhibit <strong>callous and unemotional traits</strong>. They have little empathy, do not show remorse, have shallow emotions, and are unconcerned about poor performance. Low self-esteem, poor frustration tolerance, and temper outbursts are common.</p>

                        <h3>Onset and Clinical Course</h3>
                        <p><strong>Childhood-onset type:</strong> Symptoms before age 10. Includes physical aggression and disturbed peer relationships. More likely to develop antisocial personality disorder as adults.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adolescent-onset type:</strong> No behaviors until after age 10. Less likely to be aggressive; more likely to have normal peer relationships.</p>
                        <p>Severity ranges from <strong>Mild</strong> (minor harm to others, e.g., lying, truancy) to <strong>Moderate</strong> (vandalism, conning, running away) to <strong>Severe</strong> (considerable harm, e.g., forced sex, cruelty, use of a weapon).</p>

                        <h3>Etiology</h3>
                        <p>Risk factors include genetic vulnerability, poor parenting, low academic achievement, poor peer relationships, and low self-esteem. Protective factors include resilience, family support, and positive peer relationships. There is a lack of reactivity of the autonomic nervous system in these children.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Early intervention is more effective. Treatments include parenting education, social skills training, and family therapy. For adolescents, individual therapy dealing with conflict resolution and anger management is important. Medications (antipsychotics, mood stabilizers) may be used for specific symptoms like aggression or labile moods.</p>
