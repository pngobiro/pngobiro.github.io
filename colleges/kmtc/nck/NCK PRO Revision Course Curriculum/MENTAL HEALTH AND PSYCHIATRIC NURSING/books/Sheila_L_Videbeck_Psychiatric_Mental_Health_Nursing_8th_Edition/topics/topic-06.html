                        <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Communication is the process that people use to exchange information. Messages are simultaneously sent and received on two levels: verbally through the use of words and nonverbally by behaviors that accompany the words (Wasajja, 2018). Verbal communication consists of the words a person uses to speak to one or more listeners. Words represent the objects and concepts being discussed. Placement of words into phrases and sentences that are understandable to both speaker and listeners gives an order and a meaning to these symbols. In verbal communication, content is the literal words that a person speaks. Context is the environment in which communication occurs and can include time and the physical, social, emotional, and cultural environments. Context includes the situation or circumstances that clarify the meaning of the content of the message. It is discussed in more detail throughout this chapter.</p>
                        <p>Nonverbal communication is the behavior that accompanies verbal content such as body language, eye contact, facial expression, tone of voice, speed and hesitations in speech, grunts and groans, and distance from the listeners. Nonverbal communication can indicate the speaker's thoughts, feelings, needs, and values that he or she acts out mostly unconsciously.</p>
                        <p>Process denotes all nonverbal messages that the speaker uses to give meaning and context to the message. The process component of communication requires the listeners to observe the behaviors and sounds that accent the words and to interpret the speaker's nonverbal behaviors to assess whether they agree or disagree with the verbal content. A congruent message is conveyed when content and process agree. For example, a client says, "I know I haven't been myself. I need help." She has a sad facial expression and a genuine and sincere voice tone. The process validates the content as being true. But when the content and process disagree—when what the speaker says and what he or she does do not agree—the speaker is giving an incongruent message. For example, if the client says, "I'm here to get help," but has a rigid posture, clenched fists, and an agitated and frowning facial expression and snarls the words through clenched teeth, the message is incongruent. The process or observed behavior invalidates what the speaker says (content).</p>
                        <p>Nonverbal process represents a more accurate message than does verbal content. "I'm sorry I yelled and screamed at you" is readily believable when the speaker has a slumped posture, a resigned voice tone, downcast eyes, and a shameful facial expression because the content and process are congruent. The same sentence said in a loud voice and with raised eyebrows, a piercing gaze, an insulted facial expression, hands on hips, and outraged body language invalidates the words (incongruent message). The message conveyed is "I'm apologizing because I think I have to. I'm not really sorry."</p>

                    <!-- What Is Therapeutic Communication? -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="what-is-therapeutic-communication">
                        <h2 class="section-title">What Is Therapeutic Communication?</h2>
                        <p>Therapeutic communication is an interpersonal interaction between the nurse and the client during which the nurse focuses on the client's specific needs to promote an effective exchange of information. Skilled use of therapeutic communication techniques helps the nurse understand and empathize with the client's experience. All nurses need skills in therapeutic communication to effectively apply the nursing process and to meet standards of care for their clients.</p>
                        <p>Therapeutic communication can help nurses accomplish many goals:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Establish a therapeutic nurse-client relationship.</li>
                            <li>Identify the most important client concern at that moment (the client-centered goal).</li>
                            <li>Assess the client's perception of the problem as it unfolds. This includes detailed actions (behaviors and messages) of the people involved and the client's thoughts and feelings about the situation, others, and self.</li>
                            <li>Facilitate the client's expression of emotions.</li>
                            <li>Teach the client and family the necessary self-care skills.</li>
                            <li>Recognize the client's needs.</li>
                            <li>Implement interventions designed to address the client's needs.</li>
                            <li>Guide the client toward identifying a plan of action to a satisfying and socially acceptable resolution.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Establishing a therapeutic relationship is one of the most important responsibilities of the nurse when working with clients. Communication is the means by which a therapeutic relationship is initiated, maintained, and terminated. The therapeutic relationship is discussed in depth in Chapter 5, including confidentiality, self-disclosure, and therapeutic use of self. To have effective therapeutic communication, the nurse must also consider privacy and respect of boundaries, use of touch, and active listening and observation.</p>

                        <h3>Privacy and Respecting Boundaries</h3>
                        <p>Privacy is desirable but not always possible in therapeutic communication. An interview in a conference room is optimal if the nurse believes this setting is not too isolative for the interaction. The nurse can also talk with the client at the end of the hall or in a quiet corner of the day room or lobby, depending on the physical layout of the setting. The nurse needs to evaluate whether interacting in the client's room is therapeutic. For example, if the client has difficulty maintaining boundaries or has been making sexual comments, then the client's room is not the best setting. A more formal setting would be desirable.</p>
                        <p><strong>Proxemics</strong> is the study of distance zones between people during communication. People feel more comfortable with smaller distances when communicating with someone they know rather than with strangers (McCall, 2017). People from the United States, Canada, and many Eastern European nations generally observe four <strong>distance zones</strong>:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Intimate zone (0–18 in between people)</strong>: This amount of space is comfortable for parents with young children, people who mutually desire personal contact, or people whispering. Invasion of this intimate zone by anyone else is threatening and produces anxiety.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal zone (18–36 in)</strong>: This distance is comfortable between family and friends who are talking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social zone (4–12 ft)</strong>: This distance is acceptable for communication in social, work, and business settings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Public zone (12–25 ft)</strong>: This is an acceptable distance between a speaker and an audience, small groups, and other informal functions (Hall, 1963).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some people from different cultures (e.g., Hispanic, Mediterranean, East Indian, Asian, and Middle Eastern) are more comfortable with less than 4 to 12 ft of space between them while talking. The nurse of European American or African American heritage may feel uncomfortable if clients from these cultures stand close when talking. Conversely, clients from these backgrounds may perceive the nurse as remote and indifferent (Andrews &amp; Boyle, 2015).</p>
                        <p>Both the client and the nurse can feel threatened if one invades the other’s personal or intimate zone, which can result in tension, irritability, fidgeting, or even flight. When the nurse must invade the intimate or personal zone, he or she should always ask the client’s permission. For example, if a nurse performing an assessment in a community setting needs to take the client’s blood pressure, he or she should say, “Mr. Smith, to take your blood pressure I will wrap this cuff around your arm and listen with my stethoscope. Is this acceptable to you?” He or she should ask permission in a yes-or-no format so the client’s response is clear. This is one of the times when yes-or-no questions are appropriate.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">CLINICAL VIGNETTE: Personal Boundaries between Nurse and Client</h3>
                            <p>Saying he wanted to discuss his wife’s condition, a man accompanied the nurse down the narrow hallway of his house but did not move away when they reached the parlor. He was 12 in from the nurse. The nurse was uncomfortable with his closeness, but she did not perceive any physical threat from him. Because this was the first visit to his home, the nurse indicated two easy chairs and said, “Let’s sit over here, Mr. Barrett” (offering collaboration). If sitting down were not an option and Mr. Barrett moved in to compensate for the nurse’s backing up, the nurse could neutrally say, “I feel uncomfortable when anyone invades my personal space, Mr. Barrett. Please back up at least 12 in” (setting limits). In this message, the nurse has taken the blame instead of shaming the other person and has gently given an order for a specific distance between herself and Mr. Barrett. If Mr. Barrett were to move closer to the nurse again, the nurse would note the behavior and ask the client about it—for example, “You have moved in again very close to me, Mr. Barrett. What is that about?” (encouraging evaluation). The use of an open-ended question provides an opportunity for the client to address his behavior. He may have difficulty hearing the nurse, may want to keep this discussion confidential so his wife will not hear it, may come from a culture in which 12 in is an appropriate distance for a conversation, or may be using his closeness as a manipulative behavior (ensure attention, threat, or sexual invitation). After discussing Mr. Barrett's response and understanding that he can hear adequately, the nurse can add, "We can speak just fine from 2 or 3 ft apart, Mr. Barrett. Otherwise, I will leave, or we can continue this discussion in your wife's room" (setting limits). If Mr. Barrett again moves closer, the nurse will leave or move to the wife's room to continue the interview.</p>
                            <p>The therapeutic communication interaction is most comfortable when the nurse and client are 3 to 6 ft apart. If a client invades the nurse's intimate space (0–18 in), the nurse should set limits gradually, depending on how often the client has invaded the nurse's space and the safety of the situation.</p>

                        <h3>Touch</h3>
                        <p>As intimacy increases, the need for distance decreases. Knapp (1980) identified five types of touch:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Functional-professional touch</strong> is used in examinations or procedures such as when the nurse touches a client to assess skin turgor or a massage therapist performs a massage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social-polite touch</strong> is used in greeting, such as a handshake and the "air kisses" some people use to greet acquaintances, or when a gentle hand guides someone in the correct direction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Friendship-warmth touch</strong> involves a hug in greeting, an arm thrown around the shoulder of a good friend, or the backslapping some people use to greet friends and relatives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Love-intimacy touch</strong> involves tight hugs and kisses between lovers or close relatives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sexual-arousal touch</strong> is used by lovers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Touching a client can be comforting and supportive when it is welcome and permitted. The nurse should observe the client for cues that show whether touch is desired or indicated. For example, holding the hand of a sobbing mother whose child is ill is appropriate and therapeutic. If the mother pulls her hand away, however, she signals to the nurse that she feels uncomfortable being touched. The nurse can also ask the client about touching (e.g., “Would it help you to squeeze my hand?”).</p>
                        <p>The nurse must evaluate the use of touch based on the client’s preferences, history, and needs. The nurse may find touch supportive, but the client may not. Likewise, a client may use touch too much, and again the nurse must set appropriate boundaries.</p>
                        <p>Although touch can be comforting and therapeutic, it is an invasion of intimate and personal space. Some clients with mental illness have difficulty understanding the concept of personal boundaries or knowing when touch is or is not appropriate. Clients with a history of abuse have had others touch them in harmful, hurtful ways, usually without their consent. They may be hesitant or even unable to tell others when touch is uncomfortable. Consequently, most psychiatric inpatient, outpatient, and ambulatory care units have policies against clients touching one another or staff. Unless they need to get close to a client to perform some nursing care, staff members should serve as role models and refrain from invading clients’ personal and intimate space. When a staff member is going to touch a client while performing nursing care, he or she must verbally prepare the client before starting the procedure. A client with paranoia may interpret being touched as a threat and may attempt to protect him or herself by striking the staff person.</p>

                        <h3>Active Listening and Observation</h3>
                        <p>To receive the sender’s simultaneous messages, the nurse must use active listening and active observation. Active listening means refraining from other internal mental activities and concentrating exclusively on what the client says. Active observation means watching the speaker’s nonverbal actions as he or she communicates.</p>
                        <p>Peplau (1952) used observation as the first step in the therapeutic interaction. The nurse observes the client’s behavior and guides him or her in giving detailed descriptions of that behavior. The nurse also documents these details. To help the client develop insight into his or her interpersonal skills, the nurse analyzes the information obtained, determines the underlying needs that relate to the behavior, and connects pieces of information (makes links between various sections of the conversation).</p>
                        <p>A common misconception by students learning the art of therapeutic communication is that they must always be ready with questions the instant the client has finished speaking. Hence, they are constantly thinking ahead regarding the next question rather than actively listening to what the client is saying. The result can be that the nurse does not understand the client's concerns, and the conversation is vague, superficial, and frustrating to both participants. When a superficial conversation occurs, the nurse may complain that the client is not cooperating, is repeating things, or is not taking responsibility for getting better. Superficiality, however, can be the result of the nurse's failure to listen to cues in the client's responses and repeatedly asking the same question. The nurse does not get details and works from his or her assumptions rather than from the client's true situation.</p>
                        <p>Active listening and observation help the nurse:</p>

                            <li>Use additional therapeutic communication techniques to guide the client to describe his or her perceptions fully</li>
                            <li>Understand the client's perceptions of the issue instead of jumping to conclusions</li>
                            <li>Interpret and respond to the message objectively</li>

                        <h3>Using Concrete Messages</h3>
                        <p>When speaking to the client, the nurse should use words that are as clear as possible so the client can understand the message. Anxious people lose cognitive processing skills—the higher the anxiety, the less the ability to process concepts—so concrete messages are important for accurate information exchange. In a concrete message, the words are explicit and need no interpretation; the speaker uses nouns instead of pronouns—for example, "What health symptoms caused you to come to the hospital today?" or "When was the last time you took your antidepressant medications?" Concrete questions are clear, direct, and easy to understand. They elicit more accurate responses and avoid the need to go back and rephrase unclear questions, which interrupts the flow of a therapeutic interaction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Abstract messages</strong>, in contrast, are unclear patterns of words that often contain figures of speech that are difficult to interpret. They require the listener to interpret what the speaker is asking. For example, a nurse who wants to know why a client was admitted to the unit asks, "How did you get here?" This is an abstract message: the terms how and here are vague. An anxious client might not be aware of where he or she is and might reply, "Where am I?" or might interpret this as a question about how he or she was conveyed to the hospital and respond, "The ambulance brought me." Clients who are anxious, experiencing language barriers, cognitively impaired, or suffering from some mental disorders often function at a concrete level of comprehension and have difficulty answering abstract questions. The nurse must be sure that statements and questions are clear and concrete.</p>

                                <li><strong>Abstract (unclear):</strong> "Your clinical performance has to improve."<br><strong>Concrete (clear):</strong> "To administer medications tomorrow, you'll have to be able to calculate dosages correctly by the end of today's class."</li>

                        <h3>Using Therapeutic Communication Techniques</h3>
                        <p>The nurse can use many therapeutic communication techniques to interact with clients. The choice of technique depends on the intent of the interaction and the client's ability to communicate verbally. Overall, the nurse selects techniques that facilitate the interaction and enhance communication between client and nurse. Table 6.1 lists these techniques and gives examples. Techniques such as exploring, focusing, restating, and reflecting encourage the client to discuss his or her feelings or concerns in more depth. Other techniques help focus or clarify what is being said. The nurse may give the client feedback using techniques such as making an observation or presenting reality.</p>

                            <p>Nurses who observe that a psychiatric client is pacing with pursed lips and a furrowed brow should avoid presuming that the client's behavior is motivated by anxiety. The nurse must validate whether this is the case and encourage the client to delve into why he or she is behaving that way. Doing so fosters a sense of well-being and allows the nurse to proceed appropriately.</p>

                        <h3>Avoiding Nontherapeutic Communication</h3>
                        <p>In contrast, there are many nontherapeutic techniques that nurses should avoid (Table 6.2). These responses cut off communication and make it more difficult for the interaction to continue. Responses such as "everything will work out" or "maybe tomorrow will be a better day" may be intended to comfort the client, but instead may impede the communication process. Asking "why" questions (in an effort to gain information) may be perceived as criticism by the client, conveying a negative judgment from the nurse. Many of these responses are common in social interaction. Therefore, it takes practice for the nurse to avoid making these types of comments.</p>

                        <h3>Interpreting Signals or Cues</h3>
                        <p>To understand what a client means, the nurse watches and listens carefully for cues. Cues (overt and covert) are verbal or nonverbal messages that signal key words or issues for the client. Finding cues is a function of active listening. Cues can be buried in what a client says or can be acted out in the process of communication. Often, cue words introduced by the client can help the nurse know what to ask next or how to respond to the client. The nurse builds his or her responses on these cue words or concepts. Understanding this can relieve pressure on students who are worried and anxious about what question to ask next.</p>
                        <p>Clients may use many word patterns to cue the listener to their intent. <strong>Overt cues</strong> are clear, direct statements of intent, such as “I want to die.” The message is clear that the client is thinking of suicide or self-harm. <strong>Covert cues</strong> are vague or indirect messages that need interpretation and exploration—for example, if a client says, “Nothing can help me.” The nurse is unsure, but it sounds as if the client might be saying he or she feels so hopeless and helpless that he or she plans to commit suicide. The nurse can explore this covert cue to clarify the client’s intent and to protect the client. Most suicidal people are ambivalent about whether to live or die and often admit their plan when directly asked about it. When the nurse suspects self-harm or suicide, he or she uses a yes-or-no question to elicit a clear response.</p>
                        <p>Other word patterns that need further clarification for meaning include metaphors, proverbs, and clichés. When a client uses these figures of speech, the nurse must follow up with questions to clarify what the client is trying to say.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>metaphor</strong> is a phrase that describes an object or a situation by comparing it with something else familiar.</p>
                        <p>&gt; Client: “My son’s bedroom looks like a bomb went off.”<br>
                        &gt; Nurse: “You’re saying your son is not very neat.” (verbalizing the implied)<br>
                        &gt; Client: “My mind is like mashed potatoes.”<br>
                        &gt; Nurse: “I sense you find it difficult to put thoughts together.” (translating into feelings)</p>
                        <p><strong>Proverbs</strong> are old accepted sayings with generally accepted meanings.</p>
                        <p>&gt; Client: “People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.”<br>
                        &gt; Nurse: “Who do you believe is criticizing you but actually has similar problems?” (encouraging description of perception)</p>
                        <p>A <strong>cliché</strong> is an expression that has become trite and generally conveys a stereotype. For example, if a client says, “she has more guts than brains,” the implication is that the speaker believes the woman to whom he or she refers is not smart, acts before thinking, or has no common sense. The nurse can clarify what the client means by saying, “Give me an example of how you see her as having more guts than brains” (focusing).</p>

                    <section class="content-section" id="nonverbal-communication">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Nonverbal Communication Skills</h2>
                        <p>Nonverbal communication is the behavior a person exhibits while delivering verbal content. It includes facial expression, eye contact, space, time, boundaries, and body movements. Nonverbal communication is as important as verbal communication, if not more so. It is estimated that one-third of meaning is transmitted by words and two-thirds is communicated nonverbally. The speaker may verbalize what he or she believes the listener wants to hear, while nonverbal communication conveys the speaker’s actual meaning. Nonverbal communication involves the unconscious mind acting out emotions related to the verbal content, the situation, the environment, and the relationship between the speaker and the listener.</p>
                        <p>Nonverbal communication is often more accurate than verbal communication when the two are incongruent. People can readily change what they say but are less likely to be able to control nonverbal communication.</p>

                        <h3>Facial Expression</h3>
                        <p>The human face produces the most visible, complex, and sometimes confusing nonverbal messages. Facial movements connect with words to illustrate meaning; this connection demonstrates the speaker's internal dialogue. Facial expressions can be categorized into expressive, impassive, and confusing:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>An <strong>expressive face</strong> portrays the person's moment-by-moment thoughts, feelings, and needs. These expressions may be evident even when the person does not want to reveal his or her emotions.</li>
                            <li>An <strong>impassive face</strong> is frozen into an emotionless deadpan expression similar to a mask.</li>
                            <li>A <strong>confusing facial expression</strong> is one that is the opposite of what the person wants to convey. A person who is verbally expressing sad or angry feelings while smiling is exhibiting a confusing facial expression.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Facial expressions often can affect the listener's response. Strong and emotional facial expressions can persuade the listener to believe the message. For example, by appearing perplexed and confused, a client can manipulate the nurse into staying longer than scheduled. Facial expressions such as happy, sad, embarrassed, or angry usually have the same meaning across cultures, but the nurse should identify the facial expression and ask the client to validate the nurse's interpretation of it—for instance, "You're smiling, but I sense you are angry" (Wasajja, 2018).</p>

                        <h3>Body Language</h3>
                        <p>Body language (e.g., gestures, postures, movements, and body positions) is a nonverbal form of communication. Closed body positions, such as crossed legs or arms folded across the chest, indicate that the interaction might threaten the listener who is defensive or not accepting. A better, more accepting body position is to sit facing the client with both feet on the floor, knees parallel, hands at the side of the body, and legs uncrossed or crossed only at the ankle. This open posture demonstrates unconditional positive regard, trust, care, and acceptance. The nurse indicates interest in and acceptance of the client by facing and slightly leaning toward him or her while maintaining nonthreatening eye contact.</p>

                        <h3>Vocal Cues</h3>
                        <p>Vocal cues are nonverbal sound signals transmitted along with the content: voice volume, tone, pitch, intensity, emphasis, speed, and pauses augment the sender's message. Volume, the loudness of the voice, can indicate anger, fear, happiness, or deafness. Tone can indicate whether someone is relaxed, agitated, or bored. Pitch varies from shrill and high to low and threatening. Intensity is the power, severity, and strength behind the words, indicating the importance of the message. Emphasis refers to accents on words or phrases that highlight the subject or give insight into the topic. Speed is the number of words spoken per minute. Pauses also contribute to the message, often adding emphasis or feeling.</p>

                        <h3>Eye Contact</h3>
                        <p>The eyes have been called the mirror of the soul because they often reflect our emotions. Messages that the eyes give include humor, interest, puzzlement, hatred, happiness, sadness, horror, warning, and pleading. Eye contact, looking into the other person's eyes during communication, is used to assess the other person and the environment and to indicate whose turn it is to speak; it increases during listening but decreases while speaking (Wasajja, 2018). Although maintaining good eye contact is usually desirable, it is important that the nurse doesn't "stare" at the client.</p>

                        <h3>Silence</h3>
                        <p>Silence or long pauses in communication may indicate many different things. The client may be depressed and struggling to find the energy to talk. Sometimes, pauses indicate the client is thoughtfully considering the question before responding. At times, the client may seem to be "lost in his or her own thoughts" and not paying attention to the nurse. It is important to allow the client sufficient time to respond, even if it seems like a long time. It may confuse the client if the nurse "jumps in" with another question or tries to restate the question differently. Also, in some cultures, verbal communication takes a slower cadence with many pauses, and the client may believe the nurse is impatient or disrespectful if he or she does not wait for the client's response.</p>

                    <!-- Meaning, Context, Spirituality, Culture -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="understanding-communication">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Understanding Communication Factors</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Understanding the Meaning of Communication</h3>
                        <p>Few messages in social and therapeutic communication have only one level of meaning; messages often contain more meaning than just the spoken words. The nurse must try to discover all the meaning in the client's communication. For example, the client with depression might say, "I'm so tired that I just can't go on." If the nurse considers only the literal meaning of the words, he or she might assume the client is experiencing the fatigue that often accompanies depression. However, statements such as the previous example may mean the client wishes to die. The nurse would need to further assess the client's statement to determine whether the client is suicidal.</p>

                        <h3>Understanding Context</h3>
                        <p>Understanding the context of communication is extremely important in accurately identifying the meaning of a message. Think of the difference in the meaning of "I'm going to kill you!" when stated in two different contexts: anger during an argument and when one friend discovers another is planning a surprise party for him or her. Understanding the context of a situation gives the nurse more information and reduces the risk for assumptions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Understanding Spirituality</h3>
                        <p>Spirituality is a client’s belief about life, health, illness, death, and one’s relationship to the universe. It differs from religion, which is an organized system of beliefs about one or more all-powerful, all-knowing forces that govern the universe and offer guidelines for living in harmony with the universe and others (Andrews &amp; Boyle, 2015). Spiritual and religious beliefs are usually supported by others who share them and follow the same rules and rituals for daily living. Spirituality and religion often provide comfort and hope to people and can greatly affect a person’s health and health care practices.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Considerations</h3>
                        <p>Culture is all the socially learned behaviors, values, beliefs, and customs transmitted down to each generation. The rules about the way in which to conduct communication vary because they arise from each culture’s specific social relationship patterns (Andrews &amp; Boyle, 2015). Each culture has its own rules governing verbal and nonverbal communication. For example, in Western cultures, the handshake is a nonverbal greeting often used to size up or judge another's professional demeanor. For women, a polite "hello" is an accepted form of greeting. In some Asian cultures, bowing is the accepted form of greeting and departing and a method of designating social status.</p>

                    <!-- The Therapeutic Communication Session -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="therapeutic-session">
                        <h2 class="section-title">The Therapeutic Communication Session</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Goals</h3>
                        <p>The nurse uses all the therapeutic communication techniques and skills previously described to help achieve the following goals:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Establish rapport with the client by being empathetic, genuine, caring, and unconditionally accepting of the client regardless of his or her behavior or beliefs.</li>
                            <li>Actively listen to the client to identify the issues of concern and to formulate a client-centered goal for the interaction.</li>
                            <li>Gain an in-depth understanding of the client’s perception of the issue and foster empathy in the nurse–client relationship.</li>
                            <li>Explore the client’s thoughts and feelings.</li>
                            <li>Facilitate the client’s expression of thoughts and feelings.</li>
                            <li>Guide the client in developing new skills in problem-solving.</li>
                            <li>Promote the client’s evaluation of solutions.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Nondirective Role</h3>
                        <p>When beginning therapeutic interaction with a client, it is often the client (not the nurse) who identifies the problem he or she wants to discuss. The nurse uses active listening skills to identify the topic of concern. The client identifies the goal, and information-gathering about this topic focuses on the client. The nurse acts as a guide in this conversation. The therapeutic communication centers on achieving the goal within the time limits of the conversation.</p>
                        <p>The nurse is assuming a nondirective role in this type of therapeutic communication, using broad openings and open-ended questions to collect information and to help the client identify and discuss the topic of concern. The client does most of the talking. The nurse guides the client through the interaction, facilitating the client’s expression of feelings and identification of issues.</p>

                        <h3>Directive Role</h3>
                        <p>When the client is suicidal, experiencing a crisis, or out of touch with reality, the nurse uses a directive role, asking direct yes-or-no questions and using problem-solving to help the client develop new coping mechanisms to deal with present issues. For example:</p>
                        <p>&gt; <strong>Nurse:</strong> "You sound hopeless." (verbalizing the implied) "Are you thinking about suicide?" (seeking information)<br>
                        &gt; <strong>Client:</strong> "I have been thinking I’d be better off dead."</p>
                        <p>The nurse uses a directive role in this example because the client’s safety is at issue.</p>

                        <h3>How to Phrase Questions</h3>
                        <p>The manner in which the nurse phrases the questions is important. Open-ended questions elicit more descriptive information, and yes-or-no questions yield just an answer. The nurse asks different types of questions based on the information the nurse wishes to obtain. The nurse uses active listening to build questions based on the cues the client has given in his or her responses.</p>
                        <p>In English, people frequently substitute the word <em>feel</em> for the word <em>think</em>. Emotions differ from the cognitive process of thinking, so using the appropriate term is important. For example, “What do you feel about that test?” is a vague question that could elicit several types of answers. A more specific question is, “How well do you think you did on the test?” The nurse should ask, “What did you think about...?” when discussing cognitive issues, and “How did you feel about...?” when trying to elicit the client’s emotions and feelings.</p>

                        <h3>Asking for Clarification</h3>
                        <p>Nurses often believe they should always be able to understand what the client is saying. This is not always possible; the client’s thoughts and communications may be unclear. The nurse should never assume that he or she understands; rather, the nurse should ask for clarification if there is doubt. Asking for clarification to confirm the nurse’s understanding of what the client intends to convey is paramount to accurate data collection.</p>

                        <h3>Client's Avoidance of the Anxiety-Producing Topic</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes, clients begin discussing a topic of minimal importance because it is less threatening than the issue that is increasing the client's anxiety. The client is discussing a topic but seems to be focused elsewhere. Active listening and observing changes in the intensity of the nonverbal process help give the nurse a sense of what is going on. Many options can help the nurse determine which topic is more important:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Ask the client which issue is more important at this time.</li>
                            <li>Go with the new topic because the client has given nonverbal messages that this is the issue that needs to be discussed.</li>
                            <li>Reflect the client's behavior, signaling there is a more important issue to be discussed.</li>
                            <li>Mentally file the other topic away for later exploration.</li>
                            <li>Ignore the new topic because it seems that the client is trying to avoid the original topic.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Guiding the Client in Problem-Solving and Empowering the Client to Change</h3>
                        <p>Many therapeutic situations involve problem-solving. The nurse is not expected to be an expert or to tell the client what to do to fix his or her problem. Rather, the nurse should help the client explore possibilities and find solutions to his or her problem. Often just helping the client discuss and explore his or her perceptions of a problem stimulates potential solutions in the client's mind. The nurse should introduce the concept of problem-solving and offer him or herself in this process.</p>
                        <p>Problem-solving is frequently used in crisis intervention but is equally effective for general use. The problem-solving process is used when the client has difficulty finding ways to solve the problem or when working with a group of people whose divergent viewpoints hinder finding solutions. It involves several steps:</p>

                            <li>Select the best alternative.</li>

                        <p>Assertive communication is the ability to express positive and negative ideas and feelings in an open, honest, and direct way. It recognizes the rights of both parties and is useful in various situations, such as resolving conflicts, solving problems, and expressing feelings or thoughts that are difficult for some people to express. Assertive communication can help a person deal with issues with coworkers, family, or friends. It is particularly helpful for people who have difficulty refusing another's request, expressing emotions of anger or frustration, or dealing with persons of authority.</p>
                        <p>Assertive communication works best when the speaker is calm; makes specific, factual statements; and focuses on “I” statements. For example, one of the nurses on your unit is always a few minutes late to work, arriving in a rush and disrupting change-of-shift report. There are four types of responses that coworkers can have to this situation:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Aggressive:</strong> After saying nothing for several days, one nurse jumps up and yells, “You’re always late! That is so rude! Why can’t you be on time like everyone else?” Then the nurse stomps out of the room, leaving everyone uncomfortable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Passive–aggressive:</strong> A coworker says to another nurse, “So nice of her to join us! Aren’t we lucky?” Everyone sits in uncomfortable silence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Passive:</strong> One nurse doesn’t say anything at the time, but later tells coworkers, “She’s always late. I had to tell her what she missed. I have so much work of my own to do.” But this nurse doesn’t say anything to the nurse who was late.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assertive:</strong> After report, one nurse says, “When you are late, report is disrupted, and I don’t like having to repeat information that was already discussed.” This nurse has communicated feelings about the specific situation in a calm manner with no accusations or inflammatory comments.</li>

                        <p>As community care for people with physical and mental health problems continues to expand, the nurse's role expands as well. The nurse may become the major caregiver and resource person for increasingly high-risk clients treated in the home and their families and may become more responsible for primary prevention in wellness and health maintenance. Therapeutic communication techniques and skills are essential to successful management of clients in the community.</p>
                        <p>When practicing in the community, the nurse needs self-awareness and knowledge about cultural differences. When the nurse enters the home of a client, the nurse is the outsider and must learn to negotiate the cultural context of each family by understanding their beliefs, customs, and practices and not judging them according to his or her own cultural context.</p>

                            <p>Although important, nonverbal skills are often underdeveloped, misunderstood, or ignored by health care providers. From 2014 through 2016, workshop training sessions were offered at eight conferences to help participants focus on nonverbal communication skills. Drama exercises were used to enable participants to experience involving sight, sound, touch, and proxemics in novel ways. Following the workshops, nonverbal communication skills were viewed as important in building trust and relationships with patients.</p>

                        <p>Therapeutic communication is the primary vehicle that nurses use to apply the nursing process in mental health settings. The nurse's skill in therapeutic communication influences the effectiveness of many interventions. Therefore, the nurse must evaluate and improve his or her communication skills on an ongoing basis. When the nurse examines his or her personal beliefs, attitudes, and values as they relate to communication, he or she is gaining awareness of the factors influencing communication. Gaining awareness of how one communicates is the first step toward improving communication.</p>

                                <li>Ask colleagues for feedback about your communication style. Ask them how they communicate with clients in difficult or uncomfortable situations.</li>
                                <li>Examine your communication by asking questions such as "How do I relate to men? To women? To authority figures? To elderly persons?
