                        <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Assessment is the first step of the nursing process and involves the collection, organization, and analysis of information about the client’s health. In psychiatric–mental health nursing, this process is often referred to as a psychosocial assessment, which includes a mental status examination. The purpose of the psychosocial assessment is to construct a picture of the client’s current emotional state, mental capacity, and behavioral function. This assessment serves as the basis for developing a plan of care to meet the client’s needs. The assessment is also a clinical baseline used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and interventions or a measure of the client’s progress (American Nurses Association, 2014).</p>

                        <h3>Client Participation/Feedback</h3>
                        <p>A thorough and complete psychosocial assessment requires active client participation. If the client is unable or unwilling to participate, some areas of the assessment will be incomplete or vague. For example, the client who is extremely depressed may not have the energy to answer questions or complete the assessment. Clients exhibiting psychotic thought processes or impaired cognition may have an insufficient attention span or may be unable to comprehend the questions being asked. The nurse may need to have several contacts with such clients to complete the assessment or gather further information as the client's condition permits.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Client's Health Status</h3>
                        <p>The client's health status can also affect the psychosocial assessment. If the client is anxious, tired, or in pain, the nurse may have difficulty eliciting the client's full participation in the assessment. The information that the nurse obtains may reflect the client's pain or anxiety rather than an accurate assessment of the client's situation. The nurse needs to recognize these situations and deal with them before continuing the full assessment. The client may need to rest, receive medications to alleviate pain, or be calmed before the assessment can continue.</p>

                        <h3>Client's Previous Experiences/Misconceptions about Health Care</h3>
                        <p>The client's perception of his or her circumstances can elicit emotions that interfere with obtaining an accurate psychosocial assessment. If the client is reluctant to seek treatment or has had previous unsatisfactory experiences with the health care system, he or she may have difficulty answering questions directly. The client may minimize or maximize symptoms or problems or may refuse to provide information in some areas. The nurse must address the client's feelings and perceptions to establish a trusting working relationship before proceeding with the assessment.</p>

                        <div class="callout callout--note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Concept Mastery Alert</h4>
                            <p>When beginning an assessment of a client, the nurse must address the client's feelings and perceptions to establish a trusting working relationship before proceeding with the assessment. The priority is to create an environment in which the client feels safe and can trust caregivers. Asking questions that allow the client to open up to the caregiver helps to establish that relationship.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Client's Ability to Understand</h3>
                        <p>The nurse must also determine the client's ability to hear, read, and understand the language being used in the assessment. If the client's primary language differs from that of the nurse, the client may misunderstand or misinterpret what the nurse is asking, which results in inaccurate information. A client with impaired hearing may also fail to understand what the nurse is asking. It is important that the information in the assessment reflects the client's health status; it should not be a result of poor communication.</p>

                        <h3>Nurse's Attitude and Approach</h3>
                        <p>The nurse's attitude and approach can influence the psychosocial assessment. If the client perceives the nurse's questions to be short and curt or feels rushed or pressured to complete the assessment, he or she may provide only superficial information or omit discussing problems in some areas altogether. The client may also refrain from providing sensitive information if he or she perceives the nurse as nonaccepting, defensive, or judgmental. For example, a client may be reluctant to relate instances of child abuse or domestic violence if the nurse seems uncomfortable or nonaccepting. The nurse must be aware of his or her own feelings and responses and approach the assessment matter-of-factly.</p>

                    <!-- How to Conduct the Interview -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="how-to-conduct-interview">
                        <h2 class="section-title">How to Conduct the Interview</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Environment</h3>
                        <p>The nurse should conduct the psychosocial assessment in an environment that is comfortable, private, and safe for both the client and the nurse. An environment that is fairly quiet with few distractions allows the client to give his or her full attention to the interview. Conducting the interview in a place such as a conference room assures the client that no one will overhear what is being discussed. The nurse should not choose an isolated location for the interview, however, particularly if the client is unknown to the nurse or has a history of any threatening behavior. The nurse must ensure the safety of him or herself and the client even if that means another person is present during the assessment.</p>

                        <h3>Input from Family and Friends</h3>
                        <p>If family members, friends, or caregivers have accompanied the client, the nurse should obtain their perceptions of the client's behavior and emotional state. How this is accomplished depends on the situation. Sometimes, the client does not give permission for the nurse to conduct separate interviews with family members. The nurse should then be aware that friends or family may not feel comfortable talking about the client in his or her presence and may provide limited information. Or, the client may not feel comfortable participating in the assessment without family or friends. This, too, may limit the amount or type of information the nurse obtains. It is desirable to conduct at least part of the assessment without others, especially in cases of suspected abuse or intimidation. The nurse should make every effort to assess the client in privacy in cases of suspected abuse.</p>

                        <h3>How to Phrase Questions</h3>
                        <p>The nurse may use open-ended questions to start the assessment (see Chapter 6). Doing so allows the client to begin as he or she feels comfortable and also gives the nurse an idea about the client's perception of his or her situation.</p>
                        <p>Examples of open-ended questions are as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>What brings you here today?</li>
                            <li>Tell me what has been happening to you.</li>
                            <li>How can we help you?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the client cannot organize his or her thoughts or has difficulty answering open-ended questions, the nurse may need to use more direct questions to obtain information. Questions need to be clear, simple, and focused on one specific behavior or symptom; they should not cause the client to remember several things at once. Questions regarding several different behaviors or symptoms—"How are your eating and sleeping habits? and Have you been taking any over-the-counter medications that affect your eating and sleeping?"—can be confusing to the client. The following are examples of focused or closed-ended questions:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>How many hours did you sleep last night?</li>
                            <li>Have you been thinking about suicide?</li>
                            <li>How much alcohol have you been drinking?</li>
                            <li>How well have you been sleeping?</li>
                            <li>How many meals a day do you eat?</li>
                            <li>What over-the-counter medications are you taking?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nurse should use a nonjudgmental tone and language, particularly when asking about sensitive information such as drug or alcohol use, sexual behavior, abuse or violence, and child-rearing practices. Using nonjudgmental language and a matter-of-fact tone avoids giving the client verbal cues to become defensive or to not tell the truth. For example, when asking a client about his or her parenting role, the nurse should ask, "What types of discipline do you use?" rather than "How often do you physically punish your child?" The first question is more likely to elicit honest and accurate information; the second question gives the impression that physical discipline is wrong, and it may cause the client to respond dishonestly.</p>

                        <p>The information gathered in a psychosocial assessment can be organized in many different ways. Most assessment tools or conceptual frameworks contain similar categories with some variety in arrangement or order. The nurse should use some kind of organizing framework so that he or she can assess the client in a thorough and systematic way that lends itself to analysis and serves as a basis for the client's care. The framework for psychosocial assessment discussed here and used throughout this textbook contains the following components:</p>

                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>Background assessments include the client's history, age and developmental stage, cultural and spiritual beliefs, and beliefs about health and illness. The history of the client, as well as his or her family, may provide some insight into the client's current situation. For example, Has the client experienced similar difficulties in the past? Has the client been admitted to the hospital, and if so, what was that experience like? A family history that is positive for alcoholism, bipolar disorder, or suicide is significant because it increases the client's risk for these problems.</p>
                        <p>The client's chronologic age and developmental stage are important factors in the psychosocial assessment. The nurse evaluates the client's age and developmental level for congruence with expected norms. For example, a client may be struggling with personal identity and attempting to achieve independence from his or her parents. If the client is 17 years old, these struggles are normal and anticipated because these are two of the primary developmental tasks for the adolescent. If the client is 35 years old and still struggling with issues of self-identity and independence, the nurse will need to explore the situation. The client's age and developmental level may also be incongruent with expected norms if the client has a developmental delay or intellectual disability.</p>
                        <p>The nurse must be sensitive to the client's cultural and spiritual beliefs to avoid making inaccurate assumptions about his or her psychosocial functioning (Schultz &amp; Videbeck, 2013). Many cultures have beliefs and values about a person's role in society or acceptable social or personal behavior that may differ from those of the nurse. Western cultures generally expect that as a person reaches adulthood, he or she becomes financially independent, leaves home, and makes his or her own life decisions. In contrast, in some Eastern cultures, three generations may live in one household, and elders of the family make major life decisions for all. Another example is the assessment of eye contact. Western cultures consider good eye contact to be a positive characteristic indicating self-esteem and paying attention. People from other cultures, such as Japan, consider such eye contact to be a sign of disrespect.</p>
                        <p>The nurse must also consider the client’s beliefs about health and illness when assessing the client’s psychosocial functioning. Some people view emotional or mental problems as family concerns to be handled only among family members. They may view seeking outside or professional help as a sign of individual weakness. Others may believe that their problems can be solved only with the right medication, and they will not accept other forms of therapy. Another common problem is the misconception that one should take medication only when feeling sick. Many mental disorders, like some medical conditions, may require clients to take medications on a long-term basis, perhaps even for a lifetime. Just like people with diabetes must take insulin and people with hypertension need antihypertensive medications, people with recurrent depression may need to take antidepressants on a long-term basis.</p>

                        <h3>General Appearance and Motor Behavior</h3>
                        <p>The nurse assesses the client’s overall appearance, including dress, hygiene, and grooming. Is the client appropriately dressed for his or her age and the weather? Is the client unkempt or disheveled? Does the client appear to be his or her stated age? The nurse also observes the client’s posture, eye contact, facial expression, and any unusual tics or tremors. He or she documents observations and examples of behaviors to avoid personal judgment or misinterpretation. Specific terms used in making assessments of general appearance and motor behavior include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Automatisms:</strong> repeated purposeless behaviors often indicative of anxiety, such as drumming fingers, twisting locks of hair, or tapping the foot</li>
                            <li><strong>Psychomotor retardation:</strong> overall slowed movements</li>
                            <li><strong>Waxy flexibility:</strong> maintenance of posture or position over time even when it is awkward or uncomfortable</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nurse assesses the client’s speech for quantity, quality, and any abnormalities. Does the client talk nonstop? Does the client perseverate (seem to be stuck on one topic and unable to move to another idea)? Are responses a minimal "yes" or "no" without elaboration? Is the content of the client's speech relevant to the question being asked? Is the rate of speech fast or slow? Is the tone audible or loud? Does the client speak in a rhyming manner? Does the client use neologisms (invented words that have meaning only for the client)? The nurse notes any speech difficulties such as stuttering or lisping.</p>

                        <h3>Mood and Affect</h3>
                        <p>Mood refers to the client's pervasive and enduring emotional state. Affect is the outward expression of the client's emotional state. The client may make statements about feelings, such as "I'm depressed" or "I'm elated," or the nurse may infer the client's mood from data such as posture, gestures, tone of voice, and facial expression. The nurse also assesses for consistency among the client's mood, affect, and situation. For instance, the client may have an angry facial expression but deny feeling angry or upset in any way. Or, the client may be talking about the recent loss of a family member while laughing and smiling. The nurse must note such inconsistencies.</p>
                        <p>Common terms used in assessing affect include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Blunted affect:</strong> showing little or a slow-to-respond facial expression</li>
                            <li><strong>Broad affect:</strong> displaying a full range of emotional expressions</li>
                            <li><strong>Flat affect:</strong> showing no facial expression</li>
                            <li><strong>Inappropriate affect:</strong> displaying a facial expression that is incongruent with mood or situation; often silly or giddy regardless of circumstances</li>
                            <li><strong>Restricted affect:</strong> displaying one type of expression, usually serious or somber</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The client's mood may be described as happy, sad, depressed, euphoric, anxious, or angry. When the client exhibits unpredictable and rapid mood swings from depressed and crying to euphoria with no apparent stimuli, the mood is called <strong>labile</strong> (rapidly changing).</p>
                        <p>The nurse may find it helpful to ask the client to estimate the intensity of his or her mood. The nurse can do so by asking the client to rate his or her mood on a scale of 1 to 10. For example, if the client reports being depressed, the nurse might ask, "On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being least depressed and 10 being most depressed, where would you place yourself right now?"</p>

                        <h3>Thought Process and Content</h3>
                        <p>Thought process refers to how the client thinks. The nurse can infer a client's thought process from speech and speech patterns. Thought content is what the client actually says. The nurse assesses whether the client's verbalizations make sense, that is, if ideas are related and flow logically from one to the next. The nurse must also determine whether the client seems preoccupied, as if talking or paying attention to someone or something else. When the nurse encounters clients with marked difficulties in thought process and content, he or she may find it helpful to ask focused questions requiring short answers. Common terms related to the assessment of thought process and content include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Circumstantial thinking:</strong> a client eventually answers a question but only after giving excessive unnecessary detail</li>
                            <li><strong>Delusion:</strong> a fixed false belief not based in reality</li>
                            <li><strong>Flight of ideas:</strong> excessive amount and rate of speech composed of fragmented or unrelated ideas</li>
                            <li><strong>Ideas of reference:</strong> client's inaccurate interpretation that general events are personally directed to him or her, such as hearing a speech on the news and believing the message had personal meaning</li>
                            <li><strong>Loose associations:</strong> disorganized thinking that jumps from one idea to another with little or no evident relation between the thoughts</li>
                            <li><strong>Tangential thinking:</strong> wandering off the topic and never providing the information requested</li>
                            <li><strong>Thought blocking:</strong> stopping abruptly in the middle of a sentence or train of thought; sometimes unable to continue the idea</li>
                            <li><strong>Thought broadcasting:</strong> a delusional belief that others can hear or know what the client is thinking</li>
                            <li><strong>Thought insertion:</strong> a delusional belief that others are putting ideas or thoughts into the client's head—that is, the ideas are not those of the client</li>
                            <li><strong>Thought withdrawal:</strong> a delusional belief that others are taking the client's thoughts away and the client is powerless to stop it</li>
                            <li><strong>Word salad:</strong> flow of unconnected words that convey no meaning to the listener</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Assessment of Suicide or Harm toward Others</h3>
                        <p>The nurse must determine whether the depressed or hopeless client has suicidal ideation or a lethal plan. The nurse does so by asking the client directly, "Do you have thoughts of suicide?" or "What thoughts of suicide have you had?"</p>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">Box 8.2 Suicide Assessment Questions</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li><strong>Ideation:</strong> “Are you thinking about killing yourself?”</li>
                                <li><strong>Plan:</strong> “Do you have a plan to kill yourself?”</li>
                                <li><strong>Method:</strong> “How do you plan to kill yourself?”</li>
                                <li><strong>Access:</strong> “How would you carry out this plan? Do you have access to the means to carry out the plan?”</li>
                                <li><strong>Where:</strong> “Where would you kill yourself?”</li>
                                <li><strong>When:</strong> “When do you plan to kill yourself?”</li>
                                <li><strong>Timing:</strong> “What day or time of day do you plan to kill yourself?”</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <p>Likewise, if the client is angry, hostile, or making threatening remarks about a family member, spouse, or anyone else, the nurse must ask whether the client has thoughts or plans about hurting that person. The nurse does so by questioning the client directly:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>What thoughts have you had about hurting (person’s name)?</li>
                            <li>What is your plan?</li>
                            <li>What do you want to do to (person’s name)?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When a client makes specific threats or has a plan to harm another person, health care providers are legally obligated to warn the person who is the target of the threats or plan. The legal term for this is <strong>duty to warn</strong>. This is one situation in which the nurse must breach the client’s confidentiality to protect the threatened person.</p>

                        <h3>Sensorium and Intellectual Processes</h3>
                        <p><strong>Orientation.</strong> Orientation refers to the client’s recognition of person, place, and time—that is, knowing who and where he or she is and the correct day, date, and year. This is often documented as “oriented × 3.” Occasionally, a fourth sphere, situation, is added (whether the client accurately perceives his or her current circumstances). Absence of correct information about person, place, and time is referred to as disorientation, or “oriented × 1” (person only) or “oriented × 2” (person and place). The order of person, place, and time is significant. When a person is disoriented, he or she first loses track of time, then place, and, finally person. Orientation returns in the reverse order; first, the person knows who he or she is, then realizes place, and, finally time. Disorientation is not synonymous with confusion. A confused person cannot make sense of his or her surroundings or figure things out even though he or she may be fully oriented.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Memory.</strong> The nurse directly assesses memory, both recent and remote, by asking questions with verifiable answers. For example, if the nurse asks, “Do you have any memory problems?” the client may inaccurately respond “no,” and the nurse cannot verify that. Similarly, if the nurse asks, “What did you do yesterday?” the nurse may be unable to verify the accuracy of the client’s responses. Hence, questions to assess memory generally include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>What is the name of the current president?</li>
                            <li>Who was the president before that?</li>
                            <li>In what county do you live?</li>
                            <li>What is the capital of this state?</li>
                            <li>What is your social security number?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Ability to Concentrate.</strong> The nurse assesses the client’s ability to concentrate by asking the client to perform certain tasks:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Spell the word “world” backward.</li>
                            <li>Begin with the number 100, subtract 7, subtract 7 again, and so on. This is called “serial sevens.”</li>
                            <li>Repeat the days of the week backward.</li>
                            <li>Perform a three-part task, such as “Take a piece of paper in your right hand, fold it in half, and put it on the floor.” (The nurse should give the instructions at one time.)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Abstract Thinking and Intellectual Abilities.</strong> When assessing intellectual functioning, the nurse must consider the client’s level of formal education. Lack of formal education could hinder performance in many tasks in this section of the assessment.</p>
                        <p>The nurse assesses the client’s ability to use abstract thinking, which is to make associations or interpretations about a situation or comment. The nurse can usually do so by asking the client to interpret a common proverb such as "a stitch in time saves nine." If the client can explain the proverb correctly, his or her abstract thinking abilities are intact. If the client provides a literal explanation of the proverb and cannot interpret its meaning, abstract thinking abilities are lacking. When the client continually gives literal translations, this is evidence of concrete thinking. For instance:</p>
                        <div class="callout callout--info">
                            <p><strong>Proverb:</strong> A stitch in time saves nine.</p>
                            <p><strong>Abstract meaning:</strong> If you take the time to fix something now, you'll avoid bigger problems in the future.</p>
                            <p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> Don't forget to sew up holes in your clothes (concrete thinking).</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="callout callout--info">
                            <p><strong>Proverb:</strong> People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.</p>
                            <p><strong>Abstract meaning:</strong> Don't criticize others for things you also may be guilty of doing.</p>
                            <p><strong>Literal translation:</strong> If you throw a stone at a glass house, the glass will break (concrete thinking).</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The nurse may also assess the client's intellectual functioning by asking him or her to identify the similarities between pairs of objects, for example, "What is similar about an apple and an orange?" or "What do the newspaper and the television have in common?"</p>

                        <p><strong>Sensory-Perceptual Alterations.</strong> Some clients experience hallucinations (false sensory perceptions or perceptual experiences that do not really exist). Hallucinations can involve the five senses and bodily sensations. Auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) are the most common; visual hallucinations (seeing things that don't really exist) are the second most common. Initially, clients perceive hallucinations as real experiences, but later in the illness, they may recognize them as hallucinations.</p>

                        <h3>Judgment and Insight</h3>
                        <p><strong>Judgment</strong> refers to the ability to interpret one's environment and situation correctly and to adapt one's behavior and decisions accordingly. Problems with judgment may be evidenced as the client describes recent behavior and activities that reflect a lack of reasonable care for self or others. For example, the client may spend large sums of money on frivolous items when he or she cannot afford basic necessities such as food or clothing. Risky behaviors such as picking up strangers in bars or engaging in unprotected sexual activity may also indicate poor judgment. The nurse may also assess a client's judgment by asking the client hypothetical questions, such as "If you found a stamped addressed envelope on the ground, what would you do?"</p>
                        <p><strong>Insight</strong> is the ability to understand the true nature of one's situation and accept some personal responsibility for that situation. The nurse can frequently infer insight from the client's ability to realistically describe the strengths and weaknesses of his or her behavior. An example of poor insight would be a client who places all blame on others for his own behavior, saying "It's my wife's fault that I drink and get into fights, because she nags me all the time." This client is not accepting responsibility for his or her drinking and fighting. Another example of poor insight would be the client who expects all problems to be solved with little or no personal effort: "The problem is my medication. As soon as the doctor gets the medication right, I'll be just fine."</p>

                        <h3>Self-Concept</h3>
                        <p>Self-concept is the way one views oneself in terms of personal worth and dignity. To assess a client's self-concept, the nurse can ask the client to describe him or herself, what characteristics he or she likes, and what he or she would change. The client's description of self in terms of physical characteristics gives the nurse information about the client's body image, which is also part of self-concept.</p>
                        <p>Also included in an assessment of self-concept are the emotions that the client frequently experiences, such as sadness or anger and whether the client is comfortable with those emotions. The nurse must also assess the client's coping strategies. He or she can do so by asking, "What do you do when you have a problem? How do you solve it? What usually works to deal with anger or disappointment?"</p>

                        <h3>Roles and Relationships</h3>
                        <p>People function in their communities through various roles such as mother, wife, son, daughter, teacher, secretary, or volunteer. The nurse assesses the roles the client occupies, client satisfaction with those roles, and whether the client believes he or she is fulfilling the roles adequately. The number and type of roles may vary, but they usually include family, occupation, and hobbies or activities. Family roles include son or daughter, sibling, parent, child, and spouse or partner. Occupation roles can be related to a career or school or both. The ability to fulfill a role or the lack of a desired role is often central to the client's psychosocial functioning. Changes in roles may also be part of the client's difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Relationships with other people are important to one's social and emotional health. Relationships vary in terms of significance, level of intimacy or closeness, and intensity. The inability to sustain satisfying relationships can result from mental health problems or can contribute to the worsening of some problems. The nurse must assess the relationships in the client's life, the client's satisfaction with those relationships, or any loss of relationships. Common questions include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Do you feel close to your family?</li>
                            <li>Do you have or want a relationship with a significant other?</li>
                            <li>Are your relationships meeting your needs for companionship or intimacy?</li>
                            <li>Can you meet your sexual needs satisfactorily?</li>
                            <li>Have you been involved in any abusive relationships?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the client's family relationships seem to be a significant source of stress or if the client is closely involved with his or her family, a more in-depth assessment of this area may be useful. Box 8.3 lists areas of family functioning and practices that are commonly assessed.</p>

                        <h3>Physiologic and Self-Care Considerations</h3>
                        <p>When doing a psychosocial assessment, the nurse must include physiologic functioning. Although a full physical health assessment may not be indicated, emotional problems often affect some areas of physiologic function. Emotional problems can greatly affect eating and sleeping patterns; under stress, people may eat excessively or not at all and may sleep up to 20 hours a day or be unable to sleep more than 2 or 3 hours a night. Clients with bipolar disorder may not eat or sleep for days. Clients with major depression may not be able to get out of bed. Therefore, the nurse must assess the client's usual patterns of eating and sleeping and then determine how those patterns have changed.</p>
                        <p>The nurse also asks the client whether he or she has any major or chronic health problems and whether he or she takes prescribed medications as ordered and follows dietary recommendations. The nurse also explores the client's use of alcohol and over-the-counter or illicit drugs. Such questions require nonjudgmental phrasing; the nurse must reassure the client that truthful information is crucial in determining the client's plan of care.</p>
                        <p>Noncompliance with prescribed medications is an important area. If the client has stopped taking medication or is taking medication other than as prescribed, the nurse must help the client feel comfortable enough to reveal this information. The nurse also explores the barriers to compliance. Is the client choosing noncompliance because of undesirable side effects? Has the medication failed to produce the desired results? Does the client have difficulty obtaining the medication? Is the medication too expensive for the client?</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Data Analysis</h2>
                        <p>After completing the psychosocial assessment, the nurse analyzes all the data that he or she has collected. Data analysis involves thinking about the overall assessment rather than focusing on isolated bits of information. The nurse looks for patterns or themes in the data that lead to conclusions about the client's strengths and needs and to a particular nursing diagnosis. No one statement or behavior is adequate to reach such a conclusion. The nurse must also consider the congruence of all information provided by the client, family, or caregivers as well as his or her own observations. It is not uncommon for the client's perception of his or her behavior and situation to differ from that of others. Assessments in a variety of areas are necessary to support nursing diagnoses such as chronic low self-esteem or ineffective coping.</p>
                        <p>Assessment is an ongoing, dynamic process, not a one-time activity. The nurse will assess and reassess throughout the care of the client. Reassessment is the basis for changing the plan of care, evaluation of treatment effectiveness, discharge planning, and follow-up care in the community.</p>

                        <h3>Psychological Tests</h3>
                        <p>Psychological tests are another source of data for the nurse to use in planning care for the client. Two basic types of tests are intelligence tests and personality tests. Intelligence tests are designed to evaluate the client's cognitive abilities and intellectual functioning. Personality tests reflect the client's personality in areas such as self-concept, impulse control, reality testing, and major defenses. Personality tests may be objective (constructed of true-or-false or multiple choice questions). Table 8.1 describes selected objective personality tests. The nurse compares the client's answers with standard answers or criteria and obtains a score or scores.</p>

                        <p>Other personality tests, called projective tests, are unstructured and are usually conducted by the interview method. The stimuli for these tests, such as pictures or Rorschach’s inkblots, are standard, but clients may respond with answers that vary widely. The evaluator analyzes the client’s responses and gives a narrative result of the testing. Table 8.2 lists commonly used projective personality tests.</p>

                        <p>Both intelligence tests and personality tests are frequently criticized as being culturally biased. It is important to consider the client’s culture and environment when evaluating the importance of scores or projections from any of these tests; they can provide useful information about the client in some circumstances but may not be suitable for all clients.</p>

                        <h3>Psychiatric Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>Medical diagnoses of psychiatric illness are found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This taxonomy is universally used by psychiatrists and some therapists in the diagnosis of psychiatric illnesses. The DSM-5 classifies mental disorders into categories. It describes each disorder and provides diagnostic criteria to distinguish one from another. The descriptions of disorders and related behaviors can be a valuable resource for the nurse to use as a guide.</p>

                        <h3>Mental Status Examination</h3>
                        <p>Often, psychiatrists, therapists, or other clinicians perform a cursory abbreviated exam that focuses on the client's cognitive abilities. These exams usually include items such as orientation to person, time, place, date, season, and day of the week; ability to interpret proverbs; ability to perform math calculations; memorization and short-term recall; naming common objects in the environment; ability to follow multistep commands; and ability to write or copy a simple drawing. The fewer the tasks the client completes accurately, the greater the cognitive deficit. Because this exam assesses cognitive ability, it is often used to screen for dementia. However, cognition may also be impaired (usually temporarily) when clients are depressed or psychotic.</p>

                            <p>In the United States, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention has established the Zero Suicide Model, a framework that incorporates 10 basic steps for clinical management of those at risk for suicide. The steps include suicide risk assessment, brief interventions to increase safety, and teaching coping strategies to improve ongoing contact and monitoring during transitions in care and high-risk periods. Linking risk assessment to interventions and evaluation of outcomes is a more comprehensive approach to managing suicide risk successfully.</p>
                            <p>The next step is implementation of such a model in different settings dealing with people at risk for suicide. Evaluation of outcomes for the success of the model compared with current practices will guide clinicians toward the best practices.</p>

                    <section class="content-section" id="self-awareness-issues">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Self-Awareness Issues</h2>
                        <p>Self-awareness is crucial when a nurse is trying to obtain accurate and complete information from the client during the assessment process. The nurse must be aware of any feelings, biases, and values that could interfere with the psychosocial assessment of a client with different beliefs, values, and behaviors. The nurse cannot let personal feelings and beliefs influence the client's treatment. Self-awareness does not mean the nurse's beliefs are wrong or must change, but it does help the nurse to be open and accepting of others' beliefs and behaviors even when the nurse does not agree with them.</p>
                        <p>Two areas that may be uncomfortable or difficult for the nurse to assess are sexuality and self-harm behaviors. The beginning nurse may feel uncomfortable, as if prying into personal matters, when asking questions about a client's intimate relationships and behavior and any self-harm behaviors or thoughts of suicide. Asking such questions, however, is essential to obtaining a thorough and complete assessment. The nurse needs to remember that it may be uncomfortable for the client to discuss these topics as well.</p>
                        <p>Being able to listen to the client without judgment and to support the discussion of personal topics takes practice and usually gets easier with experience. Talking to more experienced colleagues about such discomfort and methods to alleviate it often helps. It may also help for the nurse to preface uncomfortable questions by saying to the client, "I need to ask you some personal questions. Remember, this is information that will help the staff provide better care for you."</p>
                        <p>The nurse must assess the client for suicidal thoughts. Some beginning nurses feel uncomfortable discussing suicide or believe that asking about suicide might suggest it to a client who had not previously thought about it. This is not the case. It has been shown that the safest way to assess a client with suspected mental disorders is to ask him or her clearly and directly about suicidal ideas. It is the nurse's professional responsibility to keep the client's safety needs first and foremost, and this includes overcoming any personal discomfort in talking about suicide (Schultz &amp; Videbeck, 2013).</p>

                                    <p>The components of a thorough psychosocial assessment include the client's history, general appearance and motor behavior, mood and affect, thought process and content, sensorium and intellectual process, judgment and insight, self-concept, roles and relationships, and physiologic and self-care considerations.</p>

                                    <p>Several important factors in the client can influence the psychosocial assessment: ability to participate and give feedback, physical health status, emotional well-being and perception of the situation, and ability to communicate.</p>

                                    <p>The nurse's attitude and approach can greatly influence the psychosocial assessment. The nurse must conduct the assessment professionally, nonjudgmentally, and matter-of-factly, while not allowing personal feelings to influence the interview.</p>

Describe methods the nurse can use to demonstrate cultural competence and avoid inaccurate assumptions about her culture. What questions can the nurse ask to assess cultural beliefs, practices, and influences on L.N.C. mental illness and family functioning?</p>

                        <p>The nurse at a mental health clinic is meeting a new client for the first time and plans to do a psychosocial assessment. When the client arrives, the nurse finds a young woman who looks somewhat apprehensive and is crying and twisting facial tissues in her hands. The client can tell the nurse her name and age, but begins crying before she can provide any other information. The nurse knows it is essential to obtain information from this young woman, but it is clear she will have trouble answering all interview questions at this time.</p>
