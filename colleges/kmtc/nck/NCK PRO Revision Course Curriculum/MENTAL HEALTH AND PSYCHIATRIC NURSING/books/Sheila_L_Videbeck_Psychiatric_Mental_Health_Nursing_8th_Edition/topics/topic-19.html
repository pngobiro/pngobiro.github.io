                        <p><strong>Alcohol:</strong> The first episode of intoxication often occurs between ages 12 and 14. A pattern of more severe difficulties emerges in the mid-20s to mid-30s, often characterized by the first <strong>blackout</strong>. <strong>Tolerance</strong> develops, followed by a <strong>tolerance break</strong> where very small amounts intoxicate the person. Spontaneous remission or "natural recovery" can occur, but poor outcomes are associated with earlier onset and longer periods of use.</p>

                        <h3>Alcohol</h3>
                        <p><strong>Intoxication/Overdose:</strong> CNS depressant. Overdose can result in vomiting, unconsciousness, and respiratory depression. Treatment involves gastric lavage or dialysis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Withdrawal:</strong> Symptoms begin 4 to 12 hours after cessation. Includes tremors, sweating, elevated pulse/BP, insomnia, anxiety. Severe withdrawal can progress to delirium tremens (hallucinations, seizures). Withdrawal is usually managed with benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide) using a fixed schedule or symptom-triggered dosing (using CIWA-AR scale).</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA-AR)</h4>
                            <p>Assesses nausea, tremor, paroxysmal sweats, anxiety, agitation, tactile disturbances, auditory disturbances, visual disturbances, headache, and orientation. A score less than 10 usually indicates no need for additional medication.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Sedatives, Hypnotics, and Anxiolytics</h3>
                        <p>Includes benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Intoxication symptoms are similar to alcohol. Benzodiazepine withdrawal can be managed by tapering the dose.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Stimulants</h3>
                        <p>Includes amphetamines, cocaine, methamphetamine. Intoxication includes euphoria, hyperactivity, hypervigilance, anxiety, and hallucinations. Withdrawal causes marked dysphoria ("crashing") and fatigue but is not life-threatening.</p>

                        <h3>Cannabis</h3>
                        <p>Most widely used illegal drug (though legal status is changing). Intoxication includes lowered inhibitions, relaxation, euphoria, and increased appetite. No clinically significant withdrawal syndrome is identified.</p>

                        <h3>Opioids</h3>
                        <p>Includes morphine, heroin, codeine, fentanyl, methadone. Intoxication involves apathy, lethargy, constricted pupils, and drowsiness. Overdose can cause coma, respiratory depression, and death; treated with <strong>naloxone (Narcan)</strong>. Withdrawal includes anxiety, restlessness, aching back/legs, nausea, vomiting, dysphoria, and sweating.</p>

                        <h3>Hallucinogens</h3>
                        <p>Includes LSD, PCP, ecstasy. Distorts perception of reality. Intoxication includes anxiety, depression, paranoid ideation. PCP toxicity can include seizures and hypertension. No withdrawal syndrome, but flashbacks can occur.</p>

                        <p>Includes gasoline, glue, paint thinner. Intoxication involves dizziness, nystagmus, uncoordination, and slurred speech. Acute toxicity causes anoxia and respiratory depression. Can cause significant brain damage.</p>

                        <p><strong>Addressing Family Issues:</strong> <strong>Codependence</strong> is a maladaptive coping pattern in family members. <strong>Enabling</strong> behaviors seem helpful but perpetuate substance use. Refer families to Al-Anon or AlaTeen.</p>
                        <p><strong>Promoting Coping Skills:</strong> Focus on the here-and-now. Set realistic goals (e.g., "stay sober today").</p>
