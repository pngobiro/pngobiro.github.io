                        <p>Violent behavior has been identified as a national health concern and a priority for intervention in the United States, where occurrences exceed 2 million per year. The most alarming statistics relate to violence in the home and abuse, or the wrongful use and maltreatment of another person. Statistics show that most abuse is perpetrated by someone the victim knows. Victims of abuse are found across the life span, and they can be spouses or partners, children, or elderly parents.</p>
                        <p>This chapter discusses domestic abuse (intimate partner abuse, child abuse/neglect, and elder abuse) and rape. Many survivors of abuse suffer long-term emotional trauma, including disorders associated with abuse and violence, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and dissociative disorders, which are discussed in Chapter 13. Other long-term problems associated with abuse and trauma include substance abuse (see Chapter 19) and depression (see Chapter 17).</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Clinical Picture of Abuse and Violence</h2>
                        <p>Victims of abuse or violence can certainly have physical injuries needing medical attention, but they also experience psychological injuries with a broad range of responses. Some clients are agitated and visibly upset; others are withdrawn and aloof, appearing numb or oblivious to their surroundings. Often, domestic violence remains undisclosed for months or even years because victims fear their abusers. Victims frequently suppress their anger and resentment and do not tell anyone. This is particularly true in cases of childhood sexual abuse.</p>
                        <p>Survivors of abuse often suffer in silence and continue to feel guilt and shame. Children particularly come to believe that somehow they are at fault and did something to deserve or provoke the abuse. They are more likely to miss school, less likely to attend college, and continue to have problems through adolescence into adulthood. As adults, they usually feel guilt or shame for not trying to stop the abuse. Survivors feel degraded, humiliated, and dehumanized. Their self-esteem is extremely low, and they view themselves as unlovable. They believe they are unacceptable to others, contaminated, or ruined. Depression, suicidal behavior, and marital and sexual difficulties are common.</p>
                        <p>Victims and survivors of abuse may have problems relating to others. They find trusting others, especially authority figures, to be difficult. In relationships, their emotional reactions are likely to be erratic, intense, and perceived as unpredictable. Intimate relationships may trigger extreme emotional responses such as panic, anxiety, fear, and terror. Even when survivors of abuse desire closeness with another person, they may perceive actual closeness as intrusive and threatening.</p>
                        <p>Nurses should be particularly sensitive to the abused client's need to feel safe, secure, and in control of his or her body. They should take care to maintain the client's personal space, assess the client's anxiety level, and ask permission before touching him or her for any reason. Because the nurse may not always be aware of a history of abuse when initially working with a client, he or she should apply these cautions to all clients in the mental health setting.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Characteristics of Violent Families</h2>
                        <p>Family violence encompasses spouse battering; neglect and physical, emotional, or sexual abuse of children; elder abuse; and marital rape. In many cases, family members tolerate abusive and violent behavior from relatives they would never accept from strangers. In violent families, the home, which is normally a safe haven of love and protection, may be the most dangerous place for victims.</p>

                        <p>Research studies have identified some common characteristics of violent families regardless of the type of abuse that exists. These are discussed next and in Box 12.1.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">Box 12.1 Characteristics of Violent Families</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Social isolation</li>
                                <li>Abuse of power and control</li>
                                <li>Alcohol and other drug abuse</li>
                                <li>Intergenerational transmission process</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Social Isolation</h3>
                        <p>One characteristic of violent families is social isolation. Members of these families keep to themselves and usually do not invite others into the home or tell anyone what is happening. Often, abusers threaten victims with even greater harm if they reveal the secret. They may tell children that a parent, sibling, or pet will die if anyone outside the family learns of the abuse. Children then keep the secret out of fear, which prevents others from "interfering with private family business."</p>

                        <h3>Abuse of Power and Control</h3>
                        <p>The abusive family member almost always holds a position of power and control over the victim (child, spouse, or elderly parent). The abuser exerts not only physical power but also economic and social control. He or she is often the only family member who makes decisions, spends money, or spends time outside the home with other people. The abuser belittles and blames the victim, often using threats and emotional manipulation. If the abuser perceives any indication, real or imagined, of victim independence or disobedience, violence usually escalates. Intimate partner violence (IPV) accounts for 14% of all homicides. Of these deaths, 70% were females and 30% were males (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2017). In the United States, half of all female homicide victims were killed by a current or former romantic partner; only 16% of female homicides were committed by a stranger.</p>

                        <h3>Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse</h3>
                        <p>Substance abuse, especially alcoholism, has been associated with family violence. This finding does not imply a cause-and-effect relationship. Alcohol does not cause the person to be abusive; rather, an abusive person is also likely to use alcohol or other drugs. The majority of victims of intimate violence report that alcohol was involved in the violent incident. Women whose partners abused alcohol were more likely than other women to be assaulted by their partners. Although alcohol may not cause the abuse, many researchers believe that alcohol may diminish inhibitions and make violent behavior more intense or frequent (Stromberg, 2017).</p>
                        <p>Alcohol is also cited as a factor in acquaintance rape or date rape. Often, both victims and offenders reported drinking alcohol at the time of the assault. In addition, use of the illegal drug flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) or other "date rape drugs" to subdue potential victims is on the rise.</p>

                        <h3>Intergenerational Transmission Process</h3>
                        <p>The intergenerational transmission process shows that patterns of violence are perpetuated from one generation to the next through role modeling and social learning (Bartlett, Kotake, Fauth, &amp; Easterbrooks, 2017). Intergenerational transmission suggests that family violence is a learned pattern of behavior. For example, children who witness violence between their parents learn that violence is a way to resolve conflict and is an integral part of a close relationship. Statistics show that one-third of abusive men are likely to have come from violent homes where they witnessed abuse or were abused themselves. Women who grew up in violent homes are 50% more likely to expect or accept violence in their own relationships. Not all persons exposed to family violence, however, become abusive or violent as adults. Therefore, this single factor does not explain the perpetuation of violent behavior.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Considerations</h3>
                        <p>Although domestic violence affects families of all ethnicities, races, ages, national origins, sexual orientations, religions, and socioeconomic backgrounds, a specific population is particularly at risk: immigrant women. Battered immigrant women face legal, social, and economic problems different from the U.S. citizens who are battered and from people of other cultural, racial, and ethnic origins who are not battered.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The battered woman may come from a culture that accepts domestic violence.</li>
                            <li>She may believe she has less access to legal and social services than do the U.S. citizens.</li>
                            <li>If she is not a citizen, she may be forced to leave the United States if she seeks legal sanctions against her abuser or attempts to leave him or her.</li>
                            <li>She is isolated by cultural dynamics that do not permit her to leave her abuser; economically, she may be unable to gather the resources to leave, work, or go to school.</li>
                            <li>Language barriers may interfere with her ability to call 911; learn about her rights or legal options; and obtain shelter, financial assistance, or food.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It may be necessary for the nurse to obtain the assistance of an interpreter whom the woman trusts, make referrals to legal services, and assist the woman with contacting the Department of Immigration to deal with these additional concerns.</p>

                    <!-- Intimate Partner Violence -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="intimate-partner-violence">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Intimate Partner Violence</h2>
                        <p>Intimate partner violence is the mistreatment or misuse of one person by another in the context of an emotionally intimate relationship. The relationship may be spousal, between partners, boyfriend, girlfriend, or an estranged relationship. The abuse can be emotional or psychological, physical, sexual, or a combination (which is common). Psychological abuse (emotional abuse) includes name-calling, belittling, screaming, yelling, destroying property, and making threats as well as subtler forms, such as refusing to speak to or ignoring the victim. Physical abuse ranges from shoving and pushing to severe battering and choking and may involve broken limbs and ribs, internal bleeding, brain damage, and even homicide. Sexual abuse includes assaults during sexual relations such as biting nipples, pulling hair, slapping and hitting, and rape (discussed later).</p>
                        <p>Nearly one in four women and one in seven men report having experienced severe physical violence from an intimate partner in their lifetimes in the United States. About one in six women and one in 14 men have experienced sexual violence by an intimate partner (CDC, 2017).</p>
                        <p>Pregnant women experience an increase in violence during pregnancy. Battering during pregnancy leads to adverse outcomes, such as miscarriage and stillbirth, as well as further physical and psychological problems for the woman. The increase in violence often results from the partner's jealousy, possessiveness, insecurity, and lessened physical and emotional availability of the pregnant woman (Stromberg, 2017).</p>
                        <p>Domestic violence occurs in same-sex relationships with the same statistical frequency as in heterosexual relationships. Although same-sex battering mirrors heterosexual battering in prevalence, its victims receive fewer protections. Seven states define domestic violence in a way that excludes same-sex victims. Twelve states have sodomy laws that designate sodomy (anal intercourse) as a crime, even though such laws were invalidated by the Supreme Court in 2003. The same-sex batterer has an additional weapon to use against the victim: the threat of revealing the partner's homosexuality to friends, family, employers, or the community.</p>

                        <h3>Clinical Picture</h3>
                        <p>Because abuse is often perpetrated by a husband against a wife, that example is used in this section. These same patterns are consistent, however, between partners who are not married, between same-sex partners, and with wives who abuse their husbands.</p>
                        <p>An abusive husband often believes his wife belongs to him (like property) and becomes increasingly violent and abusive if she shows any sign of independence, such as getting a job or threatening to leave. Typically, the abuser has strong feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem as well as poor problem-solving and social skills. He is emotionally immature, needy, irrationally jealous, and possessive. He may even be jealous of his wife's attention to their own children or may beat both his children and his wife. By bullying and physically punishing the family, the abuser often experiences a sense of power and control, a feeling that eludes him outside the home. Therefore, the violent behavior is often rewarding and boosts his self-esteem.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">CLINICAL VIGNETTE: Intimate Partner Violence</h3>
                            <p>Darlene sat in the bathroom trying to regain her balance and holding a cold washcloth to her face. She looked in the mirror and saw a large, red, swollen area around her eye and cheek where her husband, Frank, had hit her. They had been married for only 6 months, and this was the second time he had gotten angry and struck her in the face before storming out of the house. Last time, he was so sorry the day after it happened that he brought her flowers and took her out to dinner to apologize. He said he loved her more than ever and felt terrible about what had happened. He said it was because he had had an argument with his boss over getting a raise and went out drinking after work before coming home. He had promised not to go out drinking anymore and that it would never happen again. For several weeks after he quit drinking, he was wonderful, and it felt like it was before they got married. She remembered thinking that she must try harder to keep him happy because she knew he really did love her.</p>
                            <p>But during the past 2 weeks, he had been increasingly silent and sullen, complaining about everything. He didn't like the dinners she cooked and said he wanted to go out to eat even though money was tight and their credit cards were loaded with charges they couldn't pay off. He began drinking again. After a few hours of drinking that night, he yelled at her and said she was the cause of all his money problems. She tried to reason with him, but he hit her, and this time he knocked her to the floor, and her head hit the table. She was really frightened, but what should she do? She couldn't move out; she had no money of her own, and her job just didn't pay enough to support her. Should she go to her parents? She couldn't tell them about what happened because they never wanted her to marry Frank in the first place. They would probably say, "We told you so, and you didn't listen. Now you married him, and you'll have to deal with his problems." She was too embarrassed to tell her friends, most of whom were "their" friends and had never seen this violent side of Frank. They probably wouldn't believe her. What could she do? Her face and head were really beginning to hurt now. "I'll talk to him tomorrow when he is sober and tell him he must get some help for the drinking problem. When he's sober, he is reasonable, and he'll see that this drinking is causing a big problem for our marriage," she thought.</p>

                        <h3>Cycle of Abuse and Violence</h3>
                        <p>The cycle of violence or abuse is another reason often cited for why women have difficulty leaving abusive relationships. A typical pattern exists; usually, the initial episode of battering or violence is followed by a period of the abuser expressing regret, apologizing, and promising it will never happen again. He professes his love for his wife and may even engage in romantic behavior (e.g., buying gifts and flowers). This period of contrition or remorse is sometimes called the honeymoon period. The woman naturally wants to believe her husband and hopes the violence was an isolated incident. After this honeymoon period, the tension-building phase begins; there may be arguments, stony silence, or complaints from the husband. The tension ends in another violent episode after which the abuser once again feels regret and remorse and promises to change. This cycle continually repeats itself. Each time, the victim keeps hoping the violence will stop.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>Initially, the honeymoon period may last weeks or even months, causing the woman to believe that the relationship has improved and her husband's behavior has changed. Over time, however, the violent episodes are more frequent, the period of remorse disappears altogether, and the level of violence and severity of injuries worsen. Eventually, the violence is routine—several times a week or even daily.</p>
                        <p>While the cycle of violence is the most common pattern of IPV, it does not apply to all situations. Many survivors report only one or two elements of the cycle. For example, there may be only periodic episodes of violent behavior with no subsequent honeymoon period or no observable period of increasing tension.</p>

                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Because most abused women do not seek direct help for the problem, nurses must help identify abused women in various settings. Nurses may encounter abused women in emergency departments, clinics, or pediatricians' offices. Some victims may be seeking treatment for other medical conditions not directly related to the abuse or for pregnancy. Identifying abused women who need assistance is a top priority of the Department of Health and Human Services. The generalist nurse is not expected to deal with this complicated problem alone. He or she can, however, make referrals and contact appropriate health care professionals experienced in working with abused women. Above all, the nurse can offer caring and support throughout the victim's visit. Table 12.1 summarizes techniques for working with victims of partner violence.</p>

                        <p>It is essential to ask everyone whether they are safe at home or in their relationship. If the nurse asks only people seen as “likely victims,” he or she will be stereotyping and may well miss someone who really needs help.</p>
                        <p>Many hospitals, clinics, and doctors’ offices ask women about safety issues as part of all health histories or intake interviews. Because this issue is delicate and sensitive and many abused women are afraid or embarrassed to admit the problem, nurses must be skilled in asking appropriate questions about abuse. Box 12.2 gives examples of questions to ask to determine the client's safety. The initial questions are designed to detect abuse. The nurse should ask the latter questions if warranted. He or she should ask these questions when the woman is alone; the nurse can paraphrase or edit the questions as needed for any given situation.</p>

                            <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is the mistreatment or misuse of one person by another in the context of an emotionally intimate relationship. IPV may be suspected if a client exhibits unexplained bruising, broken bones, sexual assault, or a psychological/emotional trauma. Stalking is a crime of intimidation in which perpetrators harass and terrorize their victims through behavior that causes fear or substantial emotional distress.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Treatment and Intervention</h3>
                        <p>Every state in the United States allows police to make arrests in cases of domestic violence; more than half of the states have laws requiring police to make arrests for at least some domestic violence crimes. Sometimes after police have been called to the scene, the abuser is allowed to remain at home after talking with police and calming down. If an arrest is made, sometimes the abuser is held only for a few hours or overnight. Often, the abuser retaliates upon release; hence, women have a legitimate fear of calling the police. Studies have shown that arresting the batterer may reduce short-term violence but may increase long-term violence.</p>
                        <p>A woman can obtain a <strong>restraining order</strong> (protection order) from her county of residence that legally prohibits the abuser from approaching or contacting her. Nevertheless, a restraining order provides only limited protection. The abuser may decide to violate the order and severely injure or kill the woman before police can intervene. Some states have enacted laws removing firearms from persons identified on a protection order. However, informing the person of the firearm ban or collecting the firearm is an ambiguous process in some states (Fleury-Steiner, Miller, &amp; Carcirieri, 2017).</p>
                        <p>Civil orders of protection are more effective in preventing future violence when linked with other interventions such as advocacy counseling, shelter, or talking with health care providers. Women who left their abusive relationships are more likely to be successful if their legal and psychological needs are addressed simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>Even after a victim of battering has "ended" the relationship, problems may continue. Stalking, or repeated and persistent attempts to impose unwanted communication or contact on another person, is a problem. In addition to abusive partner stalking when the end of the relationship is not accepted, other stalkers are "would-be lovers," pursuing relationships that have never even existed, doctors stalked by patients, or famous people stalked by "fans." Lifetime prevalence rates of stalking are one in six women and one in 19 men. Among college students, 12% to 13% reported being the victim of a stalker (Violence Prevention and Action Center/John Carroll University, 2018). Cyberstalking can be monitoring, following, or intruding into another's social media, using a false identity to get back into the person's life, or tracking his or her location with a cell phone. These have all become more common in recent years, and it has become more difficult to detect the stalker (Lund &amp; Ross, 2017).</p>
                        <p>Battered women's shelters can provide temporary housing and food for abused women and their children when they decide to leave the abusive relationship. In many cities, however, shelters are crowded; some have waiting lists, and the relief they provide is temporary. The woman leaving an abusive relationship may have no financial support and limited job skills or experience. Often, she has dependent children. These barriers are difficult to overcome, and public or private assistance is limited.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the many physical injuries that abused women may experience, there are emotional and psychological consequences. Individual psychotherapy or counseling, group therapy, or support and self-help groups can help abused women deal with their trauma and begin to build new, healthier relationships. Battering may also result in PTSD, which is discussed later in this chapter.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Child Abuse</h2>
                        <p>Child abuse or maltreatment generally is defined as the intentional injury of a child. It can include physical abuse or injuries, neglect or failure to prevent harm, failure to provide adequate physical or emotional care or supervision, abandonment, sexual assault or intrusion, and overt torture or maiming. In the United States, each state defines child maltreatment, identifies specific reporting procedures, and establishes service delivery systems. Although similarities exist among the laws of all states, there is also a great deal of variation. For this reason, accurate data on the type, frequency, and severity of child maltreatment across the country are difficult to obtain.</p>
                        <p>During 2014 in the United States, 702,000 victims were identified from over 6.6 million reports. Of these cases, 75% were neglect, 17% physical abuse, 8% sexual abuse, and 6% emotional/psychological maltreatment. An estimated 1,580 children died as a result of maltreatment with 70% under the age of 3 (Bernet &amp; Freeman, 2017). Fathers, stepfathers, uncles, older siblings, and live-in partners of the child's mother often perpetrate abuse on girls. About 75% of reported cases involve father–daughter incest; mother–son incest is much less frequent. Estimates are that 15 million women in the United States were sexually abused as children, and one-third of all sexually abused victims were molested when they were younger than 9. Accurate statistics on sexual abuse are difficult to obtain because many incidences are unreported as a result of shame and embarrassment. In other cases, women do not acknowledge sexual abuse until they are adults. Adults with a history of childhood sexual abuse are at a higher risk for depression, suicide attempts, marital problems, marriage to an alcoholic, smoking, alcohol abuse, chronic pain, and medically unexplained symptoms (Steine et al., 2017).</p>

                            <p>The nurse has seen Johnny before for a variety of bruises, injuries, and even a burn on his hands. In the past, Johnny's mother has described him as clumsy, always tripping and falling down. She says he's a "daredevil," always trying stunts with his bike or rollerblades or climbing trees and falling or jumping to the ground. She says she has tried everything but can't slow him down.</p>
                            <p>When the nurse talks to Johnny, he is reluctant to discuss the bruise on his face. He does not make eye contact with the nurse and gives a vague explanation for his bruise, "I guess I ran into something." The nurse suspects that someone at home is abusing Johnny.</p>

                        <h3>Types of Child Abuse</h3>
                        <p><strong>Physical abuse</strong> of children often results from unreasonably severe corporal punishment or unjustifiable punishment such as hitting an infant for crying or soiling his or her diapers. Intentional, deliberate assaults on children include burning, biting, cutting, poking, twisting limbs, or scalding with hot water. The victim often has evidence of old injuries (e.g., scars, untreated fractures, or multiple bruises of various ages) that the history given by parents or caregivers does not explain adequately.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sexual abuse</strong> involves sexual acts performed by an adult on a child younger than 18 years. Examples include incest, rape, and sodomy performed directly by the person or with an object, oral-genital contact, and acts of molestation such as rubbing, fondling, or exposing the adult's genitals. Sexual abuse may consist of a single incident or multiple episodes over a protracted period. A second type of sexual abuse involves exploitation, such as making, promoting, or selling pornography involving minors, and coercion of minors to participate in obscene acts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Neglect</strong> is malicious or ignorant withholding of physical, emotional, or educational necessities for the child's well-being. Child abuse by neglect is the most prevalent type of maltreatment and includes refusal to seek health care or delay doing so; abandonment; inadequate supervision; reckless disregard for the child's safety; punitive, exploitive, or abusive emotional treatment; spousal abuse in the child's presence; giving the child permission to be truant; or failing to enroll the child in school.</p>
                        <p><strong>Psychological abuse (emotional abuse)</strong> includes verbal assaults, such as blaming, screaming, name-calling, and using sarcasm; constant family discord characterized by fighting, yelling, and chaos; and emotional deprivation or withholding of affection, nurturing, and normal experiences that engender acceptance, love, security, and self-worth. Emotional abuse often accompanies other types of abuse (e.g., physical or sexual abuse). Exposure to parental alcoholism, drug use, or prostitution—and the neglect that results—also falls within this category.</p>

                        <h3>Clinical Picture</h3>
                        <p>Parents who abuse their children often have minimal parenting knowledge and skills. They may not understand or know what their children need, or they may be angry or frustrated because they are emotionally or financially unequipped to meet those needs. Although lack of education and poverty contribute to child abuse and neglect, they by no means explain the entire phenomenon. Many incidences of abuse and violence occur in families who seem to have everything; the parents are well educated, with successful careers, and the family is financially stable.</p>
                        <p>Parents who abuse their children often are emotionally immature, needy, and incapable of meeting their own needs much less those of a child. As in spousal abuse, the abuser frequently views his or her children as property belonging to the abusing parent. The abuser does not consider the children people with rights and feelings. In some instances, the parent feels the need to have children to replace his or her own faulty and disappointing childhood; the parent wants to feel the love between child and parent that he or she missed as a child. But the reality of the tremendous emotional, physical, and financial demands that come with raising children usually shatters these unrealistic expectations. When the parent's unrealistic expectations are not met, he or she often reverts to using the same methods his or her parents used.</p>
                        <p>This tendency for adults to raise their children in the same way they were raised perpetuates the cycle of family violence. Adults who were victims of abuse as children frequently abuse their own children (Bernet &amp; Freeman, 2017).</p>

                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>As with all types of family violence, detection and accurate identification are the first steps. Box 12.3 lists signs that might lead the nurse to suspect neglect or abuse. Burns or scalds may have an identifiable shape, such as cigarette marks, or may have a “stocking and glove” distribution, indicating scalding. The parent of an infant with a severe skull fracture may report that he or she “rolled off the couch,” even though the child is too young to do so or the injury is much too severe for such a shortfall. Bruises may have familiar, recognizable shapes such as belt buckles or teeth marks.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Serious injuries such as fractures, burns, or lacerations with no reported history of trauma</li>
                                <li>Delay in seeking treatment for a significant injury</li>
                                <li>Child or parent giving a history inconsistent with severity of injury, such as a baby with contrecoup injuries to the brain (shaken baby syndrome) that the parents claim happened when the infant rolled off the sofa</li>
                                <li>Inconsistencies or changes in the child’s history during the evaluation by either the child or the adult</li>
                                <li>Unusual injuries for the child’s age and level of development, such as a fractured femur in a 2-month-old or a dislocated shoulder in a 2-year-old</li>
                                <li>High incidence of urinary tract infections; bruised, red, or swollen genitalia; tears or bruising of rectum or vagina</li>
                                <li>Evidence of old injuries not reported, such as scars, fractures not treated, and multiple bruises that parent/caregiver cannot explain adequately</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <p>Children who have been sexually abused may have urinary tract infections; bruised, red, or swollen genitalia; tears of the rectum or vagina; and bruising. The emotional response of these children varies widely. Often, these children talk or behave in ways that indicate more advanced knowledge of sexual issues than would be expected for their ages. At other times, they are frightened and anxious and may either cling to an adult or reject adult attention entirely. The key is to recognize when the child’s behavior is outside what is normally expected for his or her age and developmental stage. Seemingly unexplained behavior, from refusal to eat to aggressive behavior with peers, may indicate abuse.</p>
                        <p>The nurse does not have to decide with certainty that abuse has occurred. Nurses are responsible for reporting suspected child abuse with accurate and thorough documentation of assessment data. All 50 states have laws, often called mandatory reporting laws, that require nurses to report suspected abuse. The nurse alone or in consultation with other health team members (e.g., physicians or social workers) may report suspected abuse to appropriate local governmental authorities. In some states, that authority is Child Protective Services, Children and Family Services, or the Department of Health. The number to call can be located in the local telephone book. The reporting person may remain anonymous if desired. People who work in such agencies have special education in the investigation of abuse. Questions must be asked in ways that do not further traumatize the child or impede any possible legal actions. The generalist nurse should not pursue investigation with the child; it may do more harm than good.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment and Intervention</h3>
                        <p>The first part of treatment for child abuse or neglect is to ensure the child's safety and well-being. This may involve removing the child from the home, which also can be traumatic. Given the high risk of psychological problems, a thorough psychiatric evaluation also is indicated. A relationship of trust between the therapist and the child is crucial to help the child deal with the trauma of abuse. Depending on the severity and duration of abuse and the child's response, therapy may be indicated over a significant period.</p>
                        <p>Long-term treatment for the child usually involves professionals from several disciplines, such as psychiatry, social work, and psychology. The very young child may communicate best through play therapy, where he or she draws or acts out situations with puppets or dolls rather than talks about what has happened or his or her feelings. Social service agencies are involved in determining whether returning the child to the parental home is possible based on whether parents can show benefit from treatment. Family therapy may be indicated if reuniting the family is feasible. Parents may require psychiatric or substance abuse treatment. If the child is unlikely to return home, short-term or long-term foster care services may be indicated.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Elder Abuse</h2>
                        <p>Elder abuse is the maltreatment of older adults by family members or others in a caregiver role. It may include physical and sexual abuse, psychological abuse, neglect, self-neglect, financial exploitation, and denial of adequate medical treatment. It is estimated that one in 10 people over age 65 are injured, exploited, abused, or neglected by their caregivers, but few elder maltreatment cases are reported. Perpetrators of the abuse are most likely living with the victim and/or related to the victim as well as having legal or psychological problems themselves. Most victims of elder abuse are 75 years or older; 60% to 65% are women. Abuse is more likely when the elder has multiple chronic mental and physical health problems and when he or she is dependent on others for food, medical care, and various activities of daily living (Greenwood, Haroun, &amp; Naimark, 2017).</p>

                        <p>Persons who abuse elders are almost always in a caregiver role, or the elders depend on them in some way. Most cases of elder abuse occur when one older spouse is taking care of another. This type of spousal abuse usually happens over many years after a disability renders the abused spouse unable to care for him or herself. When the abuser is an adult child, it is twice as likely to be a son as a daughter. A psychiatric disorder or a problem with substance abuse may aggravate abuse of elders.</p>
                        <p>Bullying has also been identified in senior living facilities between residents. Verbal and social bullying is most common. Both victims and perpetrators were reported having cognitive and physical disabilities (Andresen &amp; Buchanan, 2017). Educational programs on safe interventions for bullying between residents are indicated.</p>
                        <p>Elders are often reluctant to report abuse, even when they can, because the abuse usually involves family members whom the elder wishes to protect. Victims also often fear losing their support and being moved to an institution.</p>
                        <p>No national estimates of abuse of elders living in institutions are available. However, under a 1978 federal mandate, ombudsmen are allowed to visit nursing homes to check on the care of the elderly. These ombudsmen report that complaints of elder abuse are common in institutions, though not all complaints are substantiated.</p>

                        <h3>Clinical Picture</h3>
                        <p>The victim may have bruises or fractures; may lack needed eyeglasses or hearing aids; may be denied food, fluids, or medications; or may be restrained in a bed or chair. The abuser may use the victim's financial resources for his or her own pleasure, while the elder cannot afford food or medications. Abusers may withhold medical care from an elder with acute or chronic illness. Self-neglect involves the elder's failure to care for him or herself.</p>

                            <p>Josephine is an elderly woman who has moved in with her son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren after the death of her husband. She lives in a finished basement apartment with her own bath. Friction with her daughter-in-law begins to develop when Josephine tries to help out around the house. She comments on the poor manners and outlandish clothes of her teenaged grandchildren. She adds spices to food her daughter-in-law is cooking on the stove. She comments on how late the children stay out, their friends, and how hard her son works. All this is annoying but harmless.</p>
                            <p>Josephine’s daughter-in-law gets impatient, telling her husband, “I’m the one who has to deal with your mother all day long.” One day, after another criticism from Josephine, the daughter-in-law slaps her. She then tells Josephine to go downstairs to her room and stay out of sight if she wants to have a place to live. A friend of Josephine's calls on the phone, and the daughter-in-law lies and tells her Josephine is sleeping.</p>
                            <p>Josephine spends more time alone in her room, becomes more isolated and depressed, and is eating and sleeping poorly. She is afraid she will be placed in a nursing home if she doesn't get along better with her daughter-in-law. Her son seems too busy to notice what is happening, and Josephine is afraid to tell him for fear he won't believe her or will take his wife's side. Her friends don't seem to call much anymore, and she has no one to talk to about how miserable she is. She just stays by herself most of the day.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Careful assessment of elderly persons and their caregiving relationships is essential in detecting elder abuse. Often, determining whether the elder's condition results from deterioration associated with a chronic illness or from abuse is difficult. Several potential indicators of abuse require further assessment and careful evaluation (Box 12.4). These indicators by themselves, however, do not necessarily signify abuse or neglect.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Box 12.4 Possible Indicators of Elder Abuse</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li><strong>Physical Abuse Indicators:</strong> Frequent, unexplained injuries; reluctance to seek medical treatment; disorientation; fear/edginess around caregiver.</li>
                                <li><strong>Psychosocial Abuse Indicators:</strong> Change in mood/behavior; isolation; helplessness; anger/agitation; withdrawal/depression.</li>
                                <li><strong>Material Abuse Indicators:</strong> Unpaid bills; sudden sale of property; unusual bank activity; missing valuables; lack of affordable items.</li>
                                <li><strong>Neglect Indicators:</strong> Poor hygiene; lack of medication; hazardous living environment; malnutrition; dehydration.</li>
                                <li><strong>Indicators of Self-Neglect:</strong> Inability to manage finances/ADLs; wandering; refusing medical attention; confusion.</li>
                                <li><strong>Warning Indicators From Caregiver:</strong> Not allowing elder to speak; indifference/anger; blaming elder; defensiveness; conflicting accounts; history of abuse/substance issues.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <p>The nurse should suspect abuse if injuries have been hidden or untreated or are incompatible with the explanation provided. Such injuries can include cuts, lacerations, puncture wounds, bruises, welts, or burns. Burns can be cigarette burns, scaldings, acid or caustic burns, or friction burns of the wrists or ankles caused from being restrained by ropes, clothing, or chains. Signs of physical neglect include a pervasive smell of urine or feces, dirt, rashes, sores, lice, or inadequate clothing. Dehydration or malnourishment not linked with a specific illness also strongly indicates abuse.</p>
                        <p>Possible indicators of emotional or psychological abuse include an elder who is hesitant to talk openly to the nurse or who is fearful, withdrawn, depressed, and helpless. The elder may also exhibit anger or agitation for no apparent reason. He or she may deny any problems, even when the facts indicate otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Possible indicators of self-neglect include inability to manage money (hoarding or squandering while failing to pay bills), inability to perform activities of daily living (personal care, shopping, food preparation, and cleaning), and changes in intellectual function (confusion, disorientation, inappropriate responses, and memory loss and isolation). Other indicators of self-neglect include signs of malnutrition or dehydration, rashes or sores on the body, an odor of urine or feces, or failure to keep necessary medical appointments. For self-neglect to be diagnosed, the elder must be evaluated as unable to manage day-to-day life and take care of him or herself. Self-neglect cannot be established solely on the basis of family members' beliefs that the elder cannot manage his or her finances. For example, an older adult cannot be considered to have self-neglect just because he or she gives away large sums of money to a group or charity or invests in some venture of which family members disapprove.</p>
                        <p>Warnings of financial exploitation or abuse may include numerous unpaid bills (when the client has enough money to pay them), unusual activity in bank accounts, checks signed by someone other than the elder, or recent changes in a will or power of attorney when the elder cannot make such decisions. The elder may lack amenities that he or she can afford, such as clothing, personal products, or a television. The elder may report losing valuable possessions and report that he or she has no contact with friends or relatives.</p>
                        <p>The nurse may also detect possible indicators of abuse from the caregiver. The caregiver may complain about how difficult caring for the elder is, incontinence, difficulties in feeding, or excessive costs of medication. He or she may display anger or indifference toward the elder and try to keep the nurse from talking with the elder alone. Elder abuse is more likely when the caregiver has a history of family violence or alcohol or drug problems.</p>
                        <p>All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have laws governing adult protective services. These cover elder citizens and, in most states, include adults who are considered dependent, disabled, or impaired and who must rely on others to meet basic needs. These laws provide a system for defining, reporting, and investigating abuse, as well as providing services to victims. However, abuse reporting for elders or dependent adults is not mandatory in all states and territories. Nurses should be familiar with the laws or statutes for reporting abuse in their own states. Many cases remain unreported. The local agency on aging can provide procedures for reporting abuse in accordance with state laws. To find a local agency, go online and enter adult protective services to be directed to local addresses and phone numbers in the area where you want to report.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment and Intervention</h3>
                        <p>Elder abuse may develop gradually as the burden of care exceeds the caregiver's physical or emotional resources. Relieving the caregiver's stress and providing additional resources may help correct the abusive situation and leave the caregiving relationship intact. In other cases, the neglect or abuse is intentional and designed to provide personal gain to the caregiver, such as access to the victim's financial resources. In these situations, removal of the elder or caregiver is necessary.</p>

                    <!-- Rape and Sexual Assault -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="rape-sexual-assault">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Rape and Sexual Assault</h2>
                        <p>Rape is the perpetration of an act of sexual intercourse with a person against his or her will and without her consent, whether that will is overcome by force, fear of force, drugs, or intoxicants. Rape is a crime of violence and humiliation of the victim expressed through sexual means. It is also considered rape if the victim is incapable of exercising rational judgment because of mental deficiency or because he or she is younger than the age of consent (which varies among states from 14 to 18 years; Stromberg, 2017). The crime of rape requires only slight penetration of the outer vulva or rectum; full erection and ejaculation are not necessary. Forced acts of oral sex and anal penetration, although they frequently accompany rape, are legally considered sodomy, which is still sexual assault. The person who is raped may also be physically beaten and injured.</p>
                        <p>Rape can occur between strangers, acquaintances, married persons, and persons of the same sex, though seven states define domestic violence in a way that excludes same-sex victims. Only 28% of rapes are committed by strangers, 7% for child victims (Rape Abuse &amp; Incest National Network [RAINN], 2018). A phenomenon called date rape (acquaintance rape) may occur on a first date, on a ride home from a party, or when the two people have known each other for some time. It is more prevalent around or on college campuses. The rate of serious injuries associated with dating violence increases with increased consumption of alcohol by either the victim or the perpetrator.</p>
                        <p>Rape is a highly underreported crime, less than one half of all rapes are estimated to be reported. The underreporting is attributed to the victim's feelings of shame and guilt, the fear of further injury, and the belief that he or she has no recourse in the legal system. Victims of rape can be any age; reported cases have victims ranging in age from 15 months to 82 years. The highest incidence is in girls and women 16 to 24 years of age. Girls younger than 20 years were the victims in 80% of rapes reported (Stromberg, 2017).</p>
                        <p>Rape most commonly occurs in the victim's neighborhood, often inside or near the home. Most rapes are premeditated. As many as 50% of female victims do not acknowledge a sexual assault, minimizing it as a misunderstanding or a lesser event (Stromberg, 2017). This is particularly true if the perpetrator is known to the woman or is in a power position, such as a manager at work, a family member, or someone of distinction in the community.</p>
                        <p>Male rape is also a significantly underacknowledged and underreported crime. It can occur between gay partners or strangers, but it is most prevalent in institutions such as prisons. Over 80,000 male inmates are sexually assaulted each year, but the figure may be much higher; 60% of the sexual violence is perpetrated by prison or jail staff. This type of rape is particularly violent, and the dynamics of power and control correspond to that of heterosexual rape (RAINN, 2018).</p>

                        <h3>Dynamics of Rape</h3>
                        <p>Of men who commit rape, 50% are age 30 and older; 25% are between 21 and 29. In terms of race, 57% are white. Alcohol is involved in 34% of cases. Rape often accompanies another crime. Almost 75% of arrested rapists have prior criminal histories, including other rapes, assaults, robberies, and homicides (RAINN, 2018).</p>
                        <p>In the past, rape and its perpetrators were described in terms of motivation or dynamics (e.g., power, anger, opportunity). Those categories weren't particularly useful since they were designed around the "rape by a stranger" idea, which is not usually the circumstance. It is generally accepted that rape is not a sexual crime but rather the perpetrator's exertion of power, control, infliction of pain, or punishment for perceived wrongs.</p>
                        <p>Feminist theory proposes that women have historically served as objects of aggression, dating back to when women (and children) were legally the property of men. In 1982, for the first time, a married man was convicted of raping his wife, signaling the end of the notion that sexual intercourse could not be denied in the context of marriage.</p>
                        <p>Women who are raped are frequently in life-threatening situations, so their primary motivation is to stay alive. At times, attempts to resist or fight the attacker succeed; in other situations, fighting and yelling result in more severe physical injuries or even death. Degree of submission is higher when the attacker has a weapon such as a gun or knife. In addition to forcible penetration, the more violent rapist may urinate or defecate on the woman or insert foreign objects into her vagina and rectum.</p>
                        <p>The physical and psychological trauma that rape victims suffer is severe. Related medical problems can include acute injury, sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, and lingering medical complaints. A cross-sectional study of medical patients found that women who had been raped rated themselves as significantly less healthy, visited a physician twice as often, and incurred medical costs more than twice as high as women who had not experienced any criminal victimization. The level of violence experienced during the assault was found to be a powerful predictor of future use of medical services. Many victims of rape experience fear, helplessness, shock, disbelief, guilt, humiliation, and embarrassment. They may also avoid the place or circumstances of the rape; give up previously pleasurable activities; experience depression, anxiety, PTSD, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, and impaired memory; or contemplate suicide (Ba &amp; Bhopal, 2017). Until recently, the rights of rape victims were often ignored. For example, when rape victims reported a rape to authorities, they often faced doubt and embarrassing questions from police officers. The courts did not protect the rights of victims; for example, a woman's past sexual behavior was admissible in court even though the past criminal record of her accused attacker was not. Laws to correct these problems have been enacted on a state-by-state basis since the mid-1980s and continue to be enacted.</p>
                        <p>Although the treatment of rape victims and the prosecution of rapists have improved in the past two decades, many people still believe that a woman provokes rape with her behavior and that the woman is partially responsible for this crime. Box 12.5 summarizes common myths and misunderstandings about rape.</p>

                                <li>Rape usually happens between strangers.</li>

                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>To preserve possible evidence, the physical examination should occur before the victim has showered, brushed teeth, douched, changed clothes, or had anything to drink. This may not be possible because the victim may have done some of these things before seeking care. If there is no report of oral sex, then rinsing the mouth or drinking fluids can be permitted immediately.</p>
                        <p>To assess the patient’s physical status, the nurse asks the victim to describe what happened. If he or she cannot do so, the nurse may ask needed questions gently and with care. Rape kits and rape protocols are available in most emergency department settings and provide the equipment and instructions needed to collect physical evidence. The physician or a specially trained sexual assault nurse examiner is primarily responsible for this step of the examination.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment and Intervention</h3>
                        <p>Victims of rape fare best when they receive immediate support and can express fear and rage to family members, nurses, physicians, and law enforcement officials who believe them. Education about rape and the needs of victims is an ongoing requirement for health care professionals, law enforcement officers, and the general public.</p>
                        <p>Box 12.6 lists warning signs of relationship violence. These signs can educate students and others about date rape and can alert people to the characteristics of people who are likely to commit dating violence. Examples include expressing negativity about women, acting tough, engaging in heavy drinking, exhibiting jealousy, making belittling comments, expressing anger, and using intimidation.</p>

                            </ul>

                        <p>Rape treatment centers (emergency services that coordinate psychiatric, gynecologic, and physical trauma services in one location and work with law enforcement agencies) are most helpful to the victim. In the emergency setting, the nurse is an essential part of the team in providing emotional support to the victim. The nurse should allow the victim to proceed at his or her own pace and not rush through any interview or examination procedures.</p>
                        <p>Giving as much control as possible back to the victim is important. Ways to do so include allowing him or her to make decisions when possible about whom to call, what to do next, what he or she would like done, and so on. It is the victim’s decision about whether or not to file charges and testify against the perpetrator. The victim must sign consent forms before any photographs or hair and nail samples are taken for future evidence.</p>
                        <p>Prophylactic treatment for sexually transmitted diseases is offered. Doing so is cost-effective; many victims of rape will not return to get definitive test results for these diseases. HIV testing is strongly encouraged at specified intervals because seroconversion to positive status does not occur immediately. Victims are also encouraged to engage in safe-sex practices until the results of HIV testing are available. Prophylaxis with ethinyl estradiol and norgestrel (Ovral) can be offered to prevent pregnancy. Some women may elect to wait to initiate intervention until they have a positive pregnancy test result or miss a menstrual period.</p>
                        <p>Rape crisis centers, advocacy groups, and other local resources often provide a counselor or volunteer to be with the victim from the emergency department through longer-term follow-up. This person provides emotional support, serves as an advocate for the victim throughout the process, and can be totally available to the victim. This type of complete and unconditional support is often crucial to recovery.</p>
                        <p>Therapy is usually supportive in approach and focuses on restoring the victim's sense of control; relieving feelings of helplessness, dependency, and obsession with the assault that frequently follow rape; regaining trust; improving daily functioning; finding adequate social support; and dealing with feelings of guilt, shame, and anger. Group therapy with other victims who have been raped is a particularly effective treatment. Some people attend both individual and group therapies.</p>
                        <p>It often takes 1 year or more for survivors of rape to regain previous levels of functioning. In some cases, survivors of rape have long-term consequences, such as PTSD, which is discussed later in this chapter.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Community Violence</h2>
                        <p>The National Center for Education Statistics publishes annual reports about school crime and safety with the most recent data coming from the 2017 report. Death by homicide at school is less than 3%. But in recent years, multiple homicides by a single shooter are more common than one-on-one homicide at school. Multiple shootings make the news around the world. Students are trained on what to do if an active shooter comes to school, and schools have increased security in a number of ways to address safety concerns (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2017). In an effort to combat violence at school, the CDC has been working with schools to develop curricula that emphasize problem-solving skills, anger management, and social skills development. In addition, parenting programs that promote strong bonding between parents and children and conflict management in the home, as well as mentoring programs for young people, show promise in dealing with school-related violence. A few people responsible for such violence have been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, often conduct disorder, which is discussed in Chapter 23. Often, however, this violence seems to occur when alienation, disregard for others, and little regard for self predominates.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">CLINICAL VIGNETTE: Rape</h3>
                            <p>Cynthia is a 22-year-old college student who spent Saturday afternoon with a group of friends at the football game. Afterward, they were going to attend a few parties to celebrate the victory. Alcohol was served freely at these parties. At one party, Cynthia became separated from her friends, but started talking to Ron, whom she recognized from her English Lit course.</p>
                            <p>They spent the rest of the evening together, talking, dancing, and drinking. She had had more drinks than she was used to as Ron kept bringing her more every time her glass was empty. At the end of the night, Ron asked if she wanted him to drive her home. Her friends were staying longer at the party.</p>
                            <p>When Ron and Cynthia arrived at her apartment, none of her roommates had returned yet, so she asked Ron to come in. She was feeling a little tipsy, and they began kissing. She could feel Ron getting excited. He began to try to remove her skirt, but she said no and tried to move away from him. She remembered him saying, “What’s the matter with you? Are you a prude or what?” She told him she had had a good time but didn’t want to go further. He responded, “Come on, you’ve been trying to turn me on all night. You want this as much as I do.” He forced himself on top of her and held his arm over her neck and raped her.</p>
                            <p>When her roommates return in an hour, Cynthia is huddled in the corner of her room, seems stunned, and is crying uncontrollably. She feels sick and confused. Did she do something to cause this whole thing? She keeps asking herself whether she might not have gotten into that situation had she not been a little tipsy.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Bullying is another problem experienced at school, including verbal aggression; physical acts from shoving to breaking bones; targeting a student to be shunned or ignored by others; and cyberbullying involving unwanted e-mails, text messages, or pictures posted on the internet. Adolescent suicide, substance use, self-harm ideation and actions, and moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression are correlated with bullying.</p>
                        <p>Ostracism, ignoring and excluding a target individual, has recently emerged as one of the more common and damaging forms of bullying. The victim experiences threats to belonging, self-esteem, meaningful existence, and sense of control. Ostracism may pose an even greater threat to children’s adjustment than bullying (Heithaus, Twyman, &amp; Braddock, 2017).</p>
                        <p>Nearly one-third of the U.S. students report they experience bullying, either as a target or as a perpetrator. The frequency of bullying was highest among sixth through eighth graders. Children who were bullied reported more loneliness and difficulty making friends, and those who bullied were more likely to have poor grades and use alcohol and tobacco. Children with special physical health care needs are bullied more often, and children with chronic emotional, behavioral, or developmental problems are more likely to be victims of bullying (Pinquart, 2017).</p>
                        <p>Hazing, or initiation rites, is prevalent in both high school and college. Victims may be subjected to humiliating activities, or even illegal activities. Hazing has reported negative consequences such as fighting; being injured; hurting other people; doing poorly in school; difficulty eating, sleeping, or concentrating; and experiencing feelings of anger, confusion, embarrassment, or guilt. Hazing activities are most often associated with athletic teams, fraternities or other groups offering special status, prestige, recognition/admiration, and/or a sense of belonging. The anticipation of these benefits helps lure students to participate, as well as the negative consequences that refusal may bring. Alcohol consumption, humiliation, isolation, sleep deprivation, and sex acts are hazing practices common across students' groups, not limited to fraternities/sororities or athletics (Jeckell, Copenhaver, &amp; Diamond, 2018).</p>
                        <p>Exposure to community violence tremendously affects children and young adults. When children witness violence, they experience stress-related symptoms that increase with the amount of violence they see. In addition, witnessing violence can lead to future problems with aggression, depression, relationships, achievement, and abuse of drugs and alcohol. Addressing the problem of violence exposure may help alleviate the cycle of dysfunction and further violence.</p>
                        <p>On a larger scale, violence such as the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania in 2001 also has far-reaching effects on citizens. In the immediate aftermath, children were afraid to go to school or have their parents leave them for any reason. Adults had difficulty going to work, leaving their homes, using public transportation, and flying. One year later, one in 10 New York area residents suffered lingering stress and depression as a result of September 11, and an additional 532,240 cases of PTSD had been reported in the New York City metropolitan area alone. In addition, people reported higher relapse rates of depression and anxiety disorders. There was no increase in PTSD nationwide as a result of individuals watching the attacks and associated coverage on television, however, which had been an initial concern.</p>
                        <p>Prevalence rates of PTSD and depression remain elevated 15 years later (Adams et al., 2019). Early intervention and treatment are key to dealing with victims of violence. After several instances of school or workplace shootings, counseling, referrals, and ongoing treatment were instituted immediately to help those involved deal with the horror of their experiences. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, teams of physicians, therapists, and other health professionals many associated with universities and medical centers) have been working with survivors, families, and others affected. Despite such efforts, many people will continue to experience long-term difficulties, as described in Chapter 13.</p>

                        <p>Nurses are sometimes reluctant to ask women about abuse, partly because they may believe some common myths about abuse. They may believe that questions about abuse will offend the client or fear that incorrect interventions will worsen the situation. Nurses may even believe that a woman who stays in an abusive relationship might deserve or enjoy the abuse or that abuse between husband and wife is private. Some nurses may believe abuse to be a societal or legal, not a health, problem.</p>
                        <p>Listening to stories of family violence or rape is difficult; the nurse may feel horror or revulsion. Because clients often watch for the nurse’s reaction, containing these feelings and focusing on the client’s needs are important. The nurse must be prepared to listen to the client’s story, no matter how disturbing, and support and validate the client's feelings with comments such as "That must have been terrifying" or "Sounds like you were afraid for your life." The nurse must convey acceptance and regard for the client as a person with worth and dignity regardless of the circumstances. These clients often have low self-esteem and guilt. They must learn to accept and face what has occurred. If the client believes that the nurse can accept him or her after hearing what has happened, he or she then may gain self-acceptance. Although this acceptance is often painful, it is essential to healing. The nurse must remember that he or she cannot fix or change things; the nurse's role is to listen and convey acceptance and support for the client.</p>
                        <p>Nurses with personal histories of abuse or trauma must seek professional assistance to deal with these issues before working with survivors of trauma or abuse. Such nurses can be effective and supportive of other survivors but only after engaging in therapeutic work and accepting and understanding their own trauma.</p>
