                        <p>Everyone occasionally feels sad, low, and tired, with the desire to stay in bed and shut out the world. These episodes are often accompanied by <strong>anergia</strong> (lack of energy), exhaustion, agitation, noise intolerance, and slow thinking processes, all of which make decisions difficult.</p>

                        <p>Work, family, and social responsibilities drive most people to proceed with their daily routines, even when nothing seems to go right and their irritable mood is obvious to all. Such "low periods" pass in a few days, and energy returns. Fluctuations in mood are so common to the human condition that we think nothing of hearing someone saying, "I'm depressed because I have too much to do." Everyday use of the word "depressed" doesn't actually mean that the person is clinically depressed but rather that the person is just having a bad day. Sadness in mood can also be a response to misfortune; death of a friend or relative, financial problems, or loss of a job may cause a person to grieve (see Chapter 10).</p>
                        <p>At the other end of the mood spectrum are episodes of exaggeratedly energetic behavior. The person has the sure sense that he or she can take on any task or relationship. In an elated mood, stamina for work, family, and social events is untiring. This feeling of being "on top of the world" also recedes in a few days to a euthymic mood (average affect and activity). Happy events stimulate joy and enthusiasm. These mood alterations are normal and do not interfere meaningfully with the person's life.</p>
                        <p>Mood disorders, also called affective disorders, are pervasive alterations in emotions that are manifested by depression or mania or both. They interfere with a person's life, plaguing him or her with drastic and long-term sadness, agitation, or elation. Accompanying self-doubt, guilt, and anger alter life activities, especially those that involve self-esteem, occupation, and relationships.</p>
                        <p>Mood disorders are the most common psychiatric diagnoses associated with suicide; depression is one of the most important risk factors for it (Rhimer &amp; Pompili, 2017). For this reason, this chapter focuses on major depression, bipolar disorder, and suicide. It is important to note that clients with schizophrenia, substance use disorders, antisocial and borderline personality disorders, and panic disorders are also at increased risk for suicide and suicide attempts.</p>

                        <p>The primary mood disorders are major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness). A major depressive episode lasts at least 2 weeks, during which the person experiences a depressed mood or loss of pleasure in nearly all activities. Symptoms include changes in eating habits, resulting in unplanned weight gain or loss; hypersomnia or insomnia; impaired concentration, decision-making, or problem-solving abilities; inability to cope with daily life; feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, guilt, or despair; thoughts of death and/or suicide; overwhelming fatigue; and rumination with pessimistic thinking with no hope of improvement. These symptoms result in significant distress or impairment of social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. About 20% have delusions and hallucinations; this combination is referred to as psychotic depression (Akiskal, 2017).</p>
                        <p>Bipolar disorder is diagnosed when a person’s mood fluctuates to extremes of mania and/or depression, as described previously. Mania is a distinct period during which mood is abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable. Typically, this period lasts about 1 week (unless the person is hospitalized and treated sooner), but it may be longer for some individuals. Manic episodes include inflated self-esteem or grandiosity; decreased sleep; excessive and pressured speech (unrelenting, rapid, often loud talking without pauses); flight of ideas (racing, often unconnected, thoughts); distractibility; increased activity or psychomotor agitation; and excessive involvement in pleasure-seeking or risk-taking activities with a high potential for painful consequences. The person’s mood may be excessively cheerful, enthusiastic, and expansive, or the person may be irritable, especially when he or she is told no or has rules to follow. The person often denies any problems, placing the blame on others for any difficulties he or she experiences. Some people also exhibit delusions and hallucinations during a manic episode.</p>
                        <p>Hypomania is a period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and some other milder symptoms of mania. The difference is that hypomanic episodes do not impair the person’s ability to function (in fact, he or she may be quite productive), and there are no psychotic features (delusions and hallucinations). A mixed episode is diagnosed when the person experiences both mania and depression nearly every day for at least 1 week. These mixed episodes are often called rapid cycling (Akiskal, 2017).</p>

                        <h3>Related Disorders</h3>
                        <p>Other disorders classified with similarities to mood disorders include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Persistent depressive (dysthymic) disorder</strong> is a chronic, persistent mood disturbance characterized by symptoms such as insomnia, loss of appetite, decreased energy, low self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of sadness and hopelessness that are milder than those of depression.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder</strong> is a persistent angry or irritable mood, punctuated by severe, recurrent temper outbursts that are not in keeping with the provocation or situation, beginning before age 10.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cyclothymic disorder</strong> is characterized by mild mood swings between hypomania and depression without loss of social or occupational functioning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Substance-induced depressive or bipolar disorder</strong> is characterized by a significant disturbance in mood that is a direct physiological consequence of ingested substances such as alcohol, other drugs, or toxins.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)</strong> has two subtypes. In one, most commonly called winter depression or fall-onset SAD, people experience increased sleep, appetite, and carbohydrate cravings; weight gain; interpersonal conflict; irritability; and heaviness in the extremities beginning in late autumn and abating in spring and summer. The other subtype, called spring-onset SAD, is less common, with symptoms of insomnia, weight loss, and poor appetite lasting from late spring or early summer until early fall. SAD is often treated with light therapy (Leahy, 2017).</li>
                            <li><strong>Postpartum or "maternity" blues</strong> is a mild, predictable mood disturbance occurring in the first several days after delivery of a baby. Symptoms include labile mood and affect, crying spells, sadness, insomnia, and anxiety.</li>
                            <li><strong>Postpartum depression</strong> is the most common complication of pregnancy in developed countries (Langan &amp; Goodbred, 2017). The symptoms are consistent with those of depression, with onset within 4 weeks of delivery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Postpartum psychosis</strong> is a severe and debilitating psychiatric illness, with acute onset in the days following childbirth. Symptoms begin with fatigue, sadness, emotional lability, poor memory, and confusion and progress to delusions, hallucinations, poor insight and judgment, and loss of contact with reality.</li>
                            <li><strong>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder</strong> is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome and is defined as recurrent, moderate psychological and physical symptoms that occur during the week before menses and resolving with menstruation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nonsuicidal self-injury</strong> involves deliberate, intentional cutting, burning, scraping, hitting, or interference with wound healing.</li>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Etiology</h2>

                        <h3>Biologic Theories</h3>
                        <p><strong>Genetic Theories:</strong> Genetic studies implicate the transmission of major depression in first-degree relatives who are at twice the risk for developing depression compared with the general population. First-degree relatives of people with bipolar disorder have a sevenfold risk for developing bipolar disorder compared with a 1% risk in the general population. For all mood disorders, monozygotic (identical) twins have a concordance rate two to four times higher than that of dizygotic (fraternal) twins.</p>
                        <p><strong>Neurochemical Theories:</strong> Neurochemical influences of neurotransmitters focus on serotonin and norepinephrine as the two major biogenic amines implicated in mood disorders. Deficits of serotonin, its precursor tryptophan, or a metabolite (5-hydroxyindole acetic acid) of serotonin found in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid occur in people with depression. Norepinephrine levels may be deficient in depression and increased in mania. This catecholamine energizes the body to mobilize during stress and inhibits kindling.</p>
                        <p><strong>Neuroendocrine Influences:</strong> Hormonal fluctuations are being studied in relation to depression. Mood disturbances have been documented in people with endocrine disorders, such as those of the thyroid, adrenal, parathyroid, and pituitary glands.</p>

                        <h3>Psychodynamic Theories</h3>
                        <p>Many psychodynamic theories about the cause of mood disorders seemed to "blame the victim" and his or her family (Markowitz &amp; Milrod, 2017). They include beliefs that depression is a reaction to a distressing life experience, or that children raised by rejecting or unloving parents are prone to feelings of insecurity and loneliness.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Considerations</h3>
                        <p>Other behaviors considered age-appropriate can mask depression. Children with depression often appear cranky. Adolescents with depression may abuse substances, join gangs, engage in risky behavior, be underachievers, or drop out of school. In adults, manifestations of depression can include substance abuse, eating disorders, compulsive behaviors such as workaholism, gambling, and hypochondriasis. Older adults who are cranky and argumentative may actually be depressed. Many somatic ailments accompany depression, and this manifestation varies among cultures.</p>

                        <h3>Onset and Clinical Course</h3>
                        <p>An untreated episode of depression can last from a few weeks to months or even years, though most episodes clear in about 6 months. Some people have a single episode of depression, while 50% to 60% will have a recurrence of depression. Approximately 20% will develop a chronic form of depression.</p>

                        <h3>Treatment and Prognosis</h3>
                        <p><strong>Psychopharmacology:</strong> Major categories of antidepressants include cyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and atypical antidepressants. The choice of which antidepressant to use is based on the client's symptoms, age, and physical health needs.</p>

                            <p>Serotonin syndrome occurs when there is an inadequate washout period between taking MAOIs and SSRIs or when MAOIs are combined with meperidine. Symptoms include:</p>

                            <p>MAOIs can cause potentially fatal interactions with Amphetamines, Ephedrine, Fenfluramine, Isoproterenol, Meperidine, Phenylephrine, Phenylpropanolamine, Pseudoephedrine, SSRIs, Tricyclic antidepressants, and Tyramine.</p>

                        <p><strong>Other Medical Treatments:</strong> Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves application of electrodes to the head of the client to deliver an electrical impulse to the brain; this causes a seizure. It is believed that the shock stimulates brain chemistry to correct the chemical imbalance of depression. Clients usually receive a series of six to 15 treatments.</p>
                        <p><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> A combination of psychotherapy and medications is considered the most effective treatment for depressive disorders. Cognitive therapy focuses on how the person thinks about the self, others, and the future and interprets his or her experiences.</p>

                        <h4>Assessment</h4>
                        <p><strong>History:</strong> The nurse collects assessment data from the client and family or significant others. It may take several short periods to complete the assessment because clients who are severely depressed feel exhausted and overwhelmed.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>General Appearance and Motor Behavior:</strong> Many people with depression look sad; sometimes they just look ill. The posture is often slouched with head down, and they make minimal eye contact. They have psychomotor retardation (slow body movements, slow cognitive processing, and slow verbal interaction).</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Mood and Affect:</strong> Clients with depression may describe themselves as hopeless, helpless, down, or anxious. They experience anhedonia. Their affect is sad or depressed or may be flat with no emotional expressions.</p>

They may wear clothes that reflect the elevated mood—brightly colored, flamboyant, attention-getting, and perhaps sexually suggestive. Clients experiencing a manic episode think, move, and talk fast (pressured speech).</p>

                        <p>Suicide is the intentional act of killing oneself. Suicidal thoughts are common in people with mood disorders, especially depression. Clients with psychiatric disorders, especially depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder, and borderline personality disorder, are at increased risk for suicide.</p>

                        <h3>Warnings of Suicidal Intent</h3>
                        <p>Most people with suicidal ideation send either direct or indirect signals to others about their intent to harm themselves. The nurse never ignores any hint of suicidal ideation regardless of how trivial or subtle it seems.</p>

                        <p>Intervention for suicide or suicidal ideation becomes the first priority of nursing care. The nurse assumes an authoritative role to help clients stay safe. Policies for general environmental safety include denying clients access to materials on cleaning carts, their own medications, sharp scissors, and pen knives.</p>

                        <p>Nurses working with clients who are depressed often empathize with them and also begin to feel sad or agitated. Working with clients who are manic can be exhausting. Some health care professionals consider suicidal people to be failures, immoral, or unworthy of care. To be effective, the nurse must be aware of his or her own feelings and beliefs about suicide.</p>

                        <h3>CLINICAL EXAMPLE</h3>
                        <p>June, 46 years old, is divorced with three children, 10, 13, and 16 years of age. She works in the county clerk's office and has called in sick four times in the past 2 weeks. June has lost 17 pounds in the past 2 months, is spending a lot of time in bed, but still feels exhausted "all the time."</p>
                        <p>During the admission interview, June looks overwhelmingly sad, is tearful, has her head down, and makes little eye contact. She answers the nurse's questions with one or two words. The nurse considers postponing the remainder of the interview because June seems unable to provide much information.</p>
