                        <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Schizophrenia causes distorted and bizarre thoughts, perceptions, emotions, movements, and behavior. It cannot be defined as a single illness; rather, schizophrenia is thought of as a syndrome or as a disease process with many different varieties and symptoms, much like the varieties of cancer. For decades, the public vastly misunderstood schizophrenia, fearing it as dangerous and uncontrollable and causing wild disturbances and violent outbursts. Many people believed that those with schizophrenia needed to be locked away from society and institutionalized. Only recently has the mental health community come to learn and educate the community at large that schizophrenia has many different symptoms and presentations and is an illness that medication can control. Thanks to the increased effectiveness of newer atypical antipsychotic drugs and advances in community-based treatment, many clients with schizophrenia live successfully in the community. Clients whose illness is medically supervised and whose treatment is maintained often continue to live and sometimes work in the community with family and outside support.</p>
                        <p>Schizophrenia is usually diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Rarely does it manifest in childhood. The peak incidence of onset is 15 to 25 years of age for men and 25 to 35 years of age for women. The prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated at about 1% of the total population. In the United States, this translates to nearly 3 million people who are, have been, or will be affected by the disease. The incidence and the lifetime prevalence are roughly the same throughout the world (Jablensky, 2017).</p>
                        <p>The symptoms of schizophrenia are divided into two major categories: positive or hard symptoms/signs, which include delusions, hallucinations, and grossly disorganized thinking, speech, and behavior, and negative or soft symptoms/signs, which include flat affect, lack of volition, and social withdrawal or discomfort. Box 16.1 describes these symptoms more fully.</p>

                            <h4>Negative or Soft Symptoms</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Alogia:</strong> Tendency to speak little or to convey little substance of meaning (poverty of content)</li>
                                <li><strong>Anhedonia:</strong> Feeling no joy or pleasure from life or any activities or relationships</li>

                        <p>Medication may control the positive symptoms, but frequently, the negative symptoms persist after positive symptoms have abated. The persistence of these negative symptoms over time presents a major barrier to recovery and improved functioning in the client's daily life.</p>
                        <p>Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed when the client is severely ill and has a mixture of psychotic and mood symptoms. The signs and symptoms include those of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder such as depression or bipolar disorder. The symptoms may occur simultaneously or may alternate between psychotic and mood disorder symptoms.</p>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Clinical Course -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="clinical-course">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Clinical Course</h2>
                        <p>Although the symptoms of schizophrenia are always severe, the long-term course does not always involve progressive deterioration. The clinical course varies among clients.</p>

                        <h3>Onset</h3>
                        <p>Onset may be abrupt or insidious, but most clients slowly and gradually develop signs and symptoms such as social withdrawal, unusual behavior, loss of interest in school or at work, and neglected hygiene. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is usually made when the person begins to display more actively positive symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thinking (psychosis).</p>
                        <p>When and how the illness develops seems to affect the outcome. Age at onset appears to be an important factor in how well the client fares; those who develop the illness earlier show worse outcomes than those who develop it later. Younger clients display a poorer premorbid adjustment, more prominent negative signs, and greater cognitive impairment than do older clients. Those who experience a gradual onset of the disease (about 50%) tend to have a poorer immediate- and long-term course than those who experience an acute and sudden onset.</p>

                        <h3>Immediate-Term Course</h3>
                        <p>In the years immediately after the onset of psychotic symptoms, two typical clinical patterns emerge. In one pattern, the client experiences ongoing psychosis and never fully recovers, though symptoms may shift in severity over time. In another pattern, the client experiences episodes of psychotic symptoms that alternate with episodes of relatively complete recovery from the psychosis.</p>

                        <h3>Long-Term Course</h3>
                        <p>The intensity of psychosis tends to diminish with age. Many clients with long-term impairment regain some degree of social and occupational functioning. Over time, the disease becomes less disruptive to the person's life and easier to manage but rarely can the client overcome the effects of many years of dysfunction.</p>

                    <!-- Etiology -->
                    <section class="content-section" id="etiology">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Etiology</h2>
                        <p>Whether schizophrenia is an organic disease with underlying physical brain pathology has been an important question for researchers and clinicians. Newer scientific studies began to demonstrate that schizophrenia results from a type of brain dysfunction.</p>

                        <h3>Biologic Theories</h3>
                        <p>The biologic theories of schizophrenia focus on genetic factors, neuroanatomic and neurochemical factors (structure and function of the brain), and immunovirology (the body's response to exposure to a virus).</p>

                        <h4>Genetic Factors</h4>
                        <p>Most genetic studies have focused on immediate families (i.e., parents, siblings, and offspring) to examine whether schizophrenia is genetically transmitted or inherited. Identical twins have a 50% risk of schizophrenia; if one twin has schizophrenia, the other has a 50% chance of developing it as well. Fraternal twins have only a 15% risk. Children with one biologic parent with schizophrenia have a 15% risk; the risk rises to 35% if both biologic parents have schizophrenia.</p>

                        <h4>Neuroanatomic and Neurochemical Factors</h4>
                        <p>Findings have demonstrated that people with schizophrenia have relatively less brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid than those who do not have schizophrenia. Computed tomography scans have shown enlarged ventricles in the brain and cortical atrophy. Positron emission tomography studies suggest that glucose metabolism and oxygen are diminished in the frontal cortical structures of the brain.</p>
                        <p>Neurochemical studies have consistently demonstrated alterations in the neurotransmitter systems of the brain in people with schizophrenia. Studies have implicated the actions of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, glutamate, and several neuromodulary peptides.</p>

                        <h4>Immunovirologic Factors</h4>
                        <p>Popular theories have emerged stating that exposure to a virus or the body's immune response to a virus could alter the brain physiology of people with schizophrenia. Cytokines are chemical messengers between immune cells, mediating inflammatory and immune responses. Specific cytokines also play a role in signaling the brain to produce behavioral and neurochemical changes needed in the face of physical or psychological stress to maintain homeostasis.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Cultural Considerations</h2>
                        <p>Awareness of cultural differences is important when assessing for symptoms of schizophrenia. Ideas that are considered delusional in one culture, such as beliefs in sorcery or witchcraft, may be commonly accepted by other cultures. Also, auditory or visual hallucinations, such as seeing the Virgin Mary or hearing God's voice, may be a normal part of religious experiences in some cultures.</p>
                        <p>Psychotic behavior observed in countries other than the United States or among particular ethnic groups has been identified as a "culture-bound" syndrome. Some examples include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Bouffée délirante:</strong> Syndrome found in West Africa and Haiti, characterized by a sudden outburst of agitated and aggressive behavior, marked confusion, and psychomotor excitement.</li>

                        <h3>Psychopharmacology</h3>
                        <p>The primary medical treatment for schizophrenia is psychopharmacology. Antipsychotic medications, also known as neuroleptics, are prescribed primarily for their efficacy in decreasing psychotic symptoms. They do not cure schizophrenia; rather, they are used to manage the symptoms of the disease.</p>
                        <p>The conventional, or first-generation, antipsychotic medications are dopamine antagonists. The atypical, or second-generation, antipsychotic medications are both dopamine and serotonin antagonists.</p>

                        <p>The nurse first elicits information about the client's previous history with schizophrenia to establish baseline data. He or she asks questions about how the client functioned before the crisis developed, age at onset, and previous history of hospital admissions and response.</p>
                        
                        <h4>General Appearance, Motor Behavior, and Speech</h4>
                        <p>Appearance may vary widely. Some clients appear normal, while others exhibit odd or bizarre behavior. Motor behavior may include restlessness, agitation, catatonia, or stereotypic behavior. Speech patterns may include word salad, echolalia, latency of response, or neologisms.</p>

                        <p>One hallmark symptom of schizophrenic psychosis is hallucinations (false sensory perceptions). Auditory hallucinations are the most common type, involving hearing sounds, most often voices. Visual, olfactory, tactile, gustatory, cenesthetic, and kinesthetic hallucinations may also occur.</p>

                        <h4>Self-Care Considerations</h4>
                        <p>Clients with schizophrenia may have significant self-care deficits. Inattention to hygiene and grooming needs is common. They may also fail to recognize sensations such as hunger or thirst.</p>

                        <p>Clients with schizophrenia are no longer hospitalized for long periods. Most return to live in the community with assistance provided by family and support services. Assertive community treatment programs have shown success in reducing the rate of hospital admissions by managing symptoms and medications; assisting clients with social, recreational, and vocational needs; and providing support to clients and their families. Case management services often include helping the client with housing and transportation, money management, and keeping appointments.</p>
