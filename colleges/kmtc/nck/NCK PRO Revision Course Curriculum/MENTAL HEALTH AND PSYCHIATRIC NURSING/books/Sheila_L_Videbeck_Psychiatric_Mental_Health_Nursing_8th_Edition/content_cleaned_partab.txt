<p>Offering support and encouragement to the client is important to help him or her manage anxiety responses. The nurse can validate the overwhelming feelings the client experiences while indicating the belief that the client can make needed changes and regain a sense of control. The nurse encourages the client to talk about the feelings and describe them in</p>
<p>576</p>
<p>as much detail as the client can tolerate. Because many clients try to hide their rituals and keep obsessions secret, discussing these thoughts, behaviors, and resulting feelings with the nurse is an important step. Doing so can begin to relieve some of the "burden" the client has been keeping to him or herself.</p>

<p>The nurse can teach the client about relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery. This intervention should take place when the client's anxiety is low so he or she can learn more effectively. Initially, the nurse can demonstrate and practice the techniques with the client. Then, the nurse encourages the client to practice these techniques until he or she is comfortable doing them alone. When the client has mastered relaxation techniques, he or she can begin to use them when anxiety increases. In addition to decreasing anxiety, the client gains an increased sense of control that can lead to improved self-esteem.</p>
<p>To manage anxiety and ritualistic behaviors, a baseline of frequency and duration is necessary. The client can keep a diary to chronicle situations that trigger obsessions, the intensity of the anxiety, the time spent performing rituals, and the avoidance behaviors. This record provides a clear picture for both client and nurse. The client then can begin to use exposure and response prevention behavioral techniques. Initially, the client can decrease the time he or she spends performing the ritual or delay performing the ritual while experiencing anxiety. Eventually, the client can eliminate the ritualistic response or decrease it significantly to the point that interference with daily life is minimal. Clients can use relaxation techniques to assist them in managing and tolerating the anxiety they are experiencing.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the client must be willing to engage in exposure and response prevention. These are not techniques that can be forced on the client.</p>

<p>To accomplish tasks efficiently, the client initially may need additional time to allow for rituals. For example, if breakfast is at 8 AM and the client has a 45-minute ritual before eating, the nurse must plan that time into the client's schedule. It is important for the nurse not to interrupt or to attempt to stop the ritual because doing so will escalate the client's anxiety</p>
<p>577</p>
<p>dramatically. Again, the client must be willing to make changes in his or her behavior. The nurse and client can agree on a plan to limit the time spent performing rituals. They may decide to limit the morning ritual to 40 minutes, then to 35 minutes, and so forth, taking care to decrease this time gradually at a rate the client can tolerate. When the client has completed the ritual or the time allotted has passed, the client then must engage in the expected activity. This may cause anxiety and is a time when the client can use relaxation and stress reduction techniques. At home, the client can continue to follow a daily routine or written schedule that helps him or her to stay on tasks and accomplish activities and responsibilities.</p>

<p>It is important for both the client and family to learn about OCD. They are often relieved to find the client is not “going crazy” and that the obsessions are unwanted, rather than a reflection of any “dark side” to the client’s personality. Helping the client and family talk openly about the obsessions, anxiety, and rituals eliminates the client’s need to keep these things secret and to carry the guilty burden alone. Family members can also give the client needed emotional support when they are fully informed.</p>
<p>Teaching about the importance of medication compliance to combat OCD is essential. The client may need to try different medications until his or her response is satisfactory. The chances for improved OCD symptoms are enhanced when the client takes medication and uses behavioral techniques.</p>

<p>Treatment has been effective when OCD symptoms no longer interfere with the client’s ability to carry out responsibilities. When obsessions occur, the client manages resulting anxiety without engaging in complicated or time-consuming rituals. He or she reports regained control over his or her life and the ability to tolerate and manage anxiety with minimal disruption.</p>
<p>579</p>
<p>ELDER CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>Onset of OCD after age 50 is extremely rare. Recently acquired obsessive or compulsive behavior by an elder person should alert the physician to a possible organic cause for the behavior, such as infections, degenerative disorders, brain injury, and cerebrovascular lesions, particularly in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia. Treatment then is directed at the underlying cause, and the obsessive-compulsive behaviors can improve if the underlying cause can be successfully resolved.</p>

<p>CBT that encompasses exposure and response prevention may be the first-line best practice in the treatment of OCD. Treatment can be delivered in a variety of settings, and initially, the results seem to be enduring.</p>
<p>The next step is to implement this combination therapy with different age groups, in various settings, and using different delivery methods to determine whether the enduring positive results will continue under the varying circumstances.</p>

<p>Hoarding disorder often has a late-age onset (Dozier et al., 2016). Multiple community agencies may be needed to deal with hoarding in the older adult. Treatment for hoarding in older adults may need to continue over a long period of time to reach successful outcomes.</p>

<p>Treatment for OCD involves both medication and CBT, as discussed in "Treatment" section. The therapist or treatment team can teach the client exposure and response prevention techniques, but the client will need to continue to practice those techniques at home in the community over an extended time. Successful outcomes of treatment require consistent use of the</p>
<p>580</p>
<p>techniques on a daily basis.</p>
<p>One of the promising newer developments for clients is technology-enhanced delivery. Though in its infancy, a few small studies have tried various technology-delivered techniques: bibliotherapy, telephone-delivered CBT, and computerized CBT. These technologies have promise and should be implemented in large studies to evaluate their effectiveness over time. In addition, self-help and online therapy can be an effective add-on to standard therapy. While online self-help methods alone may not produce optimal results, they might be the only type of treatment that people who are shamed and stigmatized by their OCD symptoms will be willing to seek.</p>

<p>It may be difficult for nurses and others to understand why the person cannot simply stop performing the bizarre behaviors interfering with his or her life. Why does the hand washer who has scrubbed himself raw keep washing his sore hands every hour on the hour? People with OCD are usually aware that their ritualistic behavior appears senseless or even bizarre to others. Given that, family and friends may believe that the person “should just stop” the ritualistic behavior. “Just find something else to do” or other unsolicited advice only adds to the guilt and shame that people with OCD experience.</p>
<p>It is important for the nurse (and other health professionals) to avoid taking that same point of view. Most times, people with OCD appear “perfectly normal” and therefore capable of controlling their own behaviors. The nurse must remember that overwhelming fear and anxiety interfere with the person’s ability to monitor or control their own actions.</p>
<p>In addition, OCD is often chronic in nature, with symptoms that wax and wane over time. Just because the client has some success in managing thoughts and rituals doesn’t mean they will never again need professional help in the future.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia causes distorted and bizarre thoughts, perceptions, emotions, movements, and behavior. It cannot be defined as a single illness; rather, schizophrenia is thought of as a syndrome or as a disease process with many different varieties and symptoms, much like the varieties of cancer. For decades, the public vastly misunderstood schizophrenia, fearing it as dangerous and uncontrollable and causing wild disturbances and violent outbursts. Many people believed that those with schizophrenia needed to be locked away from society and institutionalized. Only recently has the mental health community come to learn and educate the community at large that schizophrenia has many different symptoms and presentations and is an illness that medication can control. Thanks to the increased effectiveness of newer atypical antipsychotic drugs and advances in community-based treatment, many clients with schizophrenia live successfully in the community. Clients whose illness is medically supervised and whose treatment is maintained often continue to live and sometimes work in the community with family and outside support.</p>
<p>Schizophrenia is usually diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. Rarely does it manifest in childhood. The peak incidence of onset is 15 to 25 years of age for men and 25 to 35 years of age for women. The prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated at about 1% of the total population. In the United States, this translates to nearly 3 million people who are, have been, or will be affected by the disease. The incidence and the lifetime prevalence are roughly the same throughout the world (Jablensky, 2017).</p>
<p>The symptoms of schizophrenia are divided into two major categories: positive or hard symptoms/signs, which include delusions, hallucinations, and grossly disorganized thinking, speech, and behavior, and negative or soft symptoms/signs, which include flat affect, lack of volition, and social withdrawal or discomfort. Box 16.1 describes these symptoms more fully.</p>

<p>Medication may control the positive symptoms, but frequently, the negative symptoms persist after positive symptoms have abated. The persistence of these negative symptoms over time presents a major barrier to recovery and improved functioning in the client's daily life.</p>
<p>Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed when the client is severely ill and has a mixture of psychotic and mood symptoms. The signs and symptoms include those of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder such as depression or bipolar disorder. The symptoms may occur simultaneously or may alternate between psychotic and mood disorder symptoms. Some studies report that long-term outcomes for the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder are similar to those for bipolar disorder, while outcomes for the depressed type of schizoaffective disorder are similar to those for schizophrenia. Treatment for schizoaffective disorder targets both psychotic and mood symptoms. Often, second-generation antipsychotics are the best first choice for treatment.

<p>Although the symptoms of schizophrenia are always severe, the long-term course does not always involve progressive deterioration. The clinical course varies among clients.</p>

<p>Onset may be abrupt or insidious, but most clients slowly and gradually develop signs and symptoms such as social withdrawal, unusual behavior, loss of interest in school or at work, and neglected hygiene. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is usually made when the person begins to display more actively positive symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thinking (psychosis). Regardless of when and how the illness begins and the type of schizophrenia, consequences for most clients and their families are substantial and enduring.</p>
<p>When and how the illness develops seems to affect the outcome. Age at onset appears to be an important factor in how well the client fares; those who</p>
<p>591</p>
<p>develop the illness earlier show worse outcomes than those who develop it later. Younger clients display a poorer premorbid adjustment, more prominent negative signs, and greater cognitive impairment than do older clients. Those who experience a gradual onset of the disease (about 50%) tend to have a poorer immediate- and long-term course than those who experience an acute and sudden onset. Approximately one-third to one-half of clients with schizophrenia relapse within 1 year of an acute episode. Higher relapse rates are associated with nonadherence to medication, persistent substance use, caregiver criticism, and negative attitude toward treatment (Wade, Tai, Awenot, &amp; Haddock, 2017).</p>

<p>In the years immediately after the onset of psychotic symptoms, two typical clinical patterns emerge. In one pattern, the client experiences ongoing psychosis and never fully recovers, though symptoms may shift in severity over time. In another pattern, the client experiences episodes of psychotic symptoms that alternate with episodes of relatively complete recovery from the psychosis.</p>

<p>The intensity of psychosis tends to diminish with age. Many clients with long-term impairment regain some degree of social and occupational functioning. Over time, the disease becomes less disruptive to the person's life and easier to manage but rarely can the client overcome the effects of many years of dysfunction. In later life, these clients may live independently or in a structured family-type setting and may succeed at jobs with stable expectations and a supportive work environment. However, many clients with schizophrenia have difficulty functioning in the community, and few lead fully independent lives. This is primarily due to persistent negative symptoms, impaired cognition, or treatment-refractory positive symptoms (Jablensky, 2017).</p>
<p>Antipsychotic medications play a crucial role in the course of the disease and individual outcomes. They do not cure the disorder; however, they are crucial to its successful management. The more effective the client's response and adherence to his or her medication regimen, the better the client's outcome. Longer periods of untreated psychosis lead to poorer long-term</p>
<p>592</p>
<p>outcomes. Therefore, early detection and aggressive treatment of the first psychotic episode with medication and psychosocial interventions are essential to promote improved outcomes, such as lower relapse rates and improved insight, quality of life, and social functioning (Jablensky, 2017).</p>

<p>Schizoaffective disorder was described earlier. Other disorders are related to but distinguished from schizophrenia in terms of presenting symptoms and the duration or magnitude of impairment. Mojtabai et al. (2017) identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schizophreniform disorder: The client exhibits an acute, reactive psychosis for less than the 6 months necessary to meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. If symptoms persist over 6 months, the diagnosis is changed to schizophrenia. Social or occupational functioning may or may not be impaired.</li>
<li>Catatonia: Catatonia is characterized by marked psychomotor disturbance, either excessive motor activity or virtual immobility and motionlessness. Motor immobility may include catalepsy (waxy flexibility) or stupor. Excessive motor activity is apparently purposeless and not influenced by external stimuli. Other behaviors include extreme negativism, mutism, peculiar movements, echolalia, or echopraxia. Catatonia can occur with schizophrenia, mood disorders, or other psychotic disorders.</li>
<li>Delusional disorder: The client has one or more nonbizarre delusions—that is, the focus of the delusion is believable. The delusion may be persecutory, erotomanic, grandiose, jealous, or somatic in content. Psychosocial functioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously odd or bizarre.</li>
<li>Brief psychotic disorder: The client experiences the sudden onset of at least one psychotic symptom, such as delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech or behavior, which lasts from 1 day to 1 month. The episode may or may not have an identifiable stressor or may follow childbirth.</li>
<li>Shared psychotic disorder (folie à deux): Two people share a similar delusion. The person with this diagnosis develops this delusion in the context of a close relationship with someone who has psychotic delusions, most commonly siblings, parent and child, or husband and wife. The more submissive or suggestible person may rapidly improve if separated from the dominant person.</li>
<li>Schizotypal personality disorder: This involves odd, eccentric behaviors,</li>
</ul>
<p>593</p>
<p>including transient psychotic symptoms. Approximately 20% of persons with this personality disorder will eventually be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Schizotypal personality disorder is discussed in Chapter 18.</p>

<p>Whether schizophrenia is an organic disease with underlying physical brain pathology has been an important question for researchers and clinicians for as long as they have studied the illness. In the first half of the 20th century, studies focused on trying to find a particular pathologic structure associated with the disease, largely through autopsy. Such a site was not discovered. In the 1950s and 1960s, the emphasis shifted to examination of psychological and social causes. Interpersonal theorists suggested that schizophrenia resulted from dysfunctional relationships in early life and adolescence. None of the interpersonal theories has been proved, and newer scientific studies are finding more evidence to support neurologic/neurochemical causes. However, some therapists still believe that schizophrenia results from dysfunctional parenting or family dynamics. For parents or family members of persons diagnosed with schizophrenia, such beliefs cause agony over what they did "wrong" or what they could have done to help prevent it.</p>
<p>Newer scientific studies began to demonstrate that schizophrenia results from a type of brain dysfunction. In the 1970s, studies began to focus on possible neurochemical causes, which remain the primary focus of research and theory today. These neurochemical/neurologic theories are supported by the effects of antipsychotic medications, which help control psychotic symptoms, and neuroimaging tools such as computed tomography, which have shown that the brains of people with schizophrenia differ in structure and function from those of control subjects.</p>

<p>The biologic theories of schizophrenia focus on genetic factors, neuroanatomic and neurochemical factors (structure and function of the brain), and immunovirology (the body's response to exposure to a virus).</p>

<p>Most genetic studies have focused on immediate families (i.e., parents, siblings, and offspring) to examine whether schizophrenia is genetically</p>
<p>594</p>
<p>transmitted or inherited. Few have focused on more distant relatives. The most important studies have centered on twins; these findings have demonstrated that identical twins have a 50% risk of schizophrenia; that is, if one twin has schizophrenia, the other has a 50% chance of developing it as well. Fraternal twins have only a 15% risk. This finding indicates a genetic vulnerability or risk of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Other important studies have shown that children with one biologic parent with schizophrenia have a 15% risk; the risk rises to 35% if both biologic parents have schizophrenia. Children adopted at birth into a family with no history of schizophrenia but whose biologic parents have a history of schizophrenia still reflect the genetic risk of their biologic parents. All these studies have indicated a genetic risk or tendency for schizophrenia, but Mendelian genetics cannot be the only factor; identical twins have only a 50% risk even though their genes are 100% identical. Rather, recent studies indicate that the genetic risk of schizophrenia is polygenic, meaning several genes contribute to the development (Kendall, Kirov, &amp; Owen, 2017).</p>

<p>With the development of noninvasive imaging techniques, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography, in the past 25 years, scientists have been able to study the brain structure (neuroanatomy) and activity (neurochemistry) of people with schizophrenia. Findings have demonstrated that people with schizophrenia have relatively less brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid than those who do not have schizophrenia; this could represent a failure in the development or a subsequent loss of tissue. Computed tomography scans have shown enlarged ventricles in the brain and cortical atrophy. Positron emission tomography studies suggest that glucose metabolism and oxygen are diminished in the frontal cortical structures of the brain. The research consistently shows decreased brain volume and abnormal brain function in the frontal and temporal areas of persons with schizophrenia. This pathology correlates with the positive signs of schizophrenia (temporal lobe), such as psychosis, and the negative signs of schizophrenia (frontal lobe), such as lack of volition or motivation and anhedonia. It is unknown whether these changes in the frontal and temporal lobes are the result of a failure of these areas to develop properly or whether a virus, trauma, or immune response has damaged them. Intrauterine influences, such as poor nutrition, tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, and stress are also being studied as possible causes of the brain pathology found in people with schizophrenia (Kendall et al., 2017).</p>
<p>595</p>
<p>Neurochemical studies have consistently demonstrated alterations in the neurotransmitter systems of the brain in people with schizophrenia. The neuronal networks that transmit information by electrical signals from a nerve cell through its axon and across synapses to postsynaptic receptors on other nerve cells seem to malfunction. The transmission of the signal across the synapse requires a complex series of biochemical events. Studies have implicated the actions of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, glutamate, and several neuromodulary peptides.</p>
<p>Currently, the most prominent neurochemical theories involve dopamine and serotonin. One prominent theory suggests excess dopamine as a cause. This theory was developed on the basis of two observations: First, drugs that increase activity in the dopaminergic system, such as amphetamine and levodopa, sometimes induce a paranoid psychotic reaction similar to schizophrenia. Second, drugs blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors reduce psychotic symptoms; in fact, the greater the ability of the drug to block dopamine receptors, the more effective it is in decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia (Perez &amp; Ghose, 2017).</p>
<p>More recently, serotonin has been included among the leading neurochemical factors affecting schizophrenia. The theory regarding serotonin suggests that serotonin modulates and helps to control excess dopamine. Some believe that excess serotonin itself contributes to the development of schizophrenia. Newer atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine (Clozaril), are both dopamine and serotonin antagonists. Drug studies have shown that clozapine can dramatically reduce psychotic symptoms and ameliorate the negative signs of schizophrenia (Kane &amp; Correll, 2017).</p>

<p>Popular theories have emerged, stating that exposure to a virus or the body's immune response to a virus could alter the brain physiology of people with schizophrenia. Although scientists continue to study these possibilities, few findings have validated them.</p>
<p>Cytokines are chemical messengers between immune cells, mediating inflammatory and immune responses. Specific cytokines also play a role in signaling the brain to produce behavioral and neurochemical changes needed in the face of physical or psychological stress to maintain homeostasis. It is believed that cytokines may have a role in the development of major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Dahan et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Recently, researchers have been focusing on infections in pregnant women as a possible origin for schizophrenia. Waves of schizophrenia in England,</p>
<p>596</p>
<p>Wales, Denmark, Finland, and other countries have occurred a generation after influenza epidemics. Also, there are higher rates of schizophrenia among children born in crowded areas in cold weather, conditions that are hospitable to respiratory ailments (Kendall et al., 2017).</p>

<p>Awareness of cultural differences is important when assessing for symptoms of schizophrenia. Ideas that are considered delusional in one culture, such as beliefs in sorcery or witchcraft, may be commonly accepted by other cultures. Also, auditory or visual hallucinations, such as seeing the Virgin Mary or hearing God's voice, may be a normal part of religious experiences in some cultures. The assessment of affect requires sensitivity to differences in eye contact, body language, and acceptable emotional expression; these vary across cultures.</p>
<p>Psychotic behavior observed in countries other than the United States or among particular ethnic groups has been identified as a "culture-bound" syndrome. Although these episodes exist primarily in certain countries, they may be seen in other places as people visit or immigrate to other countries or areas. Some examples of culture-bound syndromes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bouffée délirante is a syndrome found in West Africa and Haiti, characterized by a sudden outburst of agitated and aggressive behavior, marked confusion, and psychomotor excitement. It is sometimes accompanied by visual and auditory hallucinations or paranoid ideation (Mojtabai et al., 2017).</li>
<li>Ghost sickness is preoccupation with death and the deceased frequently observed among members of some Native American tribes. Symptoms include bad dreams, weakness, feelings of danger, loss of appetite, fainting, dizziness, fear, anxiety, hallucinations, loss of consciousness, confusion, feelings of futility, and a sense of suffocation.</li>
<li>Jikoshu-kyofu is a condition characterized by a fear of offending others by emitting foul body odor. This was first described in Japan in the 1960s and has two subtypes, either with or without delusions (Greenberg, Shaw, Reuman, Schwartz, &amp; Wilhelm, 2016).</li>
<li>Locura refers to a chronic psychosis experienced by Latinos in the United States and Latin America. Symptoms include incoherence, agitation, visual and auditory hallucinations, inability to follow social rules, unpredictability, and, possibly, violent behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>597</p>
<ul>
<li>Qi-gong psychotic reaction is an acute, time-limited episode characterized by dissociative, paranoid, or other psychotic symptoms that occur after participating in the Chinese folk health-enhancing practice of qi-gong. Especially vulnerable are those who become overly involved in the practice.</li>
<li>Zar, an experience of spirits possessing a person, is seen in Ethiopia, Somalia, Egypt, Sudan, Iran, and other North African and Middle Eastern societies. The afflicted person may laugh, shout, wail, bang his or her head on a wall, or be apathetic and withdrawn, refusing to eat or carry out daily tasks. Locally, such behavior is not considered pathologic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ethnicity may also be a factor in the way a person responds to psychotropic medications. This difference in response is probably the result of the person's genetic makeup. Some people metabolize certain drugs more slowly, so the drug level in the bloodstream is higher than desired. In a study on poor treatment response, researchers found subtherapeutic plasma levels in some individuals despite having been administered therapeutic doses of the medication (McCutcheon et al., 2018). Black ethnicity was a factor associated with low plasma levels, causing the researchers to postulate that standard drug doses were not leading to therapeutic levels. Changing doses or changing the antipsychotic medication may be indicated in people with subtherapeutic plasma levels who have poor response to treatment.</p>

<p>The primary medical treatment for schizophrenia is psychopharmacology. In the past, electroconvulsive therapy, insulin shock therapy, and psychosurgery were used, but since the creation of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) in 1952, other treatment modalities have become all but obsolete. Antipsychotic medications, also known as neuroleptics, are prescribed primarily for their efficacy in decreasing psychotic symptoms. They do not cure schizophrenia; rather, they are used to manage the symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>The conventional, or first-generation, antipsychotic medications are dopamine antagonists. The atypical, or second-generation, antipsychotic medications are both dopamine and serotonin antagonists (see Chapter 2). These medications, usual daily dosages, and their common side effects are listed in Table 16.1. The first-generation antipsychotics target the positive signs of schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations, disturbed thinking,</p>
<p>598</p>

<p>Six antipsychotics are available as long-acting injections (LAIs), formerly called depot injections, for maintenance therapy. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fluphenazine (Prolixin) in decanoate and enanthate preparations
Haloperidol (Haldol) in decanoate
Risperidone (Risperdal Consta)
Paliperidone (Invega Sustenna)
Olanzapine (Zyprexa Relprevv)
Aripiprazole (Abilify Maintena)</li>
</ul>
<p>The vehicle for the first two conventional antipsychotic injections is sesame</p>
<p>oil; therefore, the medications are absorbed slowly over time into the client's system. The effects of the medications last 2 to 4 weeks, eliminating the need for daily oral antipsychotic medication (see Chapter 2). The duration of action is 7 to 28 days for fluphenazine and 4 weeks for haloperidol. The other four second-generation antipsychotics are contained in polymer-based microspheres that degrade slowly in the body. It may take several weeks of oral therapy with these medications to reach a stable dosing level before the transition to depot injections can be made. Therefore, these preparations are not suitable for the management of acute episodes of psychosis. They are, however, useful for clients requiring supervised medication compliance over an extended period.</p>
<p>In addition, some studies have shown that the second-generation LAIs are more effective than oral forms of the medication in controlling negative symptoms and improving psychosocial functioning (Kane &amp; Corell, 2017). Yet, clinicians may be reluctant to prescribe the LAIs because they assume patients are reluctant to have injections.</p>

<p>The side effects of antipsychotic medications are significant and can range from mild discomfort to permanent movement disorders. Because many of these side effects are frightening and upsetting to clients, they are frequently cited as the primary reason that clients discontinue or reduce the dosage of their medications. Serious neurologic side effects include extrapyramidal side effects (EPSs) (acute dystonic reactions, akathisia, and parkinsonism), tardive dyskinesia, seizures, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS; discussion to follow). Nonneurologic side effects include weight gain, sedation, photosensitivity, and anticholinergic symptoms, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, and orthostatic hypotension. Table 16.2 lists the side effects of antipsychotic medications and appropriate nursing interventions.</p>

<p>AIMS, Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale; EPSs, extrapyramidal side effects.</p>
<p>Extrapyramidal Side Effects. EPSs are reversible movement disorders induced by neuroleptic medication. They include dystonic reactions, parkinsonism, and akathisia.</p>
<p>Dystonic reactions to antipsychotic medications appear early in the course of treatment and are characterized by spasms in discrete muscle groups, such as the neck muscles (torticollis) or eye muscles (oculogyric crisis). These spasms may also be accompanied by protrusion of the tongue, dysphagia, and laryngeal and pharyngeal spasms that can compromise the client's airway, causing a medical emergency. Dystonic reactions are extremely frightening and painful for the client. Acute treatment consists of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) given either intramuscularly or intravenously, or benztropine (Cogentin) given intramuscularly.</p>
<p>Pseudoparkinsonism, or neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism, includes a</p>
<p>shuffling gait, masklike facies, muscle stiffness (continuous) or cogwheeling rigidity (ratchet-like movements of joints), drooling, and akinesia (slowness and difficulty initiating movement). These symptoms usually appear in the first few days after starting or increasing the dosage of an antipsychotic medication. Treatment of pseudoparkinsonism and prevention of further dystonic reactions are achieved with the medications listed in Table 16.3.</p>

<p>Akathisia is characterized by restless movement, pacing, inability to remain still, and the client's report of inner restlessness. Akathisia usually develops when the antipsychotic is started or when the dose is increased. Clients are typically uncomfortable with these sensations and may stop taking the antipsychotic medication to avoid these side effects. Beta-blockers such as propranolol have been most effective in treating akathisia, and benzodiazepines have provided some success as well.</p>
<p>The early detection and successful treatment of EPSs is important in promoting the client's compliance with medication. The nurse is most often the person who observes these symptoms or the person to whom the client reports symptoms. To provide consistency in assessment among nurses working with the client, a standardized rating scale for EPSs is useful. The Simpson-Angus scale for EPS is one tool that can be used.</p>
<p>Tardive Dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia, a late-appearing side effect of antipsychotic medications, is characterized by abnormal, involuntary movements such as lip smacking, tongue protrusion, chewing, blinking, grimacing, and choreiform movements of the limbs and feet. These involuntary movements are embarrassing for clients and may cause them to become more socially isolated. Tardive dyskinesia is irreversible once it appears, but decreasing or discontinuing the medication can arrest the progression. In addition, newly approved medications to treat tardive dyskinesia, valbenazine (Ingrezza) and deutetrabenazine (Austedo, Teva), are now available (see Chapter 2). Clozapine (Clozaril), an atypical antipsychotic drug, has not been found to cause this side effect, so it is often recommended for clients who have experienced tardive dyskinesia while taking conventional antipsychotic drugs.</p>
<p>Screening clients for late-appearing movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia is important. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is used to screen for symptoms of movement disorders. The client is observed in several positions, and the severity of symptoms is rated from 0 to 4. The AIMS can be administered every 3 to 6 months. If the nurse detects an increased score on the AIMS, indicating increased symptoms of tardive dyskinesia, he or she should notify the physician so that the client's dosage or drug can be changed to prevent advancement of tardive dyskinesia. The AIMS examination procedure is presented in Box 16.2.</p>

<p>Seizures. Seizures are an infrequent side effect associated with antipsychotic medications. The incidence is 1% of people taking antipsychotics. The notable exception is clozapine, which has an incidence of 5%. Seizures may be</p>
<p>604</p>
<p>associated with high doses of the medication. Treatment is a lowered dosage or a different antipsychotic medication.</p>
<p><strong>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome.</strong> NMS is a serious and frequently fatal condition seen in those being treated with antipsychotic medications. It is characterized by muscle rigidity, high fever, increased muscle enzymes (particularly, creatine phosphokinase), and leukocytosis (increased leukocytes). It is estimated that 0.1% to 1% of all clients taking antipsychotics develop NMS. Any of the antipsychotic medications can cause NMS, which is treated by stopping the medication. The client's ability to tolerate other antipsychotic medications after NMS varies, but use of another antipsychotic appears possible in most instances.</p>
<p><strong>Agranulocytosis.</strong> Clozapine has the potentially fatal side effect of agranulocytosis (failure of the bone marrow to produce adequate white blood cells). Agranulocytosis develops suddenly and is characterized by fever, malaise, ulcerative sore throat, and leukopenia. This side effect may not be manifested immediately but can occur as long as 18 to 24 weeks after the initiation of therapy. The drug must be discontinued immediately. Clients taking this antipsychotic must have weekly white blood cell counts for the first 6 months of clozapine therapy and every 2 weeks thereafter. Clozapine is dispensed every 7 or 14 days only, and evidence of a white blood cell count above 3,500 cells/mm³ is required before a refill is furnished.</p>

<p>In addition to pharmacologic treatment, many other modes of treatment can help the person with schizophrenia. Individual and group therapies, family therapy, family education, and social skills training can be instituted for clients in both inpatient and community settings.</p>
<p>Individual and group therapy sessions are often supportive in nature, giving the client an opportunity for social contact and meaningful relationships with other people. Groups that focus on topics of concern such as medication management, use of community supports, and family concerns have also been beneficial to clients with schizophrenia (Schaub, Hippius, Moller, &amp; Falkai, 2016). Clients with schizophrenia can improve their social competence with social skill training, which translates into more effective functioning in the community. Basic social skill training involves breaking complex social behavior into simpler steps, practicing through role-playing, and applying the</p>
<p>605</p>
<p>concepts in the community or real-world setting. Cognitive adaptation training using environmental supports is designed to improve adaptive functioning in the home setting. Individually tailored environmental supports such as signs, calendars, hygiene supplies, and pill containers cue the client to perform associated tasks. This psychosocial skill training was more effective when carried out during in-home visits in the client's own environment rather than in an outpatient setting.</p>
<p>DSM-5 DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA: Schizophrenia 295.90 (F20.9)</p>
<p>A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):</p>
<ol>
<li>Delusions</li>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
<li>Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence)</li>
<li>Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior</li>
<li>Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional or avolition)</li>
</ol>
<p>B. For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve the expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).</p>
<p>C. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).</p>
<p>D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either (1) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms or (2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.</p>
<p>606</p>
<p>E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.</p>
<p>F. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).</p>

<p>A newer therapy, cognitive enhancement therapy (CET), combines computer-based cognitive training with group sessions that allow clients to practice and develop social skills. This approach is designed to remediate or improve the clients' social and neurocognitive deficits, such as attention, memory, and information processing. The experiential exercises help the client take the perspective of another person, rather than focus entirely on him or herself. Positive results of CET include increased mental stamina, active rather than passive information processing, and spontaneous and appropriate negotiation of unrehearsed social challenges. CET has also been effective in decreasing substance misuse in people with schizophrenia (Sandoval et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Family education and therapy are known to diminish the negative effects of schizophrenia and reduce the relapse rate. Although inclusion of the family is a factor that improves outcomes for the client, family involvement is often neglected by health care professionals. Families often have a difficult time coping with the complexities and ramifications of the client's illness. This creates stress among family members that is not beneficial for the client or family members. Family education helps make family members part of the treatment team. See Chapter 3 for a discussion of the Family-to-Family Education course developed by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.</p>
<p>In addition, family members can benefit from a supportive environment that helps them cope with the many difficulties presented when a loved one has schizophrenia. These concerns include continuing as a caregiver for the child who is now an adult; worrying about who will care for the client when the parents are gone; dealing with the social stigma of mental illness; and, possibly, facing financial problems, marital discord, and social isolation. Such support is available through the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and local support groups. The client's health care provider can make referrals to</p>

<p>Schizophrenia affects thought processes and content, perception, emotion, behavior, and social functioning; however, it affects each individual differently. The degree of impairment in both the acute or psychotic phase and the chronic or long-term phase varies greatly; thus, so do the needs of and the nursing interventions for each affected client. The nurse must not make assumptions about the client's abilities or limitations solely on basis of the medical diagnosis of schizophrenia.</p>
<p>For example, the nurse may care for a client in an acute inpatient setting. The client may appear frightened, hear voices (hallucinate), make no eye contact, and mumble constantly. The nurse would deal with the positive, or psychotic, signs of the disease. Another nurse may encounter a client with schizophrenia in a community setting who is not experiencing psychotic symptoms; rather, this client lacks energy for daily tasks and has feelings of loneliness and isolation (negative signs of schizophrenia). Although both clients have the same medical diagnosis, the approach and interventions that each nurse takes would be different.</p>

<p>The nurse first elicits information about the client's previous history with schizophrenia to establish baseline data. He or she asks questions about how the client functioned before the crisis developed, such as "How do you usually spend your time?" and "Can you describe what you do each day?"</p>
<p>The nurse assesses the age at onset of schizophrenia, knowing that poorer outcomes are associated with an earlier age at onset. Learning the client's previous history of hospital admissions and response to hospitalization is also important.</p>
<p>The nurse also assesses the client for previous suicide attempts. Of all people with schizophrenia, 10% eventually commit suicide. The nurse</p>
<p>608</p>
<p>might ask, "Have you ever attempted suicide?" or "Have you ever heard voices telling you to hurt yourself?" Likewise, it is important to elicit information about any history of violence or aggression because a history of aggressive behavior is a strong predictor of future aggression. The nurse might ask, "What do you do when you are angry, frustrated, upset, or scared?"</p>
<p>The nurse assesses whether the client has been using current support systems by asking the client or significant others the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has the client kept in contact with family or friends?</li>
<li>Has the client been to scheduled groups or therapy appointments?</li>
<li>Does the client seem to run out of money between paychecks?</li>
<li>Have the client's living arrangements changed recently?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the nurse assesses the client's perception of his or her current situation—that is, what the client believes to be significant present events or stressors. The nurse can gather such information by asking, "What do you see as the primary problem now?" or "What do you need help managing now?"</p>

<p>Appearance may vary widely among different clients with schizophrenia. Some appear normal in terms of being dressed appropriately, sitting in a chair conversing with the nurse, and exhibiting no strange or unusual postures or gestures. Others exhibit odd or bizarre behavior. They may appear disheveled and unkempt with no obvious concern for their hygiene, or they may wear strange or inappropriate clothing (for instance, a heavy wool coat and stocking cap in hot weather).</p>
<p>Overall, motor behavior may also appear odd. The client may be restless and unable to sit still, exhibit agitation and pacing, or appear unmoving (catatonia). He or she may also demonstrate seemingly purposeless gestures (stereotypic behavior) and odd facial expressions, such as grimacing. The client may imitate the movements and gestures of someone whom he or she is observing (echopraxia). Rambling speech that may or may not make sense to the listener is likely to accompany these behaviors.</p>
<p>Conversely, the client may exhibit psychomotor retardation (a general slowing of all movements). Sometimes the client may be almost immobile, curled into a ball (fetal position). Clients with the catatonic type of schizophrenia can exhibit waxy flexibility; they maintain any position in which they are placed, even if the position is awkward or uncomfortable.</p>
<p>609</p>
<p>The client may exhibit an unusual speech pattern. Two typical patterns are word salad (jumbled words and phrases that are disconnected or incoherent and make no sense to the listener) and echolalia (repetition or imitation of what someone else says). Speech may be slowed or accelerated in rate and volume; the client may speak in whispers or hushed tones or may talk loudly or yell. Latency of response refers to hesitation before the client responds to questions. This latency or hesitation may last 30 or 45 seconds and usually indicates the client's difficulty with cognition or thought processes. Box 16.3 lists and gives examples of these unusual speech patterns.</p>
<p>BOX 16.3 Unusual Speech Patterns of Clients with Schizophrenia</p>
<p>Clang associations are ideas that are related to one another based on sound or rhyming rather than meaning.</p>
<p>Example: "I will take a pill if I go up the hill but not if my name is Jill, I don't want to kill."</p>
<p>Neologisms are words invented by the client.</p>
<p>Example: "I'm afraid of gritty. If there are any gritty here, I will have to leave. Are you a gritty?"</p>
<p>Verbigeration is the stereotyped repetition of words or phrases that may or may not have meaning to the listener.</p>
<p>Example: "I want to go home, go home, go home, go home."</p>
<p>Echolalia is the client's imitation or repetition of what the nurse says.</p>
<p>Example: Nurse: "Can you tell me how you're feeling?"</p>
<p>Client: "Can you tell me how you're feeling, how you're feeling?"</p>
<p>Stilted language is use of words or phrases that are flowery, excessive, and pompous.</p>
<p>Example: "Would you be so kind, as a representative of Florence Nightingale, as to do me the honor of providing just a wee bit of refreshment, perhaps in the form of some clear spring water?"</p>
<p>Perseveration is the persistent adherence to a single idea or topic and verbal repetition of a sentence, phrase, or word, even when another person attempts to change the topic.</p>
<p>Example: Nurse: "How have you been sleeping lately?"</p>
<p>Client: "I think people have been following me."</p>
<p>Nurse: "Where do you live?"</p>
<p>Client: "At my place people have been following me."</p>
<p>610</p>
<p>Nurse: “What do you like to do in your free time?”</p>
<p>Client: “Nothing because people are following me.”</p>
<p>Word salad is a combination of jumbled words and phrases that are disconnected or incoherent and make no sense to the listener.</p>
<p>Example: “Corn, potatoes, jump up, play games, grass, cupboard.”</p>

<p>Clients with schizophrenia report and demonstrate wide variations in mood and affect. They are often described as having flat affect (no facial expression) or blunted affect (few observable facial expressions). The typical facial expression is often described as masklike. The affect may also be described as silly, characterized by giddy laughter for no apparent reason. The client may exhibit an inappropriate expression or emotions incongruent with the context of the situation. This incongruence ranges from mild or subtle to grossly inappropriate. For example, the client may laugh and grin while describing the death of a family member or weep while talking about the weather.</p>
<p>The client may report feeling depressed and having no pleasure or joy in life (anhedonia). Conversely, he or she may report feeling all-knowing, all-powerful and not at all concerned with the circumstance or situation. It is more common for the client to report exaggerated feelings of well-being during episodes of psychotic or delusional thinking, and a lack of energy or pleasurable feelings during the chronic, or long-term, phase of the illness.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia is often referred to as a thought disorder because that is the primary feature of the disease: Thought processes become disordered, and the continuity of thoughts and information processing is disrupted. The nurse can assess thought process by inferring from what the client says. He or she can assess thought content by evaluating what the client actually says. For example, clients may suddenly stop talking in the middle of a sentence and remain silent for several seconds to 1 minute (thought blocking). They may also state that they believe others can hear their thoughts (thought broadcasting), that others are taking their thoughts (thought withdrawal), or that others are placing thoughts in their mind against their will (thought insertion).</p>
<p>Clients may also exhibit tangential thinking, which is veering onto</p>
<p>611</p>
<p>unrelated topics and never answering the original question:</p>
<p>Circumstantiality may be evidenced if the client gives unnecessary details or strays from the topic but eventually provides the requested information:</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/image-20260121-ffd804bc.jpeg" alt="img-0.jpeg"></p>
<p>Thought broadcasting</p>
<p>Nurse: "How have you been sleeping lately?"</p>
<p>Client: "Oh, I go to bed early, so I can get plenty of rest. I like to listen to music or read before bed. Right now I'm reading a good mystery. Maybe I'll write a mystery someday. But it isn't helping, reading I mean. I have been getting only 2 or 3 hours of sleep at night."</p>
<p>Poverty of content (alogia) describes the lack of any real meaning or</p>
<p>substance in what the client says:</p>
<p>Nurse: “How have you been sleeping lately?”
Client: “Well, I guess, I don’t know, hard to tell.”</p>

<p>Clients with schizophrenia usually experience delusions (fixed, false beliefs with no basis in reality) in the psychotic phase of the illness. A common characteristic of schizophrenic delusions is the direct, immediate, and total certainty with which the client holds these beliefs. Because the client believes the delusion, he or she, therefore, acts accordingly. For example, the client with delusions of persecution is probably suspicious, mistrustful, and guarded about disclosing personal information; he or she may examine the room periodically or speak in hushed, secretive tones.</p>
<p>The theme or content of the delusions may vary. Box 16.4 describes and provides examples of the various types of delusions. External contradictory information or facts cannot alter these delusional beliefs. If asked why he or she believes such an unlikely idea, the client often replies, “I just know it.”</p>

<p>Persecutory/paranoid delusions involve the client's belief that "others" are planning to harm him or her or are spying, following, ridiculing, or belittling the client in some way. Sometimes the client cannot define who these "others" are.</p>
<p>Examples: The client may think that food has been poisoned or that rooms are bugged with listening devices. Sometimes the "persecutor" is the government, FBI, or another powerful organization. Occasionally, specific individuals, even family members, may be</p>
<p>named as the persecutor.</p>
<p>Grandiose delusions are characterized by the client's claim to association with famous people or celebrities, or the client's belief that he or she is famous or capable of great feats.</p>
<p>Examples: The client may claim to be engaged to a famous movie star or related to some public figure, such as claiming to be the daughter of the president of the United States, or he or she may claim to have found a cure for cancer.</p>
<p>Religious delusions often center around the second coming of Christ or another significant religious figure or prophet. These religious delusions appear suddenly as part of the client's psychosis and are not part of his or her religious faith or that of others.</p>
<p>Examples: The client claims to be the Messiah or some prophet sent from God and believes that God communicates directly to him or her or that he or she has a special religious mission in life or special religious powers.</p>
<p>Somatic delusions are generally vague and unrealistic beliefs about the client's health or bodily functions. Factual information or diagnostic testing does not change these beliefs.</p>
<p>Examples: A male client may say that he is pregnant, or a client may report decaying intestines or worms in the brain.</p>
<p>Sexual delusions involve the client's belief that his or her sexual behavior is known to others; that the client is a rapist, prostitute, or pedophile or is pregnant; or that his or her excessive masturbation has led to insanity.</p>
<p>Nihilistic delusions are the client's belief that his or her organs aren't functioning or are rotting away, or that some body part or feature is horribly disfigured or misshapen.</p>
<p>Referential delusions or ideas of reference involve the client's belief that television broadcasts, music, or newspaper articles have special meaning for him or her.</p>
<p>Examples: The client may report that the president was speaking directly to him on a news broadcast or that special messages are sent through newspaper articles.</p>
<p>Initially, the nurse assesses the content and depth of the delusion to know what behaviors to expect and to try to establish reality for the client. When eliciting information about the client's delusional beliefs, the nurse must be careful not to support or challenge them. The nurse might ask the</p>
<p>615</p>
<p>client to explain what he or she believes by saying, “Please explain that to me” or “Tell me what you’re thinking about that.”</p>

<p>One hallmark symptom of schizophrenic psychosis is hallucinations (false sensory perceptions, or perceptual experiences that do not exist in reality). Hallucinations can involve the five senses and bodily sensations. They can be threatening and frightening for the client; less frequently, clients report hallucinations as pleasant. Initially, the client perceives hallucinations as real, but later in the illness, he or she may recognize them as hallucinations.</p>
<p>Hallucinations are distinguished from illusions, which are misperceptions of actual environmental stimuli. For example, while walking through the woods, a person believes he sees a snake at the side of the path. On closer examination, however, he discovers it is only a curved stick. Reality or factual information corrected this illusion. Hallucinations, however, have no such basis in reality.</p>
<p>The following are the various types of hallucinations (Lewis, Escalona, &amp; Owen, 2017):</p>
<ul>
<li>Auditory hallucinations, the most common type, involve hearing sounds, most often voices, talking to or about the client. There may be one or multiple voices; a familiar or unfamiliar person’s voice may be speaking. Command hallucinations are voices demanding that the client take action, often to harm the self or others, and are considered dangerous.</li>
<li>Visual hallucinations involve seeing images that do not exist at all, such as lights or a dead person, or distortions such as seeing a frightening monster instead of the nurse. They are the second most common type of hallucination.</li>
<li>Olfactory hallucinations involve smells or odors. They may be a specific scent such as urine or feces or a more general scent such as a rotten or rancid odor. In addition to clients with schizophrenia, this type of hallucination often occurs with dementia, seizures, or cerebrovascular accidents.</li>
<li>Tactile hallucinations refer to sensations such as electricity running through the body or bugs crawling on the skin. Tactile hallucinations are found most often in clients undergoing alcohol withdrawal; they rarely occur in clients with schizophrenia.</li>
<li>Gustatory hallucinations involve a taste lingering in the mouth or the</li>
</ul>
<p>616</p>
<p>sense that food tastes like something else. The taste may be metallic or bitter or may be represented as a specific taste.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cenesthetichallucinations involve the client's report that he or she feels bodily functions that are usually undetectable. Examples would be the sensation of urine forming or impulses being transmitted through the brain.</li>
<li>Kinesthetic hallucinations occur when the client is motionless but reports the sensation of bodily movement. Occasionally, the bodily movement is something unusual, such as floating above the ground.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ricky was staying with his father for a few weeks on a visit. During the first week, things had gone pretty well, but Ricky forgot to take his medication for a few days. His father knew Ricky wasn't sleeping well at night, and he could hear Ricky talking to himself in the next room.</p>
<p>One day while his father was at work, Ricky began to hear some voices outside the apartment. The voices grew louder, saying, "You're no good; you can't do anything right. You can't take care of yourself or protect your dad. We're going to get you both." Ricky grew more frightened and went to the closet where his dad kept his tools. He grabbed a hammer and ran outside. When his father came home from work early, Ricky wasn't in the apartment, though his coat and wallet were still there. Ricky's father called a neighbor, and they drove around the apartment complex looking for Ricky. They finally found him crouched behind some bushes. Although it was 45°F (7°C), he was wearing only a T-shirt and shorts and no shoes. Ricky's neighbor called emergency services. Meanwhile, Ricky's father tried to coax Ricky into the car, but Ricky wouldn't come. The voices had grown louder, and Ricky was convinced that the devil had kidnapped his father and was coming for him too. He saw someone else in the car with his dad. The voices said they would crash the car if he got in. They were laughing at him! He couldn't get into the car; it was a trap. His dad had tried his best, but he was trapped too. The voices told Ricky to use the hammer and to destroy the car to kill the devil. He began to swing the hammer into the windshield, but someone held him back.</p>
<p>The emergency services staff arrived and spoke quietly and firmly as they removed the hammer from Ricky's hands. They told Ricky they</p>
<p>617</p>
<p>were taking him to the hospital where he and his father would be safe. They gently put him on a stretcher with restraints, and his father rode in the emergency van with him to the hospital.</p>
<p>During episodes of psychosis, clients are commonly disoriented to time and sometimes to place. The most extreme form of disorientation is depersonalization, in which the client feels detached from his or her behavior. Although the client can state his or her name correctly, he or she feels as if his or her body belongs to someone else or that his or her spirit is detached from the body.</p>
<p>Assessing the intellectual processes of a client with schizophrenia is difficult if he or she is experiencing psychosis. The client usually demonstrates poor intellectual functioning as a result of disordered thoughts. Nevertheless, the nurse should not assume that the client has limited intellectual capacity based on impaired thought processes. It may be that the client cannot focus, concentrate, or pay adequate attention to demonstrate his or her intellectual abilities accurately. The nurse is more likely to obtain accurate assessments of the client's intellectual abilities when the client's thought processes are clearer.</p>
<p>Clients often have difficulty with abstract thinking and may respond in a literal way to other people and the environment. For example, when asked to interpret the proverb, "A stitch in time saves nine," the client may explain it by saying, "I need to sew up my clothes." The client may not understand what is being said and can easily misinterpret instructions. This can pose serious problems during medication administration. For example, the nurse may tell the client, "It is always important to take all your medications." The client may misinterpret the nurse's statement and take the entire supply of medication at one time.</p>

<p>Judgment is frequently impaired in the client with schizophrenia. Because judgment is based on the ability to interpret the environment correctly, it follows that the client with disordered thought processes and environmental misinterpretations will have great difficulty with judgment. At times, lack of judgment is so severe that clients cannot meet their needs for safety and protection and place themselves in harm's way. This difficulty may range from failing to wear warm clothing in cold weather to failing to seek medical care even when desperately ill. The client may also</p>
<p>618</p>
<p>fail to recognize needs for sleep or food.</p>
<p>Insight can also be severely impaired, especially early in the illness, when the client, family, and friends do not understand what is happening. Over time, some clients can learn about the illness, anticipate problems, and seek appropriate assistance as needed. However, chronic difficulties result in clients who fail to understand schizophrenia as a long-term health problem requiring consistent management.</p>

<p>Deterioration of the concept of self is a major problem in schizophrenia. The phrase <em>loss of ego boundaries</em> describes the client’s lack of a clear sense of where his or her own body, mind, and influence end and where those aspects of other animate and inanimate objects begin. This lack of ego boundaries is evidenced by depersonalization, derealization (environmental objects become smaller or larger or seem unfamiliar), and ideas of reference. Clients may believe they are fused with another person or object, may not recognize body parts as their own, or may fail to know whether they are male or female. These difficulties are the source of many bizarre behaviors such as public undressing or masturbating, speaking about oneself in the third person, or physically clinging to objects in the environment. Body image distortion may also occur.</p>

<p>Social isolation is prevalent in clients with schizophrenia, partly as a result of positive signs such as delusions, hallucinations, and loss of ego boundaries. Relating to others is difficult when oneself concept is not clear. Clients also have problems with trust and intimacy, which interfere with the ability to establish satisfactory relationships. Low self-esteem, one of the negative signs of schizophrenia, further complicates the client’s ability to interact with others and the environment. These clients lack confidence, feel strange or different from other people, and do not believe they are worthwhile. The result is avoidance of other people.</p>
<p>The client may experience great frustration in attempting to fulfill roles in the family and community. Success in school or at work can be severely compromised because the client has difficulty thinking clearly, remembering, paying attention, and concentrating. Subsequently, he or she lacks motivation. Clients who develop schizophrenia at young ages have more difficulties than those whose illness developed later in life because they did not have the opportunity to succeed in these areas before the</p>
<p>619</p>
<p>illness.</p>
<p>Fulfilling family roles, such as that of a son or daughter or sibling, is difficult for these clients. Often, their erratic or unpredictable behavior frightens or embarrasses family members, who become unsure what to expect next. Families may also feel guilty or responsible, believing they somehow failed to provide a loving supportive home life. These clients may also believe they have disappointed their families because they cannot become independent or successful.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Nursing Interventions*</th><th>Rationale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Be sincere and honest when communicating with the client. Avoid vague or evasive remarks.</td><td>Delusional clients are extremely sensitive about others and can recognize insincerity. Evasive comments or hesitation reinforces mistrust or delusions.</td></tr><tr><td>Be consistent in setting expectations, enforcing rules, and so forth.</td><td>Clear, consistent limits provide a secure structure for the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Do not make promises that you cannot keep.</td><td>Broken promises reinforce the client's mistrust of others.</td></tr><tr><td>Encourage the client to talk with you, but do not pry for information.</td><td>Probing increases the client's suspicion and interferes with the therapeutic relationship.</td></tr><tr><td>Explain procedures and try to be sure the client understands the procedures before carrying them out.</td><td>When the client has full knowledge of procedures, he or she is less likely to feel tricked by the staff.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Positive feedback for genuine success enhances the client's sense of well-being</td></tr></tbody></table>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>and helps make nondelusional reality a more positive situation for the client.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Recognize the client's delusions as the client's perception of the environment.</td><td>Recognizing the client's perceptions can help you understand the feelings he or she is experiencing.</td></tr><tr><td>Initially, do not argue with the client or try to convince the client that the delusions are false or unreal.</td><td>Logical argument does not dispel delusional ideas and can interfere with the development of trust.</td></tr><tr><td>Interact with the client on the basis of real things; do not dwell on the delusional material.</td><td>Interacting about reality is healthy for the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Engage the client in one-to-one activities at first, then activities in small groups, and gradually activities in larger groups.</td><td>A distrustful client can best deal with one person initially. Gradual introduction of others as the client tolerates is less threatening.</td></tr><tr><td>Recognize and support the client's accomplishments (projects completed, responsibilities fulfilled, interactions initiated).</td><td>Recognizing the client's accomplishments can lessen anxiety and the need for delusions as a source of self-esteem.</td></tr><tr><td>Show empathy regarding the client's feelings; reassure the client of your presence and acceptance.</td><td>The client's delusions can be distressing. Empathy conveys your caring, interest, and acceptance of the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Do not be judgmental or belittle or joke about the client's beliefs.</td><td>The client's delusions and feelings are not funny to him or her. The client may not understand or may feel rejected by attempts at humor.</td></tr><tr><td>Never convey to the client that you accept the delusions as reality.</td><td>Indicating belief in the delusions reinforces the delusion (and the client's illness).</td></tr><tr><td>Directly interject doubt regarding delusions as soon as the client seems ready to accept this (e.g., "I find that hard to believe."). Do not argue but present a factual account of the situation.</td><td>As the client begins to trust you, he or she may become willing to doubt the delusion if you express your doubt.</td></tr><tr><td>As the client begins to doubt the delusions or is willing to discuss the possibility that they may not be accurate, talk with the client about his or her perceptions and feelings. Give the client support for expressing feelings and concerns.</td><td>As the client begins to relinquish delusional ideas, he or she may have increased anxiety or be embarrassed about the beliefs.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><thead><tr><th>Ask the client if he or she can see that the delusions interfere with or cause problems in his or her life.</th><th>Discussion of the problems caused by the delusions is a focus on the present and is reality based.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>If the delusions are persistent but the client can acknowledge the consequences of expressing the beliefs, help him or her understand the difference between holding a belief and acting on it or sharing it with others.</td><td>Learning to choose to not act on a delusional belief and not discuss it with others outside the therapeutic relationship may help the client avoid hospitalization and other consequences in the future.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Adapted from Schultz, J. M., &amp; Videbeck, S. L (2013). Lippincott's manual of psychiatric nursing care plans (9th ed.). Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</p>
<p>Clients may also fail to recognize sensations such as hunger or thirst, and food or fluid intake may be inadequate. This can result in malnourishment and constipation. Constipation is also a common side effect of antipsychotic medications, compounding the problem. Paranoia or excessive fears that food and fluids have been poisoned are common and may interfere with eating. If the client is agitated and pacing, he or she may be unable to sit down long enough to eat.</p>
<p>Occasionally, clients develop polydipsia (excessive water intake), which leads to water intoxication. Serum sodium levels can become dangerously low, leading to seizures. Polydipsia is usually seen in clients who have had severe and persistent mental illness for many years as well as long-term therapy with antipsychotic medications. It may be caused by the behavioral state itself or may be precipitated by the use of antidepressant or antipsychotic medications (Sailer, Winzeler, &amp; Christ-Crain, 2017). Sleep problems are common. Hallucinations may stimulate clients, resulting in insomnia. Other times, clients are suspicious and believe harm will come to them if they sleep. As in other self-care areas, the client may not correctly perceive or acknowledge physical cues such as fatigue.</p>
<p>To assist the client with community living, the nurse assesses daily living skills and functional abilities. Such skills—having a bank account and paying bills, buying food and preparing meals, and using public transportation—are often difficult tasks for the client with schizophrenia. He or she might never have learned such skills or may be unable to accomplish them consistently.</p>

<p>The nurse must analyze assessment data for clients with schizophrenia to determine priorities and establish an effective plan of care. Not all clients have the same problems and needs, nor is it likely that any individual client has all the problems that can accompany schizophrenia. Levels of family and community support and available services also vary, all of which influence the client's care and outcomes.</p>
<p>The analysis of assessment data generally falls into two main categories: data associated with the positive signs of the disease and data associated with the negative signs. The North American Nursing Diagnosis Association's (NANDA) nursing diagnoses commonly</p>
<p>established based on the assessment of psychotic symptoms or positive signs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk for other-directed violence</li>
<li>Risk for suicide</li>
<li>Disturbed thought processes</li>
<li>Disturbed sensory perception</li>
<li>Disturbed personal identity</li>
<li>Impaired verbal communication</li>
</ul>
<p>The NANDA nursing diagnoses based on the assessment of negative signs and functional abilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-care deficits</li>
<li>Social isolation</li>
<li>Deficient diversional activity</li>
<li>Ineffective health maintenance</li>
<li>Ineffective therapeutic regimen management</li>
</ul>

<p>It is likely that the client with an acute psychotic episode of schizophrenia will receive treatment in an intensive setting, such as an inpatient hospital unit. During this phase, the focus of care is stabilizing the client's thought processes and reality orientation as well as ensuring safety. This is also the time to evaluate resources, make referrals, and begin planning for the client's rehabilitation and return to the community.</p>
<p>Examples of outcomes appropriate to the acute, psychotic phase of treatment are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The client will not injure him or herself or others.</li>
<li>The client will establish contact with reality.</li>
<li>The client will interact with others in the environment.</li>
<li>The client will express thoughts and feelings in a safe and socially acceptable manner.</li>
<li>The client will participate in prescribed therapeutic interventions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the crisis or the acute, psychotic symptoms have been stabilized, the focus is on developing the client's ability to live as independently and successfully as possible in the community. This usually requires continued follow-up care and participation of the client's family in community support services. Prevention and early recognition and treatment of relapse symptoms are important parts of successful rehabilitation. Dealing with</p>
<p>625</p>
<p>the negative signs of schizophrenia, which medication generally does not affect, is a major challenge for the client and caregivers. Examples of treatment outcomes for continued care after the stabilization of acute symptoms are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The client will participate in the prescribed regimen (including medications and follow-up appointments).</li>
<li>The client will maintain adequate routines for sleeping and food and fluid intake.</li>
<li>The client will demonstrate independence in self-care activities.</li>
<li>The client will communicate effectively with others in the community to meet his or her needs.</li>
<li>The client will seek or accept assistance to meet his or her needs when indicated.</li>
</ol>
<p>The nurse must appreciate the severity of schizophrenia and the profound and sometimes devastating effects it has on the lives of clients and their families. It is equally important to avoid treating the client as a "hopeless case," someone who no longer is capable of having a meaningful and satisfying life. It is not helpful to expect either too much or too little from the client. Careful ongoing assessment is necessary so that appropriate treatment and interventions address the client's needs and difficulties while helping the client reach his or her optimal level of functioning.</p>

<p>Safety for both the client and the nurse is the priority when providing care for the client with schizophrenia. The client may be paranoid and suspicious of the nurse and the environment and may feel threatened and intimidated. Although the client's behavior may be threatening to the nurse, the client is also feeling unsafe and may believe his or her wellbeing is in jeopardy. Therefore, the nurse must approach the client in a nonthreatening manner. Making demands or being authoritative only increases the client's fears. Giving the client ample personal space usually enhances his or her sense of security.</p>
<p>A fearful or agitated client has the potential to harm him or herself or others. The nurse must observe for signs of building agitation or escalating behavior such as increased intensity of pacing, loud talking or yelling, and</p>
<p>626</p>
<p>hitting or kicking objects. The nurse must institute interventions to protect the client, nurse, and others in the environment. This may involve administering medication; moving the client to a quiet, less stimulating environment; and in extreme situations, temporarily using seclusion or restraints. See Chapter 11 for a discussion on how to deal with anger and hostility, and Chapter 17 for a discussion on how to deal with clients who are suicidal.</p>

<p>Establishing trust between the client and the nurse also helps allay the fears of a frightened client. Initially, the client may tolerate only 5 or 10 minutes of contact at one time. Establishing a therapeutic relationship takes time, and the nurse must be patient. The nurse provides explanations that are clear, direct, and easy to understand. Body language should include eye contact, but not staring, a relaxed body posture, and facial expressions that convey genuine interest and concern. Telling the client one's name and calling the client by name are helpful in establishing trust as well as reality orientation.</p>
<p>The nurse must carefully assess the client's response to the use of touch. Sometimes gentle touch conveys caring and concern. At other times, the client may misinterpret the nurse's touch as threatening and therefore undesirable. As the nurse sits near the client, does he or she move or look away? Is the client frightened or wary of the nurse's presence? If so, that client may not be reassured by touch but frightened or threatened by it.</p>

<p>Communicating with clients experiencing psychotic symptoms can be difficult and frustrating. The nurse tries to understand and make sense of what the client is saying, but this can be difficult if the client is hallucinating, withdrawn from reality, or relatively mute. The nurse must maintain nonverbal communication with the client, especially when verbal communication is not successful. This involves spending time with the client, perhaps through fairly lengthy periods of silence. The presence of the nurse is a contact with reality for the client and can also demonstrate the nurse's genuine interest and caring to the client. Calling the client by name, making references to the day and time, and commenting on the environment are all helpful ways to continue to make contact with a client who is having problems with reality orientation and verbal communication. Clients who are left alone for long periods become more</p>
<p>627</p>
<p>deeply involved in their psychosis, so frequent contact and time spent with a client are important even if the nurse is unsure that the client is aware of the nurse's presence.</p>

<p>Active listening is an important skill for the nurse trying to communicate with a client whose verbalizations are disorganized or nonsensical. Rather than dismissing what the client says because it is not clear, the nurse must make efforts to determine the meaning the client is trying to convey. Listening for themes or recurrent statements, asking clarifying questions, and exploring the meaning of the client's statements are all useful techniques to increase understanding.</p>
<p>The nurse must let the client know when his or her meaning is not clear. It is never useful to pretend to understand or just to agree or go along with what the client is saying; this is dishonest and violates trust between client and nurse.</p>

<p>The client experiencing delusions utterly believes them and cannot be convinced that they are false or untrue. Such delusions powerfully influence the client's behavior. For example, if the client's delusion is that he or she is being poisoned, he or she will be suspicious, mistrustful, and probably resistant to providing information and taking medications.</p>
<p>The nurse must avoid openly confronting the delusion or arguing with the client about it. The nurse must also avoid reinforcing the delusional belief by "playing along" with what the client says. It is the nurse's responsibility to present and maintain reality by making simple statements such as</p>
<p>“I have seen no evidence of that.” (presenting reality)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>"It doesn't seem that way to me." (casting doubt)</p>
<p>As antipsychotic medications begin to have a therapeutic effect, it will be possible for the nurse to discuss the delusional ideas with the client and identify ways in which the delusions interfere with the client's daily life.</p>
<p>The nurse can also help the client minimize the effects of delusional thinking. Distraction techniques, such as listening to music, watching television, writing, or talking to friends, are useful. Direct action, such as engaging in positive self-talk and positive thinking and ignoring the delusional thoughts, may be beneficial as well.</p>

<p>Intervening when the client experiences hallucinations requires the nurse to focus on what is real and to help shift the client's response toward reality. Initially, the nurse must determine what the client is experiencing—that is, what the voices are saying or what the client is seeing. Doing so increases the nurse's understanding of the nature of the client's feelings and behavior. In command hallucinations, the client hears voices directing him or her to do something, often to hurt him or herself or someone else. For this reason, the nurse must elicit a description of the content of the hallucination so that health care personnel can take precautions to protect the client and others as necessary. The nurse might say,</p>
<p>"I don't hear any voices; what are you hearing?" (presenting reality/seeking clarification)</p>
<p>This can also help the nurse understand how to relieve the client's fears or paranoia. For example, the client might be seeing ghosts or monster-like images, and the nurse could respond,</p>
<p>"I don't see anything, but you must be frightened. You are safe here in the hospital." (presenting reality/translating into feelings)</p>
<p>This acknowledges the client's fear but reassures the client that no harm will come to him or her. Clients do not always report or identify hallucinations. At times, the nurse must infer from the client's behavior that</p>
<p>630</p>
<p>hallucinations are occurring. Examples of behavior that indicate hallucinations include alternately listening and then talking when no one else is present, laughing inappropriately for no observable reason, and mumbling or mouthing words with no audible sound.</p>
<p>A helpful strategy for intervening with hallucinations is to engage the client in a reality-based activity, such as playing cards, participating in occupational therapy, or listening to music. It is difficult for the client to pay attention to hallucinations and reality-based activity at the same time, so this technique of distracting the client is often useful.</p>
<p>It may also be useful to work with the client to identify certain situations or a particular frame of mind that may precede or trigger auditory hallucinations. Intensity of hallucinations is often related to anxiety levels; therefore, monitoring and intervening to lower a client's anxiety may decrease the intensity of hallucinations. Clients who recognize that certain moods or patterns of thinking precede the onset of voices may eventually be able to manage or control the hallucinations by learning to manage or avoid particular states of mind. This may involve learning to relax when voices occur, engaging in diversions, correcting negative self-talk, and seeking out or avoiding social interaction.</p>
<p>Teaching the client to talk back to the voices forcefully may also help him or her manage auditory hallucinations. The client should do this in a relatively private place rather than in public. There is an international self-help movement of "voice-hearer groups," developed to assist people to manage auditory hallucinations. One group devised the strategy of carrying a cell phone (fake or real) to cope with voices when in public places. With cell phones, members can carry on conversations with their voices in the street—and tell them to shut up—while avoiding ridicule by looking like a normal part of the street scene. Being able to verbalize resistance can help the client feel empowered and capable of dealing with the hallucinations. Clients can also benefit from openly discussing the voice-hearing experience with designated others. Talking with other clients who have similar experiences with auditory hallucinations has proved helpful, so the client doesn't feel so isolated and alone with the hallucination experience. Some clients wanted to discuss the hallucinations with their community mental health nurse to better understand the hallucinations and what they might mean.</p>

<p>Clients with schizophrenia often experience a loss of ego boundaries, which poses difficulties for themselves and others in their environment and community. Potentially bizarre or strange behaviors include touching others without warning or invitation, intruding into others' living spaces, talking to or caressing inanimate objects, and engaging in socially inappropriate behaviors such as undressing, masturbating, or urinating in public. Clients may approach others and make provocative, insulting, or sexual statements. The nurse must consider the needs of others as well as the needs of clients in these situations.</p>
<p>Protecting the client is a primary nursing responsibility and includes protecting the client from retaliation by others who experience the client's intrusions and socially unacceptable behavior. Redirecting the client away from situations or others can interrupt the undesirable behavior and keep the client from further intrusive behaviors. The nurse must also try to protect the client's right to privacy and dignity. Taking the client to his or her room or to a quiet area with less stimulation and fewer people often helps. Engaging the client in appropriate activities is also indicated. For example, if the client is undressing in front of others, the nurse might say,</p>
<p>“Let’s go to your room and you can put your clothes back on.” (encouraging collaboration/redirecting to appropriate activity)</p>
<p>If the client is making verbal statements to others, the nurse might ask the client to go for a walk or move to another area to listen to music. The nurse should deal with socially inappropriate behavior nonjudgmentally and matter-of-factly. This means making factual statements with no overtones of scolding and not talking to the client as if he or she were a naughty child.</p>
<p>Some behaviors may be so offensive or threatening that others respond</p>
<p>by yelling at, ridiculing, or even taking aggressive action against the client. Although providing physical protection for the client is the nurse's first consideration, helping others affected by the client's behavior is also important. Usually, the nurse can offer simple and factual statements to others that do not violate the client's confidentiality. The nurse might make statements, such as</p>
<p>"You didn't do anything to provoke that behavior. Sometimes, people's illnesses cause them to act in strange and uncomfortable ways. It is important not to laugh at behaviors that are part of someone's illness." (presenting reality/giving information)</p>
<p>The nurse reassures the client's family that these behaviors are part of the client's illness and not personally directed at them. Such situations present an opportunity to educate family members about schizophrenia and help allay any feelings of guilt, shame, or responsibility.</p>
<p>Reintegrating the client into the treatment milieu as soon as possible is essential. The client should not feel shunned or punished for inappropriate behavior. Health care personnel should introduce limited stimulation gradually. For example, when the client is comfortable and demonstrating appropriate behavior with the nurse, one or two other people can be engaged in a somewhat structured activity with the client. The client's involvement is gradually increased to small groups and then to larger, less structured groups as he or she can tolerate the increased level of stimulation without decompensating (regressing to previous, less effective coping behaviors).</p>

<p>Coping with schizophrenia is a major adjustment for both clients and their families. Understanding the illness, the need for continuing medication and follow-up, and the uncertainty of the prognosis or recovery are key issues. Clients and families need help to cope with the emotional upheaval that schizophrenia causes. See "Client and Family Education for Schizophrenia" for education points.</p>
<p>Identifying and managing one's own health needs are primary concerns for everyone, but this is a particular challenge for clients with schizophrenia because their health needs can be complex and their ability to manage them may be impaired. The nurse helps the client manage his or her illness and health needs as independently as possible. This can be</p>
<p>633</p>
<p>accomplished only through education and ongoing support.</p>
<p>Teaching the client and family members to prevent or manage relapse is an essential part of a comprehensive plan of care. This includes providing facts about schizophrenia, identifying the early signs of relapse, and teaching health practices to promote physical and psychological well-being. Early identification of these relapse signs (Box 16.5) has been found to reduce the frequency of relapse; when relapse cannot be prevented, early identification provides the foundation for interventions to manage the relapse. For example, if the nurse finds that the client is fatigued or lacks adequate sleep or proper nutrition, interventions to promote rest and nutrition may prevent a relapse or minimize its intensity and duration.</p>

<p>Client: "Oh, I try to sleep at night. I like to listen to music to help me sleep. I really like country-western music best. What do you like? Can I have something to eat pretty soon? I'm hungry."</p>
<p>Nurse: "Can you tell me how you've been sleeping?"</p>
<p>The nurse can use the list of relapse risk factors in several ways. He or she can include these risk factors in discharge teaching before the client leaves the inpatient setting so that the client and family know what to watch for and when to seek assistance. The nurse can also use the list when assessing the client in an outpatient or clinic setting or when working with clients in a community support program. The nurse can also provide teaching to ancillary personnel who may work with the client so they know when to contact a mental health professional. Taking medications as prescribed, keeping regular follow-up appointments, and avoiding alcohol and other drugs have been associated with fewer and shorter hospital stays. In addition, clients who can identify and avoid stressful situations are less likely to suffer frequent relapses. Using a list of relapse risk factors is one way to assess the client's progress in the community.</p>
<p>Families experience a wide variety of responses to the illness of their</p>
<p>loved one. Some family members might be ashamed or embarrassed or frightened of the client's strange or threatening behaviors. They worry about a relapse. They may feel guilty for having these feelings or fear for their own mental health or well-being. If the client experiences repeated and profound problems with schizophrenia, the family members may become emotionally exhausted or even alienated from the client, feeling they can no longer deal with the situation. Family members need ongoing support and education, including reassurance that they are not the cause of schizophrenia. Participating in organizations such as the Alliance for the Mentally Ill may help families with their ongoing needs.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Self-Care and Proper Nutrition.</strong> Because of apathy or lack of energy over the course of the illness, poor personal hygiene can be a problem for clients who are experiencing psychotic symptoms as well as for all clients with schizophrenia. When the client is psychotic, he or she may pay little attention to hygiene or may be unable to sustain the attention or concentration required to complete grooming tasks. The nurse may need to direct the client through the necessary steps for bathing, shampooing, dressing, and so forth. The nurse gives directions in short, clear statements to enhance the client's ability to complete the tasks. The nurse allows ample time for grooming and performing hygiene and does not attempt to rush or hurry the client. In this way, the nurse encourages the client to become more independent as soon as possible—that is, when he or she is better oriented to reality and better able to sustain the concentration and attention needed for these tasks.</p>
<p>If the client has deficits in hygiene and grooming resulting from apathy or lack of energy for tasks, the nurse may vary the approach used to promote the client's independence in these areas. The client is most likely to perform tasks of hygiene and grooming if they become a part of his or her daily routine. The client who has an established structure that incorporates his or her preferences has a greater chance for success than the client who waits to decide about hygiene tasks or performs them randomly. For example, the client may prefer to shower and shampoo on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday upon getting up in the morning. This nurse can assist the client to incorporate this plan into the client's daily routine, which leads to it becoming a habit. The client thus avoids making daily decisions about whether or not to shower or whether he or she feels like showering on a particular day.</p>
<p>Adequate nutrition and fluids are essential to the client's physical and</p>
<p>636</p>
<p>emotional well-being. Careful assessment of the client's eating patterns and preferences allows the nurse to determine whether the client needs assistance in these areas. As with any type of self-care deficit, the nurse provides assistance as long as needed and then gradually promotes the client's independence as soon as the client is capable.</p>
<p>When the client is in the community, factors other than the client's illness may contribute to inadequate nutritional intake. Examples include lack of money to buy food, lack of knowledge about a nutritious diet, inadequate transportation, or limited abilities to prepare food. A thorough assessment of the client's functional abilities for community living helps the nurse plan appropriate interventions. See the section "Community-Based Care."</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Social Skills.</strong> Clients may be isolated from others for a variety of reasons. The bizarre behavior or statements of the client who is delusional or hallucinating may frighten or embarrass family or community members. Clients who are suspicious or mistrustful may avoid contact with others. Other times, clients may lack the social or conversation skills they need to make and maintain relationships with others. Also, a stigma remains attached to mental illness, particularly for clients for whom medication fails to relieve the positive signs of the illness.</p>
<p>The nurse can help the client develop social skills through education, role modeling, and practice. The client may not discriminate between the topics suitable for sharing with the nurse and those suitable for using to initiate a conversation on a bus. The nurse can help the client learn neutral social topics appropriate to any conversation, such as the weather or local events. The client can also benefit from learning that he or she should share certain details of his or her illness, such as the content of delusions or hallucinations, only with a health care provider.</p>
<p>Modeling and practicing social skills with the client can help him or her experience greater success in social interactions. Specific skills such as eye contact, attentive listening, and taking turns talking can increase the client's abilities and confidence in socializing.</p>
<p><strong>Medication Management.</strong> Maintaining the medication regimen is vital to a successful outcome for clients with schizophrenia. Failing to take medications as prescribed is one of the most frequent reasons for recurrence of psychotic symptoms and hospital admission. Clients who</p>
<p>637</p>
<p>respond well to and maintain an antipsychotic medication regimen may lead relatively normal lives with only an occasional relapse. Those who do not respond well to antipsychotic agents may face a lifetime of dealing with delusional ideas and hallucinations, negative signs, and marked impairment. Many clients find themselves somewhere between these two extremes. See “Client and Family Education for Medication Management: Antipsychotics.”</p>
<p>There are many reasons why clients may not maintain the medication regimen. The nurse must determine the barriers to compliance for each client. Sometimes clients intend to take their medications as prescribed but have difficulty remembering when and if they did so. They may find it difficult to adhere to a routine schedule for medications. Several methods are available to help clients remember when to take medications. One is using a pillbox with compartments for days of the week and times of the day. After the box has been filled, perhaps with assistance from the nurse or case manager, the client often has no more difficulties. It is also helpful to make a chart of all administration times so that the client can cross off each time he or she has taken the medications.</p>
<p>Clients may have practical barriers to medication compliance, such as inadequate funds to obtain expensive medications, lack of transportation or knowledge about how to obtain refills for prescriptions, or inability to plan ahead to get new prescriptions before current supplies run out. Clients can usually overcome all these obstacles once they have been identified.</p>
<p>Sometimes clients decide to decrease or discontinue their medications because of uncomfortable or embarrassing side effects. Unwanted side effects are frequently reported as the reason clients stop taking medications. Interventions, such as eating a proper diet and drinking enough fluids, using a stool softener to avoid constipation, sucking on hard candy to minimize dry mouth, or using sunscreen to avoid sunburn, can help control some of these uncomfortable side effects (see Table 16.2). Some side effects, such as dry mouth and blurred vision, improve with time or with lower doses of medication. Medication may be warranted to combat common neurologic side effects such as EPSs or akathisia.</p>
<p>Some side effects, such as those affecting sexual functioning, are embarrassing for the client to report, and the client may confirm these side effects only if the nurse directly inquires about them. This may require a call to the client’s physician or primary provider to obtain a prescription for a different type of antipsychotic.</p>
<p>638</p>
<p>Sometimes a client discontinues medications because he or she dislikes taking them or believes he or she does not need them. The client may have been willing to take the medications when experiencing psychotic symptoms but may believe that medication is unnecessary when he or she feels well. By refusing to take the medications, the client may be denying the existence or severity of schizophrenia. These issues of noncompliance are much more difficult to resolve. The nurse can teach the client about schizophrenia, the nature of chronic illness, and the importance of medications in managing symptoms and preventing recurrence. For example, the nurse could say, “This medication helps you think more clearly” or “Taking this medication will make it less likely that you’ll hear troubling voices in your mind again.”</p>
<p>Even after education, some clients continue to refuse to take medication; they may understand the connection between medication and prevention of relapse only after experiencing a return of psychotic symptoms. A few clients still do not understand the importance of consistently taking medication and, even after numerous relapses, continue to experience psychosis and hospital admission fairly frequently.</p>

<p>The nurse must consider evaluation of the plan of care in the context of each client and family. Ongoing assessment provides data to determine whether the client's individual outcomes were achieved. The client's perception of the success of treatment also plays a part in evaluation.

<p>Late-onset schizophrenia refers to development of the disease after age 45; schizophrenia is not initially diagnosed in elder clients. Psychotic symptoms</p>
<p>that appear in later life are usually associated with depression or dementia, not schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia do survive into old age with a variety of long-term outcomes. They have an increased risk of developing dementia (Vahia &amp; Cohen, 2017). Approximately one-fourth of the clients experienced dementia, resulting in a steady, deteriorating decline in health; another 25% actually have a reduction in positive symptoms, somewhat like a remission; and schizophrenia remains mostly unchanged in the remaining clients.</p>

<p>Clients with schizophrenia are no longer hospitalized for long periods. Most return to live in the community with assistance provided by family and support services. Clients may live with family members, independently, or in a residential program such as a group home where they can receive needed services without being admitted to the hospital. Assertive community treatment programs have shown success in reducing the rate of hospital admissions by managing symptoms and medications; assisting clients with social, recreational, and vocational needs; and providing support to clients and their families. The psychiatric nurse is a member of the multidisciplinary team that works with clients in assertive community treatment programs, focusing on the management of medications and their side effects and the promotion of health and wellness. Behavioral home health care is also expanding, with nurses providing care to persons with schizophrenia (as well as other mental illnesses) using the holistic approach to integrate clients into the community. Although much has been done to give these clients the support they need to live in the community, there is still a need to increase services to homeless persons and those in prison with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Community support programs are often an important link in helping people with schizophrenia and their families. A case manager may be assigned to the client to provide assistance in handling the wide variety of challenges that the client in community settings faces. The client who has had schizophrenia for some time may have a case manager in the community. Other clients may need assistance to obtain a case manager. Depending on the type of funding and agencies available in a particular community, the nurse may refer the client to a social worker or may directly refer the client to case management services.</p>
<p>Case management services often include helping the client with housing and transportation, money management, and keeping appointments as well as</p>
<p>641</p>
<p>with socialization and recreation. Frequent face-to-face and telephone contact with clients in the community helps address clients' immediate concerns and avoid relapse and rehospitalization. Common concerns of clients include difficulties with treatment and aftercare, dealing with psychiatric symptoms, environmental stresses, and financial issues. Although the support of professionals in the community is vital, the nurse must not overlook the client's need for autonomy and potential abilities to manage his or her own health.</p>

<p>Psychiatric rehabilitation has the goal of recovery for clients with major mental illness that goes beyond symptom control and medication management (see Chapter 4). Working with clients to manage their own lives, make effective treatment decisions, and have an improved quality of life—from the client's point of view—are central components of such programs. Mental health promotion involves strengthening the client's ability to bounce back from adversity and to manage the inevitable obstacles encountered in life. Strategies include fostering self-efficacy and empowering the client to have control over his or her life; improving the client's resiliency, or ability to bounce back emotionally from stressful events; and improving the client's ability to cope with the problems, stress, and strains of everyday living. See Chapter 7 for a full discussion of resiliency and self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Early intervention in schizophrenia is an emerging goal of research investigating the earliest signs of the illness that occurs predominately in adolescence and young adulthood. Accurate identification of individuals at highest risk is key to early intervention (Lynch &amp; McFarlane, 2016). Initiatives of early detection, intervention, and prevention of psychosis have been established to work with primary care providers to recognize prodromal signs that are predictive of later psychotic episodes, such as sleep difficulties, change in appetite, loss of energy and interest, odd speech, hearing voices, peculiar behavior, inappropriate expression of feelings, paucity of speech, ideas of reference, and feelings of unreality. After these high-risk individuals are identified, individualized intervention is implemented, which may include education or stress management or neuroleptic medication or a combination of these. Treatment also includes family involvement, individual and vocational counseling, and coping strategies to enhance self-mastery. Interventions are intensive, using home visits and daily sessions if needed.</p>

<p>The Medication Adherence Rating Scale is a questionnaire with 10 yes-or-no questions that clients can quickly and easily answer. It provides a clear picture about the client's difficulties with medication adherence. Using such a questionnaire (available online) on a regular basis will guide staff in identifying strategies to improve compliance.</p>

<p>Working with clients with schizophrenia can present many challenges for the nurse. Clients have many experiences that are difficult for the nurse to relate to, such as delusions and hallucinations. Suspicious or paranoid behavior on the client's part may make the nurse feel as though he or she is not trustworthy or that his or her integrity is being questioned. The nurse must recognize this type of behavior as part of the illness and not interpret or respond to it as a personal affront. Taking the client's statements or behavior as a personal accusation only causes the nurse to respond defensively, which is counterproductive to the establishment of a therapeutic relationship.</p>
<p>The nurse may also be genuinely frightened or threatened if the client's behavior is hostile or aggressive. The nurse must acknowledge these feelings and take measures to ensure his or her safety. This may involve talking to the client in an open area rather than in a more isolated location or having an additional staff person present rather than being alone with the client. If the nurse pretends to be unafraid, the client may sense the fear anyway and feel less secure, leading to a greater potential for the client to lose personal control.</p>
<p>As with many chronic illnesses, the nurse may become frustrated if the</p>
<p>client does not follow the medication regimen, fails to keep needed appointments, or experiences repeated relapses. The nurse may feel as though a great deal of hard work has been wasted or that the situation is futile or hopeless. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness, and clients may suffer numerous relapses and hospital admissions. The nurse must not take responsibility for the success or failure of treatment efforts or view the client's status as a personal success or failure. Nurses should look to their colleagues for helpful support and discussion of these self-awareness issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remember that although these clients often suffer numerous relapses and return for repeated hospital stays, they do return to living and functioning in the community. Focusing on the amount of time the client is outside the hospital setting may help decrease the frustration that can result when working with clients with a chronic illness.</li>
<li>Visualize the client not at his or her worst, but as he or she gets better and symptoms become less severe.</li>
<li>Remember that the client's remarks are not directed at you personally but are a byproduct of the disordered and confused thinking that schizophrenia causes.</li>
<li>Discuss these issues with a more experienced nurse for suggestions on how to deal with your feelings and actions toward these clients. You are not expected to have all the answers.</li>

<li>Schizophrenia is a chronic illness requiring long-term management strategies and coping skills. It is a disease of the brain, a clinical syndrome characterized a person's thoughts, perceptions, emotions, movements, and behaviors.</li>
<li>The effects of schizophrenia on the client may be profound, including all aspects of the client's life: social interactions, emotional health, and ability to work and function in the community.</li>
<li>Schizophrenia is conceptualized in terms of positive signs such as delusions, hallucinations, and disordered thought processes as well as negative signs such as social isolation, apathy, anhedonia, and lack of motivation and volition.</li>
<li>The clinical picture, prognosis, and outcomes for clients with schizophrenia vary widely. Therefore, it is important that each client is carefully and individually assessed with appropriate needs and interventions determined.</li>
<li>Careful assessment of each client as an individual is essential to planning an effective plan of care.</li>
<li>Families of clients with schizophrenia may experience fear, embarrassment, and guilt in response to their family member's illness. Families must be educated about the disorder, the course of the disorder, and how it can be controlled.</li>
<li>Failure to comply with treatment and the medication regimen and the use of alcohol and other drugs are associated with poorer outcomes in the treatment of schizophrenia.</li>
<li>For clients with psychotic symptoms, key nursing interventions include helping to protect the client's safety and right to privacy and dignity, dealing with socially inappropriate behaviors in a nonjudgmental and matter-of-fact manner, helping present and maintain reality for the client by frequent contact and communication, and ensuring appropriate</li>
</ul>
<p>645</p>
<p>medication administration.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the client whose condition is stabilized with medication, key nursing interventions include continuing to offer a supportive, nonconfrontational approach, maintaining the therapeutic relationship by establishing trust and trying to clarify the client’s feelings and statements when speech and thoughts are disorganized or confused, helping to develop social skills by modeling and practicing, and helping to educate the client and family about schizophrenia and the importance of maintaining a therapeutic regimen and other self-care habits.</li>
<li>Self-awareness issues for the nurse working with clients with schizophrenia include dealing with psychotic symptoms, fear for personal safety, and frustration as a result of relapses and repeated hospital admissions.</li>

<p>John Jones, age 33, has been admitted to the hospital for the third time with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. John had been taking haloperidol (Haldol) but stopped taking it weeks ago, telling his case manager it was “the poison that is making me sick.” Yesterday, John was brought to the hospital after neighbors called the police because he had been up all night yelling loudly in his apartment. Neighbors reported him saying, “I can’t do it! They don’t deserve to die!” and similar statements. John appears guarded and suspicious and has little to say to anyone. His hair is matted, he has a strong body odor, and he is dressed in several layers of heavy clothing even though the weather is warm. So far, John has been refusing any offers of food or fluids. When the nurse approached John with a dose of haloperidol, he said, “Do you want me to die?”</p>

<p>Everyone occasionally feels sad, low, and tired, with the desire to stay in bed and shut out the world. These episodes are often accompanied by <strong>anergia</strong> (lack of energy), exhaustion, agitation, noise intolerance, and slow thinking processes, all of which make decisions difficult.</p>

<p>Work, family, and social responsibilities drive most people to proceed with their daily routines, even when nothing seems to go right and their irritable mood is obvious to all. Such "low periods" pass in a few days, and energy returns. Fluctuations in mood are so common to the human condition that we think nothing of hearing someone saying, "I'm depressed because I have too much to do." Everyday use of the word "depressed" doesn't actually mean that the person is clinically depressed but rather that the person is just having</p>
<p>a bad day. Sadness in mood can also be a response to misfortune; death of a friend or relative, financial problems, or loss of a job may cause a person to grieve (see Chapter 10).</p>
<p>At the other end of the mood spectrum are episodes of exaggeratedly energetic behavior. The person has the sure sense that he or she can take on any task or relationship. In an elated mood, stamina for work, family, and social events is untiring. This feeling of being "on top of the world" also recedes in a few days to a euthymic mood (average affect and activity). Happy events stimulate joy and enthusiasm. These mood alterations are normal and do not interfere meaningfully with the person's life.</p>
<p>Mood disorders, also called affective disorders, are pervasive alterations in emotions that are manifested by depression or mania or both. They interfere with a person's life, plaguing him or her with drastic and long-term sadness, agitation, or elation. Accompanying self-doubt, guilt, and anger alter life activities, especially those that involve self-esteem, occupation, and relationships.</p>
<p>From early history, people have suffered from mood disturbances. Archeologists have found holes drilled into ancient skulls to relieve the "evil humors" of those suffering from sad feelings and strange behaviors. Babylonians and ancient Hebrews believed that overwhelming sadness and extreme behavior were sent to people through the will of God or other divine beings. Biblical notables King Saul, King Nebuchadnezzar, and Moses suffered overwhelming grief of heart, unclean spirits, and bitterness of soul, all of which are symptoms of depression. Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria had recurrent episodes of depression. Other famous people with mood disorders were writers Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, and Eugene O'Neill; composer George Frideric Handel; musician Jerry Garcia; artist Vincent van Gogh; philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche; television commentator and host of 60 Minutes Mike Wallace; and actress Patty Duke.</p>
<p>Until the mid-1950s, no treatment was available to help people with serious depression or mania. These people suffered through their altered moods, thinking they were hopelessly weak to succumb to these devastating symptoms. Family and mental health professionals tended to agree, seeing sufferers as egocentric or viewing life negatively. Although there are still no cures for mood disorders, effective treatments for both depression and mania are now available.</p>
<p>Mood disorders are the most common psychiatric diagnoses associated with suicide; depression is one of the most important risk factors for it (Rhimer &amp; Pompili, 2017). For this reason, this chapter focuses on major depression,</p>
<p>655</p>
<p>bipolar disorder, and suicide. It is important to note that clients with schizophrenia, substance use disorders, antisocial and borderline personality disorders, and panic disorders are also at increased risk for suicide and suicide attempts.</p>

<p>The primary mood disorders are major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness). A major depressive episode lasts at least 2 weeks, during which the person experiences a depressed mood or loss of pleasure in nearly all activities. Symptoms include changes in eating habits, resulting in unplanned weight gain or loss; hypersomnia or insomnia; impaired concentration, decision-making, or problem-solving abilities; inability to cope with daily life; feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, guilt, or despair; thoughts of death and/or suicide; overwhelming fatigue; and rumination with pessimistic thinking with no hope of improvement. These symptoms result in significant distress or impairment of social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. About 20% have delusions and hallucinations; this combination is referred to as psychotic depression (Akiskal, 2017).</p>
<p>Bipolar disorder is diagnosed when a person’s mood fluctuates to extremes of mania and/or depression, as described previously. Mania is a distinct period during which mood is abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable. Typically, this period lasts about 1 week (unless the person is hospitalized and treated sooner), but it may be longer for some individuals. Manic episodes include inflated self-esteem or grandiosity; decreased sleep; excessive and pressured speech (unrelenting, rapid, often loud talking without pauses); flight of ideas (racing, often unconnected, thoughts); distractibility; increased activity or psychomotor agitation; and excessive involvement in pleasure-seeking or risk-taking activities with a high potential for painful consequences. The person’s mood may be excessively cheerful, enthusiastic, and expansive, or the person may be irritable, especially when he or she is told no or has rules to follow. The person often denies any problems, placing the blame on others for any difficulties he or she experiences. Some people also exhibit delusions and hallucinations during a manic episode.</p>
<p>Hypomania is a period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and some other milder symptoms of mania. The difference is that hypomanic episodes do not impair the person’s ability to function (in fact, he or she may be quite productive), and there are no psychotic features</p>
<p>656</p>
<p>(delusions and hallucinations). A mixed episode is diagnosed when the person experiences both mania and depression nearly every day for at least 1 week. These mixed episodes are often called rapid cycling (Akiskal, 2017). For the purpose of medical diagnosis, bipolar disorders are described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bipolar I disorder—one or more manic or mixed episodes usually accompanied by major depressive episodes</li>
<li>Bipolar II disorder—one or more major depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode</li>
</ul>
<p>People with bipolar disorder may experience a euthymic or normal mood and affect between extreme episodes, or they may have a depressed mood swing after a manic episode before returning to a euthymic mood. For some, euthymic periods between extremes are quite short. For others, euthymia lasts months or even years.</p>

<p>Other disorders classified with similarities to mood disorders include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent depressive (dysthymic) disorder is a chronic, persistent mood disturbance characterized by symptoms such as insomnia, loss of appetite, decreased energy, low self-esteem, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of sadness and hopelessness that are milder than those of depression.</li>
<li>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is a persistent angry or irritable mood, punctuated by severe, recurrent temper outbursts that are not in keeping with the provocation or situation, beginning before age 10.</li>
<li>Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by mild mood swings between hypomania and depression without loss of social or occupational functioning.</li>
<li>Substance-induced depressive or bipolar disorder is characterized by a significant disturbance in mood that is a direct physiological consequence of ingested substances such as alcohol, other drugs, or toxins.</li>
<li>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) has two subtypes. In one, most commonly called winter depression or fall-onset SAD, people experience increased sleep, appetite, and carbohydrate cravings; weight gain; interpersonal conflict; irritability; and heaviness in the extremities beginning in late autumn and abating in spring and summer. The other subtype, called spring-onset SAD, is less common, with symptoms of insomnia, weight loss, and poor appetite lasting from late spring or early summer until early fall. SAD is often treated with light therapy (Leahy, 2017).</li>
</ul>
<p>657</p>
<ul>
<li>Postpartum or "maternity" blues is a mild, predictable mood disturbance occurring in the first several days after delivery of a baby. Symptoms include labile mood and affect, crying spells, sadness, insomnia, and anxiety. The symptoms subside without treatment, but mothers do benefit from the support and understanding of friends and family (Langan &amp; Goodbred, 2017).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="assets/images/image-20260121-78c1e186.jpeg" alt="img-4.jpeg"></p>
<p>Seasonal affective disorder</p>
<ul>
<li>Postpartum depression is the most common complication of pregnancy in</li>
</ul>
<p>658</p>
<p>developed countries (Langan &amp; Goodbred, 2017). The symptoms are consistent with those of depression (described previously), with onset within 4 weeks of delivery.</p>
<ul>
<li>Postpartum psychosis is a severe and debilitating psychiatric illness, with acute onset in the days following childbirth. Symptoms begin with fatigue, sadness, emotional lability, poor memory, and confusion and progress to delusions, hallucinations, poor insight and judgment, and loss of contact with reality. This medical emergency requires immediate treatment. Women who have a history of serious mental illness are at higher risk for a postpartum relapse, even if they were well during pregnancy (Burgerhout et al., 2017).</li>
<li>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome and is defined as recurrent, moderate psychological and physical symptoms that occur during the week before menses and resolving with menstruation. Approximately 20% to 30% of premenopausal women are affected by affective and/or somatic symptoms that can cause severe dysfunction in social or occupational functioning, such as labile mood, irritability, increased interpersonal conflict, difficulty concentrating, feeling overwhelmed or unable to cope, and feelings of anxiety, tension, or hopelessness (Appleton, 2018).</li>
<li>Nonsuicidal self-injury involves deliberate, intentional cutting, burning, scraping, hitting, or interference with wound healing. Some persons who engage in self-injury (sometimes called self-mutilation) report reasons of alleviation of negative emotions, self-punishment, seeking attention, or escaping a situation or responsibility. Others report the influence of peers or the need to "fit in" as contributing factors (Chesin et al., 2017). This is further discussed in Chapter 18.</li>

<p>Various theories for the etiology of mood disorders exist. The most recent research focuses on chemical biologic imbalances as the cause. Nevertheless, psychosocial stressors and interpersonal events appear to trigger certain physiological and chemical changes in the brain, which significantly alter the balance of neurotransmitters. Effective treatment addresses both the biologic and psychosocial components of mood disorders. Thus, nurses need a basic knowledge of both perspectives when working with clients experiencing these disorders.</p>

<p>Genetic studies implicate the transmission of major depression in first-degree relatives who are at twice the risk for developing depression compared with the general population. First-degree relatives of people with bipolar disorder have a sevenfold risk for developing bipolar disorder compared with a 1% risk in the general population. For all mood disorders, monozygotic (identical) twins have a concordance rate (both twins having the disorder) two to four times higher than that of dizygotic (fraternal) twins. Although heredity is a significant factor, the concordance rate for monozygotic twins is not 100%, so genetics alone do not account for all mood disorders (Kelsoe &amp; Greenwood, 2017).</p>
<p>There are also indications of a genetic overlap between early-onset bipolar disorder and early-onset alcoholism. People with both problems have a higher rate of mixed and rapid cycling, poorer response to lithium, slower rate of recovery, and more hospital admissions. Mania displayed by these clients involves more agitation than elation; clients may respond better to anticonvulsants than to lithium (Akiskal, 2017).</p>

<p>Neurochemical influences of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) focus on serotonin and norepinephrine as the two major biogenic amines implicated in mood disorders. Serotonin has many roles in behavior: mood, activity, aggressiveness and irritability, cognition, pain, biorhythms, and neuroendocrine processes (i.e., growth hormone, cortisol, and prolactin levels are abnormal in depression). Deficits of serotonin, its precursor tryptophan, or a metabolite (5-hydroxyindole acetic acid) of serotonin found in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid occur in people with depression. Positron emission tomography demonstrates reduced metabolism in the prefrontal cortex, which may promote depression.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine levels may be deficient in depression and increased in mania. This catecholamine energizes the body to mobilize during stress and inhibits kindling. Kindling is the process by which seizure activity in a specific area of the brain is initially stimulated by reaching a threshold of the cumulative effects of stress, low amounts of electric impulses, or chemicals such as cocaine that sensitize nerve cells and pathways. These highly sensitized pathways respond by no longer needing the stimulus to induce</p>
<p>seizure activity, which now occurs spontaneously. It is theorized that kindling may underlie the cycling of mood disorders as well as addiction. Anticonvulsants inhibit kindling; this may explain their efficacy in the treatment of bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Dysregulation of acetylcholine and dopamine is also being studied in relation to mood disorders. Cholinergic drugs alter mood, sleep, neuroendocrine function, and the electroencephalographic pattern; therefore, acetylcholine seems to be implicated in depression and mania. The neurotransmitter problem may not be as simple as underproduction or depletion through overuse during stress. Changes in the sensitivity as well as the number of receptors are being evaluated for their roles in mood disorders (Thase, 2017).</p>

<p>Hormonal fluctuations are being studied in relation to depression. Mood disturbances have been documented in people with endocrine disorders, such as those of the thyroid, adrenal, parathyroid, and pituitary glands. Elevated glucocorticoid activity is associated with the stress response, and evidence of increased cortisol secretion is apparent in about 40% of clients with depression, with the highest rates found among older clients. Postpartum hormone alterations precipitate mood disorders such as postpartum depression and psychosis. About 5% to 10% of people with depression have thyroid dysfunction, notably an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone. This problem must be corrected with thyroid treatment, or treatment for the mood disorder is adversely affected (Thase, 2017).</p>

<p>Many psychodynamic theories about the cause of mood disorders seemed to "blame the victim" and his or her family (Markowitz &amp; Milrod, 2017). They include the following beliefs or suppositions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The self-depreciation of people with depression becomes self-reproach and "anger turned inward" related to either a real or perceived loss. Feeling abandoned by this loss, people are then angry while both loving and hating the lost object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person's ego (or self) aspires to be ideal (i.e., good and loving, superior or strong), and that to be loved and worthy, must achieve these high standards. Depression results when, in reality, the person is not able to</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>661</p>
<p>achieve these ideals all the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>The state of depression is like a situation in which the ego is a powerless, helpless child who is victimized by the superego, much like a powerful and sadistic parent who takes delight in torturing the child.</li>
<li>Most psychoanalytical theories of mania view manic episodes as a "defense" against underlying depression, with the ID taking over the ego and acting as an undisciplined hedonistic being (child).</li>
<li>Depression is a reaction to a distressing life experience, such as an event with psychic causality.</li>
<li>Children raised by rejecting or unloving parents are prone to feelings of insecurity and loneliness, making them susceptible to depression and helplessness.</li>
<li>Depression is a result of specific cognitive distortions in susceptible people. Early experiences shape distorted ways of thinking about oneself, the world, and the future; these distortions involve magnification of negative events, traits, and expectations and simultaneous minimization of anything positive.</li>

<p>Other behaviors considered age-appropriate can mask depression, which makes the disorder difficult to identify and diagnose in certain age groups. Children with depression often appear cranky. They may have school phobia, hyperactivity, learning disorders, failing grades, and antisocial behaviors. Adolescents with depression may abuse substances, join gangs, engage in risky behavior, be underachievers, or drop out of school. In adults, manifestations of depression can include substance abuse, eating disorders, compulsive behaviors such as workaholism, gambling, and hypochondriasis. Older adults who are cranky and argumentative may actually be depressed.</p>
<p>Many somatic ailments (physiological ailments) accompany depression. This manifestation varies among cultures and may be more apparent in cultures that avoid verbalizing emotions. For example, some people may report multiple physical, problems, backache, headache, or heart problems. How they are experiencing depression may be related to cultural norms or beliefs.</p>

<p>Major depressive disorder typically involves 2 weeks or more of a sad mood or lack of interest in life activities, with at least four other symptoms of depression such as anhedonia and changes in weight, sleep, energy, concentration, decision-making, self-esteem, and goals. Major depression is twice as common in women and has a one-and-a-half to three times greater incidence in first-degree relatives than in the general population. Incidence of depression decreases with age in women and increases with age in men. Single and divorced people have the highest incidence. Depression in prepubertal boys and girls occurs at an equal rate (Akiskal, 2017).</p>

<p>An untreated episode of depression can last from a few weeks to months or even years, though most episodes clear in about 6 months. Some people have a single episode of depression, while 50% to 60% will have a recurrence of depression. Approximately 20% will develop a chronic form of depression. Depressive symptoms can vary from mild to severe. The degree of depression is comparable with the person's sense of helplessness and hopelessness. Some people with severe depression (about 20%) have psychotic features (Akiskal, 2017).</p>

<p>Major categories of antidepressants include cyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and atypical antidepressants. Chapter 2 details biologic treatments. The choice of which antidepressant to use is based on the client's symptoms, age, and physical health needs; drugs that have or have not worked in the past or that have worked for a blood relative with depression; and other medications that the client is taking.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that levels of neurotransmitters, especially norepinephrine and serotonin, are decreased in depression. Usually, presynaptic neurons release these neurotransmitters to allow them to enter synapses and link with postsynaptic receptors. Depression results if too few neurotransmitters are released, if they linger too briefly in synapses, if the releasing presynaptic neurons reabsorb them too quickly, if conditions in synapses do not support linkage with postsynaptic receptors, or if the number</p>
<p>663</p>
<p>of postsynaptic receptors has decreased. The goal is to increase the efficacy of available neurotransmitters and the absorption by postsynaptic receptors. To do so, antidepressants establish a blockade for the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin into their specific nerve terminals. This permits them to linger longer in synapses and to be more available to postsynaptic receptors. Antidepressants also increase the sensitivity of the postsynaptic receptor sites (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018).</p>
<p>In clients who have acute depression with psychotic features, an antipsychotic is used in combination with an antidepressant. The antipsychotic treats the psychotic features; several weeks into treatment, the client is reassessed to determine whether the antipsychotic can be withdrawn and the antidepressant maintained.</p>
<p>Evidence is increasing that antidepressant therapy should continue for longer than the 3 to 6 months originally believed necessary. Fewer relapses occur in people with depression who receive 18 to 24 months of antidepressant therapy. As a rule, the dosage of antidepressants should be tapered before being discontinued.</p>
<p>DSM5-TR DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA: Major Depressive Disorder</p>
<p>A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.</p>
<p>B. Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents can be irritable mood.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of &gt;5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>664</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).</li>
<li>Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.</li>
<li>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).</li>
<li>Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).</li>
<li>Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.</li>
</ol>
<p>C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another medical condition.
E. Note: Criteria A to C represent a major depressive episode.
F. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual's history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.
G. The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.
H. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.
I. Note: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition.</p>

<p>Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. SSRIs, the most frequently prescribed category of antidepressants (Table 17.1), are effective for most clients. Their action is specific to serotonin reuptake inhibition; these drugs produce few sedating, anticholinergic, and cardiovascular side effects, which make them safer for use in older adults. Because of their low side effects and relative safety, people using SSRIs are more apt to be compliant with the treatment regimen than clients using more troublesome medications. Insomnia decreases in 3 to 4 days, appetite returns to a more normal state in 5 to 7 days, and energy returns in 4 to 7 days. In 7 to 10 days, mood, concentration, and interest in life improve.</p>

<p>SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.</p>
<p>Fluoxetine (Prozac) produces a slightly higher rate of mild agitation and weight loss but less somnolence. It has a half-life of more than 7 days, which differs from the 25-hour half-life of other SSRIs.</p>
<p>Cyclic Antidepressants. Tricyclics, introduced for the treatment of depression in the mid-1950s, are the oldest antidepressants. They relieve symptoms of hopelessness, helplessness, anhedonia, inappropriate guilt, suicidal ideation, and daily mood variations (cranky in the morning and better in the evening). Other indications include panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders. Each drug has a different degree of efficacy in blocking the activity of norepinephrine and serotonin or increasing the sensitivity of postsynaptic receptor sites. Tricyclic (and also heterocyclic) antidepressants have a lag period of 10 to 14 days before reaching a serum level that begins to alter symptoms; they take 6 weeks to reach full effect. Because they have a long serum half-life, there is a lag period of 1 to 4 weeks before steady plasma levels are reached and the client's symptoms begin to</p>
<p>decrease. They cost less, primarily because they have been around longer and generic forms are available.</p>
<p>Tricyclic antidepressants are contraindicated in severe impairment of liver function and in myocardial infarction (acute recovery phase). They cannot be given concurrently with MAOIs. Because of their anticholinergic side effects, tricyclic antidepressants must be used cautiously in clients who have glaucoma, benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention or obstruction, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, or respiratory disorders (Table 17.2).</p>

<p>Overdosage of tricyclic antidepressants occurs over several days and results in confusion, agitation, hallucinations, hyperpyrexia, and increased reflexes. Seizures, coma, and cardiovascular toxicity can occur with ensuing tachycardia, decreased output, depressed contractility, and atrioventricular block. Because many older adults have concomitant health problems, cyclic antidepressants are used less often in the geriatric population than newer types of antidepressants that have fewer side effects and less drug interactions.</p>
<p>Amoxapine (Asendin) may cause extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. It can create tolerance in 1 to 3 months. It increases appetite and causes weight gain and cravings for sweets.</p>
<p>Maprotiline (Ludiomil) carries a risk for seizures (especially in heavy drinkers), severe constipation and urinary retention, stomatitis, and other side effects; this leads to poor compliance. The drug is started and withdrawn gradually. Central nervous system depressants can increase the effects of this drug.</p>
<p>Atypical Antidepressants. Atypical antidepressants are used when the client has an inadequate response to or side effects from SSRIs. Atypical antidepressants include venlafaxine (Effexor), duloxetine (Cymbalta), bupropion (Wellbutrin), nefazodone (Serzone), mirtazapine (Remeron), and vilazodone (Viibryd) (Table 17.3).</p>

<p>ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; SNRI, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.</p>
<p>Venlafaxine blocks the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (weakly). Duloxetine selectively blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine. Bupropion modestly inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine, weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, and has no effects on serotonin. Bupropion is marketed as Zyban for smoking cessation.</p>
<p>Nefazodone inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine and has few side effects. Its half-life is 4 hours, and it can be used in clients with liver and kidney disease. It increases the action of certain benzodiazepines (alprazolam, estazolam, and triazolam) and the  <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">H</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{H}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.8333em; vertical-align: -0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">H</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height: 0.3011em;"><span style="top: -2.55em; margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height: 2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height: 0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>  blocker terfenadine. Remeron also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and it has few sexual side effects; however, its use comes with a higher incidence of weight gain, sedation, and anticholinergic side effects. Vilazodone may also treat anxiety that often accompanies depression (Stuivenga et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors. MAOIs have been used infrequently because of potentially fatal side effects and interactions with numerous drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter preparations (Table 17.4). However, they may be superior to typical medications for treatment of typical and treatment-resistant depression (Ricken, Ulrich, Schlattmann, &amp; Adi, 2017). The most serious side effect is hypertensive crisis, a life-threatening condition that can result when a client taking MAOIs ingests tyramine-containing foods (see Chapter 2, Box 2.1) and fluids or other medications. Symptoms are occipital headache, hypertension, nausea, vomiting, chills, sweating, restlessness, nuchal rigidity, dilated pupils, fever, and motor agitation. These can lead to hyperpyrexia, cerebral hemorrhage, and death. The MAOI-tyramine interaction produces symptoms within 20 to 60 minutes after ingestion. For hypertensive crisis, transient antihypertensive agents, such as phentolamine mesylate, are given to dilate blood vessels and decrease vascular resistance (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018).</p>

<p>Electroconvulsive Therapy. Psychiatrists may use electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to treat depression in select groups, such as clients who do not respond to antidepressants or those who experience intolerable side effects at therapeutic doses (particularly true for older adults). In addition, pregnant women can safely have ECT while many medications are not safe for use during pregnancy. Clients who are actively suicidal may be given ECT if there is concern for their safety while waiting weeks for the full effects of antidepressant medication. It has also shown a high degree of efficacy for patients with psychotic features and marked psychomotor disturbances (Heijnen et al., 2018).</p>
<p>ECT involves application of electrodes to the head of the client to deliver an electrical impulse to the brain; this causes a seizure. It is believed that the shock stimulates brain chemistry to correct the chemical imbalance of depression. Historically, clients did not receive any anesthetic or other medication before ECT, and they had full-blown grand mal seizures that often resulted in injuries ranging from biting the tongue to breaking bones. ECT fell into disfavor for a period and was seen as "barbaric." Today, although ECT is administered in a safe and humane way with almost no injuries, there are still critics of the treatment.</p>
<p>Clients usually receive a series of six to 15 treatments scheduled three times a week. Generally, a minimum of six treatments are needed to see sustained improvement in depressive symptoms. Maximum benefit is achieved in 12 to 15 treatments.</p>
<p>Preparation of a client for ECT is similar to preparation for any outpatient</p>
<p>674</p>
<p>minor surgical procedure: The client receives nothing by mouth (is NPO) after midnight, removes any fingernail polish, and voids just before the procedure. An intravenous line is started for the administration of medication.</p>
<p>Initially, the client receives a short-acting anesthetic so that he or she is not awake during the procedure. Next, he or she receives a muscle relaxant/paralytic, usually succinylcholine, which relaxes all muscles to reduce greatly the outward signs of the seizure (e.g., clonic-tonic muscle contractions). Electrodes are placed on the client's head: one on either side (bilateral) or both on one side (unilateral). The electrical stimulation is delivered, which causes seizure activity in the brain that is monitored by an electroencephalogram (EEG). The client receives oxygen and is assisted to breathe with an Ambu bag. He or she generally begins to awaken after a few minutes. Vital signs are monitored, and the client is assessed for the return of a gag reflex.</p>
<p>After ECT treatment, the client may be mildly confused or briefly disoriented. He or she is tired and often has a headache. The symptoms are just like those of anyone who has had a grand mal seizure. In addition, the client will have some short-term memory impairment. After a treatment, the client may eat as soon as he or she is hungry and usually sleeps for a period. Headaches are treated symptomatically.</p>
<p>Unilateral ECT results in less memory loss for the client, but more treatments may be needed to see sustained improvement. Bilateral ECT results in more rapid improvement but with increased short-term memory loss.</p>
<p>Some studies report that ECT is as effective as medication for depression, while other studies report only short-term improvement. Likewise, some studies report that memory loss side effects of ECT are short lived, while others report they are serious and long term. ECT is also used for relapse prevention in depression. Clients may continue to receive treatments, such as one per month, to maintain mood improvement. Often, clients are given antidepressant therapy after ECT to prevent relapse. Studies have found maintenance ECT to be effective in relapse prevention (Ahmadi, Moss, Hauser, Nemeroff, &amp; Atre-Vaidya, 2018).</p>
<p><strong>Psychotherapy.</strong> A combination of psychotherapy and medications is considered the most effective treatment for depressive disorders in both children and adults (Mullen, 2018). There is no one specific type of therapy that is better for the treatment of depression. The goals of combined therapy are symptom remission, psychosocial restoration, prevention of relapse or</p>
<p>675</p>
<p>recurrence, reduced secondary consequences such as marital discord or occupational difficulties, and increasing treatment compliance.</p>
<p>Interpersonal therapy focuses on difficulties in relationships, such as grief reactions, role disputes, and role transitions. For example, a person who as a child never learned how to make and trust a friend outside the family structure has difficulty establishing friendships as an adult. Interpersonal therapy helps the person find ways to accomplish this developmental task.</p>
<p>Behavior therapy seeks to increase the frequency of the client's positively reinforcing interactions with the environment and to decrease negative interactions. It may also focus on improving social skills.</p>
<p>Cognitive therapy focuses on how the person thinks about the self, others, and the future and interprets his or her experiences. This model focuses on the person's distorted thinking, which, in turn, influences feelings, behavior, and functional abilities. Table 17.5 describes the cognitive distortions that are the focus of cognitive therapy.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Cognitive Distortion</th><th>Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Absolute, dichotomous thinking</td><td>Tendency to view everything in polar categories (i.e., all or none, black or white)</td></tr><tr><td>Arbitrary inference</td><td>Drawing a specific conclusion without sufficient evidence (i.e., jumping to [negative] conclusions)</td></tr><tr><td>Specific abstraction</td><td>Focusing on a single (often minor) detail while ignoring other, more significant aspects of the experience (i.e., concentrating on one small [negative] detail while discounting positive aspects)</td></tr><tr><td>Overgeneralization</td><td>Forming conclusions based on too little or too narrow experience (i.e., if one experience was negative, then all similar experiences will be negative)</td></tr><tr><td>Magnification and minimization</td><td>Overvaluing or undervaluing the significance of a particular event (i.e., one small negative event is the end of the world or a positive experience is totally discounted)</td></tr><tr><td>Personalization</td><td>Tendency to self-reference external events without basis (i.e., believing that events are directly related to oneself, whether they are or not)</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>New and Investigational Treatments. Other treatments for depression are being tested. These include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic seizure therapy, deep brain stimulation, and vagal nerve stimulation. TMS is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for major</p>
<p>depression in treatment-resistant clients. When used as an adjunct to antidepressant medications, TMS was found to be safe and effective. When used alone, TMS is most effective for mild or moderate depression (Husain, McClintock, &amp; Croakin, 2017).</p>

<p>The nurse can collect assessment data from the client and family or significant others, previous chart information, and others involved in the support or care. It may take several short periods to complete the assessment because clients who are severely depressed feel exhausted and overwhelmed. It can take time for them to process the question asked and to formulate a response. It is important that the nurse does not try to rush clients because doing so leads to frustration and incomplete assessment data.</p>
<p>To assess the client's perception of the problem, the nurse asks about behavioral changes: when they started, what was happening when they began, their duration, and what the client has tried to do about them. Assessing the history is important to determine any previous episodes of depression, treatment, and the client's response to treatment. The nurse also asks about family history of mood disorders, suicide, or attempted suicide.</p>

<p>Many people with depression look sad; sometimes they just look ill. The posture is often slouched with head down, and they make minimal eye contact. They have psychomotor retardation (slow body movements, slow cognitive processing, and slow verbal interaction). Responses to questions may be minimal, with only one or two words. Latency of response is seen when clients take up to 30 seconds to respond to a question. They may answer some questions with "I don't know" because they are simply too fatigued and overwhelmed to think of an answer or respond in any detail.</p>
<p>677</p>
<p>Clients may also exhibit signs of agitation or anxiety such as wringing their hands and having difficulty sitting still. These clients are said to have psychomotor agitation (increased body movements and thoughts), which includes pacing, accelerated thinking, and argumentativeness.</p>

<p>Clients with depression may describe themselves as hopeless, helpless, down, or anxious. They may also say they are a burden on others or are a failure at life, or they may make other similar statements. They are easily frustrated, are angry with themselves, and can be angry with others. They experience anhedonia, losing any sense of pleasure from activities they formerly enjoyed. Clients may be apathetic, that is, not caring about themselves, activities, or much of anything.</p>
<p>Their affect is sad or depressed or may be flat with no emotional expressions. Typically, depressed clients sit alone, staring into space or lost in thought. When addressed, they interact minimally with a few words or a gesture. They are overwhelmed by noise and people who might make demands on them, so they withdraw from the stimulation of interaction with others.</p>

<p>"Just get out! I am not interested in food," Chris said to her husband Matt, who had come into their bedroom to invite her to the dinner he and their daughters had prepared. "Can't they leave me alone?" Chris thought to herself as she miserably pulled the covers over her shoulders. Still, she felt guilty about the way she'd snapped at Matt. She knew she'd disparaged her family's efforts to help, but she couldn't stop.</p>
<p>Chris was physically and emotionally exhausted. "I can't remember when I felt well ... maybe last year sometime, or maybe never," she thought fretfully. She'd always worked hard to get things done; lately, she could not do anything at all except complain. Kathy, her 13-year-old, accused her of hating everything and everybody, including her family. Linda, 11 years old, said, "Everything has to be your way, Mom. You snap at us for every little thing. You never listen anymore." Matt had long ago withdrawn from her moodiness, acid tongue, and disinterest in sex. One day, she overheard Matt tell his brother that Chris was "crabby, agitated, and self-centered, and if it wasn't for the</p>

<p>girls, I don't know what I'd do. I've tried to get her to go to a doctor, but she says it's all our fault; then she sulks for days. What is our fault? I don't know what to do for her. I feel as if I am living in a minefield and never know what will set off an explosion. I try to remember the love we had together, but her behavior is getting old."</p>
<p>Chris has lost 12 lb in the past 2 months, has difficulty sleeping, and is hostile, angry, and guilty about her feelings. She has no desire for any pleasure. "Why bother? There is nothing to enjoy. Life is bleak." She feels stuck, worthless, hopeless, and helpless. Hoping against hope, Chris thinks to herself, "I wish I were dead. I'd never have to do anything again."</p>

<p>Clients with depression experience slow thinking processes, their thinking seems to occur in slow motion. With severe depression, they may not respond verbally to questions. Clients tend to be negative and pessimistic in their thinking; they believe they will always feel this bad, things will never get any better, and nothing will help. Clients make self-deprecating remarks, criticizing themselves harshly, and focusing only on failures or negative attributes. They tend to <strong>ruminate</strong>, which is repeatedly going over the same thoughts. Those who experience psychotic symptoms have delusions; they often believe they are responsible for all the tragedies and miseries in the world.</p>

<p>Often, clients with depression have thoughts of dying or committing suicide. It is important to assess suicidal ideation by asking about it directly. The nurse may ask, “Are you thinking about suicide?” or “What suicidal thoughts are you having?” Most clients readily admit to suicidal thinking.

They believe that others would be better off without them, a belief that leads to suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p>Clients with depression have difficulty fulfilling roles and responsibilities. The more severe the depression, the greater the difficulty. They have problems going to work or school; when there, they seem unable to carry out their responsibilities. The same is true with family responsibilities. Clients are less able to cook, clean, or care for children. In addition to the inability to fulfill roles, clients become even more convinced of their "worthlessness" for being unable to meet life responsibilities.</p>
<p>Depression can cause great strain in relationships. Family members who have limited knowledge about depression may believe clients should "just get on with it." Clients often avoid family and social relationships because they feel overwhelmed, experience no pleasure from interactions, and feel unworthy. As clients withdraw from relationships, the strain increases.</p>

<p>Clients with depression often experience pronounced weight loss because of lack of appetite or disinterest in eating. Sleep disturbances are common; either clients cannot sleep, or they feel exhausted and unrefreshed no matter how much time they spend in bed. They lose interest in sexual activities, and men often experience impotence. Some clients neglect personal hygiene because they lack the interest or energy. Constipation commonly results from decreased food and fluid intake as well as from inactivity. If fluid intake is severely limited, clients may also be dehydrated.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Nursing Interventions*</th><th>Rationale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Provide a safe environment for the client.</td><td>Physical safety of the client is a priority. Many common items may be used in a self-destructive manner.</td></tr><tr><td>Continually assess the client's potential for suicide. Remain aware of this suicide potential at all times.</td><td>Clients with depression may have a potential for suicide that may or may not be expressed and that may change with time.</td></tr><tr><td>Observe the client closely, especially under the following circumstances: ·After antidepressant medication begins to raise the client's mood ·Unstructured time on the unit or times when the number of staff on the unit is</td><td>You must be aware of the client's activities at all times when there is a potential for suicide or self-injury. Risk for suicide increases as the client's energy level is increased by medication, when the client's time is unstructured, and</td></tr><tr><td>in the unit or times when the number of staff on the unit is increased.</td><td>in the unit or times when the number of staff on the unit is decreased.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<table><thead><tr><th>limited ·After any dramatic behavioral change (sudden cheerfulness, relief, or giving away personal belongings)</th><th>when observation of the client decreases. These changes may indicate that the client has come to a decision to commit suicide.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reorient the client to person, place, and time as indicated (call the client by name, tell the client your name, tell the client where he or she is, and so forth).</td><td>Repeated presentation of reality is concrete reinforcement for the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Spend time with the client.</td><td>Your physical presence is reality.</td></tr><tr><td>If the client is ruminating, tell him or her that you will talk about reality or about the client's feelings, but limit the attention given to repeated expressions of rumination.</td><td>Minimizing attention may help decrease rumination. Providing reinforcement for reality orientation and expression of feelings will encourage these behaviors.</td></tr><tr><td>Initially assign the same staff members to work with the client whenever possible.</td><td>The client's ability to respond to others may be impaired. Limiting the number of new contacts initially will facilitate familiarity and trust. However, the number of people interacting with the client should increase as soon as possible to minimize dependency and to facilitate the client's abilities to communicate with a variety of people.</td></tr><tr><td>When approaching the client, use a moderate-level tone of voice. Avoid being overly cheerful.</td><td>Being overly cheerful may indicate to the client that being cheerful is the goal and that other feelings are not acceptable.</td></tr><tr><td>Use silence and active listening when interacting with the client. Let the client know you are concerned and you consider the client a worthwhile person.</td><td>The client may not communicate if you are talking too much. Your presence and use of active listening will communicate your interest and concern.</td></tr><tr><td>Be comfortable sitting with the client in silence. Let the client know you are available to converse, but do not require the client to talk.</td><td>Your silence will convey your expectation that the client will communicate and your acceptance of the client's difficulty with communication.</td></tr><tr><td>When first communicating with the client, use simple, direct sentences; avoid complex sentences or directions.</td><td>The client's ability to perceive and respond to complex stimuli is impaired.</td></tr><tr><td>Avoid asking the client many questions, especially questions that require only brief answers.</td><td>Asking questions and requiring only brief answers may discourage the client from expressing feelings.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<table><thead><tr><th>Do not cut off interactions with cheerful remarks or platitudes (e.g., “No one really wants to die,” or “You’ll feel better soon.”). Do not belittle the client’s feelings. Accept the client’s verbalizations of feelings as real and give support for expressions of emotions, especially those that may be difficult for the client (like anger).</th><th>You may be uncomfortable with certain feelings the client expresses. If so, it is important for you to recognize this and discuss it with another staff member rather than directly or indirectly communicating your discomfort to the client. Proclaiming the client’s feelings to be inappropriate or belittling them is detrimental.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Encourage the client to ventilate feelings in whatever way is comfortable—verbal and nonverbal. Let the client know you will listen and accept what is being expressed.</td><td>Expressing feelings may help relieve despair, hopelessness, and so forth. Feelings are not inherently good or bad. You must remain nonjudgmental about the client’s feelings and express this to the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Allow (and encourage) the client to cry. Stay with and support the client if he or she desires. Provide privacy if the client desires and it is safe to do so.</td><td>Crying is a healthy way of expressing feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. The client may not feel comfortable crying and may need encouragement or privacy.</td></tr><tr><td>Interact with the client on topics with which he or she is comfortable. Do not probe for information.</td><td>Topics that are uncomfortable for the client and probing may be threatening and may discourage communication. After trust has been established, the client may be able to discuss more difficult topics.</td></tr><tr><td>Talk with the client about coping strategies he or she has used in the past. Explore which strategies have been successful and which may have led to negative consequences.</td><td>The client may have had success using coping strategies in the past but may have lost confidence in him or herself or in his or her ability to cope with stressors and feelings. Some coping strategies can be self-destructive (e.g., self-medication with drugs or alcohol).</td></tr><tr><td>Teach the client about positive coping strategies and stress management skills, such as increasing physical exercise, expressing feelings verbally or in a journal, or meditation techniques. Encourage the client to practice this type of technique while in the hospital.</td><td>The client may have limited or no knowledge of stress management techniques or may not have used positive techniques in the past. If the client tries to build skills in the treatment setting, he or she can experience success and receive positive feedback for his or her efforts.</td></tr><tr><td>Teach the client about the problem-solving process: Explore possible options, examine the consequences of each alternative, select and implement an alternative, and evaluate the results.</td><td>The client may be unaware of a systematic method for solving problems. Successful use of the problem-solving process facilitates the client’s confidence in the use of coping skills.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Positive feedback at each step will give the</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Clients can complete some rating scales for depression; mental health professionals administer others. These assessment tools, along with evaluation of behavior, thought processes, history, family history, and situational factors, help create a diagnostic picture. Self-rating scales of depressive symptoms include the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. Self-rating scales are used for case finding in the general public and may be used over the course of treatment to determine improvement from the client's perspective.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Box 17.1) is a clinician-rated depression scale used like a clinical interview. The clinician rates the range of the client's behaviors, such as depressed mood, guilt, suicide, and insomnia. There is also a section to score diurnal variations, depersonalization (sense of unreality about the self), paranoid symptoms, and obsessions.</p>

<p>Outcomes for clients with depression relate to how the depression is manifested—for instance, whether or not the person is slow or agitated, sleeps too much or too little, or eats too much or too little. Examples of outcomes for a client with the psychomotor retardation form of depression include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client will not injure him or herself.</li>
<li>The client will independently carry out activities of daily living (showering, changing clothing, grooming).</li>
<li>The client will establish a balance of rest, sleep, and activity.</li>
<li>The client will establish a balance of adequate nutrition, hydration, and elimination.</li>
<li>The client will evaluate self-attributes realistically.</li>
<li>The client will socialize with staff, peers, and family/friends.</li>
<li>The client will return to occupation or school activities.</li>
<li>The client will comply with an antidepressant regimen.</li>
<li>The client will verbalize symptoms of a recurrence.</li>

<p>The first priority is to determine whether a client with depression is suicidal. If a client has suicidal ideation or hears voices commanding him or her to commit suicide, measures to provide a safe environment are necessary. If the client has a suicide plan, the nurse asks additional questions to determine the lethality of the intent and plan. The nurse reports this information to the treatment team. Health care personnel follow hospital or agency policies and procedures for instituting suicide precautions (e.g., removal of harmful items, increased supervision). A thorough discussion is presented later in this chapter.</p>

<p>It is important to have meaningful contact with clients who have depression and to begin a therapeutic relationship, regardless of the state of depression. Some clients are quite open in describing their feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, or agitation. Clients may be unable to sustain a long interaction, so several shorter visits help the nurse assess status and establish a therapeutic relationship.</p>
<p>The nurse may find it difficult to interact with these clients because of empathy with such sadness and depression. The nurse may also feel unable to “do anything” for clients with limited responses. Clients with psychomotor are noncommunicative or may even be mute. The nurse can sit with such clients for a few minutes at intervals throughout the day. The nurse’s presence conveys genuine interest and caring. It is not necessary for the nurse to talk to clients the entire time; rather, silence can convey that clients are worthwhile even if they are not interacting.</p>
<p>&gt; “My name is Sheila. I’m your nurse today. I’m going to sit with you for a few minutes. If you need anything, or if you would like to talk, please tell me.”</p>
<p>After time has elapsed, the nurse would say:</p>
<p>&gt; “I’m going now. I will be back in an hour to see you again.”</p>
<p>It is also important that the nurse avoids being overly cheerful or trying to “cheer up” clients. It is impossible to coax or to humor clients out of depression. In fact, an overly cheerful approach may make clients feel worse or convey a lack of understanding of the despair.</p>

<p>The ability to perform daily activities is related to the level of psychomotor retardation. To assess ability to perform activities of daily living independently, the nurse first asks the client to perform the global task. For example,</p>
<p>&gt; “Martin, it’s time to get dressed.” (global task)</p>
<p>If a client cannot respond to the global request, the nurse breaks the task into smaller segments. Clients with depression can become overwhelmed</p>
<p>easily with a task that has several steps. The nurse can use success in small, concrete steps as a basis to increase self-esteem and to build competency for a slightly more complex task the next time.</p>
<p>If clients cannot choose between articles of clothing, the nurse selects the clothing and directs clients to put them on. For example,</p>
<p>“Here are your gray slacks. Put them on.”</p>
<p>This still allows clients to participate in dressing. If this is what clients are capable of doing at this point, this activity will reduce dependence on staff. This request is concrete, and if clients cannot do this, the nurse has information about the level of psychomotor retardation.</p>
<p>If a client cannot put on slacks, the nurse assists by saying,</p>
<p>“Let me help you with your slacks, Martin.”</p>
<p>The nurse helps clients dress only when they cannot perform any of the above steps. This allows clients to do as much as possible for themselves and to avoid becoming dependent on the staff. The nurse can carry out this same process with clients when they eat, take a shower, and perform routine self-care activities.</p>
<p>Because abilities change over time, the nurse must assess them on an ongoing basis. This continual assessment takes more time than simply helping clients dress. Nevertheless, it promotes independence and provides dynamic assessment data about psychomotor abilities.</p>
<p>Often, clients decline to engage in activities because they are too fatigued or have no interest. The nurse can validate these feelings, yet promote participation. For example,</p>
<p>“I know you feel like staying in bed, but it is time to get up for breakfast.”</p>
<p>Often, clients may want to stay in bed until they “feel like getting up” or feel like engaging in activities of daily living. The nurse can let clients know that they must become more active to feel better rather than waiting passively for improvement. It may be helpful to avoid asking “yes-or-no” questions. Instead of asking, “Do you want to get up now?,” the nurse would say, “It is time to get up now.”</p>

<p>Reestablishing balanced nutrition can be challenging when clients have no appetite or don't feel like eating. The nurse can explain that beginning to eat helps stimulate appetite. Food offered frequently and in small amounts can prevent overwhelming clients with a large meal that they feel unable to eat. Sitting quietly with clients during meals can promote eating. Monitoring food and fluid intake may be necessary until clients are consuming adequate amounts.</p>
<p>Promoting sleep may include the short-term use of a sedative or giving medication in the evening if drowsiness or sedation is a side effect. It is also important to encourage clients to remain out of bed and active during the day to facilitate sleeping at night. It is important to monitor the number of hours clients sleep as well as whether they feel refreshed on awakening.</p>

<p>Clients with depression are often overwhelmed by the intensity of their emotions. Talking about these feelings can be beneficial. Initially, the nurse encourages clients to describe in detail how they are feeling. Sharing the burden with another person can provide some relief. At these times, the nurse can listen attentively, encourage clients, and validate the intensity of the experience. For example,</p>
<p>Nurse: “How are you feeling today?” (broad opening)</p>
<p>695</p>
<p>Client: "I feel so awful ... terrible."</p>
<p>Nurse: "Tell me more. What is that like for you?" (using a general lead; encouraging description)</p>
<p>Client: "I don't feel like myself. I don't know what to do."</p>
<p>Nurse: "That must be frightening." (validating)</p>
<p>It is important at this point that the nurse does not attempt to "fix" the client's difficulties or offer clichés such as, "Things will get better" or "But you know your family really needs you." Although the nurse may have good intentions, remarks of this type belittle the client's feelings or make the client feel more guilty and worthless.</p>
<p>As clients begin to improve, the nurse can help them learn or rediscover more effective coping strategies such as talking to friends, spending leisure time to relax, taking positive steps to deal with stressors, and so forth. Improved coping skills may not prevent, depression but may assist clients in dealing with the effects of depression more effectively.</p>

<p>The increased activity and improved mood that antidepressants produce can provide the energy for suicidal clients to carry out the act. Thus, the nurse must assess suicide risk even when clients are receiving antidepressants. It is also important to ensure that clients ingest the medication and are not saving it in attempt to commit suicide. As clients become ready for discharge, careful assessment of suicide potential is important because they will have a supply of antidepressant medication at home. SSRIs are rarely fatal in overdose, but cyclic and MAOI antidepressants are potentially fatal. Prescriptions may need to be limited to only a 1-week supply at a time if concerns linger about overdose.</p>
<p>An important component of client care is management of side effects. The nurse must make careful observations and ask clients pertinent questions to determine how they are tolerating medications. Tables 17.1 through 17.4 give specific interventions to manage side effects of antidepressant medications.</p>
<p>Clients and their families must learn how to manage the medication regimen because clients may need to take these medications for months, years, or even a lifetime. Education promotes compliance. Clients must know how often they need to return for monitoring and diagnostic tests.</p>

<p>Teaching clients and families about depression is important. They must understand that depression is an illness, not a lack of willpower or motivation. Learning about the beginning symptoms of relapse may assist clients in seeking treatment early and avoiding a lengthy recurrence.</p>
<p>Clients and families should know that treatment outcomes are best when psychotherapy and antidepressants are combined. Psychotherapy helps clients explore anger, dependence, guilt, hopelessness, helplessness, object loss, interpersonal issues, and irrational beliefs. The goal is to reverse negative views of the future, improve self-image, and help clients gain competence and self-mastery. The nurse can help clients to find a therapist through mental health centers in specific communities.</p>

<p>Evaluation of the plan of care is based on achievement of individual client outcomes. It is essential that clients feel safe and do not experience uncontrollable urges to commit suicide. Participation in therapy and medication compliance produces more favorable outcomes for clients with depression. Being able to identify signs of relapse and to seek treatment immediately can significantly decrease the severity of a depressive episode.</p>

<p>Bipolar disorder involves extreme mood swings from episodes of mania to episodes of depression. (Bipolar disorder was formerly known as manic-depressive illness.) During manic phases, clients are euphoric, grandiose, energetic, and sleepless. They have poor judgment and rapid thoughts, actions, and speech. During depressed phases, mood, behavior, and thoughts are the same as in people diagnosed with major depression (see previous discussion). In fact, if a person's first episode of bipolar illness is a depressed phase, he or she might be diagnosed with major depression; a diagnosis of bipolar disorder may not be made until the person experiences a manic episode. To increase awareness about bipolar disorder, health care professionals can use tools such as the Mood Disorder Questionnaire. This tool is available at <a href="http://www.sadag.org/images/pdf/mdq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.sadag.org/images/pdf/mdq.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Bipolar disorder ranks second only to major depression as a cause of worldwide disability. The lifetime risk for bipolar disorder is at least 1.2%, with a risk of completed suicide for 15%. Young men early in the course of the illness are at the highest risk for suicide, especially those with a history of suicide attempts or alcohol abuse as well as those recently discharged from the hospital (Akiskal, 2017).</p>
<p>While a person with major depression slowly slides into depression that can last for 6 months to 2 years, the person with bipolar disorder cycles between depression and normal behavior (bipolar depressed) or mania and normal behavior (bipolar manic). A person with bipolar mixed episodes alternates between major depressive and manic episodes interspersed with periods of normal behavior. Each mood may last for weeks or months before the pattern begins to descend or ascend once again. Figure 17.1 shows the three categories of bipolar cycles.</p>

<li>Bipolar type I—Manic episodes with at least one depressive episode.</li>
<li>Bipolar type II—Recurrent depressive episodes with at least one hypomanic episode.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bipolar disorder occurs almost equally among men and women. It is more common in highly educated people. Because some people with bipolar illness deny their mania, prevalence rates may actually be higher than reported.</p>

<p>The first manic episode generally occurs in a person's teens, 20s, or 30s. Currently, debate exists about whether or not some children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder actually have a very early onset of bipolar disorder. Manic episodes typically begin suddenly with rapid escalation of symptoms over a few days, and they last from a few weeks to several months. They tend to be briefer and end more suddenly than depressive episodes. Adolescents are more likely to have psychotic manifestations.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of a manic episode or mania requires at least 1 week of unusual and incessantly heightened, grandiose, or agitated mood in addition to three or more of the following symptoms: exaggerated self-esteem,</p>
<p>sleeplessness, pressured speech, flight of ideas, reduced ability to filter extraneous stimuli, distractibility, increased activities with increased energy, and multiple, grandiose, high-risk activities involving poor judgment and severe consequences, such as spending sprees, sex with strangers, and impulsive investments (Akiskal, 2017).</p>
<p>Clients often do not understand how their illness affects others. They may stop taking medications because they like the euphoria and feel burdened by the side effects, blood tests, and physicians' visits needed to maintain treatment. Family members are concerned and exhausted by their loved ones' behaviors; they often stay up late at night for fear that the manic person may do something impulsive and dangerous.</p>

<p>Treatment for bipolar disorder involves a lifetime regimen of medications—either an antimanic agent called lithium or anticonvulsant medications used as mood stabilizers (see Chapter 2). This is the only psychiatric disorder in which medications can prevent acute cycles of bipolar behavior. Once thought to help reduce manic behavior only, lithium and these anticonvulsants also protect against the effects of bipolar depressive cycles. If a client in the acute stage of mania or depression exhibits psychosis (disordered thinking as seen with delusions, hallucinations, and illusions), an antipsychotic agent is administered in addition to the bipolar medications. Some clients keep taking both bipolar medications and antipsychotics.</p>
<p><strong>Lithium.</strong> Lithium is a salt contained in the human body; it is similar to gold, copper, magnesium, manganese, and other trace elements. Once believed to be helpful for bipolar mania only, investigators quickly realized that lithium could also partially or completely mute the cycling toward bipolar depression. The response rate in acute mania to lithium therapy is 70% to 80%. In addition to treating the range of bipolar behaviors, lithium can also stabilize bipolar disorder by reducing the degree and frequency of cycling or eliminating manic episodes (Severus, Bauer, &amp; Geddes, 2018).</p>
<p>Lithium not only competes for salt receptor sites but also affects calcium, potassium, and magnesium ions as well as glucose metabolism. Its mechanism of action is unknown, but it is thought to work in the synapses to hasten destruction of catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine), inhibit</p>
<p>700</p>
<p>neurotransmitter release, and decrease the sensitivity of postsynaptic receptors (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018).</p>
<p>Lithium's action peaks in 30 minutes to 4 hours for regular forms and in 4 to 6 hours for the slow-release form. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and placenta and is distributed in sweat and breast milk. Lithium use during pregnancy is not recommended because it can lead to first-trimester developmental abnormalities. Onset of action is 5 to 14 days; with this lag period, antipsychotic or antidepressant agents are used carefully in combination with lithium to reduce symptoms in acutely manic or acutely depressed clients. The half-life of lithium is 20 to 27 hours (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018).</p>
<p>DSM5-TR DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA: Bipolar I Disorder</p>
<p>Manic Episode</p>
<p>A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).</p>
<p>B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.</li>
<li>Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).</li>
<li>More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.</li>
<li>Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.</li>
<li>Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.</li>
<li>Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexuality) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).</li>
<li>Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).</li>
</ol>
<p>701</p>
<p>C. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.
D. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical condition.</p>
<p>Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, ECT) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and therefore a bipolar I diagnosis.</p>
<p>Note: Criteria A to D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.</p>

The rest do not respond or have difficulty taking lithium because of side effects, problems with the treatment regimen, drug interactions, or medical conditions such as renal disease that contraindicate use of lithium. Several anticonvulsants traditionally used to treat seizure disorders have proved helpful in stabilizing the moods of people with bipolar illness. These drugs are categorized as miscellaneous anticonvulsants. Their mechanism of action is largely unknown, but they may raise the brain's threshold for dealing with stimulation; this prevents the person from being bombarded with external and internal stimuli (Table 17.6).</p>

<p>Carbamazepine (Tegretol), which had been used for grand mal and temporal lobe epilepsy as well as for trigeminal neuralgia, was the first anticonvulsant found to have mood-stabilizing properties, but the threat of agranulocytosis was of great concern. Clients taking carbamazepine need to have drug serum levels checked regularly to monitor for toxicity and to determine whether the drug has reached therapeutic levels, which are generally 4 to 12 µg/mL (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018). Baseline and periodic laboratory testing must also be done to monitor for suppression of white blood cells.</p>
<p>Valproic acid (Depakote), also known as divalproex sodium or sodium valproate, is an anticonvulsant used for simple absence and mixed seizures, migraine prophylaxis, and mania. The mechanism of action is unclear. Therapeutic levels are monitored periodically to remain at 50 to 125 µg/mL, as are baseline and ongoing liver function tests, including serum ammonia levels and platelet and bleeding times.</p>
<p>Gabapentin (Neurontin), lamotrigine (Lamictal), and topiramate (Topamax) are other anticonvulsants sometimes used as mood stabilizers, but they are used less frequently than valproic acid. Value ranges for therapeutic levels are not established.</p>
<p>Clonazepam (Klonopin) is an anticonvulsant and a benzodiazepine (a schedule IV controlled substance) used in simple absence and minor motor seizures, panic disorder, and bipolar disorder. Physiological dependence can develop with long-term use. This drug may be used in lithium or other mood stabilizers, but is not used alone to manage bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Aripiprazole (Abilify), brexpiprazole (Rexulti), and cariprazine (Vraylar) are dopamine system stabilizer antipsychotic medications used as adjuncts to other mood-stabilizing drugs. When other mood stabilizers alone are inadequate in controlling symptoms, the addition of these medications is</p>
<p>704</p>
<p>effective in both the acute and maintenances phases of treatment (Mazza et al., 2018; Muneer, 2016).</p>
<p>Second-generation antipsychotic medications are often used in conjunction with mood stabilizers or antidepressants to treat bipolar disorder. Ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda), and quetiapine (Seroquel) are most effective. They prevent a "switch to mania" when persons are treated for a depressed episode and manage psychotic symptoms that are associated with mania in some people (Bauer, Miller, Bajor, &amp; Lee, 2016).</p>

<p>Psychotherapy can be useful in the mildly depressive or normal portion of the bipolar cycle. It is not useful during acute manic stages because the person's attention span is brief and he or she can gain little insight during times of accelerated psychomotor activity. Psychotherapy combined with medication can reduce the risk for suicide and injury, provide support to the client and family, and help the client accept the diagnosis and treatment plan.</p>

<p>Taking a history with a client in the manic phase often proves difficult. The client may jump from subject to subject, which makes it difficult for the nurse to follow. Obtaining data in several short sessions as well as talking to family members may be necessary. The nurse can obtain much information, however, by watching and listening.</p>

<p>Clients with mania experience psychomotor agitation and seem to be in perpetual motion; sitting still is difficult. This continual movement has many ramifications; clients can become exhausted or injure themselves.</p>
<p>In the manic phase, the client may wear clothes that reflect the elevated mood—brightly colored, flamboyant, attention-getting, and perhaps sexually suggestive. For example, a woman in the manic phase may wear a lot of jewelry and hair ornaments, or her makeup may be garish and heavy, while a male client may wear a tight and revealing muscle shirt or go bare-chested.</p>
<p>Clients experiencing a manic episode think, move, and talk fast. Pressured speech, one of the hallmark symptoms, is evidenced by unrelentingly rapid and often loud speech without pauses. Those with pressured speech interrupt and cannot listen to others. They ignore verbal and nonverbal cues, indicating that others wish to speak, and they continue with constant intelligible or unintelligible speech, turning from one listener to another or speaking to no one at all. If interrupted, clients with mania often start over from the beginning.</p>

<p>Mania is reflected in periods of euphoria, exuberant activity, grandiosity, and false sense of well-being. Projection of an all-knowing and all-powerful image may be an unconscious defense against underlying low self-esteem. Some clients manifest mania with an angry, verbally aggressive tone and are sarcastic and irritable, especially when others set limits on their behavior. Clients' mood is quite labile, and they may alternate between periods of loud laughter and episodes of tears.</p>

<p>Cognitive ability or thinking is confused and jumbled with thoughts racing one after another, which is often referred to as flight of ideas. Clients cannot connect concepts, and they jump from one subject to another. Circumstantiality and tangentiality also characterize thinking. At times, clients may be unable to communicate thoughts or needs in ways that others understand.</p>
<p>These clients start many projects at one time, but cannot carry any to completion. There is little true planning, but clients talk nonstop about plans and projects to anyone and everyone, insisting on the importance of accomplishing these activities. Sometimes, they try to enlist help from others in one or more activities. They do not consider risks or personal</p>
<p>706</p>
<p>experience, abilities, or resources. Clients start these activities as they occur in their thought processes. Examples of these multiple activities are going on shopping sprees, using credit cards excessively while unemployed and broke, starting several business ventures at once, having promiscuous sex, gambling, taking impulsive trips, embarking on illegal endeavors, making risky investments, talking with multiple people, and speeding.</p>
<p>Some clients experience psychotic features during mania; they express grandiose delusions involving importance, fame, privilege, and wealth. Some may claim to be the president, a famous movie star, or even God or a prophet.</p>

<p>Clients may be oriented to person and place but rarely to time. Intellectual functioning, such as fund of knowledge, is difficult to assess during the manic phase. Clients may claim to have many abilities they do not possess. The ability to concentrate or to pay attention is grossly impaired. Again, if a client is psychotic, he or she may experience hallucinations.</p>

<p>People in the manic phase are easily angered and irritated and strike back at what they perceive as censorship by others because they impose no restrictions on themselves. They are impulsive and rarely think before acting or speaking, which makes their judgment poor. Insight is limited because they believe they are "fine" and have no problems. They blame any difficulties on others.</p>

<p>Clients with mania often have exaggerated self-esteem; they believe they can accomplish anything. They rarely discuss their self-concept realistically. Nevertheless, a false sense of well-being masks difficulties with chronic low self-esteem.</p>

<p>Clients in the manic phase can rarely fulfill role responsibilities. They have trouble at work or school (if they are even attending) and are too distracted and hyperactive to pay attention to children or activities of daily living. Although they may begin many tasks or projects, they complete few.</p>
<p>707</p>
<p>These clients have a great need to socialize but little understanding of their excessive, overpowering, and confrontational social interactions. Their need for socialization often leads to promiscuity. Clients invade the intimate space and personal business of others. Arguments result when others feel threatened by such boundary invasions. Although the usual mood of manic people is elation, emotions are unstable and can fluctuate (labile emotions) readily between euphoria and hostility. Clients with mania can become hostile to others whom they perceive as standing in way of desired goals. They cannot postpone or delay gratification. For example, a manic client tells his wife, “You are the most wonderful woman in the world. Give me $50 so I can buy you a ticket to the opera.” When she refuses, he snarls and accuses her of being cheap and selfish and may even strike her.</p>

<p>“Everyone is stupid! What is the matter? Have you all taken dumb pills? Dumb pills, rum pills, shlummy shlum lum pills!” Mitch screamed as he waited for his staff to snap to attention and get with the program. He had started the Pickle Barn 10 years ago and now had a money-making business canning and delivering gourmet pickles.</p>
<p>He knew how to do everything in this place and running from person to person to watch what each was doing, he didn’t like what he saw. It was 8 AM, and he’d already fired the supervisor, who had been with him for 5 years.</p>
<p>By 8:02 AM, Mitch had fired six assistants because he did not like the way they looked. Then, Mitch threw pots and paddles at them because they weren’t leaving fast enough. Rich, his brother, walked in during this melee and quietly asked everyone to stay, then invited Mitch outside for a walk.</p>
<p>“Are you nuts?” Mitch screamed at his brother. “Everyone here is out of control. I have to do everything.” Mitch was trembling, shaking. He hadn’t slept in 3 days and didn’t need to. The only time he’d left the building in these 3 days was to have sex with any woman who had agreed. He felt euphoric, supreme, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. He glared at Rich. “I feel good! What are you bugging me for?” He slammed out the door, shrilly reciting, “Rich and Mitch! Rich and Mitch! Pickle king rich!”</p>
<p>“Rich and Mitch, Rich and Mitch. With dear old auntie, now we’re</p>
<p>708</p>
<p>rich." Mitch couldn't stop talking and speed walking. Watching Mitch, Rich gently said, "Aunt Jen called me last night. She says you are manic again. When did you stop taking your lithium?"</p>
<p>"Manic? Who's manic? I'm just feeling good. Who needs that stuff? I like to feel good. It is wonderful, marvelous, stupendous. I am not manic," shrieked Mitch as he swerved around to face his brother. Rich, weary and sad, said, "I am taking you to the emergency psych unit. If you do not agree to go, I will have the police take you. I know you don't see this in yourself, but you are out of control and getting dangerous."</p>

<p>Clients with mania can go days without sleep or food and not even realize they are hungry or tired. They may be on the brink of physical exhaustion but are unwilling or unable to stop, rest, or sleep. They often ignore personal hygiene as "boring" when they have "more important things" to do.

<p>Because of the safety risks that clients in the manic phase take, safety plays a primary role in care followed by issues related to self-esteem and socialization. A primary nursing responsibility is to provide a safe environment for clients and others. The nurse assesses clients directly for suicidal ideation and plans or thoughts of hurting others. In addition, clients in the manic phase have little insight into their anger and agitation and how their behaviors affect others. They often intrude into others' space, take others' belongings without permission, or appear aggressive in approaching others. This behavior can threaten or anger people who then</p>
<p>retaliate. It is important to monitor the clients' whereabouts and behaviors frequently.</p>
<p>The nurse should also tell clients that staff members will help them control their behavior if clients cannot do so alone. For clients who feel out of control, the nurse must establish external controls empathetically and nonjudgmentally. These external controls provide long-term comfort to clients, though their initial response may be aggression. People in the manic phase have labile emotions; it is not unusual for them to strike staff members who have set limits in a way clients dislike.</p>
<p>These clients physically and psychologically invade boundaries. It is necessary to set limits when they cannot set limits on themselves. For example, the nurse might say,</p>
<p>“John, you are too close to my face. Please stand back 2 ft.”</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>“It is unacceptable to hug other clients. You may talk to others, but do not touch them.”</p>
<p>When setting limits, it is important to clearly identify the unacceptable behavior and the expected, appropriate behavior. All staff must consistently set and enforce limits for those limits to be effective.</p>

<p>Clients with mania may get little rest or sleep, even if they are on the brink of physical exhaustion. Medication may be helpful, though clients may resist taking it. Decreasing environmental stimulation may assist clients in relaxing. The nurse provides a quiet environment without noise, television, or other distractions. Establishing a bedtime routine, such as a tepid bath, may help clients calm down enough to rest.</p>
<p>Nutrition is another area of concern. Manic clients may be "too busy" to sit down and eat, or they may have such poor concentration that they fail to stay interested in food for long. "Finger foods" or things clients can eat while moving around are the best options to improve nutrition. Such foods should also be as high in calories and protein as possible. For example, celery and carrots are finger foods, but they supply little nutrition. Sandwiches, protein bars, and fortified shakes are better choices. Clients with mania also benefit from food that is easy to eat without much</p>
<p>713</p>
<p>preparation. Meat that must be cut into bite sizes or plates of spaghetti are not likely to be successful options. Having snacks available between meals, so clients can eat whenever possible, is also useful.</p>

<p>Clients with mania have short attention spans, so the nurse uses clear, simple sentences when communicating. They may not be able to handle a lot of information at once, so the nurse breaks information into many small segments. It helps to ask clients to repeat brief messages to ensure they have heard and incorporated them.</p>
<p>Clients may need to undergo baseline and follow-up laboratory tests. A brief explanation of the purpose of each test allows anxiety. The nurse gives printed information to reinforce verbal messages, especially those related to rules, schedules, civil rights, treatment, staff names, and client education.</p>
<p>The speech of manic clients may be pressured—rapid, circumstantial, rhyming, noisy, or intrusive with flights of ideas. Such disordered speech indicates thought processes that are flooded with thoughts, ideas, and</p>
<p>714</p>
<p>impulses. The nurse must keep channels of communication open with clients, regardless of speech patterns. The nurse can say,</p>
<p>&gt; “Please speak more slowly. I’m having trouble following you.”</p>
<p>This puts the responsibility for the communication difficulty on the nurse rather than on the client. This nurse patiently and frequently repeats this request during conversation because clients will return to rapid speech.</p>
<p>Clients in the manic phase often use pronouns when referring to people, making it difficult for listeners to understand who is being discussed and when the conversation has moved to a new subject. While clients are agitatedly talking, they are usually thinking and moving just as quickly, so it is a challenge for the nurse to follow a coherent story. The nurse can ask clients to identify each person, place, or thing being discussed.</p>
<p>When speech includes flight of ideas, the nurse can ask clients to explain the relationship between topics, for example,</p>
<p>&gt; “What happened then?”
&gt; or
&gt;
&gt; “Was that before or after you got married?”</p>
<p>The nurse also assesses and documents the coherence of messages.</p>
<p>Clients with pressured speech rarely let others speak. Instead, they talk nonstop until they run out of steam or just stand there looking at the other person before moving away. Those with pressured speech do not respond to others’ verbal or nonverbal signals that indicate a desire to speak. The nurse avoids becoming involved in power struggles over who will dominate the conversation. Instead, the nurse may talk to clients away from others so there is no “competition” for the nurse’s attention. The nurse also sets limits regarding taking turns speaking and listening as well as giving attention to others when they need it. Clients with mania cannot have all requests granted immediately even though that may be their desire.</p>

<p>These clients need to be protected from their pursuit of socially unacceptable and risky behaviors. The nurse can direct their need for movement into socially acceptable, large motor activities, such as arranging chairs for a community meeting or walking. In acute mania,</p>
<p>715</p>
<p>clients lose the ability to control their behaviors and engage in risky activities. Because acutely manic clients feel extraordinarily powerful, they place few restrictions on themselves. They act out impulsive thoughts, have inflated and grandiose perceptions of their abilities, are demanding, and need immediate gratification. This can affect their physical, social, occupational, or financial safety as well as that of others. Clients may make purchases that exceed their ability to pay. They may give away money or jewelry or other possessions. The nurse may need to monitor a client's access to such items until his or her behavior is less impulsive.</p>
<p>In an acute manic episode, clients may also lose sexual inhibitions, resulting in provocative and risky behaviors. Clothing may be flashy or revealing, or clients may undress in public areas. They may engage in unprotected sex with virtual strangers. Clients may ask staff members or other clients (of the same or opposite sex) for sex, graphically describe sexual acts, or display their genitals. The nurse handles such behavior in a matter-of-fact, nonjudgmental manner. For example,</p>
<p>&gt; “Mary, let’s go to your room and find a sweater.”</p>
<p>It is important to treat clients with dignity and respect despite their inappropriate behavior. It is not helpful to “scold” or chastise them; they are not children engaging in willful misbehavior.</p>
<p>In the manic phase, clients cannot understand personal boundaries, so it is the staff’s role to keep clients in view for intervention as necessary. For example, a staff member who sees a client invading the intimate space of others can say,</p>
<p>&gt; “Jeffrey, I’d appreciate your help in setting up a circle of chairs in the group therapy room.”</p>
<p>This large motor activity distracts Jeffrey from his inappropriate behavior, appeals to his need for heightened physical activity, is noncompetitive, and is socially acceptable. The staff’s vigilant redirection to a more socially appropriate activity protects clients from the hazards of unprotected sex and reduces embarrassment over such behaviors when they return to normal behavior.</p>

<p>Lithium is not metabolized; rather, it is reabsorbed by the proximal tubule</p>
<p>716</p>
<p>and excreted in the urine. Periodic serum lithium levels are used to monitor the client's safety and to ensure that the dose given has increased the serum lithium level to a treatment level or reduced it to a maintenance level. There is a narrow range of safety among maintenance levels (0.5–1 mEq/L), treatment levels (0.8–1.5 mEq/L), and toxic levels (1.5 mEq/L and above). It is important to assess for signs of toxicity and to ensure that clients and their families have this information before discharge (Table 17.7). Older adults can have symptoms of toxicity at lower serum levels. Lithium is potentially fatal in overdose.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Serum Lithium Level</th><th>Symptoms of Lithium Toxicity</th><th>Interventions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.5–2 mEq/L</td><td>Nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, reduced coordination, drowsiness, slurred speech, and muscle weakness</td><td>Withhold next dose; call physician.

Hemodialysis may also be used to remove lithium from the body. Respiratory, circulatory, thyroid, and immune systems are monitored and assisted as needed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Clients should drink adequate water (approximately 2 L/day) and continue with the usual amount of dietary table salt. Having too much salt in the diet because of unusually salty foods or the ingestion of salt-containing antacids can reduce receptor availability for lithium and increase lithium excretion, so the lithium level will be too low. If there is</p>
<p>717</p>
<p>too much water, lithium is diluted and the lithium level will be too low to be therapeutic. Drinking too little water or losing fluid through excessive sweating, vomiting, or diarrhea increases the lithium level, which may result in toxicity. Monitoring daily weights and the balance between intake and output and checking for dependent edema can be helpful in monitoring fluid balance. The physician should be contacted if the client has diarrhea, fever, flu, or any condition that leads to dehydration.</p>
<p>Thyroid function tests are usually ordered as a baseline and every 6 months during treatment with lithium. In 6 to 18 months, one-third of clients taking lithium have an increased level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, which can cause anxiety, labile emotions, and sleeping difficulties. Decreased levels are implicated in fatigue and depression.</p>
<p>Because most lithium is excreted in the urine, baseline and periodic assessments of renal status are necessary to assess renal function. The reduced renal function in older adults necessitates lower doses. Lithium is contraindicated in people with compromised renal function or urinary retention and those taking low-salt diets or diuretics. Lithium is also contraindicated in people with brain or cardiovascular damage.</p>

<p>Educating clients about the dangers of risky behavior is necessary; however, clients with acute mania largely fail to heed such teaching because they have little patience or capacity to listen, understand, and see the relevance of this information. Clients with euphoria may not see why the behavior is a problem because they believe they can do anything without impunity. As they begin to cycle toward normalcy, however, risky behavior lessens, and they become ready and able for teaching.</p>
<p>Manic clients start many tasks, create many goals, and try to carry them out all at once. The result is that they cannot complete any. They move readily between these goals while sometimes obsessing about the importance of one over another, but the goals can quickly change. Clients may invest in a business in which they have no knowledge or experience, go on spending sprees, impulsively travel, speed, make new "best friends," and take the center of attention in any group. They are egocentric and have little concern for others, except as listeners, sexual partners, or the means to achieve one of their poorly conceived goals.</p>
<p>Education about the cause of bipolar disorder, medication management, ways to deal with behaviors, and potential problems that manic people can encounter is important for family members. Education reduces the guilt,</p>
<p>718</p>
<p>blame, and shame that accompany mental illness; increases client safety; enlarges the support system for clients and the family members; and promotes compliance. Education takes the "mystery" out of treatment for mental illness by providing a proactive view: this is what we know, this is what can be done, and this is what you can do to help.</p>
<p>Family members often say they know clients have stopped taking their medication when, for example, clients become more argumentative, talk about buying expensive items that they cannot afford, hotly deny anything is wrong, or demonstrate any other signs of escalating mania. People sometimes need permission to act on their observations, so a family education session is an appropriate place to give this permission and to set up interventions for various behaviors.</p>
<p>Clients should learn to adhere to the established dosage of lithium and not to omit doses or change dosage intervals; unprescribed dosage alterations interfere with maintenance of serum lithium levels. Clients should know about the many drugs that interact with lithium and should tell each physician they consult that they are taking lithium. When a client taking lithium seems to have increased manic behavior, lithium levels should be checked to determine whether there is lithium toxicity. Periodic monitoring of serum lithium levels is necessary to ensure the safety and adequacy of the treatment regimen. Persistent thirst and diluted urine can indicate the need to call a physician and have the serum lithium level checked to see if the dosage needs to be reduced.</p>
<p>Clients and family members should know the symptoms of lithium toxicity and interventions to take, including backup plans if the physician is not immediately available. The nurse should give these in writing and explain them to clients and family.</p>

<p>Suicide is the intentional act of killing oneself. Suicidal thoughts are common in people with mood disorders, especially depression. Each year, more than 45,000 suicides are reported in the United States; this represents just under a 30% increase in the past two decades (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2018). Suicide attempts are estimated to be 8 to 10 times higher than completed suicides. In the United States, men commit approximately 72% of suicides, which is roughly three times the rate of women, although women are four times more likely than men to attempt suicide. The higher suicide rates for men are partly the result of the method chosen (e.g., shooting, hanging, jumping from a high place). Women are more likely to overdose on medication. Men, young women, whites, and separated and divorced people are at increased risk for suicide. Adults older than 65 years compose 10% of the population but account for 25% of suicides. Suicide is the second leading cause of death (after accidents) among people aged 15 to 24 years. The rate of suicide is increasing most rapidly among those ages 45 to 65 years (CDC, 2018).</p>
<p>Intentionally trying to commit suicide and self-injury behavior are often different concepts. However, it is crucial to remember that one does not exclude the other. Persons who self-injure can and do commit suicide. It is</p>
<p>720</p>
<p>important to assess for both, and never think someone is "safe" from suicide because they typically self-injure.</p>
<p>Clients with psychiatric disorders, especially depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder, and borderline personality disorder, are at increased risk for suicide. Chronic medical illnesses associated with increased risk for suicide include cancer, HIV or AIDS, diabetes, cerebrovascular accidents, and head and spinal cord injury. Environmental factors that increase suicide risk include isolation, recent loss, lack of social support, unemployment, critical life events, and family history of depression or suicide. Behavioral factors that increase risk include impulsivity, erratic or unexplained changes from usual behavior, and unstable lifestyle (Rhimer &amp; Pompili, 2017).</p>
<p>Suicidal ideation means thinking about killing oneself. Active suicidal ideation is when a person thinks about and seeks ways to commit suicide. Passive suicidal ideation is when a person thinks about wanting to die or wishes he or she were dead but has no plans to cause his or her death. People with active suicidal ideation are considered more potentially lethal.</p>
<p>Attempted suicide is a suicidal act that either failed or was incomplete. In an incomplete suicide attempt, the person did not finish the act because (1) someone recognized the suicide attempt and responded or (2) the person was discovered and rescued.</p>
<p>Suicide involves ambivalence. Many fatal accidents may be impulsive suicides. It is impossible to know, for example, whether the person who drove into a telephone pole did this intentionally. Hence, keeping accurate statistics on suicide is difficult. There are also many myths and misconceptions about suicide of which the nurse should be aware. The nurse must know the facts and warning signs for those at risk for suicide as described in Box 17.2.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Suicidal people only want to hurt themselves, not others.</th><th>command the individual to kill others before killing the self. A depressed person who has decided to commit suicide with a gun may impulsively shoot the person who tries to grab the gun in an effort to thwart the suicide. Emotional harm: Often, family members, friends, health care professionals, and even police involved in trying to avert a suicide or those who did not realize the person's depression and plans to commit suicide feel intense guilt and shame because of their failure to help and are “stuck” in a never ending cycle of despair and grief. Some people, depressed after the suicide of a loved one, will rationalize that suicide was a “good way out of the pain” and plan their own suicide to escape pain. Some suicides are planned to engender guilt and pain in survivors (e.g., as someone who wants to punish another for rejecting or not returning love).</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>There is no way to help someone who wants to kill him or herself.</td><td>Suicidal people have mixed feelings (ambivalence) about the wish to die, wish to kill others, or to be killed. This ambivalence often prompts the cries for help evident in overt or covert cues. Intervention can help the suicidal individual get help from situational supports, choose to live, learn new ways to cope, and move forward in life.</td></tr><tr><td>Do not mention the word “suicide” to a person you suspect to be suicidal, because this could give him or her the idea to commit suicide.</td><td>Suicidal people have already thought of the idea of suicide and may have begun plans.

All plans, threats, gestures, or cues should be taken seriously and immediate help given that focuses on the problem about which the person is suicidal. When asked about suicide, it is often a relief for the client to know that his or her cries for help have been heard and that help is on the way.</td></tr><tr><td>Once a suicide risk, always a suicide risk.</td><td>Although it is true that most people who successfully commit suicide have made attempts at least once before, most people with suicidal ideation can have positive resolution to the suicidal crisis. With proper support, finding new ways to resolve the problem helps these individuals become emotionally secure and have no further need for suicide as a way to resolve a problem.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Assessment</p>
<p>A history of previous suicide attempts increases risk for suicide. The first 2 years after an attempt represents the highest risk period, especially the first 3 months. Those with a relative who committed suicide are at increased risk for suicide; the closer the relationship, the greater the risk. One possible explanation is that the relative's suicide offers a sense of "permission" or acceptance of suicide as a method of escaping a difficult situation. This familiarity and acceptance is also believed to contribute to "copycat suicides" by teenagers, who are greatly influenced by their peers' actions.</p>
<p>Many people with depression who have suicidal ideation lack the energy to implement suicide plans. The natural energy that accompanies increased sunlight in spring is believed to explain why most suicides occur in April. Most suicides happen on Monday mornings, when most people return to work (another energy spurt). Research has shown that antidepressant treatment can actually give clients with depression the energy to act on suicidal ideation.</p>

<p>Most people with suicidal ideation send either direct or indirect signals to others about their intent to harm themselves. The nurse never ignores any hint of suicidal ideation regardless of how trivial or subtle it seems and the client's intent or emotional status. Often, people contemplating suicide have ambivalent and conflicting feelings about their desire to die; they frequently reach out to others for help. For example, a client might say,</p>
<p>“I keep thinking about taking my entire supply of medications to end it all.” (direct) or “I just can’t take it anymore.” (indirect)</p>

<p>A few people who commit suicide give no warning signs. Some artfully hide their distress and suicide plans. Others act impulsively by taking advantage of a situation to carry out the desire to die. Some suicidal people in treatment describe placing themselves in risky or dangerous situations such as speeding in a blinding rainstorm or when intoxicated. This “Russian roulette” approach carries a high risk for harm to clients and innocent bystanders alike. It allows clients to feel brave by repeatedly confronting death and surviving.</p>

<p>Depressed clients who begin taking an antidepressant may have a continued or increased risk for suicide in the first few weeks of therapy. They may experience an increase in energy from the antidepressant but remain depressed. This increase in energy may make clients more likely to act on suicidal ideas and make them capable of carrying them out. Also, because antidepressants take several weeks to reach their peak effect, clients may become discouraged and act on suicidal ideas because they believe the medication is not helping them. For these reasons, it is extremely important to monitor the suicidal ideation of depressed clients until the risk has subsided.</p>

<p>When a client admits to having a “death wish” or suicidal thoughts, the next step is to determine potential lethality. This assessment involves asking the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the client have a plan? If so, what is it? Is the plan specific?</li>
<li>Are the means available to carry out this plan? (e.g., If the person plans to shoot himself, does he have access to a gun and ammunition?)</li>
<li>If the client carries out the plan, is it likely to be lethal? (e.g., A plan to take 10 aspirin is not lethal, while a plan to take a 2-week supply of a tricyclic antidepressant is.)</li>
<li>Has the client made preparations for death, such as giving away prized possessions, writing a suicide note, or talking to friends one last time?</li>
<li>Where and when does the client intend to carry out the plan?</li>
</ul>
<p>725</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the intended time a special date or anniversary that has meaning for the client?</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific and positive answers to these questions all increase the client's likelihood of committing suicide. It is important to consider whether the client believes his or her method is lethal even if it is not. Believing a method to be lethal poses a significant risk.</p>

<p>Suicide prevention usually involves treating the underlying disorder, such as mood disorder or psychosis, with psychoactive agents. The overall goals are first to keep the client safe and later to help him or her develop new coping skills that do not involve self-harm. Other outcomes may relate to activities of daily living, sleep and nourishment needs, and problems specific to the crisis such as stabilization of psychiatric illness/symptoms.</p>
<p>Examples of outcomes for a suicidal person include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client will be safe from harming self or others.</li>
<li>The client will engage in a therapeutic relationship.</li>
<li>The client will establish a no-suicide contract.</li>
<li>The client will create a list of positive attributes.</li>
<li>The client will generate, test, and evaluate realistic plans to address underlying issues.</li>

<p>Intervention for suicide or suicidal ideation becomes the first priority of nursing care. The nurse assumes an authoritative role to help clients stay safe. In this crisis situation, clients see few or no alternatives to resolve their problems. The nurse lets clients know their safety is the primary concern and takes precedence over other needs or wishes. For example, a client may want to be alone in his or her room to think privately. This is not allowed while he or she is at an increased risk for suicide.</p>

<p>Inpatient hospital units have policies for general environmental safety. Some policies are more liberal than others, but all usually deny clients access to</p>
<p>726</p>
<p>materials on cleaning carts, their own medications, sharp scissors, and pen knives. For suicidal clients, staff members remove any item they can use to commit suicide, such as sharp objects, shoelaces, belts, lighters, matches, pencils, pens, and even clothing with drawstrings.</p>
<p>Again, institutional policies for suicide precautions vary, but usually staff members observe clients every 10 minutes if lethality is low. For clients with high potential lethality, one-to-one supervision by a staff person is initiated. This means that clients are in direct sight of and no more than 2 to 3 ft away from a staff member for all activities, including going to the bathroom. Clients are under constant staff observation with no exceptions. This may be frustrating or upsetting to clients, so staff members usually need to explain the purpose of such supervision more than once.</p>
<p>No-suicide or no-self-harm contracts have been used with suicidal clients. In such contracts, clients agree to keep themselves safe and to notify staff at the first impulse to harm themselves (at home, clients agree to notify their caregivers; the contract must identify backup people in case caregivers are unavailable). These contracts, however, are not a guarantee of safety, and their use has been sharply criticized. At no time should a nurse assume that a client is safe based on a single statement by the client. Rather a complete assessment and a thorough discussion with the client are more reliable. Shifting the focus to "safety planning," that is, managing or mitigating suicidal risk, is a more effective intervention strategy (Stallman, 2018).</p>

<p>Suicidal clients often lack social support systems such as relatives and friends or religious, occupational, and community support groups. This lack may result from social withdrawal, behavior associated with a psychiatric or medical disorder, or movement of the person to a new area because of school, work, or change in family structure or financial status. The nurse assesses support systems and the type of help each person or group can give a client. Mental health clinics, hotlines, psychiatric emergency evaluation services, student health services, church groups, and self-help groups are part of the community support system.</p>
<p>The nurse makes a list of specific names and agencies that clients can call for support; he or she obtains client consent to avoid breach of confidentiality. Many suicidal people do not have to be admitted to a hospital and can be treated successfully in the community with the help of these support people and agencies.</p>

<p>Suicide is the ultimate rejection of family and friends. Implicit in the act of suicide is the message to others that their help was incompetent, irrelevant, or unwelcome. Some suicides are done to place blame on a certain person, even to the point of planning how that person will be the one to discover the body. Most suicides are efforts to escape untenable situations. Even if a person believes love for family members prompted his or her suicide—as in the case of someone who commits suicide to avoid lengthy legal battles or to save the family the financial and emotional cost of a lingering death, relatives still grieve and may feel guilt, shame, and anger.</p>
<p>Significant others may feel guilty for not knowing how desperate the suicidal person was, angry because the person did not seek their help or trust them, ashamed that their loved one ended his or her life with a socially unacceptable act, and sad about being rejected. Suicide is newsworthy, and there may be whispered gossip and even news coverage. Life insurance companies may not pay survivors' benefits to families of those who kill themselves. Also, the one death may spark "copycat suicides" among family members or others, who may believe they have been given permission to do the same. Families can disintegrate after a suicide.</p>

<p>When dealing with a client who has suicidal ideation or attempts, the nurse's attitude must indicate unconditional positive regard not for the act but for the person and his or her desperation. The ideas or attempts are serious signals of a desperate emotional state. The nurse must convey the belief that the person can be helped and can grow and change.</p>
<p>Trying to make clients feel guilty for thinking of or attempting suicide is not helpful; they already feel incompetent, hopeless, and helpless. The nurse does not blame clients or act judgmentally when asking about the details of a planned suicide. Rather, the nurse uses a nonjudgmental tone of voice and self-monitors his or her body language and facial expressions to make sure not to convey disgust or blame.</p>
<p>Nurses believe that one person can make a difference in another's life. They must convey this belief when caring for suicidal people. Nevertheless, nurses must also realize that no matter how competent and caring interventions are, a few clients will still commit suicide. A client's suicide can be devastating to the staff members who treated him or her, especially if they</p>
<p>have gotten to know the person and his or her family well over time. Even with therapy, staff members may end up leaving the health care facility or the profession as a result.</p>

<p>Assisted suicide is a topic of national legal and ethical debate, with much attention focusing on the court decisions related to the actions of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a physician who has participated in numerous assisted suicides. Oregon was the first state to adopt assisted suicide into law and has set up safeguards to prevent indiscriminate assisted suicide. Many people believe it should be legal in any state for health care professionals or family to assist those who are terminally ill and want to die. Others view suicide as against the laws of humanity and religion and believe that health care professionals should be prosecuted if they assist those trying to die. Groups, such as the Hemlock Society, and people who were in alignment with Dr. Kevorkian, are lobbying for changes in laws that would allow health care professionals and family members to assist with suicide attempts for the terminally ill. Controversy and emotion continue to surround the issue.</p>
<p>Often, nurses must care for terminally or chronically ill people with a poor quality of life, such as those with the intractable pain of terminal cancer or severe disability or those kept alive by life support systems. It is not the nurse's role to decide how long these clients must suffer. It is the nurse's role to provide supportive care for clients and family as they work through the difficult emotional decisions about if and when these clients should be allowed to die; people who have been declared legally dead can be disconnected from life support. Each state has defined legal death and the ways to determine it.</p>

<p>Depression is common among the elderly and is markedly increased when elders are medically ill. Older adults tend to have psychotic features, particularly delusions, more frequently than younger people with depression. Suicide among persons older than 65 years is doubled compared with suicide rates of persons younger than 65. Late-onset bipolar disorder is rare (Gatchel, Wilkins, Forester, Kelly, &amp; Alexopoulos, 2017).</p>
<p>Older adults are treated for depression with ECT more frequently than</p>
<p>729</p>
<p>younger persons. Elder persons have increased intolerance of side effects of antidepressant medications and may not be able to tolerate doses high enough to effectively treat the depression. Also, ECT produces a more rapid response than medications, which may be desirable if the depression is compromising the medical health of the elder person. Because suicide among the elderly is increased, the most rapid response to treatment becomes even more important (Heijnan et al., 2018).</p>

<p>Nurses in any area of practice in the community are frequently the first health care professionals to recognize behaviors consistent with mood disorders. In some cases, a family member may mention distress about a client's withdrawal from activities; difficulty thinking, eating, and sleeping; complaints of being tired all the time; sadness; and agitation (all symptoms of depression). They might also mention cycles of euphoria, spending binges, loss of inhibitions, changes in sleep and eating patterns, and loud clothing styles and colors (all symptoms of the manic phase of bipolar disorder). Documenting and reporting such behaviors can help these people to receive treatment. Estimates are that nearly 40% of people who have been diagnosed with a mood disorder do not receive treatment (Akiskal, 2017). Contributing factors may include the stigma still associated with mental disorders, the lack of understanding about the disruption to life that mood disorders can cause, confusion about treatment choices, or a more compelling medical diagnosis; these combine with the reality of limited time that health care professionals devote to any one client.</p>
<p>People with depression can be treated successfully in the community by psychiatrists, psychiatric advanced practice nurses, and primary care physicians. People with bipolar disorder, however, should be referred to a psychiatrist or psychiatric advanced practice nurse for treatment. The physician or nurse who treats a person with bipolar disorder must understand the drug treatment, dosages, desired effects, therapeutic levels, and potential side effects so that he or she can answer questions and promote compliance with treatment.</p>

<p>Many studies have been conducted to determine how to prevent mood disorders and suicide, but prediction of suicide risk in clinical practice</p>
<p>730</p>
<p>remains difficult. Programs that use an educational approach designed to address the unique stressors that contribute to the increased incidence of depressive illness in women have had some success. These programs focus on increasing self-esteem and reducing loneliness and hopelessness, which, in turn, decrease the likelihood of depression.</p>
<p>Efforts to improve primary care treatment of depression have built upon a chronic illness care model that includes improved screening and diagnosis in primary care settings, use of evidence-based protocols for treatment, and patient self-management, or helping people be better prepared to deal with life issues and changes. This includes having a partnership with a provider, having a crisis or relapse prevention plan, creating a social support network, and making needed behavioral changes to promote health. Effectiveness of care is enhanced through collaboration between primary care and mental health providers (Goldberg et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Because suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents, prevention, early detection, and treatment are important. Strengthening protective factors (those factors associated with a reduction in suicide risk) would improve the mental health of adolescents. Protective factors include close parent-child relationships, academic achievement, family life stability, and connectedness with peers and others outside the family. School-based programs can be universal (general information for all students) or indicated (targeting young people at risk). Indicated or selective programs have been more successful than universal programs. Likewise, screening for early detection of risk factors such as family strife, parental alcoholism or mental illness, history of fighting, and access to weapons in the home can lead to referral and early intervention. In addition, bullying and cyberbullying require joint efforts of parents, families, and schools to decrease victimization of youth and prevent suicide among young people who are the targets of these activities (Zaborskis, Ilionsky, Tesler, &amp; Heinz, 2018).</p>

<p>Boudreaux, Brown, and colleagues (2017) designed and built a web-based, self-administered safety planning application for individuals at risk for suicide. It is designed for use as an adjunct for safety planning, not to</p>
<p>731</p>
<p>replace contact with professionals. A pilot with a target sample of suicidal individuals was successful.</p>
<p>The next step is use of the app by clinicians as an adjunct to other therapies. Evaluation of systematic results with a larger population should yield results about the app's efficacy.</p>

<p>People with depression are usually negative, pessimistic, and unable to generate new ideas easily. They feel hopeless and incompetent. The nurse can easily become consumed with suggesting ways to fix the problems. Most clients find some reason why the nurse's solutions will not work: "I have tried that," "It would never work," "I don't have the time to do that," or "You just don't understand." Rejection of suggestions can make the nurse feel incompetent and question his or her professional skill. Unless a client is suicidal or is experiencing a crisis, the nurse does not try to solve the client's problems. Instead, the nurse uses therapeutic techniques to encourage clients to generate their own solutions. Studies have shown that clients tend to act on plans or solutions they generate rather than those that others offer (Schultz &amp; Videbeck, 2013). Finding and acting on their own solutions gives clients renewed competence and self-worth.</p>

<p>Nurses working with clients who are depressed often empathize with them and also begin to feel sad or agitated. They may unconsciously start to avoid contact with these clients to escape such feelings. The nurse must monitor his or her feelings and reactions closely when dealing with clients with depression to be sure that he or she fulfills the responsibility to establish a therapeutic nurse-client relationship.</p>
<p>Working with clients who are manic can be exhausting. They are so hyperactive that the nurse may feel spent or tired after caring for them. The nurse may feel frustrated because these clients engage in the same behaviors repeatedly, such as being intrusive with others, undressing, singing, rhyming, and dancing. It takes hard work to remain patient and calm with the manic</p>
<p>732</p>
<p>client, but it is essential for the nurse to provide limits and redirection in a calm manner until the client can control his or her own behavior independently.</p>
<p>Some health care professionals consider suicidal people to be failures, immoral, or unworthy of care. These negative attitudes may result from several factors. They may reflect society's negative view of suicide: many states still have laws against suicide, although they rarely enforce these laws. Health care professionals may feel inadequate and anxious dealing with suicidal clients, or they may be uncomfortable about their own mortality. Many people have had thoughts about "ending it all," even if for a fleeting moment when life is not going well. The scariness of remembering such flirtations with suicide causes anxiety. If this anxiety is not resolved, the staff person can demonstrate avoidance, demeaning behavior, and superiority to suicidal clients. Therefore, to be effective, the nurse must be aware of his or her own feelings and beliefs about suicide.</p>

<ul>
<li>Studies have found a genetic component to mood disorders. The incidence of depression is up to three times greater in first-degree relatives of people with diagnosed depression. People with bipolar disorder usually have a blood relative with bipolar disorder.</li>
<li>Only 9% of people with mood disorders exhibit psychosis.</li>
<li>Major depression is a mood disorder that robs the person of joy, self-esteem, and energy. It interferes with relationships and occupational productivity.</li>
<li>Symptoms of depression include sadness, disinterest in previously pleasurable activities, crying, lack of motivation, asocial behavior, and psychomotor retardation (slow thinking, talking, and movement). Sleep disturbances, somatic complaints, loss of energy, change in weight, and a sense of worthlessness are other common features.</li>
<li>Several antidepressants are used to treat depression. SSRIs have the fewest side effects. Tricyclic antidepressants are older and have a longer lag period before reaching adequate serum levels; they are the least expensive type. MAOIs are used least because clients are at risk for hypertensive crisis if they ingest tyramine-rich foods and fluids while taking these drugs. MAOIs also have a lag period before reaching adequate serum levels.</li>
<li>People with bipolar disorder cycle between mania, normalcy, and depression. They may also cycle only between mania and normalcy or between depression and normalcy.</li>
<li>Clients with mania have a labile mood, are grandiose and manipulative, have high self-esteem, and believe they are capable of anything. They sleep little, are always in frantic motion, invade others' boundaries, cannot sit still, and start many tasks. Speech is rapid and pressured, reflects rapid thinking, and may be circumstantial and tangential with</li>
</ul>
<p>734</p>
<p>features of rhyming, punning, and flight of ideas. Clients show poor judgment with little sense of safety needs and take physical, financial, occupational, or interpersonal risks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder. It is helpful for bipolar mania and can partially or completely eradicate cycling toward bipolar depression. Lithium is effective in 75% of clients but has a narrow range of safety; thus, ongoing monitoring of serum lithium levels is necessary to establish efficacy while preventing toxicity. Clients taking lithium must ingest adequate salt and water to avoid overdosing or underdosing because lithium salt uses the same postsynaptic receptor sites as sodium chloride does. Other antimanic drugs include sodium valproate, carbamazepine, other anticonvulsants, and clonazepam, which is also a benzodiazepine.</li>
<li>For clients with mania, the nurse must monitor food and fluid intake, rest and sleep, and behavior with a focus on safety until medications reduce the acute stage and clients resume responsibility for themselves.</li>
<li>Suicidal ideation means thinking of suicide.</li>
<li>People with increased rates of suicide include single adults, divorced men, adolescents, older adults, the very poor or very wealthy, urban dwellers, migrants, students, whites, people with mood disorders, substance abusers, people with medical or personality disorders, and people with psychosis.</li>
<li>The nurse must be alert to clues to a client's suicidal intent—both direct (making threats of suicide) and indirect (giving away prized possessions, putting his or her life in order, making vague goodbyes).</li>
<li>Conducting a suicide lethality assessment involves determining the degree to which the person has planned his or her death, including time, method, tools, place, person to find the body, reason, and funeral plans.</li>
<li>Nursing interventions for a client at risk for suicide involve keeping the person safe by instituting a no-suicide contract, ensuring close supervision, and removing objects that the person could use to commit suicide.</li>

<p>Unfolding Patient Stories: L.N.C. • Part 2</p>
<p>735</p>
<p>Recall from Chapter 8, L.N.C. with major depressive disorder, who was hospitalized following her third suicide attempt with an overdose. She is transitioning to a partial hospitalization program before a formal transition to home. Her husband is concerned about their two children, ages 12 and 14, and his ability to support her once she is home. What questions can the nurse ask to clarify the husband's concerns? How can L.N.C.'s depression and attempted suicide affect her husband and children? What psychosocial interventions can the nurse consider to support L.N.C. and her family once she is home?</p>

<p>Personality can be defined as an ingrained, enduring pattern of behaving and relating to the self, others, and the environment; it includes perceptions, attitudes, and emotions. These behaviors and characteristics are consistent across a broad range of situations and do not change easily. A person is usually not consciously aware of his or her personality. Many factors influence personality; some stem from biologic and genetic makeup, while others are acquired as a person develops and interacts with the environment and other people.</p>
<p>Personality disorders are diagnosed when there is impairment of personality functioning and personality traits that are maladaptive. Individuals have identity problems such as egocentrism, or being self-centered, and their sense of self-esteem comes from gaining power or pleasure that is often at the expense of others. Their behavior often fails to conform to cultural, social, or legal norms, and they are motivated by personal gratification. Relationships with others are dysfunctional and often characterized by deceit, coercion, or intimidation by the individual with a personality disorder. They are not capable of mutual, intimate relationships and lack the capacity for empathy, remorse, or concern for others (Cloninger &amp; Svrakic, 2017).</p>
<p>Maladaptive or dysfunctional personality traits (Skodol, 2018) exhibited by individuals with a personality disorder may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Negative behaviors toward others, such as being manipulative, dishonest, deceitful, or lying</li>
<li>Anger and/or hostility</li>
</ul>
<p>744</p>
<ul>
<li>Irritable, labile moods</li>
<li>Lack of guilt or remorse, emotionally cold and uncaring</li>
<li>Impulsivity, distractibility, poor judgment</li>
<li>Irresponsible, not accountable for own actions</li>
<li>Risk-taking, thrill-seeking behaviors</li>
<li>Mistrust</li>
<li>Exhibitionism</li>
<li>Entitlement</li>
<li>Dependency, insecurity</li>
<li>Eccentric perceptions</li>
</ul>
<p>Certainly, not all these traits are a problem for each person diagnosed with a personality disorder. The traits that are present or that predominate for a given person are the basis for distinguishing the disorders from each other.</p>
<p>Personality disorders are not diagnosed until adulthood, that is, at age 18, when personality is more completely formed. Nevertheless, maladaptive behavioral patterns can often be traced to early childhood or adolescence. Although there can be great variance among clients with personality disorders, many experience significant impairment in fulfilling family, academic, employment, and other functional roles.</p>
<p>Personality disorders are long-standing because personality characteristics do not change easily. Thus, clients with personality disorders continue to behave in their same familiar ways even when these behaviors cause them difficulties or distress. No specific medication alters personality, and therapy designed to help clients make changes is often long term with slow progress. Some people with personality disorders believe their problems stem from others or the world in general; they do not recognize their own behavior as the source of difficulty. For these reasons, people with personality disorders are difficult to treat, which may be frustrating for the nurse and other caregivers as well as for family and friends. Many people with personality disorders also have coexisting mental illnesses.</p>

<p>During the revision and development process for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, much discussion surrounded the personality disorder diagnoses. In the end, a proposed hybrid model for personality disorders was not adopted but remains as an alternative section at the back of the manual (Morey, Benson, &amp; Skodel, 2016). Box 18.1 summarizes the hybrid model alternative.</p>

<p>Personality disorder is a generalized pattern of behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that begins in adolescence, remains stable over time, and causes stress or psychological damage. They are characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impaired personality functioning (areas of identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy)</li>
<li>Pathological personality factors (negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism)</li>
</ul>
<p>The personality disorders included in this proposed model are antisocial, borderline, avoidant, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal.</p>
<p>Adapted from Morey, L. C., Benson, K. T., &amp; Skodel, A. E. (2016). Relating DSM-5 section III personality traits to section II personality disorder diagnoses. <em>Psychological Medicine</em>, 46(3), 647–655.</p>
<p>Personality disorder diagnoses are organized according to clusters around a predominant type of behavioral pattern. The clusters and the diagnoses in each are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster A—odd or eccentric behaviors</li>
<li>Paranoid personality disorder</li>
<li>Schizoid personality disorder</li>
<li>Schizotypal personality disorder</li>
<li>Cluster B—erratic or dramatic behaviors</li>
<li>Antisocial personality disorder</li>
<li>Borderline personality disorder</li>
<li>Histrionic personality disorder</li>
<li>Narcissistic personality disorder</li>
<li>Cluster C—anxious or fearful behaviors</li>
<li>Avoidant personality disorder</li>
<li>Dependent personality disorder</li>
<li>Obsessive personality disorder</li>
</ul>
<p>In psychiatric settings, nurses most often encounter clients with antisocial and borderline personality disorders (BPDs). Thus, these two disorders are the primary focus of this chapter. Clients with antisocial personality disorder may enter a psychiatric setting as part of a court-ordered evaluation or as an alternative to jail. Clients with BPD are often hospitalized because their emotional instability may lead to self-inflicted injuries.</p>
<p>This chapter discusses the other personality disorders briefly. Most clients</p>
<p>with these disorders are not treated in acute care settings for these personality disorders. Nurses may encounter these clients in any health care setting or in the psychiatric setting when a client is already hospitalized for another major mental illness.</p>

<p>Other clusters of behavior related to maladaptive personality traits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depressive behavior is characterized by a pervasive pattern of depressive cognitions and behaviors in various contexts. It occurs more often in people with relatives who have major depressive disorders. People with depressive personality disorders often seek treatment for their distress.</li>
<li>Passive-aggressive behavior is characterized by a negative attitude and a pervasive pattern of passive resistance to demands for adequate social and occupational performance. These clients may appear cooperative, even ingratiating, or sullen and withdrawn, depending on the circumstances. Their mood may fluctuate rapidly and erratically, and they may be easily upset or offended.</li>

<p>Personality disorders are relatively common, occurring in 10% to 20% of the general population. Incidence is even higher for people in lower socioeconomic groups and unstable or disadvantaged populations. Of all psychiatric inpatients, 15% have a primary diagnosis of a personality disorder. Of those with a primary diagnosis of major mental illness, 40% to 45% also have a coexisting personality disorder that significantly complicates treatment. In mental health outpatient settings, the incidence of personality disorder is 30% to 50% (Cloninger &amp; Svrakic, 2017). Clients with personality disorders have a higher death rate, especially as a result of suicide; they also have higher rates of suicide attempts, accidents, and emergency department visits, and increased rates of separation, divorce, and involvement in legal proceedings regarding child custody. Personality disorders have been highly correlated with criminal behavior, alcoholism, and drug abuse.</p>
<p>People with personality disorders are often described as "treatment resistant." This is not surprising, considering that personality characteristics and behavioral patterns are deeply ingrained. It is difficult to change one's personality; if such changes occur, they evolve slowly. The slow course of</p>
<p>747</p>
<p>treatment can be frustrating for family, friends, and health care providers.</p>
<p>Another barrier to treatment is that many clients with personality disorders do not perceive their dysfunctional or maladaptive behaviors as a problem; indeed, sometimes these behaviors are a source of pride. For example, a belligerent or aggressive person may perceive him or herself as having a strong personality and as being someone who can't be taken advantage of or pushed around. Clients with personality disorders frequently fail to understand the need to change their behavior and may view changes as a threat.</p>
<p>The difficulties associated with personality disorders persist throughout young and middle adulthood, but tend to diminish in the 40s and 50s. Those with antisocial personality disorder are less likely to engage in criminal behavior, though problems with substance abuse and disregard for the feelings of others persist. Clients with <strong>borderline personality disorder (BPD)</strong> tend to demonstrate decreased impulsive behavior, increased adaptive behavior, and more stable relationships by age 50. This increased stability and improved behavior can occur even without treatment. Some personality disorders, such as schizotypal avoidant and obsessive-compulsive, tend to remain consistent throughout life.</p>

<p>Personality develops through the interaction of hereditary dispositions and environmental influences. <strong>Temperament</strong> refers to the biologic processes of sensation, association, and motivation that underlie the integration of skills and habits based on emotion. Genetic differences account for about 50% of the variances in temperament traits.</p>
<p>The four temperament traits are harm avoidance, novelty seeking, reward dependence, and persistence. Each of these four genetically influenced traits affects a person's automatic responses to certain situations. These response patterns are ingrained by 2 to 3 years of age.</p>
<p>People with high harm avoidance exhibit fear of uncertainty, social inhibition, shyness with strangers, rapid fatigability, and pessimistic worry in anticipation of problems. Those with low harm avoidance are carefree, energetic, outgoing, and optimistic. High harm avoidance behaviors may result in maladaptive inhibition and excessive anxiety. Low harm avoidance behaviors may result in unwarranted optimism and unresponsiveness to potential harm or danger.</p>

<p>A high novelty-seeking temperament results in someone who is quick-tempered, curious, easily bored, impulsive, extravagant, and disorderly. He or she may be easily bored and distracted with daily life, prone to angry outbursts, and fickle in relationships. The person low in novelty seeking is slow-tempered, stoic, reflective, frugal, reserved, orderly, and tolerant of monotony; he or she may adhere to a routine of activities.</p>
<p>749</p>
<p>Reward dependence defines how a person responds to social cues. People high in reward dependence are tenderhearted, sensitive, sociable, and socially dependent. They may become overly dependent on approval from others and readily assume the ideas or wishes of others without regard for their own beliefs or desires. People with low reward dependence are practical, tough-minded, cold, socially insensitive, irresolute, and indifferent to being alone. Social withdrawal, detachment, aloofness, and disinterest in others can result.</p>
<p>Highly persistent people are hardworking and ambitious overachievers who respond to fatigue or frustration as a personal challenge. They may persevere even when a situation dictates they should change or stop. People with low persistence are inactive, indolent, unstable, and erratic. They tend to give up easily when frustrated and rarely strive for higher accomplishments.</p>
<p>These four genetically independent temperament traits occur in all possible combinations. Some of the previous descriptions of high and low levels of traits correspond closely with the descriptions of the various personality disorders. For example, people with antisocial personality disorder are low in harm avoidance traits and high in novelty-seeking traits, while people with avoidant personality disorder are high in reward dependence traits and harm avoidance traits.</p>

<p>Although temperament is largely inherited, social learning, culture, and random life events unique to each person influence character. Character consists of concepts about the self and the external world. It develops over time as a person comes into contact with people and situations and confronts challenges. Three major character traits have been distinguished: self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence. When fully developed, these character traits define a mature personality (Cloninger &amp; Svrakic, 2017).</p>
<p>Self-directedness is the extent to which a person is responsible, reliable, resourceful, goal-oriented, and self-confident. Self-directed people are realistic and effective and can adapt their behavior to achieve goals. People low in self-directedness are blaming, helpless, irresponsible, and unreliable. They cannot set and pursue meaningful goals.</p>
<p>Cooperativeness refers to the extent to which a person sees him or herself as an integral part of human society. Highly cooperative people are described as empathic, tolerant, compassionate, supportive, and principled. People with low cooperativeness are self-absorbed, intolerant, critical, unhelpful, revengeful, and opportunistic; that is, they look out for themselves without</p>
<p>750</p>
<p>regard for the rights and feelings of others.</p>
<p>Self-transcendence describes the extent to which a person considers him or herself to be an integral part of the universe. Self-transcendent people are spiritual, unpretentious, humble, and fulfilled. These traits are helpful when dealing with suffering, illness, or death. People low in self-transcendence are practical, self-conscious, materialistic, and controlling. They may have difficulty accepting suffering, loss of control, personal and material losses, and death.</p>
<p>Character matures in stepwise stages from infancy through late adulthood. Chapter 3 discusses psychological development according to Freud, Erikson, and others. Each stage has an associated developmental task that the person must perform for mature personality development. Failure to complete a developmental task jeopardizes the person's ability to achieve future developmental tasks. For example, if the task of basic trust is not achieved in infancy, mistrust results and subsequently interferes with achievement of all future tasks.</p>
<p>Experiences with family, peers, and others can significantly influence psychosocial development. Social education in the family creates an environment that can support or oppress specific character development. For example, a family environment that does not value and demonstrate cooperation with others (compassion or tolerance) fails to support the development of that trait in its children. Likewise, the person with nonsupportive or difficult peer relationships growing up may have lifelong difficulty relating to others and forming satisfactory relationships.</p>
<p>In summary, personality develops in response to inherited dispositions (temperament) and environmental influences (character), which are experiences unique to each person. Personality disorders result when the combination of temperament and character development produces maladaptive, inflexible ways of viewing self, coping with the world, and relating to others.</p>
<p>Although a personality disorder is a psychiatric diagnosis, it is important to remember that it is not an illness with treatable symptoms in the way other mental disorders are. The personality traits are ingrained ways of being and thinking. Although some change may occur slowly over time, there will be no significant improvement or quick resolution of problematic behavior.</p>
<p>CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS
751</p>
<p>Judgments about personality functioning must involve a consideration of the person's ethnic, cultural, and social background. Members of minority groups, immigrants, political refugees, and people from different ethnic backgrounds may display guarded or defensive behavior as a result of language barriers or previous negative experiences; this should not be confused with emotional coldness or lack of concern for others. People with religious or spiritual beliefs, such as clairvoyance, speaking in tongues, or evil spirits as a cause of disease, could be misinterpreted as having schizotypal personality disorder.</p>
<p>There is also a difference in how some cultural groups view avoidance or dependent behavior, particularly for women. An emphasis on deference, passivity, and politeness should not be confused with avoidant personality disorder. Cultures that value work and productivity may produce citizens with a strong emphasis in these areas; this should not be confused with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>Certain personality disorders—for example, antisocial personality disorder—are diagnosed more often in men. BPD is diagnosed more often in women. Social stereotypes about typical gender roles and behaviors can influence diagnostic decisions if clinicians are unaware of such biases.</p>

<p>Several treatment strategies are used with clients with personality disorders; these strategies are based on the disorder's type and severity or the amount of distress or functional impairment the client experiences. Combinations of medication and group and individual therapies are more likely to be effective than is any single treatment. Not all people with personality disorders seek treatment, however, even when significant others or family members urge them to do so. Typically, people with schizotypal, narcissistic, or obsessive-compulsive personality disorders are least likely to engage or remain in any treatment. They see other people, rather than their own behavior, as the cause of their problems.</p>

<p>Pharmacologic treatment of clients with personality disorders focuses on the client's symptoms rather than the particular subtype. The four symptom categories that underlie personality disorders are cognitive-perceptual distortions, including psychotic symptoms; affective symptoms and mood</p>
<p>752</p>
<p>dysregulation; aggression and behavioral dysfunction; and anxiety. These four symptom categories relate to the underlying temperaments associated with personality disorders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low reward dependence corresponds to the categories of affective dysregulation, detachment, and cognitive disturbances.</li>
<li>High novelty seeking corresponds to the target symptoms of impulsiveness and aggression.</li>
<li>High harm avoidance corresponds to the categories of anxiety and depression symptoms.</li>
<li>Cognitive-perceptual disturbances include magical thinking, odd beliefs, illusions, suspiciousness, ideas of reference, and low-grade psychotic symptoms. These chronic symptoms usually respond to low-dose antipsychotic medications (Koch et al., 2016).</li>
</ul>
<p>Several types of aggression have been described in people with personality disorders. Aggression may occur in impulsive people (some with a normal electroencephalogram and some with an abnormal one); people who exhibit predatory or cruel behavior; or people with organic-like impulsivity, poor social judgment, and emotional lability. Lithium, anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines are used most often to treat aggression. Low-dose neuroleptics may be useful in modifying predatory aggression (Black &amp; Andreasen, 2016).</p>
<p>Mood dysregulation symptoms include emotional instability, emotional detachment, depression, and dysphoria (Garofalo et al., 2018). Emotional instability and mood swings respond favorably to lithium, carbamazepine (Tegretol), valproate (Depakote), or low-dose neuroleptics such as haloperidol (Haldol). Emotional detachment, cold and aloof emotions, and disinterest in social relations often respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), and quetiapine (Seroquel). Atypical depression is often treated with SSRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressants, or low-dose antipsychotic medications.</p>
<p>Anxiety seen with personality disorders may be chronic cognitive anxiety, chronic somatic anxiety, or severe acute anxiety. Chronic cognitive anxiety responds to SSRIs and MAOIs, as does chronic somatic anxiety or anxiety manifested as multiple physical complaints. Episodes of severe acute anxiety are best treated with MAOIs or low-dose antipsychotic medications.</p>

<p>Therapy helpful to clients with personality disorders varies according to the type and severity of symptoms and the particular disorder. Inpatient hospitalization is usually indicated when safety is a concern, for example, when a person with BPD has suicidal ideas or engages in self-injury. Otherwise, hospitalization is not useful and may even result in dependence on the hospital and staff.</p>
<p>Individual and group psychotherapy goals for clients with personality disorders focus on building trust, teaching basic living skills, providing support, decreasing distressing symptoms such as anxiety, and improving interpersonal relationships (Cloninger &amp; Svrakic, 2017). Relaxation or meditation techniques can help manage anxiety for clients. Improvement in basic living skills through the relationship with a case manager or therapist can improve the functional skills of people with schizotypal personality disorder. Assertiveness training groups can assist people to have more satisfying relationships with others and to build self-esteem when that is needed.</p>

<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been particularly helpful for clients with personality disorders. Several cognitive restructuring techniques are used to change the way the client thinks about him or herself and others: thought stopping, in which the client stops negative thought patterns; positive self-talk, designed to change negative self-messages; and decatastrophizing, which teaches the client to view life events more realistically and not as catastrophes. Examples of these techniques are presented later in this chapter.</p>
<p>Dialectical behavior therapy was designed for clients with BPD by Dr. Marsha Linehan. It focuses on distorted thinking and behavior based on the assumption that poorly regulated emotions are the underlying problem (May, Richardi, &amp; Barth, 2016).

<p>Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by pervasive mistrust and suspiciousness of others. Clients with this disorder interpret others' actions as potentially harmful.

Data about prognosis are limited because most people do not readily seek or remain in treatment. Generally, they tend to have lifelong problems living and working with others (Lee, 2017).</p>
<p>Clients appear aloof and withdrawn and may remain a considerable physical distance from the nurse; they view this as necessary for their protection. Clients may also appear guarded or hypervigilant; they may survey the room and its contents, look behind furniture or doors, and generally appear alert to any impending danger. They may choose to sit near the door to have ready access to an exit, or with their backs against the wall to prevent anyone</p>
<p>from sneaking up behind them. They may have a restricted affect and may be unable to demonstrate warmth or empathic emotional responses such as “You look nice today” or “I’m sorry you’re having a bad day.” Mood may be labile, quickly changing from quietly suspicious to angry or hostile. Responses may become sarcastic for no apparent reason. The constant mistrust and suspicion that clients feel toward others and the environment distorts thoughts, thought processing, and content. Clients frequently see malevolence in the actions of others where none exists. They may spend disproportionate time examining and analyzing the behavior and motives of others to discover hidden and threatening meanings. Clients often feel attacked by others and may devise elaborate plans or fantasies for protection.</p>
<p>These clients use the defense mechanism of projection, which is blaming other people, institutions, or events for their own difficulties. It is common for such clients to blame the government for personal problems. For example, the client who gets a parking ticket says it is part of a plot by the police to drive him out of the neighborhood. He may engage in fantasies of retribution or devise elaborate and sometimes violent plans to get even. Although most clients do not carry out such plans, there is a potential danger.</p>
<p>Conflict with authority figures on the job is common; clients may even resent being given directions from a supervisor. Paranoia may extend to feelings of being singled out for menial tasks, treated as stupid, or more closely monitored than other employees.</p>

<p>Forming an effective working relationship with paranoid or suspicious clients is difficult. The nurse must remember that these clients take everything seriously and are particularly sensitive to the reactions and motivations of others. Therefore, the nurse must approach these clients in a formal, businesslike manner and refrain from social chit-chat or jokes. Being on time, keeping commitments, and being especially straightforward are essential to the success of the nurse-client relationship.</p>
<p>Because these clients need to feel in control, it is important to involve them in formulating their care plan. The nurse asks what the client would like to accomplish in concrete terms, such as minimizing problems at work or getting along with others. Clients are more likely to engage in the therapeutic process if they believe they have something to gain. One of the most effective interventions is helping clients validate ideas before taking action; however, this requires the ability to trust and listen to one person. The rationale for this</p>
<p>757</p>
<p>intervention is that clients can avoid problems if they can refrain from taking action until they have validated their ideas with another person. This helps prevent clients from acting on paranoid ideas or beliefs. It also assists them to starting to base decisions and actions on reality, rather than distorted ideas or perceptions.</p>

<p>Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression in interpersonal settings. It may affect 5% of the general population and is more common in males than females (Cloninger &amp; Svrakic, 2017). People with schizoid personality disorder avoid treatment as much as they avoid other relationships, unless their life circumstances change significantly.</p>
<p>Clients with schizoid personality disorder display a constricted affect and little, if any, emotion. They are aloof and indifferent, appearing emotionally cold, uncaring, or unfeeling. They report no leisure or pleasurable activities because they rarely experience enjoyment. Even under stress or adverse circumstances, their response appears passive and disinterested. There is marked difficulty experiencing and expressing emotions, particularly anger or aggression (Chun, Barrantes-Vidal, Sheinbaum, &amp; Kwapi, 2017). Clients do not report feeling distressed about this lack of emotion; it is more distressing to family members. Clients usually have a rich and extensive fantasy life, though they may be reluctant to reveal that information to the nurse or anyone else. The ideal relationships that occur in the client's fantasies are rewarding and gratifying; these fantasies, though, are in stark contrast to real-life experiences. The fantasy relationship often includes someone the client has met only briefly. Nevertheless, these clients can distinguish fantasies from reality, and no disordered or delusional thought processes are evident.</p>
<p>Clients generally are accomplished intellectually and often involved with computers or electronics for work or to pass their time. They may spend long hours solving puzzles or mathematical problems, though they see these pursuits as useful or productive rather than fun.</p>
<p>Clients may be indecisive and lack future goals or direction. They see no need for planning and have no aspirations. They have little opportunity to exercise judgment or decision-making because they rarely engage in these</p>
<p>758</p>
<p>activities. Insight might be described as impaired, at least by the social standards of others; these clients do not see their situation as a problem and fail to understand why their lack of emotion or social involvement troubles others. They are self-absorbed and loners in almost all aspects of daily life. Given an opportunity to engage with other people, they often decline. They are also indifferent to praise or criticism and are relatively unaffected by the emotions or opinions of others. They also experience dissociation from or no bodily or sensory pleasures. For example, the client has little reaction to beautiful scenery, a sunset, or a walk on the beach.</p>
<p>Clients have a pervasive lack of desire for involvement with others in all aspects of life. They do not have or desire friends, rarely date or marry, and have little or no sexual contact. They may have some connection with a first-degree relative, often a parent. Clients may remain in the parental home well into adulthood if they can maintain adequate separation and distance from other family members. They have few social skills, are oblivious to the social cues or overtures of others, and do not engage in social conversation.</p>

<p>Nursing interventions focus on improved functioning in the community. If a client needs housing or a change in living circumstances, the nurse can make referrals to social services or appropriate local agencies for assistance. The nurse can help agency personnel find suitable housing that accommodates the client's desire and need for solitude. For example, the client with a schizoid personality disorder would function best in a board and care facility, which provides meals and laundry service but requires little social interaction. Facilities designed to promote socialization through group activities would be less desirable.</p>
<p>If the client has an identified family member as his or her primary relationship, the nurse must ascertain whether that person can continue in that role. If the person cannot, the client may need to establish at least a working relationship with a case manager in the community. The case manager can then help the client obtain services and health care, manage finances, and so on. The client has a greater chance of success if he or she can relate his or her needs to one person (as opposed to neglecting important areas of daily life).</p>

<p>Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with and reduced capacity for close relationships as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and behavioral eccentricities. Incidence is about 3% of the population; the disorder is slightly more common in men than in women. Clients may experience transient psychotic episodes in response to extreme stress. Persons with schizotypal personality disorder may develop schizophrenia (Racioppi et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Clients often have an odd appearance that causes others to notice them. They may be unkempt and disheveled, and their clothes are often ill-fitting, do not match, and may be stained or dirty. They may wander aimlessly and, at times, become preoccupied with some environmental detail. Speech is coherent, but may be loose, digressive, or vague. Clients often provide unsatisfactory answers to questions and may be unable to specify or to describe information clearly. They frequently use words incorrectly, which makes their speech sound bizarre. For example, in response to a question about sleeping habits, the client might respond, "Sleep is slow, the REMs don't flow." These clients have a restricted range of emotions; that is, they lack the ability to experience and to express a full range of emotions such as anger, happiness, and pleasure. Affect is often flat and is sometimes silly or inappropriate.</p>
<p>Cognitive distortions include ideas of reference, magical thinking, odd or unfounded beliefs, and a preoccupation with parapsychology, including extrasensory perception and clairvoyance. Ideas of reference usually involve the client's belief that events have special meaning for him or her; however, these ideas are not firmly fixed and delusional, as may be seen in clients with schizophrenia. In magical thinking, which is normal in small children, a client believes he or she has special powers—that by thinking about something, he or she can make it happen. In addition, clients may express ideas that indicate paranoid thinking and suspiciousness, usually about the motives of other people (Cloninger &amp; Svrakic, 2017).</p>
<p>Clients experience great anxiety around other people, especially those who are unfamiliar. This does not improve with time or repeated exposures; rather, the anxiety may intensify. This results from the belief that strangers cannot be trusted. Clients do not view their anxiety as a problem that arises from a threatened sense of self. Interpersonal relationships are troublesome; therefore, clients may have only one significant relationship, usually with a first-degree relative. They may remain in their parents' home well into the</p>
<p>adult years. They have a limited capacity for close relationships, even though they may be unhappy being alone.</p>
<p>Clients cannot respond to normal social cues and hence cannot engage in superficial conversation. They may have skills that could be useful in a vocational setting, but they are not often successful in employment without support or assistance. Mistrust of others, bizarre thinking and ideas, and unkempt appearance can make it difficult for these clients to get and to keep jobs.</p>

<p>The focus of nursing care for clients with schizotypal personality disorder is development of self-care and social skills and improved functioning in the community. The nurse encourages clients to establish a daily routine for hygiene and grooming. Such a routine is important because it does not depend on the client to decide when hygiene and grooming tasks are necessary. It is useful for clients to have an appearance that is not bizarre or disheveled because stares or comments from others can increase discomfort. Because these clients are uncomfortable around others and this is not likely to change, the nurse must help them function in the community with minimal discomfort. It may help to ask clients to prepare a list of people in the community with whom they must have contact, such as a landlord, store clerk, or pharmacist. The nurse can then role-play interactions that clients would have with each of these people; this allows clients to practice making clear and logical requests to obtain services or to conduct personal business. Because face-to-face contact is more uncomfortable, clients may be able to make written requests or to use the telephone for business. Social skills training may help clients talk clearly with others and to reduce bizarre conversations. It helps to identify one person with whom clients can discuss unusual or bizarre beliefs, such as a social worker or a family member. Given an acceptable outlet for these topics, clients may be able to refrain from these conversations with people who might react negatively.</p>

<p>Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others—and by the central characteristics of deceit and manipulation. This pattern has also been referred</p>
<p>761</p>
<p>to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or dyssocial personality disorder. It occurs in about 3% of the general population, up to 30% in clinical settings, and is three to four times more common in men than in women. In prison populations, about 75% are diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. Antisocial behaviors tend to peak in the 20s and diminish significantly after 45 years of age in many individuals.</p>

<p>Onset is in childhood or adolescence, though formal diagnosis is not made until the client is 18 years old. Childhood histories of enuresis, sleepwalking, and syntonic acts of cruelty are characteristic predictors. In adolescence, clients may have engaged in lying, truancy, sexual promiscuity, cigarette smoking, substance use, and illegal activities that brought them into contact with police. Families have high rates of depression, substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder, poverty, and divorce. Erratic, neglectful, harsh, or even abusive parenting frequently marks the childhoods of these clients (Stevens, 2018).</p>

<p>Clients often display false emotions chosen to suit the occasion or to work</p>
<p>762</p>
<p>to their advantage. For example, a client who is forced to seek treatment instead of going to jail may appear engaging or try to evoke sympathy by sadly relating a story of his or her "terrible childhood." The client's actual emotions are quite shallow.</p>
<p>These clients cannot empathize with the feelings of others, which enables them to exploit others without guilt. Usually, they feel remorse only if they are caught breaking the law or exploiting someone.</p>

<p>Clients do not experience disordered thoughts, but their views of the world are narrow and distorted.

<p>These clients generally exercise poor judgment for various reasons. They pay no attention to the legality of their actions and do not consider morals or ethics when making decisions.

Such impulsivity ranges from simple failure to use normal caution (waiting for a green light to cross a busy street) to extreme thrill-seeking behaviors such as driving recklessly.</p>
<p>Clients lack insight and almost never see their actions as the cause of their problems. It is always someone else's fault; some external source is responsible for their situation or behavior.</p>

<p>Clients manipulate and exploit those around them. They view relationships as serving their needs and pursue others only for personal gain. They never think about the repercussions of their actions to others. For example, a client is caught scamming an older person out of his or her entire life savings. The client's only comment when caught is "Can you believe that's all the money I got? I was cheated! There should have been more."</p>
<p>These clients are often involved in many relationships, sometimes simultaneously. They may marry and have children, but they cannot sustain long-term commitments. They are usually unsuccessful as spouses and parents and leave others abandoned and disappointed. They may obtain employment readily with their adept use of superficial social skills, but over time, their work history is poor. Problems may result from absenteeism, theft, or embezzlement, or they may quit simply out of boredom.</p>

<p>People with antisocial personality disorder generally do not seek treatment voluntarily unless they perceive some personal gain from doing so. For example, a client may choose a treatment setting as an alternative to jail or to gain sympathy from an employer; they may cite stress as a reason for absenteeism or poor performance. Inpatient treatment settings are not necessarily effective for these clients and may in fact bring out their worst qualities.</p>

<li>Identifying the expected or desired behavior</li>
</ol>
<p>Consistent limit setting in a matter-of-fact nonjudgmental manner is crucial to success. For example, a client may approach the nurse flirtatiously and attempt to gain personal information. The nurse would use limit setting by saying,</p>
<p>&gt; “It is not acceptable for you to ask personal questions. If you continue, I will terminate our interaction. We need to use this time to work on solving your job-related problems.”</p>
<p>The nurse should not become angry or respond to the client harshly or punitively.</p>
<p><strong>Confrontation</strong> is another technique designed to manage manipulative or deceptive behavior. The nurse points out a client’s problematic behavior while remaining neutral and matter-of-fact; he or she avoids accusing the client. The nurse can also use confrontation to keep clients focused on the topic and in the present. The nurse can focus on the behavior itself rather than on attempts by clients to justify it. For example:</p>
<p>&gt; “Nurse: ‘You’ve said you’re interested in learning to manage angry</p>
<p>765</p>
<p>outbursts, but you’ve missed the last three group meetings.”</p>
<p>Client: “Well, I can tell no one in the group likes me. Why should I bother?”</p>
<p>Nurse: “The group meetings are designed to help you and the others, but you can’t work on issues if you’re not there.”</p>

<p>Clients with antisocial personality disorder have an established pattern of reacting impulsively when confronted with problems. The nurse can teach problem-solving skills and help clients practice them. Problem-solving skills include identifying the problem, exploring alternative solutions and related consequences, choosing and implementing an alternative, and evaluating the results. Although these clients have the cognitive ability to solve problems, they need to learn a step-by-step approach to deal with them. For example, a client’s car isn’t running, so he or she stops going to work. The problem is transportation to work; alternative solutions might be taking the bus, asking a coworker for a ride, and getting the car fixed. The nurse can help the client discuss the various options and choose one so that he or she can go back to work.</p>
<p>Managing emotions, especially anger and frustration, can be a major problem. When clients are calm and not upset, the nurse can encourage them to identify sources of frustration, how they respond to it, and the consequences. In this way, the nurse assists clients in anticipating stressful situations and to learn ways to avoid negative future consequences. Taking a time-out or leaving the area and going to a neutral place to regain internal control is often a helpful strategy. Time-outs help clients to avoid impulsive reactions and angry outbursts in emotionally charged situations, regain control of emotions, and engage in constructive problem-solving.</p>

<p>Steve found himself in the local jail again after being arrested for burglary. He had told the police it wasn't breaking and entering; he had his friend's permission to use his parents' home, but they'd just forgotten to leave the key. Steve has a long juvenile record of truancy, fighting, and marijuana use, which he blames on "having the wrong friends." This is his third arrest, and Steve claims the police are picking on him ever since an elderly lady in the community gave him $5,000 when he was out of work. He intends to pay her back when his ship comes in. Steve's wife of 3 years left him recently, claiming he couldn't hold a decent job and was running up bills they couldn't pay. Steve was tired of her nagging and was ready for a new relationship anyway. He wishes he could win the lottery and find a beautiful girl to love him. He's tired of people demanding that he grow up, get a job, and settle down. They just don't understand that he's got more exciting things to do.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Nursing Interventions</th><th>Rationale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Encourage the client to identify the actions that precipitated hospitalization (e.g., debts, marital problems, law violation).</td><td>These clients frequently deny responsibility for the consequences of their own actions.</td></tr><tr><td>Give positive feedback for honesty. The client may try to avoid responsibility by acting as though he or she is “sick” or helpless.</td><td>Honest identification of the consequences of the client’s behavior is necessary for future behavior change.</td></tr><tr><td>Identify unacceptable behaviors, either general (stealing others’ possessions) or specific (embarrassing another by telling lewd jokes).</td><td>You must supply clear, concrete limits when the client is unable or unwilling to do so.</td></tr><tr><td>Develop specific consequences for unacceptable behaviors (e.g., the client may not watch television).</td><td>Unpleasant consequences may help decrease or eliminate unacceptable behaviors. The consequences must be related to something the client enjoys, to be effective.</td></tr><tr><td>Avoid any discussion about why requirements exist. State the requirement in a matter-of-fact manner. Avoid arguing with the client.</td><td>The client may attempt to bend the rules “just this once” with numerous excuses and justifications. Your refusal to be manipulated or charmed will help decrease manipulative behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>Inform the client of unacceptable behaviors and the resulting consequences before they occur.</td><td>The client must be aware of expectations and consequences.</td></tr><tr><td>Communicate and document in the client’s care plan all behaviors and consequences in specific terms.</td><td>The client may attempt to gain favor with individual staff members or play one staff member against another (“Last night, the nurse told me I could do that”). If all team members follow the written plan, the client will not be able to manipulate changes.</td></tr><tr><td>Avoid discussing another staff member’s actions or statements unless the other staff member is present.</td><td>The client may try to manipulate staff members or focus attention on others to decrease attention to him or herself.</td></tr><tr><td>Be consistent and firm with the care plan. Do not</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<table><thead><tr><th>make independent changes in rules or consequences. Any change should be made by the staff as a group and conveyed to all staff members working with this client. (You may designate a primary staff person to be responsible for minor decisions and refer all questions to this person.)*</th><th>Consistency is essential. If the client can find just one person to make independent changes, any plan will become ineffective.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Avoid trying to coax or convince the client to do the “right thing.”</td><td>The client must decide to accept responsibility for his or her behavior and its consequences.</td></tr><tr><td>When the client exceeds a limit, provide consequences immediately after the behavior in a matter-of-fact manner.</td><td>Consequences are most effective when they closely follow the unacceptable behavior. Do not react to the client in an angry or punitive manner. If you show anger toward the client, he or she may take advantage of it. It is better to get out of the situation if possible and let someone else handle it.</td></tr><tr><td>Point out the client’s responsibility for his or her behavior in a nonjudgmental manner.</td><td>The client needs to learn the connection between behavior and the consequences, but blame and judgment are not appropriate.</td></tr><tr><td>Provide immediate positive feedback or reward for acceptable behavior.</td><td>Immediate positive feedback will help increase acceptable behavior. The client must receive attention for positive behaviors, not just unacceptable ones.</td></tr><tr><td>Gradually, require longer periods of acceptable behavior and greater rewards, and inform the client of changes as decisions are made. For example, at first the client must demonstrate acceptable behavior for 2 hours to earn 1 hour of television time. Gradually, the client could progress to 5 days of acceptable behavior and earn a 2-day weekend pass.</td><td>This gradual progression will help develop the client’s ability to delay gratification. This is necessary if the client is to function effectively in society.</td></tr><tr><td>Encourage the client to identify sources of frustration, how he or she dealt with it previously, and any unpleasant consequences that resulted.</td><td>This may facilitate the client’s ability to accept responsibility for his or her own behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>Explore alternative, socially and legally acceptable methods of dealing with identified frustrations.</td><td>The client has the opportunity to learn to make alternative choices.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><thead><tr><th>Help the client try alternatives as situations arise. Give positive feedback when the client uses alternatives successfully.</th><th>The client can role-play alternatives in a nonthreatening environment.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Discuss job seeking, work attendance, court appearances, and so forth when working with the client in anticipation of discharge.*</td><td>Dealing with consequences and working are responsible behaviors. The client may have had little or no successful experience in these areas and may benefit from assistance.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>The nurse helps clients to identify specific problems at work or home that are barriers to success in fulfilling roles. Assessing use of alcohol and other drugs is essential when examining role performance because many clients use or abuse these substances. These clients tend to blame others for their failures and difficulties, and the nurse must redirect them to examine the source of their problems realistically. Referrals to vocational or job programs may be indicated.</p>

<p>BPD is characterized by a pervasive pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect as well as marked impulsivity. About 2% to 3% of the general population has BPD; it is five times more common in those with a first-degree relative with the diagnosis. BPD is the most common personality disorder found in clinical settings. It is three times more common in women than in men. Under stress, transient psychotic symptoms are common. Between 8% and 10% of people with this diagnosis commit suicide, and many more suffer permanent damage from self-mutilation injuries, such as cutting or burning. Up to three-quarters of clients with BPD engage in deliberate self-harm, sometimes called <strong>nonsuicidal self-injury</strong> (Merza, Papp, Molnar, &amp; Szabo, 2017). Typically, recurrent self-mutilation is a cry for help, an expression of intense anger or helplessness, or a form of self-punishment. The resulting physical pain is also a means to block emotional pain. Clients who engage in self-mutilation do so to reinforce that they are still alive; they seek to experience physical pain in the face of emotional numbing.</p>
<p>Working with clients who have BPD can be frustrating. They may cling and ask for help 1 minute and then become angry, act out, and reject all offers of help in the next minute. They may attempt to manipulate staff to gain immediate gratification of needs and, at times, sabotage their own treatment plans by purposely failing to do what they have agreed. Their labile mood, unpredictability, and diverse behaviors can make it seem as if the staff is always “back to square one” with them.</p>

<p>Many of these clients report disturbed early relationships with their parents that often begin at 18 to 30 months of age. Commonly, early attempts by these clients to achieve developmental independence were met with punitive responses from parents or threats of withdrawal of parental support and approval. Of these clients, 50% have experienced childhood sexual abuse; others have experienced physical and verbal abuse and parental alcoholism. Clients tend to use transitional objects (e.g., teddy bears, pillows, blankets, and dolls) extensively; this may continue into adulthood. Transitional objects are often similar to favorite items from childhood that the client used for comfort or security (Kiefer et al., 2017).</p>

<p>Clients experience a wide range of dysfunction from severe to mild. Initial behavior and presentation may vary widely depending on a client's present status. When dysfunction is severe, clients may appear disheveled and may be unable to sit still, or they may display labile emotions. In other cases, initial appearance and motor behavior may seem normal. The client seen in the emergency department threatening suicide or self-harm may seem out of control, while a client seen in an outpatient clinic may appear fairly calm and rational.</p>

<p>The pervasive mood is dysphoric, involving unhappiness, restlessness, and malaise. Clients often report intense loneliness, boredom, frustration, and feeling "empty." They rarely experience periods of satisfaction or well-being. Although there is a pervasive depressed affect, it is unstable and erratic. Clients may become irritable, even hostile or sarcastic, and complain of episodes of panic anxiety. They experience intense emotions such as anger and rage but rarely express them productively or usefully. They are usually hypersensitive to others' emotions, which can easily trigger reactions. Minor changes may precipitate a severe emotional crisis, for example, when an appointment must be changed from one day to the next. Commonly, these clients experience major emotional trauma when their therapists take vacations.</p>

<p>Thinking about oneself and others is often polarized and extreme, which is sometimes referred to as splitting. Clients tend to adore and idealize other people even after a brief acquaintance but then quickly devalue them if these others do not meet their expectations in some way. Clients have excessive and chronic fears of abandonment even in normal situations; this reflects their intolerance of being alone. They may also engage in obsessive rumination about almost anything, regardless of the issue's relative importance.</p>
<p>Clients may experience dissociative episodes (periods of wakefulness when they are unaware of their actions). Self-harm behaviors often occur during these dissociative episodes, though, at other times, clients may be fully aware of injuring themselves. As stated earlier, under extreme stress,</p>

<p>Intellectual capacities are intact, and clients are fully oriented to reality. The exception is transient psychotic symptoms; during such episodes, reports of auditory hallucinations encouraging or demanding self-harm are most common. These symptoms usually abate when the stress is relieved. Many clients also report flashbacks of previous abuse or trauma. These experiences are consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder, which is common in clients with BPD (see Chapter 13).</p>

<p>Clients frequently report behaviors consistent with impaired judgment and lack of care and concern for safety, such as gambling, shoplifting, and reckless driving. They make decisions impulsively on the basis of emotions rather than facts.</p>
<p>Clients have difficulty accepting responsibility for meeting needs outside a relationship. They see life's problems and failures as a result of others' shortcomings. Because others are always to blame, insight is limited. A typical reaction to a problem is "I wouldn't have gotten into this mess if so-and-so had been there."</p>

<p>Clients have an unstable view of themselves that shifts dramatically and suddenly. They may appear needy and dependent one moment and angry, hostile, and rejecting the next.

<p>Suicidal threats, gestures, and attempts are common. Self-harm and mutilation, such as cutting, punching, or burning, are common. These behaviors must be taken seriously because these clients are at increased risk for completed suicide, even if numerous previous attempts have not been life-threatening. These self-inflicted injuries cause much pain and often require extensive treatment; some result in massive scarring or permanent disability such as paralysis or loss of mobility from injury to nerves, tendons, and other essential structures.</p>

<p>People with borderline personality disorder (BPD) have an extreme fear of abandonment and a history of unstable, insecure attachments. These individuals, who already are intensely emotional and have a poor sense of self, feel estranged from others and inadequate in meeting perceived social standards. The pervasive mood is dysphoric, involving unhappiness, restlessness, and malaise. Clients often report intense loneliness and feeling “empty,” which causes them to rarely experience periods of satisfaction or well-being that would lead to exaggerated self-image. Clients tend to have an unstable view of themselves that shifts dramatically and suddenly, often from needy and dependent one moment to angry, hostile, and rejecting the next.</p>

<p>Clients hate being alone, but their erratic, labile, and sometimes dangerous behaviors often isolate them. Relationships are unstable, stormy, and intense; the cycle repeats itself continually. These clients have extreme fears of abandonment and difficulty believing a relationship still exists once the person is away from them. They engage in many desperate behaviors, even suicide attempts, to gain or maintain relationships. Feelings for others are often distorted, erratic, and inappropriate. For example, they may view someone they have met only once or twice as their best and only friend or the “love of my life.” If another person does not immediately reciprocate their feelings, they may feel rejected, become hostile, and declare him or her to be their enemy. These erratic emotional changes can occur in the space of an hour. Often, these situations precipitate self-mutilating behavior; occasionally, clients may attempt to harm others physically.</p>
<p>Clients usually have a history of poor school and work performance because of constantly changing career goals and shifts in identity or aspirations, preoccupation with maintaining relationships, and fear of real or perceived abandonment. Clients lack the concentration and self-discipline to follow through on sometimes mundane tasks associated with work or school.</p>

<p>Sally had been calling her therapist all day, ever since their session this morning. But the therapist hadn't called her back, even though all her messages said this was an emergency. She was sure her therapist was angry at her and was probably going to drop her as a client. Then she'd have no one; she'd be abandoned by the only person in the world she could talk to. Sally was upset and crying as she began to run the razor blade across her arm. As the blood trickled out, she began to calm down. Then her therapist called and asked what the problem was. Sally was sobbing as she told her therapist that she was cutting her arm because the therapist didn't care anymore, that she was abandoning Sally just like everyone else in her life—her parents, her best friend, every man she had a relationship with. No one was ever there for her when she needed them.</p>

<p>Clients with BPD are often involved in long-term psychotherapy to address issues of family dysfunction and abuse. The nurse is most likely to have contact with these clients during crises, when they are exhibiting self-harm behaviors or transient psychotic symptoms. Brief hospitalizations are often used to manage these difficulties and to stabilize the client's condition.</p>

<p>Clients' physical safety is always a priority. The nurse must always seriously consider suicidal ideation with the presence of a plan, access to means for enacting the plan, and self-harm behaviors and institute appropriate interventions (see Chapter 17). Clients often experience chronic suicidality or ongoing intermittent ideas of suicide over months or years. The challenge for the nurse, in concert with clients, is to determine when suicidal ideas are likely to be translated into action.</p>
<p>Clients may enact self-harm urges by cutting, burning, or punching themselves, which sometimes causes permanent physical damage. Self-injury can occur when a client is enraged or experiencing dissociative episodes or psychotic symptoms, or it may occur for no readily apparent reason. Helping clients avoid self-injury can be difficult when antecedent conditions vary greatly. Sometimes, clients may discuss self-harm urges</p>
<p>with the nurse if they feel comfortable doing so. The nurse must remain nonjudgmental when discussing this topic.</p>
<p>It has been common practice in many settings to encourage clients to enter into a no-self-harm contract, in which the client promises not to engage in self-harm and to report to the nurse when he or she is losing control. The no-self-harm contract is not a promise to the nurse but the client's promise to him or herself to be safe. Although not legally binding, such a contract is thought to be beneficial to the client's treatment by promoting self-responsibility and encouraging dialogue between client and nurse. However, there is no evidence to support the effectiveness of these contracts, and in fact, some believe they may give staff a false sense of security. When clients are relatively calm and thinking clearly, it is helpful for the nurse to explore self-harm behavior. The nurse avoids sensational aspects of the injury; the focus is on identifying mood and affect, level of agitation and distress, and circumstances surrounding the incident. In this way, clients can begin to identify trigger situations, moods, or emotions that precede self-harm and to use more effective coping skills to deal with the trigger issues.</p>
<p>If clients do injure themselves, the nurse assesses the injury and need for treatment in a calm, matter-of-fact manner. Lecturing or chastising clients is punitive and has no positive effect on self-harm behaviors. Deflecting attention from the actual physical act is usually desirable.</p>

<p>Regardless of the clinical setting, the nurse must provide structure and limit setting in the therapeutic relationship. In a clinical setting, this may mean seeing the client for scheduled appointments of a predetermined length rather than whenever the client appears and demands the nurse's immediate attention. In the hospital setting, the nurse would plan to spend a specific amount of time with the client working on issues or coping strategies rather than giving the client exclusive access when he or she has had an outburst. Limit setting and confrontation techniques, described earlier, are also helpful.</p>

<p>Clients have difficulty maintaining satisfying interpersonal relationships. Personal boundaries are unclear, and clients often have unrealistic expectations. Erratic patterns of thinking and behaving often alienate them from others. This may be true for both professional and personal relationships. Clients can easily misinterpret the nurse's genuine interest and caring as a personal friendship, and the nurse may feel flattered by a client's compliments. The nurse must be quite clear about establishing the boundaries of the therapeutic relationship to ensure that neither the client's nor the nurse's boundaries are violated. For example:</p>
<p>&gt; <strong>Client:</strong> “You’re better than my family and the doctors. You understand me more than anyone else.”
&gt;
&gt; <strong>Nurse:</strong> “I’m interested in helping you get better just as the other staff members are.” (establishing boundaries)</p>

<p>It is important to teach basic communication skills such as eye contact, active listening, taking turns talking, validating the meaning of another's</p>
<p>783</p>
<p>communication, and using “I” statements (“I think...,” “I feel...,” “I need...”). The nurse can model these techniques and engage in role-playing with clients.

<p>Clients often react to situations with extreme emotional responses without actually recognizing their feelings. The nurse can help clients identify their feelings and learn to tolerate them without exaggerated responses such as destruction of property or self-harm. Keeping a journal often helps clients gain awareness of feelings. The nurse can review journal entries as a basis for discussion.</p>
<p>Another aspect of emotional regulation is decreasing impulsivity and learning to delay gratification. When clients have an immediate desire or request, they must learn that it is unreasonable to expect it to be granted without delay. Clients can use distraction such as taking a walk or listening to music to deal with the delay, or they can think about ways to meet needs themselves. Clients can write in their journals about their feelings when gratification is delayed.</p>

<p>These clients view everything, people and situations, in extremes—totally good or totally bad. Cognitive restructuring is a technique useful in changing patterns of thinking by helping clients recognize negative thoughts and feelings and replacing them with positive patterns of thinking. Thought stopping is a technique to alter the process of negative or self-critical thought patterns, such as “I’m dumb, I’m stupid, I can’t do anything right.” When the thoughts begin, the client may actually say “Stop!” in a loud voice to stop the negative thoughts. Later, more subtle means such as forming a visual image of a stop sign will be a cue to interrupt the negative thoughts. The client then learns to replace recurrent negative thoughts of worthlessness with more positive thinking. In positive self-talk, the client reframes negative thoughts into positive ones: “I made a mistake, but it’s not the end of the world. Next time, I’ll know what to do.”</p>
<p>Decatastrophizing is a technique that involves learning to assess situations realistically rather than always assuming a catastrophe will happen. The nurse asks, “So what is the worst thing that could happen?”</p>
<p>784</p>
<p>or "How likely do you think that is?" or "How do you suppose other people might deal with that?" or "Can you think of any exceptions to that?" In this way, the client must consider other points of view and actually think about the situation; in time, his or her thinking may become less rigid and inflexible.</p>

<p>Feelings of chronic boredom and emptiness, fear of abandonment, and intolerance of being alone are common problems. Clients are often at a loss about how to manage unstructured time, become unhappy and ruminative, and may engage in frantic and desperate behaviors (e.g., self-harm) to change the situation. Minimizing unstructured time by planning activities can help clients manage time alone. Clients can make a written schedule that includes appointments, shopping, reading the paper, and going for a walk. They are more likely to follow the plan if it is in written form. This can also help clients plan ahead to spend time with others instead of frantically calling others when in distress. The written schedule also allows the nurse to help clients engage in more healthful behaviors, such as exercising, planning meals, and cooking nutritious food.</p>

<p>As with any personality disorder, changes may be small and slow. The degree of functional impairment of clients with BPD may vary widely. Clients with severe impairment may be evaluated in terms of their ability to be safe and refrain from self-injury. Other clients may be employed and have fairly stable interpersonal relationships. Generally, when clients experience fewer crises less frequently over time, treatment is effective.</p>

<p><strong>Histrionic personality disorder</strong> is characterized by a pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking. It is found in 1% to 3% of the general population but in as much as 10% to 15% of inpatient populations. Clients often seek assistance for depression, unexplained physical problems, and difficulties with relationships. However, clients do not see how their own behavior has an impact on their current difficulties. This disorder is diagnosed more frequently in females than in males (Cloninger &amp; Svrakic, 2017).</p>
<p>The tendency of these clients to exaggerate the closeness of relationships or to dramatize relatively minor occurrences can result in unreliable data. Speech is usually colorful and theatrical, full of superlative adjectives. It becomes apparent, however, that though colorful and entertaining, descriptions are vague and lack detail. Overall appearance is normal, although clients may overdress (e.g., wear an evening dress and high heels for a clinical interview). Clients are overly concerned with impressing others with their appearance and spend inordinate time, energy, and money to this end. Dress and flirtatious behavior are not limited to social situations or relationships, but also occur in occupational and professional settings. The nurse may think these clients are charming or even seductive.</p>
<p>Clients are emotionally expressive, gregarious, and effusive. They often exaggerate emotions inappropriately. For example, a client says, "He is the most wonderful doctor! He is so fantastic! He has changed my life!" to describe a physician she has seen once or twice. In such a case, the client cannot specify why she views the doctor so highly. Expressed emotions, though colorful, are insincere and shallow; this is readily apparent to others, but not to clients. They experience rapid shifts in moods and emotions and may be laughing uproariously one moment and sobbing the next. Thus, their displays of emotion may seem phony or forced to observers. Clients are self-absorbed and focus most of their thinking on themselves with little or no</p>
<p>786</p>
<p>thought about the needs of others. They are highly suggestible and will agree with almost anyone to get attention. They express strong opinions firmly, but because they base them on little evidence or facts, the opinions often shift under the influence of someone they are trying to impress.</p>
<p>Clients are uncomfortable when they are not the center of attention and go to great lengths to gain that status. They use their physical appearance and dress to gain attention. At times, they may fish for compliments in unsubtle ways, fabricate unbelievable stories, or create public scenes to attract attention. They may even faint, become ill, or fall to the floor. They brighten considerably when given attention after some of these behaviors; this leaves others feeling they have been used. Any comment or statement that could be interpreted as uncomplimentary or unflattering may produce a strong response such as a temper tantrum or crying outburst.</p>
<p>Clients tend to exaggerate the intimacy of relationships. They refer to almost all acquaintances as "dear, dear friends." They may embarrass family members or friends by flamboyant and inappropriate public behavior such as hugging and kissing someone who has just been introduced or sobbing uncontrollably over a minor incident. Clients may ignore old friends if someone new and interesting has been introduced. People with whom these clients have relationships often describe being used, manipulated, or exploited shamelessly.</p>
<p>Clients may have a wide variety of vague physical complaints or relate exaggerated versions of physical illness. These episodes usually involve the attention the client received (or failed to receive) rather than any particular physiological concern.</p>

<p>The nurse gives clients feedback about their social interactions with others, including manner of dress and nonverbal behavior. Feedback should focus on appropriate alternatives, not merely criticism. For example, the nurse might say,</p>
<p>&gt; "When you embrace and kiss other people on first meeting them, they may interpret your behavior in a sexual manner. It would be more acceptable to stand at least 2 ft away from them and to shake hands."</p>
<p>It may also help to discuss social situations to explore clients' perceptions of others' reactions and behavior. Teaching social skills and role-playing</p>
<p>787</p>
<p>those skills in a safe, nonthreatening environment can help clients gain confidence in their ability to interact socially. The nurse must be specific in describing and modeling social skills, including establishing eye contact, engaging in active listening, and respecting personal space. It also helps to outline topics of discussion appropriate for casual acquaintances, closer friends or family, and the nurse only.</p>
<p>Clients may be quite sensitive to discussing self-esteem and may respond with exaggerated emotions. It is important to explore personal strengths and assets and to give specific feedback about positive characteristics. Encouraging clients to use assertive communication, such as "I" statements, may promote self-esteem and help them get their needs met more appropriately. The nurse must convey genuine confidence in the client's abilities.</p>

<p>Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy. It occurs in 1% to 6% of the general population. Of people with this diagnosis, 50% to 75% are men. Narcissistic traits are common in adolescence and do not necessarily indicate that a personality disorder will develop in adulthood. Individual psychotherapy is the most effective treatment, and hospitalization is rare unless comorbid conditions exist for which the client requires inpatient treatment.</p>

<p>Clients may display an arrogant or haughty attitude. They lack the ability to recognize or empathize with the feelings of others. They may express envy and begrudge others any recognition or material success because they believe it rightfully should be theirs. Clients tend to disparage, belittle, or discount the feelings of others. They may express their grandiosity overtly, or they may quietly expect to be recognized for their perceived greatness. They are often preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love. These fantasies reinforce their sense of superiority. Clients may ruminate about long-overdue admiration and privilege and compare themselves favorably with famous or privileged people (Miller, Lynam, Hyatt, &amp; Campbell, 2017).</p>
<p>Thought processing is intact, but insight is limited or poor. Clients believe themselves to be superior and special and are unlikely to consider that their behavior has any relation to their problems; they view their problems as the</p>
<p>fault of others.</p>
<p>Underlying self-esteem is almost always fragile and vulnerable. These clients are hypersensitive to criticism and need constant attention and admiration. They often display a sense of entitlement (unrealistic expectation of special treatment or automatic compliance with wishes). They may believe that only special or privileged people can appreciate their unique qualities or are worthy of their friendship. They expect special treatment from others and are often puzzled or even angry when they do not receive it. They often form and exploit relationships to elevate their own status. Clients assume total concern from others about their welfare. They discuss their own concerns in lengthy detail with no regard for the needs and feelings of others and often become impatient or contemptuous of those who discuss their own needs and concerns.</p>
<p>At work, these clients may experience some success because they are ambitious and confident. Difficulties are common, however, because they have trouble working with others (whom they consider to be inferior) and have limited ability to accept criticism or feedback. They are also likely to believe they are underpaid and underappreciated or should have a higher position of authority even though they are not qualified.</p>

<p>Clients with narcissistic personality disorder can present one of the greatest challenges to the nurse. The nurse must use self-awareness skills to avoid the anger and frustration that these clients' behavior and attitude can engender. Clients may be rude and arrogant, unwilling to wait, and harsh and critical of the nurse. The nurse must not internalize such criticism or take it personally. The goal is to gain the cooperation of these clients with other treatment as indicated. The nurse teaches about comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions, medication regimen, and any needed self-care skills in a matter-of-fact manner. He or she sets limits on rude or verbally abusive behavior and explains his or her expectations of the client.</p>

<p>Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social discomfort and reticence, low self-esteem, and hypersensitivity to</p>
<p>790</p>
<p>negative evaluation. It occurs in 2% to 3% of the general population. It is equally common in men and women. Clients are good candidates for individual psychotherapy (Cloninger &amp; Svrakic, 2017).</p>
<p>These clients are likely to report being overly inhibited as children and that they often avoid unfamiliar situations and people with an intensity beyond that expected for their developmental stage. This inhibition, which may have continued throughout upbringing, contributes to low self-esteem and social alienation. Clients are apt to be anxious and may fidget in chairs and make poor eye contact with the nurse. They may be reluctant to ask questions or to make requests. They may appear sad as well as anxious. They describe being shy, fearful, socially awkward, and easily devastated by real or perceived criticism. Their usual response to these feelings is to become more reticent and withdrawn.</p>
<p>Clients with avoidant personality disorder have low self-esteem. They are hypersensitive to negative evaluation from others and readily believe themselves to be inferior. Clients are reluctant to do anything perceived as risky, which for them is almost anything. They are fearful and convinced they will make a mistake, be humiliated, or embarrass themselves and others. Because they are unusually fearful of rejection, criticism, shame, or disapproval, they tend to avoid situations or relationships that may result in these feelings. They usually strongly desire social acceptance and human companionship; they wish for closeness and intimacy but fear possible rejection and humiliation. These fears hinder socialization, which makes clients seem awkward and socially inept and reinforces their beliefs about themselves. They may need excessive reassurance of guaranteed acceptance before they are willing to risk forming a relationship.</p>
<p>Clients may report some success in occupational roles because they are so eager to please or to win a supervisor's approval. Shyness, awkwardness, or fear of failure, however, may prevent them from seeking jobs that might be more suitable, challenging, or rewarding. For example, a client may reject a promotion and continue to remain in an entry-level position for years, even though he or she is well qualified to advance.</p>

<p>These clients require much support and reassurance from the nurse. In the nonthreatening context of the relationship, the nurse can help them explore positive self-aspects, positive responses from others, and possible reasons for self-criticism. Helping clients practice self-affirmations and positive self-talk</p>
<p>791</p>
<p>may be useful in promoting self-esteem. Other cognitive restructuring techniques such as reframing and decatastrophizing (described previously) can enhance self-worth. The nurse can teach social skills and help clients practice them in the safety of the nurse-client relationship. Although these clients have many social fears, those are often counterbalanced by their desire for meaningful social contact and relationships. The nurse must be careful and patient with clients and not expect them to implement social skills too rapidly.</p>

<p>Dependent personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of, which leads to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation. These behaviors are designed to elicit caretaking from others. This disorder occurs in about 1% of the population and is three times more common in females than males. It runs in families and is more common in the youngest child. People with dependent personality disorder may seek treatment for anxious, depressed, or somatic symptoms (Cloninger &amp; Svrakic, 2017).</p>
<p>Clients are frequently anxious and may be mildly uncomfortable. They are often pessimistic and self-critical; other people hurt their feelings easily. They commonly report feeling unhappy or depressed; this is associated most likely with the actual or threatened loss of support from another. They are excessively preoccupied with unrealistic fears of being left alone to care for themselves. They believe they would fail on their own, so keeping or finding a relationship occupies much of their time. They have tremendous difficulty making decisions, no matter how minor. They seek advice and repeated reassurances about all types of decisions, from what to wear to what type of job to pursue. Although they can make judgments and decisions, they lack the confidence to do so.</p>
<p>Clients perceive themselves as unable to function outside a relationship with someone who can tell them what to do. They are uncomfortable and feel helpless when alone, even if the current relationship is intact. They have difficulty initiating projects or completing simple daily tasks independently. They believe they need someone else to assume responsibility for them, a belief that far exceeds what is age or situation appropriate. They may even fear gaining competence because doing so would mean an eventual loss of support from the person on whom they depend. They may do almost anything</p>
<p>792</p>
<p>to sustain a relationship, even one of poor quality. This includes doing unpleasant tasks, going places they dislike, or, in extreme cases, tolerating abuse. Clients are reluctant to express disagreement for fear of losing the other person's support or approval; they may even consent to activities that are wrong or illegal to avoid that loss.</p>
<p>When these clients do experience the end of a relationship, they urgently and desperately seek another. The unspoken motto seems to be “Any relationship is better than no relationship at all.”</p>

<p>The nurse must help clients express feelings of grief and loss over the end of a relationship while fostering autonomy and self-reliance. Helping clients identify their strengths and needs is more helpful than encouraging the overwhelming belief that “I can’t do anything alone!” Cognitive restructuring techniques such as reframing and decatastrophizing may be beneficial.</p>
<p>Clients may need assistance in daily functioning if they have little or no past success in this area. Included are such things as planning menus, doing the weekly shopping, budgeting money, balancing a checkbook, and paying bills. Careful assessment to determine areas of need is essential. Depending on the client’s abilities and limitations, referral to agencies for services or assistance may be indicated.</p>
<p>The nurse may also need to teach problem-solving and decision-making and help clients apply them to daily life. He or she must refrain from giving advice about problems or making decisions for clients, even though clients may ask the nurse to do so. The nurse can help the client explore problems, serve as a sounding board for discussion of alternatives, and provide support and positive feedback for the client’s efforts in these areas.</p>

<p>Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with perfectionism, mental and interpersonal control, and orderliness at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. It is one of the most prevalent personality disorders, occurring in about 2% to 8% of the population, affecting twice as many men as women. Incidence is higher in</p>
<p>793</p>
<p>oldest children and people in professions involving facts, figures, or methodical focus on detail. These people often seek treatment because they recognize that their life is pleasureless or they are experiencing problems with work or relationships. Clients frequently benefit from individual therapy.</p>
<p>The demeanor of these clients is formal and serious, and they answer questions with precision and much detail. They often report feeling the need to be perfect beginning in childhood. They were expected to be good and do the right thing to win parental approval. Expressing emotions or asserting independence was probably met with harsh disapproval and emotional consequences. Emotional range is usually quite constricted. They have difficulty expressing emotions, and any emotions they do express are rigid, stiff, and formal, lacking spontaneity. Clients can be stubborn and reluctant to relinquish control, which makes it difficult for them to be vulnerable to others by expressing feelings. Affect is also restricted; they usually appear anxious and fretful or stiff and reluctant to reveal underlying emotions.</p>
<p>Clients are preoccupied with orderliness and try to maintain it in all areas of life. They strive for perfection as though it were attainable and are preoccupied with details, rules, lists, and schedules to the point of often missing "the big picture." They become absorbed in their own perspective, believe they are right, and do not listen carefully to others because they have already dismissed what is being said. Clients check and recheck the details of any project or activity; often, they never complete the project because of "trying to get it right." They have problems with judgment and decision-making—specifically, actually reaching a decision. They consider and reconsider alternatives, and the desire for perfection prevents a decision from being reached. Clients interpret rules or guidelines literally and cannot be flexible or modify decisions based on circumstances. They prefer written rules for each and every activity at work. Insight is limited, and they are often oblivious that their behavior annoys or frustrates others. If confronted with this annoyance, these clients are stunned, unable to believe others "don't want me to do a good job."</p>
<p>These clients have low self-esteem and are always harsh, critical, and judgmental of themselves; they believe that they "could have done better" regardless of how well the job has been done. Praise and reassurance do not change this belief. Clients are burdened by extremely high and unattainable standards and expectations. Although no one could live up to these expectations, they feel guilty and worthless for being unable to achieve them. They tend to evaluate self and others solely on the basis of deeds or actions without regard for personal qualities.</p>
<p>794</p>
<p>These clients have much difficulty in relationships, few friends, and little social life. They do not express warm or tender feelings to others; attempts to do so are stiff and formal and may sound insincere. For example, if a significant other expresses love and affection, a client's response might be "The feeling is mutual."</p>
<p>Marital and parent-child relationships are often difficult because these clients can be harsh and unrelenting. For example, most clients are frugal, do not give gifts or want to discard old items, and insist that those around them do the same. Shopping for something new to wear may seem frivolous and wasteful. Clients cannot tolerate lack of control and hence may organize family outings to the point that no one enjoys them. These behaviors can cause daily strife and discord in family life.</p>
<p>At work, clients may experience some success, particularly in fields where precision and attention to detail are desirable. They may miss deadlines, however, while trying to achieve perfection or may fail to make needed decisions while searching for more data. They fail to make timely decisions because of continually striving for perfection. They have difficulty working collaboratively, preferring to do it themselves so that it is done "correctly." If clients do accept help from others, they may give such detailed instructions and watch the other person so closely that coworkers are insulted, annoyed, and refuse to work with them. Given this excessive need for routine and control, new situations and compromise are also difficult.</p>

<p>Nurses may be able to help clients view decision-making and completion of projects from a different perspective. Rather than striving for the goal of perfection, clients can set a goal of completing the project or making the decision by a specified deadline. Helping clients accept or tolerate less-than-perfect work or decisions made on time may alleviate some difficulties at work or home. Clients may benefit from cognitive restructuring techniques. The nurse can ask, "What is the worst that could happen?" or "How might your boss (or your wife) see this situation?" These questions may challenge some rigid and inflexible thinking.</p>
<p>Encouraging clients to take risks, such as letting someone else plan a family activity, may improve relationships. Practicing negotiation with family or friends may also help clients relinquish some of their need for control.</p>
<p>795</p>
<p>ELDER CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>Personality disorders are not first diagnosed in elder people but may persist from young adulthood into older age. Some individuals with personality disorders tend to stabilize and experience fewer difficulties in later life. Others are described as "aging badly"; that is, they are unable or unwilling to acknowledge limitations that come with aging, refuse to accept help when needed, and do not make reasonable decisions about their health care, finances, or living situation. These individuals seem chronically angry, unhappy, or dissatisfied, resulting in strained relationships and even alienation from family, friends, caregivers, and health care providers, resulting in social isolation. The most common personality disorders reported in later life are paranoid, avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive (Agronin, 2017). Older adults with personality disorders are at increased risk for depression, suicide, and dementia.</p>

<p>Caring for clients with personality disorders occurs primarily in community-based settings. Acute psychiatric settings such as hospitals are useful for safety concerns for short periods. The nurse uses skills to deal with clients who have personality disorders in clinics, outpatient settings, doctors' offices, and many medical settings. Often, the personality disorder is not the focus of attention; rather, the client may be seeking treatment for a physical condition.</p>
<p>Most people with personality disorders are treated in group or individual therapy settings, community support programs, or self-help groups. Others will not seek treatment for their personality disorder, but may be treated for a major mental illness. Wherever the nurse encounters clients with personality disorders, including in his or her own life, the interventions discussed in this chapter can prove useful.</p>

<p>The treatment of individuals with a personality disorder often focuses on mood stabilization, decreasing impulsivity, and developing social and relationship skills. In addition, clients perceive unmet needs in a variety of areas, such as self-care (keeping clean and tidy), sexual expression (dissatisfaction with sex life), budgeting (managing daily finances), psychotic symptoms, and psychological distress. Typically, psychotic symptoms and</p>
<p>psychological distress are often the only areas addressed by health care providers. Perhaps dealing with those other areas in the treatment of a client might result in a greater sense of well-being and improved health.</p>
<p>Children who have a greater number of “protective factors” are less likely to develop antisocial behavior as adults. These protective factors include school commitment or importance of school, positive peer relationships, parent or peer disapproval of antisocial behavior, functional family relationship, and effective parenting skills. Interestingly, the study found that children at risk for abuse and those not at risk were less likely to have antisocial behavior as adults if these protective factors were present in their environment. Children lacking these protective factors are much more likely to develop antisocial behavior as adults.</p>

<p>Since schizotypal personality disorder can later lead to schizophrenia in some clients, effective early identification and treatment of this personality disorder is important. Researchers report that second-generation antipsychotics (mainly risperidone) are most often used to treat schizotypal personality disorder. However, evidence of efficacy is based on small samples insufficient to make evidence-based treatment recommendations.</p>
<p>The next step would be clinical trials in sufficient number and scope to determine whether second-generation antipsychotics can in fact decrease conversion of schizotypal personality disorder to schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Because clients with personality disorders take a long time to change their</p>
<p>797</p>
<p>behaviors, attitudes, or coping skills, nurses working with them can easily become frustrated or angry. These clients continually test the limits of the nurse-client relationship with attempts at manipulation. Nurses must discuss feelings of anger or frustration with colleagues to help them recognize and cope with their own feelings.</p>
<p>The overall appearance of clients with personality disorders can be misleading. Unlike clients who are psychotic or severely depressed, clients with personality disorders look as though they are capable of functioning more effectively. The nurse can easily but mistakenly believe the client simply lacks motivation or the willingness to make changes and may feel frustrated or angry. It is easy for the nurse to think, "Why does the client continue to do that? Can't he see it only causes difficulties?" This reaction is similar to reactions the client has probably received from others.</p>
<p>Clients with personality disorders also challenge the ability of therapeutic staff to work as a team. For example, clients with antisocial or borderline personalities often manipulate staff members by splitting them—that is, causing staff members to disagree with or contradict one another in terms of the limits of the treatment plan. This can be quite disruptive. In addition, team members may have differing opinions about individual clients. One staff member may believe that a client needs assistance, while another may believe the client is overly dependent. Ongoing communication is necessary to remain firm and consistent about expectations for clients.</p>

<li>Personality disorders are relatively common and diagnosed in early adulthood, though some behaviors are evident in childhood or adolescence.</li>
<li>Rapid or substantial changes in personality are unlikely. This can be a primary source of frustration for family members, friends, and health care professionals.</li>
<li>Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by social and interpersonal deficits, cognitive and perceptual distortions, and eccentric behavior.</li>
<li>People with antisocial personality disorder often appear glib and charming, but they are suspicious, insensitive, and uncaring and often exploit others for their own gain.</li>
<li>People with BPD have markedly unstable mood, affect, self-image, interpersonal relationships, and impulsivity; they often engage in self-harm behavior.</li>
<li>People with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder are preoccupied with orderliness, perfection, and interpersonal control at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency.</li>
<li>Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by grandiosity, need for admiration, lack of empathy for others, and a sense of entitlement.</li>

<p>The therapeutic relationship is crucial in caring for clients with personality disorders. Nurses can help clients identify their feelings and dysfunctional behaviors and develop appropriate coping skills and positive behaviors. Therapeutic communication and role modeling help promote appropriate social interactions, which help improve interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>Several therapeutic strategies are effective when working with clients with personality disorders. Cognitive restructuring techniques such as thought stopping, positive self-talk, and decatastrophizing are useful; self-help skills aid the client in functioning better in the community.</p>
<p>Psychotropic medications are prescribed for clients with personality disorders based on the type and severity of symptoms the client experiences in aggression and impulsivity, mood dysregulation, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms.</p>
<p>Clients with BPD often have self-harm urges that they enact by cutting, burning, or punching themselves; this behavior sometimes causes permanent physical damage. The nurse can encourage the client to enter into a no-self-harm contract in which the client promises to try to keep from harming him or herself and to report to the nurse when he or she is having self-harm urges.</p>
<p>Nurses must use self-awareness skills to minimize client manipulation and deal with feelings of frustration.</p>

<p>Susan Marks, 25 years old, is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. She has been attending college sporadically but has only 15 completed credits and no real career goal. She is angry because her parents have told her she must get a job to support herself. Last week, she met a man in the park and fell in love with him on the first date. She has been calling him repeatedly, but he will not return her calls. Declaring that her parents have deserted her and her boyfriend doesn't love her anymore, she slashes her forearms with a sharp knife. She then calls 911, stating, "I'm about to die! Please help me!" She is taken by ambulance to the emergency department and is admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit.</p>

<p>Substance use disorders and related disorders are a national health problem. More than 16.6 million adult Americans and 697,000 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years have an alcohol use disorder. Of adults (age 18 years or older), 14% report binge drinking in the past month. Other statistics include the following: nearly 88,000 people die from alcohol-related causes each year; alcohol-related death is the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States; and 30% of driving fatalities are alcohol related (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA], 2015). The actual precise prevalence of substance abuse is difficult to determine because many people who meet the criteria for diagnosis do not seek treatment, and surveys conducted to estimate prevalence are based on self-reported data that may be inaccurate.</p>
<p>Worldwide, 3 million deaths result from the harmful use of alcohol annually. Alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury conditions. Absenteeism at work is higher for employees who have alcohol-related problems, and they use more health benefits as well (World Health Organization, 2019).</p>
<p>The number of infants suffering the physiological and emotional consequences of prenatal exposure to alcohol or drugs (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome, neonatal abstinence syndrome, "crack babies") is increasing at alarming rates. Chemical abuse also results in increased violence, including domestic abuse, homicide, and child abuse and neglect. These rising statistics regarding substance abuse do not bode well for future generations.</p>
<p>807</p>
<p>Approximately 8.7 million children aged 17 years or younger (one in eight) live with a parent who has a substance use disorder in any given year (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2017). Children of alcoholics are four times more likely than the general population to develop problems with alcohol. Many adult people in treatment programs report having had their first drink of alcohol as a young child, when they were younger than 10 years of age. This first drink was often a taste of the drink of a parent or family member. With the increasing rates of use being reported among young people today, this problem could spiral out of control unless great strides can be made through programs for prevention, early detection, and effective treatment.</p>
<p>The increased use of opioids in the United States has prompted the identification of an "opioid crisis." An estimated 130 deaths occur daily in the United States from an opioid overdose. This problem crosses lines of gender, race, and age. The Department of Health and Human Services initiated a five-point program to address this crisis in 2019. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access: Better prevention, treatment, and recovery services</li>
<li>Data: Better data on the epidemic</li>
<li>Pain: Better pain management</li>
<li>Overdoses: Better targeting of overdose-reversing drugs</li>
<li>Research: Better research on pain and addiction</li>
</ul>
<p>However, some believe this is too narrow in scope to address all the issues. While the current crisis may have been triggered by careless overprescription of opioid analgesics, the increases in heroin and illicit synthetic opioid use have also created problems. The need for increased use of medications to treat opioid use disorders and treatment of these disorders and comorbidities such as depression and suicidality is also necessary to resolve the crisis and prevent it from happening again (Gallagher, 2018; Volkow, Jones, Einstein, &amp; Wargo, 2018).</p>

<p>Many substances can be used and abused; some can be obtained legally, while others are illegal. This discussion includes alcohol and prescription medications as substances that can be abused. Abuse of more than one substance is termed polysubstance abuse.</p>

</ol>
<p>This chapter describes the specific symptoms of intoxication, overdose, withdrawal, and detoxification for each abovementioned substance category. The so-called designer drugs, or club drugs, have become a problem in recent years. They are synthetic substances made by altering existing</p>
<p>809</p>
<p>medications or formulating new substances not yet controlled or regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As attempts to make such drugs illegal are formulated, makers of the drugs alter the substance slightly so it once again falls outside the law. Most of these drugs are amphetamine-like stimulants, and some also have hallucinogenic properties. They may also contain unknown compounds as a filler or additive, and the effects are unknown until the drug is ingested. Some of these substances are known by generic terms such as bath salts or plant food, though the substances are never used for those purposes. Others have specific names, such as ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), special K (Ketamine), or smiles (2C-1).</p>
<p>Intoxication is use of a substance that results in maladaptive behavior. Withdrawal syndrome refers to the negative psychological and physical reactions that occur when use of a substance ceases or dramatically decreases. Detoxification is the process of safely withdrawing from a substance. The treatment of other substance-induced disorders such as psychosis and mood disorders is discussed in depth in separate chapters.</p>
<p>Substance abuse can be defined as using a drug in a way that is inconsistent with medical or social norms and despite negative consequences. Substance abuse denotes problems in social, vocational, or legal areas of the person's life, while substance dependence also includes problems associated with addiction such as tolerance, withdrawal, and unsuccessful attempts to stop using the substance. This distinction between abuse and dependence is frequently viewed as unclear and unnecessary because the distinction does not affect clinical decisions once withdrawal or detoxification has been completed. Hence, the terms substance abuse and substance dependence or chemical dependence can be used interchangeably. In this chapter, the term substance use is used to include both abuse and dependence; it is not meant to refer to occasional or one-time use.</p>

<p>Much research on substance use has focused on alcohol because it is legal and more widely used; thus, more is known about alcohol's effects. The prognosis for alcohol use in general is unclear because only people seeking treatment for problems with alcohol are usually studied.</p>
<p>In the United States, the average age for an initial alcohol intoxication episode is during adolescent years (Schuckit, 2017). However, the early course of alcoholism typically begins much earlier, with the first episode of intoxication between the ages of 12 and 14 years; the first evidence of minor</p>
<p>810</p>
<p>alcohol-related problems is seen in the late teens. Episodes of "sipping" alcohol may occur as early as 8 years (Sartor et al., 2016). A pattern of more severe difficulties for people with alcoholism begins to emerge in the mid-20s to the mid-30s; these difficulties can be the alcohol-related breakup of a significant relationship, an arrest for public intoxication or driving while intoxicated, evidence of alcohol withdrawal, early alcohol-related health problems, or significant interference with functioning at work or school. During this time, the person experiences his or her first blackout, which is an episode during which the person continues to function but has no conscious awareness of his or her behavior at the time or any later memory of the behavior.</p>
<p>As the person continues to drink, he or she often develops a tolerance for alcohol; that is, he or she needs more alcohol to produce the same effect. After continued heavy drinking, the person experiences a tolerance break, which means that very small amounts of alcohol intoxicate the person.</p>
<p>The later course of alcoholism, when the person's functioning is definitely affected, is often characterized by periods of abstinence or temporarily controlled drinking. Abstinence may occur after some legal, social, or interpersonal crisis, and the person may then set up rules about drinking, such as drinking only at certain times or drinking only beer. This period of temporarily controlled drinking soon leads to an escalation of alcohol intake, more problems, and a subsequent crisis. The cycle repeats continuously.</p>
<p>For many people, substance use is a chronic illness characterized by remissions and relapses to former levels of use. Relapse rates range from 60% to 90%, with nearly half of individuals relapsing in the year after treatment (Thompson et al., 2018). A minority of people remain sober after the first treatment experience. The highest rates for successful recovery are for people who abstain from substances, are highly motivated to have a substance-free lifestyle, and who actively work on relapse prevention.</p>
<p>Reports exist that some people with alcohol-related problems can modify or quit drinking on their own without a treatment program; this is called spontaneous remission or natural recovery. Although there is a dearth of recent scientific literature, anecdotal reports state that the abstinence was often in response to a crisis or a promise to a loved one and was accomplished by engaging in alternative activities, relying on relationships with family and friends, and avoiding alcohol, alcohol users, and social cues associated with drinking.</p>
<p>Poor outcomes have been associated with an earlier age at onset, longer periods of substance use, and the coexistence of a major psychiatric illness.</p>
<p>811</p>
<p>With extended use, the risk for mental and physical deterioration and infectious disease such as HIV and AIDS, hepatitis, and tuberculosis increases, especially for those with a history of intravenous (IV) drug use. An increased number of alcohol-dependent people commit suicide.</p>

<p>Gambling disorder is a non-substance-related diagnosis. It is characterized by problem gambling, spending money one cannot afford to lose, lying about gambling, getting money from others, and an inability to refrain from gambling for any specific time. Attempts to quit or cut down result in restless, anxious, and irritable behavior.</p>
<p>Caffeine and tobacco or nicotine are substances that are addictive and are included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, but are not considered mental health problems per se. There has also been discussion of possible addiction to the internet, noting that some people spend more than half of their waking hours on the computer and become upset and irritable if use is limited or curtailed. Further study will determine whether or not this will be treated as a new type of addiction.</p>
<p>Substances can induce symptoms that are similar to other mental illness diagnoses, such as anxiety, psychosis, or mood disorders. They are called substance-induced anxiety, substance-induced psychosis, and so forth. The symptoms may subside once the substance is eliminated from the body, though this is not always the case. For example, methamphetamine can cause substance-induced psychosis, but the psychotic symptoms may persist due to damage to the brain. The nursing care for the client is the same as caring for any client with delusions and hallucinations, as discussed in other chapters. In addition, Chapter 24 discusses delirium, which may be seen in severe alcohol withdrawal. A clinical care plan for a client receiving treatment for substance abuse is featured near the end of this chapter. The effects on adults who grew up in a home with an alcoholic parent are discussed later, as are the special needs of clients with a dual diagnosis of substance use and a major psychiatric disorder.</p>

<p>The exact causes of drug use, dependence, and addiction are not known, but various factors are thought to contribute to the development of substance-related disorders (Schuckit, 2017). Much of the research on biologic and</p>
<p>812</p>
<p>genetic factors has been done on alcohol abuse, but psychological, social, and environmental studies have examined other drugs as well.</p>

<p>Children of alcoholic parents are at higher risk for developing alcoholism and drug dependence than are children of nonalcoholic parents. This increased risk is partly the result of environmental factors, but evidence points to the importance of genetic factors as well (Haverfield &amp; Theiss, 2016). Several studies of twins have shown a higher rate of concordance (when one twin has it, the other twin gets it) among identical than fraternal twins. Adoption studies have shown higher rates of alcoholism in sons of biologic fathers with alcoholism than in those of nonalcoholic biologic fathers. These studies led theorists to describe the genetic component of alcoholism as a genetic vulnerability that is then influenced by various social and environmental factors. About 60% of the variation in causes of alcoholism was the result of genetics, with the remainder caused by environmental influences (Schuckit, 2017).</p>
<p>Neurochemical influences on substance use patterns have been studied primarily in animal research. The ingestion of mood-altering substances stimulates dopamine pathways in the limbic system, which produces pleasant feelings or a "high" that is a reinforcing, or positive, experience (Cooper, Robison, &amp; Mazei-Robison, 2017). Distribution of the substance throughout the brain alters the balance of neurotransmitters that modulate pleasure, pain, and reward responses. Researchers have proposed that some people have an internal alarm that limits the amount of alcohol consumed to one or two drinks so that they feel a pleasant sensation but go no further. People without this internal signaling mechanism experience the high initially but continue to drink until the central nervous system depression is marked and they are intoxicated.</p>

<p>In addition to the genetic links to alcoholism, family dynamics are thought to play a part. Children of alcoholics are four times as likely to develop alcoholism compared with the general population. Some theorists believe that inconsistency in the parent's behavior, poor role modeling, and lack of nurturing pave the way for the child to adopt a similar style of maladaptive</p>
<p>813</p>
<p>coping, stormy relationships, and substance abuse. Others hypothesize that even children who abhorred their family lives are likely to abuse substances as adults because they lack adaptive coping skills and cannot form successful relationships (Haverfield &amp; Theiss, 2016).</p>
<p>Some people use alcohol as a coping mechanism or to relieve stress and tension, increase feelings of power, and decrease psychological pain. High doses of alcohol, however, actually increase muscle tension and nervousness.</p>

<p>Cultural factors, social attitudes, peer behaviors, laws, cost, and availability all influence initial and continued use of substances. In general, younger experimenters use substances that carry less social disapproval such as alcohol and cannabis, while older people use drugs such as cocaine and opioids that are costlier and rate higher disapproval. Alcohol consumption increases in areas where availability increases and decreases in areas where costs of alcohol are higher because of increased taxation. Many people view the social use of cannabis, though still illegal in most states, as not harmful; many advocate legalizing the use of marijuana for social purposes. Currently in the United States, there is a federal law that still classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, but some individual states have or are in the process of legalizing medical use or recreational use or both. Urban areas where cocaine and opioids are readily available also have high crime rates, high unemployment, and substandard school systems that contribute to high rates of cocaine and opioid use, and low rates of recovery. Thus, environment and social customs can influence a person's use of substances.</p>

<p>Attitudes toward substance use, patterns of use, and physiological differences to substances vary in different cultures. Muslims do not drink alcohol, but wine is an integral part of Jewish religious rites. Some Native American tribes use peyote, a hallucinogen, in religious ceremonies. It is important to be aware of such beliefs when assessing for a substance abuse problem.</p>
<p>Certain ethnic groups have genetic traits that either predispose them to or protect them from developing alcoholism. For instance, flushing, a reddening of the face and neck as a result of increased blood flow, has been linked to variants of genes for enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism. Even small</p>
<p>814</p>
<p>amounts of alcohol can produce flushing, which may be accompanied by headaches and nausea. The flushing reaction is highest among people of Asian ancestry (Aoki, Wehage, &amp; Talalay, 2017).</p>
<p>Statistics for individual tribes vary, but alcohol abuse overall plays a part in the five leading causes of death for Native Americans and Alaska Natives (motor vehicle crashes, alcoholism, cirrhosis, suicide, and homicide). Among tribes with high rates of alcoholism, an estimated 75% of all accidents are alcohol related. One-eighth of Native Americans are identified as needing treatment for alcohol or drugs—most commonly methamphetamine and marijuana. Alaska Natives are seven times more likely than the general population to die of alcohol-related problems (Schuckit, 2017).</p>
<p>In Japan, alcohol consumption has quadrupled since 1960. The Japanese do not regard alcohol as a drug, and there are no religious prohibitions against drinking. Excessive alcohol consumption is widely condoned at parties, business functions, and at home, and few Japanese people go for alcohol treatment. In Russia, high rates of alcohol abuse, suicide, cigarette smoking, accidents, violence, and cardiovascular disease are found in the male population. Life expectancy for Russian males is 60.5 years, while it is 74 years for females. This is a trend mirrored across the entire former Soviet Union (Schuckit, 2017).</p>

<p>The classes of mood-altering substances have some similarities and differences in terms of intended effect, intoxication effects, and withdrawal symptoms. Treatment approaches after detoxification, however, are quite similar. This section presents a brief overview of seven classes of substances and the effects of intoxication, overdose, withdrawal, and detoxification, and it highlights important elements of which the nurse should be aware.</p>

<p>Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant that is absorbed rapidly into the bloodstream. Initially, the effects are relaxation and loss of inhibitions. With intoxication, there is slurred speech, unsteady gait, lack of coordination, and impaired attention, concentration, memory, and judgment. Some people become aggressive or display inappropriate sexual behavior when intoxicated.</p>
<p>815</p>
<p>The person who is intoxicated may experience a blackout.</p>
<p>An overdose, or excessive alcohol intake in a short period, can result in vomiting, unconsciousness, and respiratory depression. This combination can cause aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary obstruction. Alcohol-induced hypotension can lead to cardiovascular shock and death. Treatment of an alcohol overdose is similar to that for any central nervous system depressant—gastric lavage or dialysis to remove the drug, and support of respiratory and cardiovascular functioning in an intensive care unit. The administration of central nervous system stimulants is contraindicated (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018). The physiological effects of repeated intoxication and long-term use are listed in Box 19.1.</p>

<p>Withdrawal and Detoxification</p>
<p>Symptoms of withdrawal usually begin 4 to 12 hours after cessation or marked reduction of alcohol intake. Symptoms include coarse hand tremors, sweating, elevated pulse and blood pressure, insomnia, anxiety, and nausea or vomiting. Severe or untreated withdrawal may progress to transient hallucinations, seizures, or delirium, called delirium tremens. Alcohol withdrawal usually peaks on the second day and is over in about 5 days. This can vary, however; and withdrawal may take 1 to 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Because alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening, detoxification needs to be accomplished under medical supervision. If the client's withdrawal symptoms are mild and he or she can abstain from alcohol, he or she can be treated safely at home. For more severe withdrawal or for clients who cannot</p>
<p>816</p>
<p>abstain during detoxification, a short admission of 3 to 5 days is the most common setting. Some psychiatric units also admit clients for detoxification, but this is less common.</p>
<p>Safe withdrawal is usually accomplished with the administration of benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam (Ativan), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), or diazepam (Valium), to suppress the withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal can be accomplished by fixed-schedule dosing known as tapering, or symptom-triggered dosing in which the presence and severity of withdrawal symptoms determine the amount of medication needed and the frequency of administration. Often, the protocol used is based on an assessment tool such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised, shown in Box 19.2. Total scores less than 8 indicate mild withdrawal, scores from 8 to 15 indicate moderate withdrawal (marked arousal), and scores greater than 15 indicate severe withdrawal. Clients on symptom-triggered dosing receive medication based on scores of this scale alone, while clients on fixed-dose tapers can also receive additional doses depending on the level of scores from this scale. Both methods of medicating clients are safe and effective.</p>

<p>This class of drugs includes all central nervous system depressants: barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, and anxiolytics, particularly benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates are the most frequently abused drugs in this category. The intensity of the effect depends on the particular drug. The effects of the drugs, symptoms of intoxication, and withdrawal symptoms are similar to those of alcohol. In the usual prescribed doses, these drugs cause drowsiness and reduce anxiety, which is the intended purpose. Intoxication symptoms include slurred speech, lack of coordination, unsteady gait, labile mood, impaired attention or memory, and even stupor and coma.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines alone, when taken orally in overdose, are rarely fatal, but the person is lethargic and confused. Treatment includes gastric lavage followed by ingestion of activated charcoal and a saline cathartic; dialysis can be used if symptoms are severe (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018). The client's confusion and lethargy improve as the drug is excreted.</p>

<p>John, 62 years old, was admitted at 5 this morning for an elective knee replacement surgery. The surgical procedure, including the anesthetic, went smoothly. John was stabilized in the recovery room in about 3 hours. His blood pressure was 124/82, temperature 98.8°F, pulse 76, and respirations 16. John was alert, oriented, and verbally responsive, so he was transferred to a room on the orthopedic unit.</p>

<p>Barbiturates, in contrast, can be lethal when taken in overdose. They can cause coma, respiratory arrest, cardiac failure, and death. Treatment in an intensive care unit is required using lavage or dialysis to remove the drug from the system and to support respiratory and cardiovascular function.</p>

<p>The onset of withdrawal symptoms depends on the half-life of the drug (see Chapter 2). Medications such as lorazepam, with actions that typically last about 10 hours, produce withdrawal symptoms in 6 to 8 hours; longer acting medications, such as diazepam, may not produce withdrawal symptoms for 1 week. The withdrawal syndrome is characterized by symptoms that are the opposite of the acute effects of the drug—autonomic hyperactivity (increased pulse, blood pressure, respirations, and temperature), hand tremor, insomnia, anxiety, nausea, and psychomotor agitation. Seizures and hallucinations occur only rarely in severe benzodiazepine withdrawal (Tamburin et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Detoxification from sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics is often medically managed by tapering the amount of the drug the client receives over a period of days or weeks, depending on the drug and the amount the client had been using. Tapering, or administering decreasing doses of a medication, is essential with barbiturates to prevent coma and death that occur if the drug is stopped abruptly. For example, when tapering the dosage of a benzodiazepine, the client may be given Valium, 10 mg four times a day; the dose is decreased every 3 days, and the number of times a day the dose is given is also decreased until the client safely withdraws from the drug.</p>

<p>Stimulants are drugs that stimulate or excite the central nervous system and have limited clinical use (with the exception of stimulants used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; see Chapter 22) and a high potential</p>
<p>821</p>
<p>for abuse. Amphetamines (uppers) were popular in the past; they were used by people who wanted to lose weight quickly or stay awake. Cocaine, an illegal drug with virtually no clinical use in medicine, is highly addictive and a popular recreational drug because of the intense and immediate feeling of euphoria it produces.</p>
<p>Methamphetamine is particularly dangerous. It is highly addictive and causes psychotic behavior. Brain damage related to its use is frequent, primarily as a result of the substances used to make it—that is, liquid agricultural fertilizer. The percentage of people admitted to inpatient settings for methamphetamine abuse had increased in 49 of the 50 states in the United States from 2000 to 2005. Use of methamphetamine, however, seems to have peaked and actually declined in the past few years (Iannucci &amp; Weiss, 2017). It may well increase again in the future, reflecting the pattern of use of many substances.</p>

<p>Intoxication from stimulants develops rapidly; effects include the high or euphoric feeling, hyperactivity, hypervigilance, talkativeness, anxiety, grandiosity, hallucinations, stereotypic or repetitive behavior, anger, fighting, and impaired judgment. Physiological effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, dilated pupils, perspiration or chills, nausea, chest pain, confusion, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Overdoses of stimulants can result in seizures and coma; deaths are rare (Iannucci &amp; Weiss, 2017). Treatment with chlorpromazine (Thorazine), an antipsychotic, controls hallucinations, lowers blood pressure, and relieves nausea (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018).</p>

Marked dysphoria is the primary symptom and is accompanied by fatigue, vivid and unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite, and psychomotor retardation or agitation. Marked withdrawal symptoms are referred to as "crashing"; the person may experience depressive symptoms, including suicidal ideation, for several days. Stimulant withdrawal is not treated pharmacologically.</p>

<p>Cannabis sativa is the hemp plant that is widely cultivated for its fiber used to make rope and cloth and for oil from its seeds. It has become widely known for its psychoactive resin. This resin contains more than 60 substances, called cannabinoids, of which δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is thought to be responsible for most of the psychoactive effects. Marijuana refers to the upper leaves, flowering tops, and stems of the plant; hashish is the dried resinous exudate from the leaves of the female plant (Hall &amp; Degenhardt, 2017). Cannabis is often smoked in cigarettes (joints), and it can also be eaten.</p>
<p>The legal status of cannabis has changed in the United States. While federal law still considers most cannabis use illegal, some individual states have changed their laws. States may have legalized medical marijuana use, recreational use, both, or neither. This will continue to change in future years but is a state-by-state approach at this point in time. Research has shown that cannabis has short-term effects of lowering intraocular pressure, but it is not approved for the treatment of glaucoma. It has also been studied for its effectiveness in relieving the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy and the anorexia and weight loss of AIDS. Currently, two cannabinoids, dronabinol (Marinol) and nabilone (Cesamet), have been approved for treating nausea and vomiting from cancer chemotherapy. Cannabis-related drugs have shown promise in the control of seizures in people who do not experience seizure control from other medications (Thomas &amp; Cunningham, 2018).</p>

<p>Cannabis begins to act less than 1 minute after inhalation. Peak effects usually occur in 20 to 30 minutes and last at least 2 to 3 hours. Users report a high feeling similar to that with alcohol, lowered inhibitions, relaxation, euphoria, and increased appetite. Symptoms of intoxication include impaired motor coordination, inappropriate laughter, impaired judgment and short-term memory, and distortions of time and perception. Anxiety, dysphoria, and social withdrawal may occur in some users. Physiological effects, in addition to increased appetite, include conjunctival injection (bloodshot eyes), dry mouth, hypotension, and tachycardia. Excessive use of cannabis may produce delirium or rarely, cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, both of which are treated symptomatically. Overdoses of cannabis do not occur.</p>

<p>Opioids are popular drugs of abuse because they desensitize the user to both physiological and psychological pain and induce a sense of euphoria and well-being. Opioid compounds include both potent prescription analgesics such as morphine, meperidine (Demerol), codeine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, methadone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, and propoxyphene as well as illegal substances such as heroin, illicitly produced fentanyl, and normethadone. Fentanyl (Duragesic, Actiq) is a synthetic opioid used in clinical settings for anesthesia. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Illicitly produced fentanyl use has skyrocketed in the past decade and is thought to be responsible for the dramatic increase in deaths from opioid overdose. People who abuse opioids spend a great deal of their time obtaining the drugs; they often engage in illegal activity to get money to purchase them. Health care professionals who abuse opioids often write prescriptions for themselves or divert prescribed pain medication for clients to themselves.</p>

<p>Opioid intoxication develops soon after the initial euphoric feeling; symptoms include apathy, lethargy, listlessness, impaired judgment, psychomotor retardation or agitation, constricted pupils, drowsiness, slurred speech, and impaired attention and memory. Severe intoxication or opioid overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, pupillary constriction, unconsciousness, and death. Administration of naloxone (Narcan), an opioid antagonist, is the treatment of choice because it reverses all signs of opioid toxicity. Naloxone is given every few hours until the opioid level drops to nontoxic; this process may take days (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018). Opioid overdoses have increased dramatically in the United States; many first responders now carry naloxone in autoinjector form (Evzio).</p>

<p>Opioid withdrawal develops when drug intake ceases or decreases markedly, or it can be precipitated by the administration of an opioid antagonist. Initial symptoms are anxiety, restlessness, aching back and legs, and cravings for more opioids. Symptoms that develop as withdrawal progresses include nausea, vomiting, dysphoria, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, sweating, diarrhea,</p>
<p>824</p>
<p>yawning, fever, and insomnia. Symptoms of opioid withdrawal cause significant distress, but do not require pharmacologic intervention to support life or bodily functions. Short-acting drugs such as heroin produce withdrawal symptoms in 6 to 24 hours; the symptoms peak in 2 to 3 days and gradually subside in 5 to 7 days. Longer acting substances such as methadone may not produce significant withdrawal symptoms for 2 to 4 days, and the symptoms may take 2 weeks to subside. Methadone can be used as a replacement for opioids, and the dosage is then decreased over 2 weeks. Substitution of methadone during detoxification reduces symptoms to no worse than a mild case of flu (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018). Withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, dysphoria, anhedonia, and drug craving may persist for weeks or months.</p>

<p>Hallucinogens are substances that distort the user's perception of reality and produce symptoms similar to psychosis, including hallucinations (usually visual) and depersonalization. Hallucinogens also cause increased pulse, blood pressure, and temperature; dilated pupils; and hyperreflexia. Examples of hallucinogens are mescaline, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, and "designer drugs" such as ecstasy. Phencyclidine (PCP), developed as an anesthetic, is included in this section because it acts similarly to hallucinogens.</p>

<p>Hallucinogen intoxication is marked by several maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes: anxiety, depression, paranoid ideation, ideas of reference, fear of losing one's mind, and potentially dangerous behaviors such as jumping out a window in the belief that one can fly. Physiological symptoms include sweating, tachycardia, palpitations, blurred vision, tremors, and lack of coordination. PCP intoxication often involves belligerence, aggression, impulsivity, and unpredictable behavior (Bertron, Seto, &amp; Lindsley, 2018).</p>
<p>Toxic reactions to hallucinogens (except PCP) are primarily psychological; overdoses as such do not occur. These drugs are not a direct cause of death, though fatalities have occurred from related accidents, aggression, and suicide. Treatment of toxic reactions is supportive. Psychotic reactions are managed best by isolation from external stimuli; physical restraints may be necessary for the safety of the client and others. PCP toxicity can include</p>
<p>826</p>
<p>seizures, hypertension, hyperthermia, and respiratory depression. Medications are used to control seizures and blood pressure. Cooling devices such as hyperthermia blankets are used, and mechanical ventilation is used to support respirations (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018).</p>

<p>Inhalants are a diverse group of drugs that include anesthetics, nitrates, and organic solvents that are inhaled for their effects. The most common substances in this category are aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons found in gasoline, glue, paint thinner, and spray paint. Less frequently used halogenated hydrocarbons include cleaners, correction fluid, spray can propellants, and other compounds containing esters, ketones, and glycols. Most of the vapors are inhaled from a rag soaked with the compound, from a paper or plastic bag, or directly from the container. Inhalants can cause significant brain damage, peripheral nervous system damage, and liver disease.</p>

<p>Inhalant intoxication involves dizziness, nystagmus, lack of coordination, slurred speech, unsteady gait, tremor, muscle weakness, and blurred vision. Stupor and coma can occur. Significant behavioral symptoms are belligerence, aggression, apathy, impaired judgment, and inability to function. Acute toxicity causes anoxia, respiratory depression, vagal stimulation, and dysrhythmias. Death may occur from bronchospasm, cardiac arrest, suffocation, or aspiration of the compound or vomitus (Howard, Bowen, &amp; Garland, 2017). Treatment consists of supporting respiratory and cardiac functioning until the substance is removed from the body. There are no antidotes or specific medications to treat inhalant toxicity.</p>

<p>Current treatment modalities are based on the concept of alcoholism (and other addictions) as a medical illness that is progressive, chronic, and characterized by remissions and relapses. Until the 1970s, organized treatment programs and clinics for substance abuse were scarce. Before the illness of addiction was fully understood, most of society and even the medical community viewed chemical dependency as a personal problem; the user was advised to "pull yourself together" and "get control of your problem." Founded in 1949, the Hazelden Clinic in Minnesota is the noted exception; because of its success, many programs are based on the Hazelden model of treatment.</p>
<p>Today, treatment for substance use is available in a variety of community settings, not all of which involve health professionals. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was founded in the 1930s by alcoholics. This self-help group developed the 12-step program model for recovery (Box 19.3), which is based on the philosophy that total abstinence is essential and that alcoholics need the help and support of others to maintain sobriety. Key slogans reflect the ideas in the 12 steps, such as "one day at a time" (approach sobriety one day at a time), "easy does it" (don't get frenzied about daily life and problems), and "let go and let God" (turn your life over to a higher power). People who are early in recovery are encouraged to have a sponsor to help them progress through the 12 steps of AA. Once sober, a member can be a sponsor for another person.</p>

</ol>
<p>Regular attendance at meetings is emphasized. Meetings are available daily in large cities and at least weekly in smaller towns or rural areas. AA meetings may be "closed" (only those who are pursuing recovery can attend) or "open" (anyone can attend). Meetings may be educational with a featured speaker; other meetings focus on a reading, daily meditation, or a theme and then offer the opportunity for members to relate their battles with alcohol and to ask the others for help in staying sober.</p>
<p>Many treatment programs, regardless of setting, use the 12-step approach and emphasize participation in AA. They also include individual counseling and a wide variety of groups. Group experiences involve education about substances and their use, problem-solving techniques, and cognitive techniques to identify and modify faulty ways of thinking. An overall theme is coping with life, stress, and other people without the use of substances.</p>
<p>Although traditional treatment programs and AA have been successful for many people, they are not effective for everyone. Some object to the emphasis on God and spirituality; others do not respond well to the confrontational approach sometimes used in treatment or to identifying oneself as an alcoholic</p>
<p>829</p>
<p>or an addict. Women and minorities have reported feeling overlooked or ignored by an essentially “white, male, middle-class” organization. Treatment programs have been developed to meet these needs, such as Women for Sobriety (exclusively for women) and Rainbow Recovery (for gay and lesbian individuals). AA groups may also be designated for women or gay and lesbian people.</p>
<p>The 12-step concept of recovery has been used for other drugs as well. Such groups include Narcotics Anonymous; Al-Anon, a support group for spouses, partners, and friends of alcoholics; and AlaTeen, a group for children of parents with substance problems. This same model has been used in self-help groups for people with gambling problems and eating disorders.</p>

<p>Clients being treated for intoxication and withdrawal or detoxification are encountered in a wide variety of medical settings from emergency departments to outpatient clinics. Clients needing medically supervised detoxification are often treated on medical units in the hospital setting and then referred to an appropriate outpatient treatment setting when they are medically stable.</p>
<p>Health professionals provide extended or outpatient treatment in various settings, including clinics or centers offering day and evening programs, halfway houses, residential settings, or special chemical dependency units in hospitals. Generally, the type of treatment setting selected is based on the client's needs as well as on his or her insurance coverage. For example, for someone who has limited insurance coverage, is working, and has a supportive family, the outpatient setting may be chosen first because it is less expensive, the client can continue to work, and the family can provide support. If the client cannot remain sober during outpatient treatment, then inpatient treatment may be required. Clients with repeated treatment experiences may need the structure of a halfway house with a gradual transition into the community.</p>

<p>Sam, age 38, is married with two children. Sam’s father was an alcoholic, and his childhood was chaotic. His father was seldom around for Sam’s school activities or family events, and when he was present, his drunken behavior spoiled the occasion. When Sam graduated from high school and</p>
<p>830</p>
<p>left home, he vowed he would never be like his father.</p>
<p>Initially, Sam had many hopes and dreams about becoming an architect and raising a family with love and affection, and he pictured himself as a devoted and loving spouse. But he'd had some bad luck. He got into trouble for underage drinking in college, and his grades slipped because he missed classes after celebrating with his friends. Sam believes life has treated him unfairly; after all, he only has a few beers with friends to relax. Sometimes, he overdoes it and he drinks more than he intended, but doesn't everybody? Sam's big plans for the future are on hold.</p>
<p>Today, Sam's boss told him he would be fired if he was late or absent from work in the next 30 days. Sam tells himself that the boss is being unreasonable; after all, Sam is an excellent worker when he's there. The last straw was when Sam's wife told him she was tired of his drinking and irresponsible behavior. She threatened to leave if Sam did not stop drinking. Her last words of the argument were, "You're just like your father!" Sam still believes he could control his own alcohol problems if everyone would give him a chance. He decides to go to alcohol treatment in an attempt to appease his boss and wife so that he won't lose his job and marriage.</p>

<p>Pharmacologic treatment in substance abuse has two main purposes: (1) to permit safe withdrawal from alcohol, sedative-hypnotics, and benzodiazepines and (2) to prevent relapse.

<p>Alcohol withdrawal is usually managed with a benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, which is used to suppress the symptoms of abstinence. The most commonly used benzodiazepines are lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and diazepam. These medications can be administered on a fixed schedule around the clock during withdrawal. Giving these medications on an as-needed basis according to symptom parameters, however, is just as effective and results in a speedier withdrawal. Barbiturates can be used for benzodiazepine-resistant cases of alcohol withdrawal (Martin &amp; Katz, 2016).</p>
<p>Disulfiram (Antabuse) may be prescribed to help deter clients from drinking. If a client taking disulfiram drinks alcohol, a severe adverse reaction occurs with flushing, a throbbing headache, sweating, nausea, and vomiting. In severe cases, severe hypotension, confusion, coma, and even death may result (see Chapter 2). The client must also avoid a wide variety of products that contain alcohol, such as cough syrup, lotions, mouthwash, perfume, aftershave, vinegar, and vanilla and other extracts. The client must read product labels carefully because any product containing alcohol can produce symptoms. Ingestion of alcohol may cause unpleasant symptoms for 1 to 2 weeks after the last dose of disulfiram.</p>
<p>Acamprosate (Campral) may be prescribed for clients recovering from alcohol abuse or dependence to help reduce cravings for alcohol and decrease the physical and emotional discomfort that occurs especially in the first few months of recovery. These include sweating, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. The dosage is two tablets, 333 mg each, three times a day. Individuals with renal impairment cannot take this drug. Side effects are reported as mild and include diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, and pruritis. Acamprosate is often thought to be more effective with "relief cravers," while naltrexone (discussed later in this section) is more effective with "reward cravers" (Roos, Mann, &amp; Witkiewitz, 2017). Relief cravers seek mediation of negative effects of withdrawal, while reward cravers seek positive effects of drinking.</p>
<p>Methadone, a potent synthetic opiate, is used as a substitute for heroin in some maintenance programs. The client takes 1 daily dose of methadone, which meets the physical need for opiates but does not produce cravings for more. Methadone does not produce the high associated with heroin. The client has essentially substituted his or her addiction to heroin for an addiction to methadone; however, methadone is safer because it is legal, controlled by a physician, and available in tablet form. The client avoids the risks of IV drug use, the high cost of heroin (which often leads to criminal acts), and the</p>
<p>835</p>
<p>use, the high cost of heroin (which often leads to criminal acts), and the questionable content of street drugs.</p>
<p>Levomethadyl is a narcotic analgesic with the only purpose of treating opiate dependence. It is used in the same manner as methadone.</p>
<p>Buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) is a combination drug used for opiate maintenance and to decrease opiate cravings. Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic opioid, and naloxone is an opioid inverse agonist. The client takes 1 daily sublingual dose. Medication ingestion is supervised, at least initially, because Suboxone has the potential for abuse and diversion (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018). Clients can be tapered from this medication after treatment and with adequate psychosocial support. Some clients may remain on a maintenance dose for an extended time. Naltrexone (ReVia) is an opioid receptor antagonist often used to treat overdose. It blocks the effects of any opioids that might be ingested, thereby negating the effects of using more opioids. It has also been found to reduce the cravings for alcohol in abstinent clients. Extended-release naltrexone has been effective in reduction of cravings during treatment and at 30- and 60-day intervals post-treatment (Crèvecoeur-MacPhail, Cousins, Denering, Kim, &amp; Rawson, 2018). Naltrexone is also available as a once-monthly injectable marketed as Vivitrol.</p>
<p>There are four medications that are sometimes prescribed for the off-label use of decreasing craving for cocaine. They are disulfiram (discussed earlier); modafinil (Provigil), an antinarcoleptics; propranolol (Inderal), a beta-blocker; and topiramate (Topamax), an anticonvulsant also used to stabilize moods and treat migraines.</p>
<p>Nalmefene is an opioid receptor antagonist marketed as Revex and is used in the United States to combat opioid overdose. In Europe, it has been approved in oral tablet form to diminish alcohol and opioid cravings. It has not been approved for this use by the FDA.</p>
<p>Clonidine (Catapres) is an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist used to treat hypertension. It is given to clients with opiate dependence to suppress some effects of withdrawal or abstinence. It is most effective against nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but produces modest relief from muscle aches, anxiety, and restlessness (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018).</p>
<p>Ondansetron (Zofran), a 5-HT₃ antagonist that blocks the vagal stimulation effects of serotonin in the small intestine, is used as an antiemetic. It has been used in young males at high risk for alcohol dependence or with early-onset alcohol dependence. It is being studied for treatment of methamphetamine addiction.</p>

<p>The client with both substance abuse and another psychiatric illness is said to have a dual diagnosis. Dual diagnosis clients who have schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder present the greatest challenge to health care professionals. It is estimated that 50% of people with a substance abuse disorder also have mental health diagnoses. Traditional methods for treatment of major psychiatric illness or primary substance abuse often have limited success in these clients for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients with a major psychiatric illness may have impaired abilities to process abstract concepts; this is a major barrier in substance abuse programs.</li>
<li>Substance use treatment emphasizes avoidance of all psychoactive drugs. This may not be possible for the client who needs psychotropic drugs to treat his or her mental illness.</li>
<li>The concept of "limited recovery" is more acceptable in the treatment of psychiatric illnesses, but substance abuse has no limited recovery concept.</li>
<li>The notion of lifelong abstinence, which is central to substance use treatment, may seem overwhelming and impossible to the client who lives "day to day" with a chronic mental illness.</li>
<li>The use of alcohol and other drugs can precipitate psychotic behavior; this makes it difficult for professionals to identify whether symptoms are the result of active mental illness or substance abuse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients with a dual diagnosis (substance use and mental illness) present challenges that traditional settings cannot meet. Studies of successful treatment and relapse prevention strategies for this population found that integrated treatment programs that address many unmet needs are more likely to succeed (Kikkert, Goudriaan, de Waal, Peen, &amp; Dekker, 2018). Several key elements that need to be addressed include healthy, nurturing, supportive living environments; assistance with fundamental life changes, such as finding a job and abstinent friends; connections with other recovering people; and treatment of comorbid conditions. Clients identified the need for stable housing, positive social support, using prayer or relying on a higher power, participation in meaningful activity, eating regularly, getting sufficient sleep,</p>

<p>Michael, age 33, was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 19 years old. He has been hospitalized at times and has resided in sheltered treatment settings, such as supervised apartments and group homes in the past. His compliance with antipsychotic medications is sporadic because of the side effects, and when he experiences psychotic symptoms, the paranoid delusions convince him that the medications are poisoned.</p>
<p>Michael began to drink alcohol on an almost daily basis 3 years ago. He thought alcohol might get rid of “voices in his head” and help him relax and sleep at night. Michael also mistakenly believed that having a few drinks at the local bar made him “fit in” with others and gave him the courage to try socializing.</p>
<p>The more Michael drinks, the more intense his delusions and hallucinations become. In addition, drinking and intoxication is prohibited for group home residents, and Michael was asked to leave. He is now homeless, having psychotic symptoms, drinking more alcohol, and not attending psychiatric follow-up appointments. He has been screened for an alcoholism treatment program but refuses to attend.</p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Nursing Interventions</th><th>Rationale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Encourage open expression of feelings.</td><td>Verbalizing feelings is an initial step toward dealing constructively with those feelings.</td></tr><tr><td>Validate the client's frustration or anger in dealing with dual problems (e.g., “I know this must be difficult.”).</td><td>Expressing feelings outwardly, especially negative ones, may relieve some of the client's stress and anxiety.</td></tr><tr><td>Consider alcohol or substance use as a factor that influences the client's ability to live in the community, similar to such factors as taking medications, keeping appointments, and so forth.</td><td>Substance use is not necessarily the major problem experienced by the client with a dual diagnosis; it is only one of several problems. Overemphasis on any single factor does not guarantee success.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<table><thead><tr><th>Maintain frequent contact with the client, even if it is only brief telephone calls.</th><th>Frequent contact decreases the length of time the client feels “stranded” or left alone to deal with problems.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Give positive feedback for abstinence on a day-by-day basis.</td><td>Positive feedback reinforces abstinent behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>If drinking or substance use occurs, discuss the events that led to the incident with the client in a nonjudgmental manner.</td><td>The client may be able to see the relatedness of the events or a pattern of behavior while discussing the situation.</td></tr><tr><td>Discuss ways to avoid similar circumstances in the future.</td><td>Anticipatory planning may prepare the client to avoid similar circumstances in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>Teach the client about positive coping strategies and stress management skills, such as increasing physical exercise, expressing feelings verbally or in a journal, or meditation techniques. Encourage the client to practice this type of technique while in treatment.</td><td>The client may have limited or no knowledge of stress management techniques or may not have used positive techniques in the past. If the client tries to build skills in the treatment setting, he or she can experience success and receive positive feedback for his or her efforts.</td></tr><tr><td>Assess the amount of unstructured time with which the client must cope.</td><td>The client is more likely to experience frustration or dissatisfaction, which can lead to substance use, when he or she has excessive amounts of unstructured time.</td></tr><tr><td>Assist the client in planning daily or weekly schedules of purposeful activities—errands, appointments, taking walks, and so forth.</td><td>Scheduled events provide the client with something to anticipate or look forward to doing.</td></tr><tr><td>Writing the schedule on a calendar may be beneficial.</td><td>Visualization of the schedule provides a concrete reference for the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Encourage the client to record activities, feelings, and thoughts in a journal.</td><td>A journal can provide a focus for the client and yield information that is useful in future planning but may otherwise be forgotten or overlooked.</td></tr><tr><td>Teach the client social skills. Describe and demonstrate specific skills, such as eye contact, attentive listening, nodding, and so forth. Discuss the kind of topics that are appropriate for social conversation, such as the weather, news, local events, and so forth.</td><td>The client may have little or no knowledge of social interaction skills. Modeling the skills provides a concrete example of the desired skills.</td></tr><tr><td>Give positive support to the client for appropriate use of social skills.</td><td>Positive feedback will encourage the client to continue socialization attempts and enhance self-esteem.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><thead><tr><th>Teach the client and his or her significant others about the dual diagnosis, conditions, treatment, and medications.*</th><th>The client’s significant others can help provide support and structure. The client and his or her significant others may lack knowledge about the conditions, treatments, and medications.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Refer the client to volunteering or vocational services if indicated.*</td><td>Purposeful activity makes better use of the client’s unstructured time and can enhance the client’s feelings of worth and self-esteem.</td></tr><tr><td>Refer the client to community support services that address mental health and substance dependence-related needs.*</td><td>Clients with dual diagnosis have complicated and long-term problems that require ongoing, extended assistance.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Identifying people with substance use problems can be difficult. Substance use typically includes the use of defense mechanisms, especially <strong>denial</strong>. Clients may deny directly having any problems or may minimize the extent of problems or actual substance use. In addition, the nurse may encounter clients with substance problems in various settings unrelated to mental health. A client may come to a clinic for treatment of medical problems related to alcohol use, or a client may develop withdrawal symptoms while in the hospital for surgery or an unrelated condition. The nurse must be alert to the possibility of substance use in these situations and be prepared to recognize existence of an issue and make appropriate referrals.</p>
<p>The Simple Screening Instrument for Alcohol and Other Drugs (SSI-AOD) is a useful screening device to detect hazardous drinking patterns as well as full-blown substance use disorders. This tool (Box 19.4) promotes recognition of problem drinking or drug use. Early detection and treatment are associated with more positive outcomes, so increased use of this or a similar screening device is encouraged.</p>

<p>Assessment of general appearance and behavior usually reveals appearance and speech to be normal. Clients may appear anxious, tired, and disheveled if they have just completed a difficult course of detoxification. Depending on their overall health status and any health problems resulting from substance use, clients may appear physically ill. Most clients are somewhat apprehensive about treatment, resent being in treatment, or feel pressured by others to be there. This may be the first time in a long time that clients have had to deal with any difficulty without the help of a psychoactive substance.</p>

<p>Wide ranges of mood and affect are possible. Some clients are sad and tearful, expressing guilt and remorse for their behavior and circumstances. Others may be angry and sarcastic or quiet and sullen, unwilling to talk to the nurse. Irritability is common because clients are newly free of substances. Clients may be pleasant and seemingly happy, appearing unaffected by the situation, especially if they are still in denial about the substance use.</p>

<p>During assessment of thought process and content, clients are likely to minimize their substance use, blame others for their problems, and rationalize their behavior.

<p>Clients are likely to have exercised poor judgment, especially while under the influence of the substance. Judgment may still be affected; clients may behave impulsively, such as leaving treatment to obtain the substance of choice. Insight is usually limited regarding substance use.

<p>Clients generally have low self-esteem, which they may express directly or cover with grandiose behavior. They do not feel adequate to cope with life and stress without the substance and are often uncomfortable around others when not using. They often have difficulty identifying and expressing true feelings; in the past, they have preferred to escape feelings and avoid any personal pain or difficulty with the help of the substance.</p>

<p>Clients usually have experienced many difficulties with social, family, and occupational roles. Absenteeism and poor work performance are common. Often, family members have told these clients that the substance use was a concern, and it may have been the subject of family arguments. Relationships in the family are often strained. Clients may be angry with family members who were instrumental in bringing them to treatment or who threatened loss of a significant relationship.</p>

<p>Clients and family members need facts about the substance, its effects, and recovery. The nurse must dispel the following myths and misconceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“It’s a matter of willpower.”</li>
<li>“I can’t be an alcoholic if I only drink beer or if I only drink on weekends.”</li>
<li>“I can learn to use drugs socially.”</li>

<p>substance-using acquaintances, or believe they can "handle myself now" are at high risk for relapse, and loved ones need to take action.

<p>Alcoholism (and other substance abuse) is often called a family illness. All those who have a close relationship with a person who abuses substances suffer emotional, social, and sometimes physical anguish.</p>
<p><strong>Codependence</strong> is a maladaptive coping pattern on the part of family members or others resulting from a prolonged relationship with the person who uses substances. Characteristics of codependence are poor relationship skills, excessive anxiety and worry, compulsive behaviors, and resistance to change. Family members learn these dysfunctional behavior patterns as they try to adjust to the behavior of the substance user. One type of codependent behavior is called enabling, which is a behavior that seems helpful on the surface but actually perpetuates the substance use. For example, a wife who continually calls in to her husband's job to report that he is sick when he is really drunk or hungover prevents the husband from having to face the true implications and repercussions of his behavior. What appears to be a helpful action really just assists the husband in avoiding the consequences of his behavior and to continue abusing the substance.</p>
<p>847</p>
<p>for or takes care of a parent. Codependent behaviors have also been identified in health care professionals when they make excuses for a client's behavior or do things for clients that clients can do for themselves.</p>
<p>An adult child of an alcoholic is someone who was raised in a family in which one or both parents were addicted to alcohol and who has been subjected to the many dysfunctional aspects associated with parental alcoholism. In addition to being at high risk for alcoholism and eating disorders, children of alcoholics often develop an inability to trust, an extreme need to control, an excessive sense of responsibility, and denial of feelings; these characteristics persist into adulthood. Many people growing up in homes with parental alcoholism believe their problems will be solved when they are old enough to leave and escape the situation. They may begin to have problems in relationships, have low self-esteem, and have excessive fears of abandonment or insecurity as adults. Never having experienced normal family life, they may find that they do not know what "normal" is (Haverfield &amp; Theiss, 2016).</p>
<p>Without support and help to understand and cope, many family members may develop substance abuse problems of their own, thus perpetuating the dysfunctional cycle. Treatment and support groups are available to address the issues of family members. Clients and families also need information about support groups, their purpose, and their locations in the community.</p>

<p>848</p>
<p>Nurses can encourage clients to identify problem areas in their lives and to explore the ways that substance use may have intensified those problems. Clients should not believe that all life’s problems will disappear with sobriety; rather, sobriety will assist them in thinking about the problems clearly. The nurse may need to redirect a client’s attention to his or her behavior and how it influenced his or her problems. The nurse should not allow clients to focus on external events or other people without discussing their role in the problem.</p>
<p>&gt; <strong>Nurse:</strong> “Can you describe some problems you’ve been having?”
&gt;
&gt; <strong>Client:</strong> “My wife is always nagging; nothing is ever good enough. So we don’t get along very well.”
&gt;
&gt; <strong>Nurse:</strong> “How do you communicate with your wife?”
&gt;
&gt; <strong>Client:</strong> “I can’t talk to her about anything; she won’t listen.”
&gt;
&gt; <strong>Nurse:</strong> “Are you saying that you don’t talk to her much?”</p>
<p>It may be helpful to role-play situations that clients have found difficult. This is also an opportunity to help clients learn to solve problems or to discuss situations with others calmly and more effectively. In the group setting in treatment, it is helpful to encourage clients to give and to receive feedback about how others perceive their interaction or ability to listen.</p>
<p>The nurse can also help clients find ways to relieve stress or anxiety that do not involve substance use. Relaxing, exercising, listening to music, or engaging in activities may be effective. Clients may also need to develop new social activities or leisure pursuits if most of their friends or habits of socializing involved the use of substances.</p>
<p>The nurse can help clients focus on the present, not the past. It is not helpful for clients to dwell on past problems and regrets. Rather, they must focus on what they can do now regarding their behavior or relationships. Clients may need support from the nurse to view life and sobriety in feasible terms—taking it one day at a time. The nurse can encourage clients to set attainable goals such as, “What can I do today to stay sober?” instead of feeling overwhelmed by thinking “How can I avoid substances for the rest of my life?” Clients need to believe that they can succeed.</p>

<p>Onset of initial drinking problems after the age of 50 years is not uncommon. Some older adults with alcohol use problems are those who had a drinking problem early in life, had a significant period of abstinence, and then resumed drinking again in later life. Others may have been heavy or reactive consumers of alcohol early in life. However, estimates are that 30% to 60% of elders in treatment programs began drinking abusively after age 60.</p>
<p>Risk factors for late-onset substance abuse in older adults include chronic illness that causes pain, long-term use of prescription medication (sedative-hypnotics, anxiolytics), life stress, loss, social isolation, grief, depression, and an abundance of discretionary time and money. Elders may experience physical problems associated with substance abuse rather quickly, especially if their overall medical health is compromised by other illnesses (Gilson, Bryant, &amp; Judd, 2017).</p>

<p>Many people receiving treatment for substance abuse do so in community-based settings, such as outpatient treatment, freestanding substance abuse treatment facilities, and recovery programs such as AA and Rational Recovery. Follow-up or aftercare for clients in the community is based on the client's preferences or the programs available. Some clients remain active in self-help groups. Others attend aftercare program sessions sponsored by the agency where they complete treatment. Still others seek individual or family counseling. In addition to formal aftercare, the nurse may also encounter recovering clients in clinics or physicians' offices.</p>

<p>A person only has to watch television or read a magazine to see many advertisements targeted at the promotion of responsible drinking or encouraging parents to be an "antidrug" influence for their children. Increasing public awareness and educational advertising have not made any significant change in the rates of substance abuse in the United States. Two populations currently identified for prevention programs are older adults and college-aged adults.</p>
<p>Late-onset alcoholism in older adults is usually milder and more amenable to treatment, yet health care professionals overlook it more frequently. It has been suggested that use of a screening tool in all primary care settings would promote early identification of older adults with alcoholism. Brief interventions have been effective in producing sustained abstinence or reduced levels of alcohol consumption, thereby decreasing hazardous and harmful drinking in this population.</p>
<p>The College Drinking Prevention Program, which is government sponsored, is a response to some of the following statistics about college students between the ages of 18 and 24 (NIAAA, 2015):</p>
<ul>
<li>1825 students die annually from alcohol-related unintentional injuries.</li>
<li>599,000 students are unintentionally injured while under the influence of alcohol.</li>
<li>696,000 students are assaulted by another student under the influence of alcohol.</li>
<li>97,000 students are victims of alcohol-related assault or date rape.</li>
<li>400,000 students reported having unsafe sex; 100,000 students reported being too drunk to know if they consented to sexual activity.</li>
<li>150,000 students develop an alcohol-related health problem; 1.2% to 1.5% of these students report attempting suicide in the past year because of drinking or drug use.</li>
<li>3.6 million students reported driving under the influence of alcohol.</li>
<li>About 25% of students report academic consequences of drinking, such as missing class, falling behind, doing poorly in exams or papers, and receiving lower grades overall.</li>
</ul>
<p>This prevention program was designed to help college students avoid the "predictable" or expected binge drinking common in U.S. colleges and universities. Some campuses offer alcohol- and drug-free dormitories for students, and some college-wide activities no longer allow alcohol to be served. Educational programs (about the previous statistics) are designed to raise student awareness about excessive drinking. Students who wish to abstain from alcohol are encouraged to socialize together and provide support to one another for this lifestyle choice.</p>

<p>controlled substances, such as opioids, stimulants, and sedatives, than other professionals of comparable educational achievement, such as lawyers. One reason is thought to be the ease of obtaining controlled substances. Health care professionals also have higher rates of alcoholism than the general population.</p>
<p>The issue of reporting colleagues with suspected substance abuse is an important and extremely sensitive one. It is difficult for colleagues and supervisors to report their peers for suspected abuse. Nurses may hesitate to report suspected behaviors for several reasons: they have difficulty believing that a trained health care professional would engage in abuse; they may feel guilty or fear falsely accusing someone; or they may simply want to avoid conflict. Substance abuse by health professionals is serious, however, because it can endanger clients. Nurses have an ethical responsibility to report suspicious behavior to a supervisor and, in some states, a legal obligation as defined in the state's nurse practice act. Nurses should not try to handle such situations alone by warning the coworker; this often just allows the coworker to continue to abuse the substance without suffering any repercussions.</p>
<p>General warning signs of abuse include poor work performance, frequent absenteeism, unusual behavior, slurred speech, and isolation from peers. More specific behaviors and signs that might indicate substance abuse include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrect drug counts</li>
<li>Excessive controlled substances listed as wasted or contaminated</li>
<li>Reports by clients of ineffective pain relief from medications, especially if relief had been adequate previously</li>
<li>Damaged or torn packaging on controlled substances</li>
<li>Increased reports of "pharmacy error"</li>
<li>Consistent offers to obtain controlled substances from pharmacy</li>
<li>Unexplained absences from the unit</li>
<li>Trips to the bathroom after contact with controlled substances</li>
<li>Consistent early arrivals at or late departures from work for no apparent reason</li>
</ul>
<p>Nurses can become involved in substance abuse just as any other person might. Nurses with abuse problems deserve the opportunity for treatment and recovery as well. Reporting suspected substance abuse could be the crucial first step toward a nurse getting the help he or she needs.</p>
<p>BEST PRACTICE:</p>
<p>852</p>
<p>Researchers have developed Pathways to Comorbidity Care (PCC) to better address the needs of clients with dual diagnoses of substance use and mental illness. It is a training course for health professionals to improve outcomes for a population with traditionally poorer long-term outcomes. It includes an online portal with resources for clinicians to employ in their practices.</p>
<p>The next step would be proliferation of the PCC training and resource package to see if initial positive outcomes are maintained across locations and client demographics.</p>

<p>The nurse must examine his or her beliefs and attitudes about substance abuse. A history of substance use in the nurse’s family can influence strongly his or her interaction with clients. The nurse may be overly harsh and critical, telling the client he or she should “realize how you’re hurting your family.” Conversely, the nurse may unknowingly act out old family roles and engage in enabling behavior such as sympathizing with the client’s reasons for using substances. Examining one’s own substance use or the use by close friends and family may be difficult and unpleasant, but it is necessary if the nurse is to have therapeutic relationships with clients.</p>
<p>The nurse might also have different attitudes about various substances of abuse. For example, a nurse may have empathy for clients who are addicted to prescription medication but is disgusted by clients who use heroin or other illegal substances. It is important to remember that the treatment process and underly Additional Readinging issues of substance abuse, remission, and relapse are quite similar regardless of the substance.</p>
<p>Many clients experience periodic relapses. For some, being sober is a lifelong struggle. The nurse may become cynical or pessimistic when clients return for multiple attempts at substance use treatment. Such thoughts as “he deserves health problems if he keeps drinking” or “she should expect to get hepatitis or HIV infection if she keeps doing IV drugs” are signs that the nurse</p>

<li>Remember that substance abuse is a chronic, recurring disease for many people, just like diabetes or heart disease. Even though clients look like they should be able to control their substance abuse easily, they cannot without assistance and understanding.</li>
<li>Examine substance abuse problems in your own family and friends, even though it may be painful. Recognizing your own background, beliefs, and attitudes is the first step toward managing those feelings effectively so that they do not interfere with the care of clients and families.</li>
<li>Approach each treatment experience with an open and objective attitude. The client may be successful in maintaining abstinence after his or her second or third (or more) treatment experience.</li>

<p>Substance use and substance-related disorders can involve alcohol,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substance use and dependence include major impairment in the user's social and occupational functioning and behavioral and psychological changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alcohol is the substance abused most often in the United States; cannabis is second.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intoxication is the use of a substance that results in maladaptive behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Withdrawal syndrome is defined as negative psychological and physical reactions when use of a substance ceases or dramatically decreases.</p>

<li>
<p>Detoxification is the process of safely withdrawing from a substance. Detoxification from alcohol and barbiturates can be life-threatening and requires medical supervision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most significant risk factors for alcoholism are having an alcoholic parent, genetic vulnerability, and growing up in an alcoholic home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Routine screening with tools such as the SSI-AOD in a wide variety of settings (clinics, physicians' offices, through emergency services) can be used to detect substance use problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After detoxification, treatment of substance use continues in various outpatient and inpatient settings. Approaches are often based on the 12-step philosophy of abstinence, altered lifestyles, and peer support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Substance abuse is a family illness, meaning that it affects all members in some way. Family members and close friends need education and support in coping with their feelings toward the abuser. Many support groups are available to family members and close friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clients who are dually diagnosed with substance use problems and major psychiatric illness do poorly in traditional treatment settings and need specialized attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nursing interventions for clients being treated for substance abuse include teaching clients and families about substance abuse, dealing with family issues, and helping clients learn more effective coping skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health care professionals have increased rates of substance use problems, particularly involving opioids, stimulants, and sedatives. Reporting suspected substance abuse in colleagues is an ethical (and sometimes legal) responsibility of all health care professionals.</p>

<p>Eating is part of everyday life. It is necessary for survival, but it is also a social activity and part of many happy occasions. People go out for dinner, invite friends and family for meals in their homes, and celebrate special events such as marriages, holidays, and birthdays with food. Yet for some people, eating is a source of worry and anxiety. Are they eating too much? Do they look fat? Is some new weight loss promotion going to be the answer?</p>
<p>Obesity has been identified as a major health problem in the United States; some call it an epidemic. The number of obesity-related illnesses among children has increased dramatically. At the same time, millions of people, predominantly women, are either starving themselves or engaging in chaotic eating patterns that can lead to death.</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, the two most common eating disorders found in the mental health setting. It discusses strategies for early identification and prevention of these disorders.</p>

<p>Although many believe that eating disorders are relatively new, documentation from the Middle Ages indicates willful dieting leading to self-starvation in female saints who fasted to achieve purity. In the late 1800s, doctors in England and France described young women who used self-starvation to avoid obesity. It was not until the 1960s, however, that anorexia nervosa was established as a mental disorder. Bulimia nervosa was first described as a distinct syndrome in 1979.</p>
<p>Eating disorders can be viewed on a continuum, with clients with anorexia eating too little or starving themselves, clients with bulimia eating chaotically, and clients with obesity eating too much. There is much overlap among the eating disorders; 30% to 35% of normal-weight people with bulimia have a history of anorexia nervosa and low body weight, and about 50% of people with anorexia nervosa exhibit the compensatory behaviors seen in bulimic behavior, such as purging and excessive exercise. The distinguishing features of anorexia include an earlier age at onset and below-normal body weight; the person fails to recognize the eating behavior as a problem. Clients with bulimia have a later age at onset and near-normal body weight. They are usually ashamed and embarrassed by the eating behavior (Call, Attia, &amp; Walsh, 2017).</p>
<p>More than 90% of cases of anorexia nervosa and bulimia occur in women.</p>
<p>Although fewer men than women suffer from eating disorders, the number of men with anorexia or bulimia may be much higher than previously believed, many of whom are athletes. Men, however, are less likely to seek treatment. The prevalence of both eating disorders is estimated to be 2% to 4% of the general population in the United States. In addition, a majority of the general population is dissatisfied with body image and preoccupied with weight and dieting at some point in their lives (Call et al., 2017).</p>

<p>Anorexia nervosa is a life-threatening eating disorder characterized by the client's restriction of nutritional intake necessary to maintain a minimally normal body weight, intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, significantly disturbed perception of the shape or size of the body, and steadfast inability or refusal to acknowledge the seriousness of the problem or even that one exists. Clients with anorexia have a body weight that is less than the minimum expected weight considering age, height, and overall physical health. In addition, clients have a preoccupation with food and food-related activities and can have a variety of physical manifestations (Box 20.1).</p>

<p>Clients with anorexia nervosa can be classified into two subgroups depending on how they control their weight. Clients with the restricting</p>
<p>864</p>
<p>subtype lose weight primarily through dieting, fasting, or excessive exercising. Those with the binge eating and purging subtype engage regularly in binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating means consuming a large amount of food (far greater than most people eat at one time) in a discrete period of usually 2 hours or less. Purging involves compensatory behaviors designed to eliminate food by means of self-induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives, enemas, and diuretics. Some clients with anorexia do not binge but still engage in purging behaviors after ingesting small amounts of food.</p>
<p>Clients with anorexia become totally absorbed in their quest for weight loss and thinness. The term "anorexia" is actually a misnomer; these clients do not lose their appetites. They still experience hunger but ignore it and also ignore the signs of physical weakness and fatigue; they often believe that if they eat anything, they will not be able to stop eating and will become fat. Clients with anorexia are often preoccupied with food-related activities, such as grocery shopping, collecting recipes or cookbooks, counting calories, creating fat-free meals, and cooking family meals. They may also engage in unusual or ritualistic food behaviors such as refusing to eat around others, cutting food into minute pieces, or not allowing the food they eat to touch their lips. These behaviors increase their sense of control. Excessive exercise is common; it may occupy several hours a day.</p>
<p>Bulimia nervosa, often simply called bulimia, is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors to avoid weight gain, such as purging, fasting, or excessively exercising. The amount of food consumed during a binge episode is much larger than a person would normally eat. The client often engages in binge eating secretly. Between binges, the client may eat low-calorie foods or fast. Binging or purging episodes are often precipitated by strong emotions and followed by guilt, remorse, shame, or self-contempt.</p>
<p>The weight of clients with bulimia is usually in the normal range, though some clients are overweight or underweight. Recurrent vomiting destroys tooth enamel, and incidence of dental caries and ragged or chipped teeth increases in these clients. Dentists are often the first health care professionals to identify clients with bulimia.</p>

<p>Binge eating disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating; no regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors, such as purging or excessive exercise or abuse of laxatives; guilt, shame, and disgust about</p>
<p>865</p>
<p>eating behaviors; and marked psychological distress. Binge eating disorder frequently affects people over age 35, and it occurs more often in men than does any other eating disorder. Individuals are more likely to be overweight or obese, overweight as children, and teased about their weight at an early age (Call et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Night eating syndrome is characterized by morning anorexia, evening hyperphagia (consuming 50% of daily calories after the last evening meal), and nighttime awakenings (at least once a night) to consume snacks. It is associated with life stress, low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and adverse reactions to weight loss (Tu, Meg Tseng, &amp; Chang, 2018). Most people with night eating syndrome are obese. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants has shown limited, yet positive effects (McCuen-Wurst, Ruggieri, &amp; Allison, 2018).</p>
<p>Eating or feeding disorders in childhood include pica, which is persistent ingestion of nonfood substances, and rumination, or repeated regurgitation of food that is then rechewed, reswallowed, or spit out. Both of these disorders are more common in persons with intellectual disability.</p>
<p>Orthorexia nervosa, sometimes called orthorexia, is an obsession with proper or healthful eating. It is not formally recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, but some believe it is on the rise and may constitute a separate diagnosis. Others believe it is a type of anorexia or a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Behaviors include compulsive checking of ingredients; cutting out increasing number of food groups; inability to eat only "healthy" or "pure" foods; unusual interest in what others eat; hours spent thinking about food, what will be served at an event; and obsessive involvement in food blogs (Costa, Hardi-Khalil, &amp; Gibbs, 2017).</p>
<p>Comorbid psychiatric disorders are common in clients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse/dependence are frequently seen in clients with eating disorders. Of those, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder are most common. Both anorexia and bulimia are characterized by perfectionism, obsessive-compulsiveness, neuroticism, negative emotionality, harm avoidance, low self-directedness, low cooperativeness, and traits associated with avoidant personality disorder. In addition, clients with bulimia may also exhibit high impulsivity, sensation seeking, novelty seeking, and traits associated with borderline personality disorder. Eating disorders are often linked to a history of sexual abuse, especially if the abuse occurred before puberty. Such a history may be a factor contributing to problems with</p>
<p>866</p>
<p>intimacy, body satisfaction, sexual attractiveness, and low interest in sexual activity (Mitchison et al., 2018). Clients with eating disorders and a history of sexual abuse also have higher levels of depression and anxiety, lower self-esteem, more interpersonal problems, and more severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Childhood neglect, both physical and emotional, is also associated with eating disorders (Pignatelli, Wampers, Loriedo, Biondi, &amp; Vanderlinden, 2017). Whether sexual abuse has a cause-and-effect relationship with the development of eating disorders, however, remains unclear.</p>

<p>A specific cause for eating disorders is unknown. Initially, dieting may be the stimulus that leads to their development. Biologic vulnerability, developmental problems, and family and social influences can turn dieting into an eating disorder (Table 20.1). Psychological and physiological reinforcement of maladaptive eating behaviors sustains the cycle.</p>

<p>Studies of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa have shown that these</p>
<p>disorders tend to run in families. Genetic vulnerability might also result from a particular personality type or a general susceptibility to psychiatric disorders (Bulik, Kleiman, &amp; Yilmaz, 2016). Or, it may directly involve a dysfunction of the hypothalamus. A family history of mood or anxiety disorders (e.g., obsessive–compulsive disorder) places a person at risk for an eating disorder.</p>
<p>Disruptions of the nuclei of the hypothalamus may produce many of the symptoms of eating disorders. Two sets of nuclei are particularly important in many aspects of hunger and satiety (satisfaction of appetite)—the lateral hypothalamus and the ventromedial hypothalamus (Keel et al., 2018). Deficits in the lateral hypothalamus result in decreased eating and decreased responses to sensory stimuli that are important to eating. Disruption of the ventromedial hypothalamus leads to excessive eating, weight gain, and decreased responsiveness to the satiety effects of glucose, which are behaviors seen in bulimia.</p>
<p>Many neurochemical changes accompany eating disorders, but it is difficult to tell whether they cause or result from eating disorders and the characteristic symptoms of starvation, binging, and purging. For example, norepinephrine levels rise normally in response to eating, allowing the body to metabolize and use nutrients. Norepinephrine levels do not rise during starvation, however, because few nutrients are available to metabolize. Therefore, low norepinephrine levels are seen in clients during periods of restricted food intake. Also, low epinephrine levels are related to the decreased heart rate and blood pressure seen in clients with anorexia.</p>
<p>Increased levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin and its precursor tryptophan have been linked with increased satiety. Low levels of serotonin as well as low platelet levels of monoamine oxidase have been found in clients with bulimia and the binge and purge subtype of anorexia nervosa (Call et al., 2017); this may explain binging behavior. The positive response of some clients with bulimia to the treatment with SSRI antidepressants supports the idea that serotonin levels at the synapse may be low in these clients.</p>

<p>Two essential tasks of adolescence are the struggle to develop autonomy and the establishment of a unique identity. Autonomy, or exerting control over oneself and the environment, may be difficult in families that are overprotective or in which enmeshment (lack of clear role boundaries) exists. These family environments may have an orientation toward control, system maintenance, or conflict (Darrow, Accurso, Nauman, Goldschmidt, &amp; Le</p>
<p>868</p>
<p>Grange, 2017). Such families do not support members' efforts to gain independence, and teenagers may feel as though they have little or no control over their lives. These teens begin to control their eating through severe dieting and thus gain control over their weight. Losing weight becomes reinforcing; by continuing to lose, these clients exert control over one aspect of their lives.</p>
<p>It is important to identify potential risk factors for developing eating disorders so that prevention programs can target those at highest risk. Adolescent girls who express body dissatisfaction are most likely to experience adverse outcomes, such as emotional eating, binge eating, abnormal attitudes about eating and weight, low self-esteem, stress, and depression. Characteristics of those who developed an eating disorder included disturbed eating habits; disturbed attitudes toward food; eating in secret; preoccupation with food, eating, shape, or weight; fear of losing control over eating; and wanting to have a completely empty stomach (Mitchison et al., 2017).</p>
<p>The need to develop a unique identity, or a sense of who one is as a person, is another essential task of adolescence. It coincides with the onset of puberty, which initiates many emotional and physiological changes. Self-doubt and confusion can result if the adolescent does not measure up to the person she or he wants to be.</p>
<p>Advertisements, magazines, television, and movies that feature thin models reinforce the cultural belief that slimness is attractive. Excessive dieting and weight loss may be the way an adolescent chooses to achieve this ideal. Body image is how a person perceives his or her body, that is, a mental self-image. For most people, body image is consistent with how others view them. For people with anorexia nervosa, however, body image differs greatly from the perception of others. They perceive themselves as fat, unattractive, and undesirable even when they are severely underweight and malnourished. Body image disturbance occurs when there is an extreme discrepancy between one's body image and the perceptions of others and extreme dissatisfaction with one's body image (Mitchison et al., 2017).</p>

<p>Self-perceptions of the body can influence the development of identity in adolescence greatly and often persist into adulthood. Self-perceptions that include being overweight lead to the belief that dieting is necessary before one can be happy or satisfied. Clients with bulimia nervosa report dissatisfaction with their bodies as well as the belief that they are fat, unattractive, and undesirable. The binging and purging cycle of bulimia can begin at any time —after dieting has been unsuccessful, before the severe dieting begins, or at the same time as part of a “weight loss plan.”</p>

<p>Girls growing up amid family problems and abuse are at higher risk for both anorexia and bulimia. Disordered eating is a common response to family discord. Girls growing up in families without emotional support may try to escape their negative emotions. They may place an intense focus outward on something concrete—physical appearance. Disordered eating becomes a distraction from emotions.</p>
<p>Childhood adversity has been identified as a significant risk factor in the development of problems with eating or weight in adolescence or early adulthood. Adversity is defined as physical neglect, sexual abuse, or parental maltreatment that includes little care, affection, and empathy as well as excessive paternal control, unfriendliness, or overprotectiveness.</p>

<p>In the United States and other Western countries, the media fuels the image of the "ideal woman" as thin. This culture equates beauty, desirability, and, ultimately, happiness with being thin, toned, and physically fit. Adolescents often idealize actresses and models as having the perfect "look" or body, even though many of these celebrities are underweight or use ways to appear thinner than they are. Books, magazines, dietary supplements, exercise equipment, plastic surgery advertisements, and weight loss programs abound; the dieting industry is a billion-dollar business. Western culture considers being overweight a sign of laziness, lack of self-control, or indifference; it equates pursuit of the "perfect" body with beauty, desirability, success, and willpower. Thus, many women speak of being "good" when they stick to a diet and "bad" when they eat desserts or snacks (Churruca, Ussher, &amp; Perz, 2017).</p>
<p>Pressure from others may also contribute to eating disorders. Pressure from coaches, parents, and peers and the emphasis placed on body form in sports such as gymnastics, ballet, and wrestling can promote eating disorders in athletes (Giel &amp; Hermann-Werner, 2016). Parental concern over a girl's weight and teasing from parents or peers reinforces a girl's body dissatisfaction and her need to diet or control eating in some way. Studies indicate that bullying and peer harassment are also related to an increase in disordered eating habits for both bullies and victims.</p>
<p>CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>Both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are far more prevalent in industrialized societies, where food is abundant and beauty is linked with thinness. In the United States, anorexia nervosa is less frequent among African Americans. On the island of Fiji, when there was little television, eating disorders were almost nonexistent and being "plump" was considered the ideal shape for girls and women. In the 5 years following the widespread introduction of television, the number of eating disorders in Fiji increased significantly (Call et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Eating disorders are most common in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and other developed industrialized countries. As a society becomes more prosperous with increased availability of foods high in fat and carbohydrates and increased emphasis on the thinness equals beauty concept, the incidence of eating disorders increases. In addition, immigrants from cultures in which eating disorders are rare may develop eating disorders as they assimilate the thin-body ideal (Anorexia Nervosa &amp; Related Eating Disorders, 2019).</p>
<p>Schulte (2016) found that both male and female youths in the United Arab Emirates experienced binge eating. Obesity was a prevalent problem, as was emotional eating and body-related guilt. Eating disorders appear to be equally common among Hispanic and Caucasian women and less common among African American and Asian women. Minority women who are younger, better educated, and more closely identified with middle-class values are at increased risk for developing an eating disorder (Perez, Ohrt, &amp; Hoek, 2016).</p>
<p>During the past several years, eating disorders have increased among all U.S. social classes and ethnic groups. With today's technology, the entire world is exposed to the Western ideal. As this ideal spreads to non-Western cultures, anorexia and bulimia will likely increase there as well.</p>

<p>Anorexia nervosa typically begins between the ages of 14 and 18 years. In the early stages, clients often deny having a negative body image or anxiety regarding their appearance. They are pleased with their ability to control their weight and may express this. When they initially come for treatment, they may be unable to identify or to explain their emotions about life events such as school or relationships with family or friends. A profound sense of</p>
<p>872</p>
<p>emptiness is common.</p>
<p>As the illness progresses, depression and lability in mood become more apparent. As dieting and compulsive behaviors increase, clients isolate themselves. This social isolation can lead to a basic mistrust of others and even paranoia. Clients may believe their peers are jealous of their weight loss and may believe that family and health care professionals are trying to make them "fat and ugly."</p>

Compared to the general population, clients with anorexia are six times more likely to die from medical complications or suicide. Clients with the lowest body weights and longest durations of illness tended to relapse most often and have the poorest outcomes. Clients who abuse laxatives are at a higher risk for medical complications. Table 20.2 lists common medical complications of eating disorders.</p>

<p>Clients with anorexia nervosa can be difficult to treat because they are often resistant, appear uninterested, and deny their problems. Treatment settings include inpatient specialty eating disorder units, partial hospitalization or day treatment programs, and outpatient therapy. The choice of setting depends on the severity of the illness, such as weight loss, physical symptoms, duration of binging and purging, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, and comorbid psychiatric conditions. Major life-threatening complications that indicate the need for hospital admission include severe fluid, electrolyte, and metabolic imbalances; cardiovascular complications; severe weight loss and its consequences; and risk for suicide. Short hospital stays are most effective for clients who are amenable to weight gain and who gain weight rapidly while hospitalized. Longer inpatient stays are required for those who gain weight more slowly and are more resistant to gaining additional weight. Outpatient therapy has the best success with clients who have been ill for fewer than 6 months, are not binging and purging, and have parents likely to participate effectively in family therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can also be effective in preventing relapse and improving overall outcomes (Costa &amp; Melnik, 2016).</p>

<p>Medical management focuses on weight restoration, nutritional rehabilitation, rehydration, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Clients receive nutritionally balanced meals and snacks that gradually increase caloric intake to a normal level for size, age, and activity. Severely malnourished clients may require total parenteral nutrition, tube feedings, or hyperalimentation to receive adequate nutritional intake. Generally, access to a bathroom is supervised to prevent purging as clients begin to eat more food. Weight gain and adequate food intake are most often the criteria for determining the effectiveness of treatment.</p>

<p>Several classes of drugs have been studied, but few have shown clinical success. Amitriptyline (Elavil) and the antihistamine cyproheptadine (Periactin) in high doses (up to 28 mg/day) can promote weight gain in inpatients with anorexia nervosa. Olanzapine (Zyprexa) has been used with success because of its antipsychotic effect (on bizarre body image distortions) and associated weight gain. Fluoxetine (Prozac) has some effectiveness in preventing relapse in clients whose weight has been partially or completely restored (Davis &amp; Attia, 2017); however, close monitoring is needed because weight loss can be a side effect.</p>

<p><strong>CLINICAL VIGNETTE: Anorexia Nervosa</strong></p>
<p>Maggie, 15 years old, is 5 ft 7 in tall and weighs 92 lb. Though it is August, she is wearing sweatpants and three layers of shirts. Her hair is dry, brittle, and uncombed, and she wears no makeup. Maggie’s family physician has referred her to the eating disorders unit because she has lost 20 lb in the past 4 months and her menstrual periods have ceased. She is also lethargic and weak, but has trouble sleeping. Maggie is an avid ballet student and believes she still needs to lose more weight to achieve the figure she wants. Her ballet instructor has expressed concern to Maggie’s parents about her appearance and fatigue.</p>
<p>Maggie’s family reports that she has gone from being an A and B student to barely passing in school. She spends much of her time isolated in her room and is often exercising for long hours, even in the middle of the night. Maggie seldom goes out with friends, and they have stopped calling her. The nurse interviews Maggie but gains little information as Maggie is reluctant to discuss her eating. Maggie does say she is too fat and has no interest in gaining weight. She does not understand why her parents are forcing her to come to “this place where all they want to do is fatten you up and keep you ugly.”</p>

<p>Family therapy may be beneficial for families of clients younger than 18 years. Families who demonstrate enmeshment, unclear boundaries among members, and difficulty handling emotions and conflict can begin to resolve these issues and improve communication. Family therapy is also useful to help members be effective participants in the client’s treatment. Family-based</p>
<p>early intervention can prevent future exacerbation of anorexia when families are able to participate in an effective manner. However, in a dysfunctional family, significant improvements in family functioning may take 2 years or more.</p>
<p>Individual therapy for clients with anorexia nervosa may be indicated in some circumstances; for example, if the family cannot participate in family therapy, if the client is older or separated from the nuclear family, or if the client has individual issues requiring psychotherapy. Therapy that focuses on the client's particular issues and circumstances, such as coping skills, self-esteem, self-acceptance, interpersonal relationships, and assertiveness, can improve overall functioning and life satisfaction. CBT, long used with clients with bulimia, has been adapted for adolescents with anorexia nervosa and used successfully for initial treatment as well as relapse prevention. Enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-E) has been even more successful than CBT. In addition to addressing the body image disturbance and dissatisfaction, CBT-E addresses perfectionism, mood intolerance, low self-esteem, and interpersonal difficulties (Calugi, El Ghoch, &amp; Dalle Grave, 2017).</p>

<p>Bulimia nervosa usually begins in late adolescence or early adulthood; 18 or 19 years is the typical age of onset. Binge eating frequently begins during or after dieting. Between binging and purging episodes, clients may eat restrictively, choosing salads and other low-calorie foods. This restrictive eating effectively sets them up for the next episode of binging and purging, and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>Clients with bulimia are aware that their eating behavior is pathologic, and they go to great lengths to hide it from others. They may store food in their cars, desks, or secret locations around the house. They may drive from one fast-food restaurant to another, ordering a normal amount of food at each but stopping at six places in 1 or 2 hours. Such patterns may exist for years until family or friends discover the client's behavior or until medical complications develop for which the client seeks treatment.</p>
<p>Follow-up studies of clients with bulimia show that as many as 25% or more are untreated. Clients with bulimia had 45% full recovery, while 23%</p>
<p>876</p>
<p>remained chronically ill (Call et al., 2017). One-third of fully recovered clients relapse. Clients with a comorbid personality disorder tend to have poorer outcomes than those without. The death rate from bulimia is estimated at 3% or less.</p>
<p>Most clients with bulimia are treated on an outpatient basis. Hospital admission is indicated if binging and purging behaviors are out of control and the client's medical status is compromised. Most clients with bulimia have near-normal weight, which reduces the concern about severe malnutrition, a factor in clients with anorexia nervosa.</p>

<p>CBT has been found to be the most effective treatment for bulimia. This outpatient approach often requires a detailed manual to guide treatment. Strategies designed to change the client's thinking (cognition) and actions (behavior) about food focus on interrupting the cycle of dieting, binging, and purging and altering dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs about food, weight, body image, and overall self-concept. Web-based CBT, including face time with a therapist, has been effective as well as traditionally delivered CBT. Smartphone applications (apps) for eating disorder self-management are also promising and highly acceptable to user groups (Kim et al., 2018).</p>

<p>Since the 1980s, many studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of medications, primarily antidepressants, to treat bulimia. Drugs, such as desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Tofranil), amitriptyline (Elavil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), phenelzine (Nardil), and fluoxetine (Prozac), were prescribed in the same dosages used to treat depression (see Chapter 2). In all the studies, the antidepressants were more effective than were the placebos in reducing binge eating. They also improved mood and reduced preoccupation with shape and weight; however, most of the positive results were short term. It may be that the primary contribution of medications is treating the comorbid disorders frequently seen with bulimia.</p>

<p>Several specialized tests have been developed for eating disorders. An assessment tool such as the Eating Attitudes Test (Box 20.2) is often used in studies of anorexia and bulimia. This test can also be used at the end of treatment to evaluate outcomes because it is sensitive to clinical changes.</p>

<p>Family members often describe clients with anorexia nervosa as</p>
<p>perfectionists with above-average intelligence who are achievement-oriented, dependable, eager to please, and seeking approval before onset of the condition. Parents describe clients as being “good, causing us no trouble” until the onset of anorexia. Likewise, clients with bulimia are often focused on pleasing others and avoiding conflict. Clients with bulimia, however, often have a history of impulsive behavior such as substance abuse and shoplifting as well as anxiety, depression, and personality disorders (Schultz &amp; Videbeck, 2013).</p>

<p>Clients with anorexia appear slow, lethargic, and fatigued; they may be emaciated, depending on the amount of weight loss. They may be slow to respond to questions and have difficulty deciding what to say. They are often reluctant to answer questions fully because they do not want to acknowledge any problem. They often wear loose-fitting clothes in layers, regardless of the weather, both to hide weight loss and to keep warm (clients with anorexia are generally cold). Eye contact may be limited. Clients may turn away from the nurse, indicating their unwillingness to discuss problems or to enter treatment.</p>
<p>Clients with bulimia may be underweight or overweight but are generally close to expected body weight for age and size. General appearance is not unusual, and they appear open and willing to talk.</p>

<p>Clients with eating disorders have labile moods that usually correspond to their eating or dieting behaviors. Avoiding “bad” or fattening foods gives them a sense of power and control over their bodies, while eating, binging, or purging leads to anxiety, depression, and feeling out of control. Clients with eating disorders often seem sad, anxious, and worried. Those with anorexia seldom smile, laugh, or enjoy any attempts at humor; they are somber and serious most of the time. In contrast, clients with bulimia are initially pleasant and cheerful as though nothing is wrong. The pleasant façade usually disappears when they begin describing binge eating and purging; they may express intense guilt, shame, and embarrassment.</p>

<p>Susan is driving home from the grocery store and eating from the grocery bags as she drives. In the 15-minute trip, she has already</p>
<p>880</p>
<p>consumed a package of cookies, a large bag of potato chips, and a pound of ham from the deli. She thinks, "I have to hurry, I'll be home soon. No one can see me like this!" She knew when she bought these food items that they wouldn't make it home.</p>
<p>Susan hurriedly drops the groceries on the kitchen counter and races for the bathroom. Tears are streaming down her face as she vomits to get rid of what she has just eaten. She feels guilty and ashamed and does not understand why she cannot stop her behavior. If only she did not eat those things. She thinks, "I'm 30 years old, married with two beautiful daughters, and a successful interior design consultant. What would my clients say if they could see me now? If my husband and daughters saw me, they would be disgusted." As Susan leaves the bathroom to put away the remainder of the groceries, she promises herself to stay away from all those bad foods. If she just does not eat them, this won't happen. This is a promise she has made to herself many times before.</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Nursing Interventions</th><th>Rationale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ask the client directly about thoughts of suicide or self-harm.</td><td>The client's safety is a priority. You will not give the client ideas about suicide by addressing the issue directly.</td></tr><tr><td>Set limits with the client about eating habits (e.g., food will be eaten in a dining room setting, at a table, only at conventional mealtimes).</td><td>Limits will discourage binge behavior, such as hiding, sneaking, and gulping food, and help the client return to normal eating patterns. Eating three meals a day will prevent starvation and subsequent overeating in the evening.</td></tr><tr><td>Encourage the client to eat with other clients when tolerated.</td><td>Eating with other people will discourage secrecy about eating, though initially the client's anxiety may be too high to join others at mealtime.</td></tr><tr><td>Encourage the client to express feelings, such as anxiety and guilt about having eaten.</td><td>Expressing feelings can help decrease the client's anxiety and the urge to engage in purging behaviors.</td></tr><tr><td>Encourage the client to use a diary to write types and amounts of foods eaten and feelings that occur before, during, and after eating, especially related to urges to engage in binge or purge behaviors.</td><td>A diary can help the client explore food intake, feelings, and relationships among these feelings and behaviors.

<p>It is important to ask clients with eating disorders about thoughts of self-harm or suicide. It is not uncommon for these clients to engage in self-mutilating behaviors, such as cutting. Concern about self-harm and suicidal behavior should increase when clients have a history of sexual abuse (see Chapters 12, 13, and 17).</p>
<p><strong>Thought Processes and Content</strong></p>
<p>Clients with eating disorders spend most of the time thinking about</p>
<p>dieting, food, and food-related behavior. They are preoccupied with their attempts to avoid eating or eating "bad" or "wrong" foods. Clients cannot think about themselves without thinking about weight and food. The body image disturbance can be almost delusional; even if clients are severely underweight, they can point to areas on their buttocks or thighs that are "still fat," thereby fueling their need to continue dieting. Clients with anorexia who are severely underweight may have paranoid ideas about their family and health care professionals, believing they are their "enemies" who are trying to make them fat by forcing them to eat.</p>

<p>Generally, clients with eating disorders are alert and oriented; their intellectual functions are intact. The exception is clients with anorexia who are severely malnourished and showing signs of starvation, such as mild confusion, slowed mental processes, and difficulty with concentration and attention.</p>

<p>Clients with anorexia have limited insight and poor judgment about their health status. They do not believe they have a problem; rather, they believe others are trying to interfere with their ability to lose weight and to achieve the desired body image. Facts about failing health status are not enough to convince these clients of their true problems. Clients with anorexia continue to restrict food intake or to engage in purging despite the negative effect on health.</p>
<p>In contrast, clients with bulimia are ashamed of the binge eating and purging. They recognize these behaviors as abnormal and go to great lengths to hide them. They feel out of control and unable to change, even though they recognize their behaviors as pathologic.</p>

<p>Low self-esteem is prominent in clients with eating disorders. They see themselves only in terms of their ability to control their food intake and weight. They tend to judge themselves harshly and see themselves as "bad" if they eat certain foods or fail to lose weight. They overlook or ignore other personal characteristics or achievements as less important than thinness. Clients often perceive themselves as helpless, powerless, and ineffective. This feeling of lack of control over themselves and their environment only strengthens their desire to control their weight.</p>

<p>Eating disorders interfere with the ability to fulfill roles and to have satisfying relationships. Clients with anorexia may begin to fail at school, which is in sharp contrast to previously successful academic performance. They withdraw from peers and pay little attention to friendships. They believe that others will not understand, or fear that they will begin out-of-control eating with others.</p>
<p>Clients with bulimia feel great shame about their binge eating and purging behaviors. As a result, they tend to lead secret lives that include sneaking behind the backs of friends and family to binge and purge in privacy. The time spent buying and eating food and then purging can interfere with role performance both at home and at work.</p>

<p>The health status of clients with eating disorders relates directly to the severity of self-starvation or purging behaviors or both (see Table 20.2). In addition, clients may exercise excessively, almost to the point of exhaustion, in an effort to control weight. Many clients have sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, reduced sleep time, and early-morning wakening. Those who frequently vomit have many dental problems, such as loss of tooth enamel, chipped and ragged teeth, and dental caries. Frequent vomiting may also result in mouth sores. Complete medical and dental examinations are essential.</p>

<p>Examples of expected outcomes for clients with eating disorders include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client will establish adequate nutritional eating patterns.</li>
<li>The client will eliminate use of compensatory behaviors such as excessive exercise and use of laxatives and diuretics.</li>
<li>The client will demonstrate coping mechanisms not related to food.</li>
<li>The client will verbalize feelings of guilt, anger, anxiety, or an excessive need for control.</li>

<p>Typically, inpatient treatment is for clients with anorexia nervosa who are severely malnourished and for clients with bulimia whose binge eating and purging behaviors are out of control. Primary nursing roles are to implement and supervise the regimen for nutritional rehabilitation. Total parenteral nutrition or enteral feedings may be prescribed initially when a client's health status is severely compromised.</p>
<p>When clients can eat, a diet of 1,200 to 1,500 calories/day is ordered, with gradual increases in calories until clients are ingesting adequate amounts for height, activity level, and growth needs. Typically, allotted calories are divided into three meals and three snacks. A liquid protein supplement is given to replace any food not eaten to ensure consumption of the total number of prescribed calories. The nurse is responsible for monitoring meals and snacks and often initially will sit with a client during eating at a table away from other clients. Depending on the treatment program, diet beverages and food substitutions may be prohibited, and a specified time may be set for consuming each meal or snack. Clients may also be discouraged from performing food rituals such</p>
<p>as cutting food into tiny pieces or mixing food in unusual combinations. The nurse must be alert for any attempts by clients to hide or to discard food.</p>
<p>After each meal or snack, clients may be required to remain in view of staff for 1 to 2 hours to ensure they do not empty the stomach by vomiting. Some treatment programs limit client access to bathrooms without supervision, particularly after meals, to discourage vomiting. As clients begin to gain weight and become more independent in eating behavior, these restrictions are reduced gradually.</p>
<p>In most treatment programs, clients are weighed only once daily, usually upon awakening and after they have emptied the bladder. Clients should wear minimal clothing, such as a hospital gown, each time they are weighed. They may attempt to place objects in their clothing to give the appearance of weight gain.</p>
<p>Clients with bulimia are often treated on an outpatient basis. The nurse must work closely with clients to establish normal eating patterns and to interrupt the binge-and-purge cycle. He or she encourages clients to eat meals with their families or if they live alone, with friends. Clients should always sit at a table in a designated eating area, such as a kitchen or dining room. It is easier for clients to follow a nutritious eating plan if it is written in advance and groceries are purchased for the planned menus. Clients must avoid buying foods frequently consumed during binges, such as cookies, candy bars, and potato chips. They should discard or move to the kitchen food that was kept at work, in the car, or in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Because clients with anorexia have problems with self-awareness, they often have difficulty identifying and expressing feelings (alexithymia). Therefore, they often express these feelings in terms of somatic complaints, such as feeling fat or bloated. The nurse can help clients begin to recognize emotions such as anxiety or guilt by asking them to describe how they are feeling and allowing adequate time for response. The nurse should not ask, "Are you sad?" or "Are you anxious?" because a client may quickly agree rather than struggle for an answer. The nurse encourages the client to describe his or her feelings. This approach can eventually help clients recognize their emotions and connect them to their eating behaviors.</p>

<p>Self-monitoring is a cognitive-behavioral technique designed to help clients with bulimia. It may help clients identify behavior patterns and then implement techniques to avoid or replace them (Richards, Shingleton, Goldman, Siegel, &amp; Thompson-Brenner, 2016). Self-monitoring techniques raise client awareness about behavior and help them regain a sense of control. The nurse encourages clients to keep a diary of all food eaten throughout the day, including binges, and to record moods, emotions, thoughts, circumstances, and interactions surrounding eating and binging or purging episodes. In this way, clients begin to see connections between emotions and situations and eating behaviors. The nurse can then help clients develop ways to manage emotions, such as anxiety, using relaxation techniques or distraction with music or another</p>
<p>890</p>
<p>activity. This is an important step toward helping clients find ways to cope with people, emotions, or situations that do not involve food.</p>

<p>The nurse can help clients accept a more normal body image. This may involve clients agreeing to weigh more than they would like, to be healthy, and to stay out of the hospital. When clients experience relief from emotional distress, have increased self-esteem, and can meet their emotional needs in healthy ways, they are more likely to accept their weight and body image.</p>
<p>891</p>
<p>The nurse can also help clients view themselves in terms other than weight, size, shape, and satisfaction with body image. Helping clients to identify areas of personal strength that are not food-related broadens clients' perceptions of themselves. This includes identifying talents, interests, and positive aspects of character unrelated to body shape or size.</p>

<p>One primary nursing role in caring for clients with eating disorders is providing education to help them take control of nutritional requirements independently. This teaching can be done in the inpatient setting during discharge planning or in the outpatient setting. The nurse provides extensive teaching about basic nutritional needs and the effects of restrictive eating, dieting, and the binge-and-purge cycle. Clients need encouragement to set realistic goals for eating throughout the day. Eating only salads and vegetables during the day may set up clients for later binges as a result of too little dietary fat and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>For clients who purge, the most important goal is to stop. Teaching should include information about the harmful effects of purging by vomiting and laxative abuse. The nurse explains that purging is an ineffective means of weight control and only disrupts the neuroendocrine system. In addition, purging promotes binge eating by decreasing the anxiety that follows the binge. The nurse explains that if clients can avoid purging, they may be less likely to engage in binge eating. The nurse also teaches the techniques of distraction and delay because they are useful against both binging and purging. The longer clients can delay either binging or purging, the less likely they are to carry out the behavior.</p>

<p>The nurse can use assessment tools such as the Eating Attitudes Test to detect improvement for clients with eating disorders. Both anorexia and bulimia are chronic for many clients. Residual symptoms such as dieting, compulsive exercising, and experiencing discomfort when eating in a social setting are common. Treatment is considered successful if the client maintains a body weight within 5% to 10% of normal with no medical complications from starvation or purging.</p>

<p>Treatment for clients with eating disorders usually occurs in community settings. Hospital admission is indicated only for medical necessity, such as for clients with dangerously low weight, electrolyte imbalances, or renal, cardiac, or hepatic complications. Clients who cannot control the cycle of binge eating and purging may be treated briefly in an inpatient setting. Other treatment settings include partial hospitalization or day treatment programs, individual or group outpatient therapy, and self-help groups.</p>

<p>Nurses can educate parents, children, and young people about strategies to prevent eating disorders. Important aspects include realizing that the "ideal" figures portrayed in advertisements and magazines are unrealistic, developing realistic ideas about body size and shape, resisting peer pressure to diet,</p>
<p>893</p>
<p>improving self-esteem, and learning coping strategies for dealing with emotions and life issues.</p>
<p>Healthy People 2020 (see Chapter 1) includes an objective to increase comprehensive school education for a variety of topics, including unhealthy dietary patterns and inadequate physical injury. This is in response to the increasing epidemic of obesity in the United States, including young children and adolescents.</p>

<p>The National Eating Disorders Association (2018) provides the following suggestions to promote positive body image:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get rid of the notion that a particular diet, weight, or body size will automatically lead to happiness and fulfillment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn everything you can about anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and other types of eating disorders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the choice to challenge the false idea that thinness and weight loss are great and that body fat and weight gain are horrible or indicate laziness, worthlessness, or immorality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid categorizing foods as "good/safe" versus "bad/dangerous." Remember that we all need to eat a balanced variety of foods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop judging yourself and others based on body weight or shape. Turn off the voices in your head that tell you that a person’s body weight is an indicator of their character, personality, or value as a person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit time on social media. Don’t read or listen to others’ negative comments. Surround yourself with positive, supportive, real people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become a critical viewer of the media and its messages about self-esteem and body image. Don’t accept that the images that you see are the ideals you should try to attain. Choose to value yourself based on your goals, accomplishments, talents, and character. Avoid letting the way you feel about your body weight and shape determine the course of your day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>School nurses, student health nurses at colleges and universities, and nurses in clinics and doctors’ offices may encounter clients in various settings who are at risk for developing or who already have an eating disorder. In these settings, early identification and appropriate referral are primary responsibilities of the nurse. Routine screening of all young women in these settings would help identify those at risk for an eating disorder. Box 20.3 contains a sample of questions that can be used for such screening. Such early identification could result in early intervention and prevention of a full-blown eating disorder.</p>

<p>Family-based therapy, which uses family resources, is an effective intervention for both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. It is a</p>
<p>899</p>
<p>behaviorally based intervention for adolescents and their families. Its results have been superior to other types of family therapy.</p>
<p>The next step is to adopt the family-based therapy model and provide treatment to adolescents and their families as soon as an eating disorder is diagnosed. Using a proven, evidence-based therapy is the best practice, as is treating the disorders while the client is an adolescent.</p>

<p>An emaciated, starving client with anorexia can be a shocking sight, and the nurse may want to “take care of this child” and nurse her back to health. When the client rejects this help and resists the nurse’s caring actions, the nurse can become angry and frustrated and feel incompetent in handling the situation.</p>
<p>The client initially may view the nurse, who is responsible for making the client eat, as the enemy. The client may hide or throw away food or become overtly hostile as anxiety about eating increases. The nurse must remember that the client’s behavior is a symptom of anxiety and fear about gaining weight and not personally directed toward the nurse. Taking the client’s behavior personally may cause the nurse to feel angry and behave in a rejecting manner.</p>
<p>Because eating is such a basic part of everyday life, the nurse may wonder why the client cannot just eat “like everyone else.” The nurse may also find it difficult to understand how a 75-lb client sees herself as fat when she looks in the mirror. Likewise, when working with a client who binges and purges, the nurse may wonder why the client cannot exert the willpower to stop. The nurse must remember that the client’s eating behavior has gotten out of control. Eating disorders are mental illnesses, just like schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder.</p>

<li>Be empathetic and nonjudgmental, though this is not easy. Remember the client’s perspective and fears about weight and eating.</li>
<li>Avoid sounding parental when teaching about nutrition or why laxative use is harmful. Presenting information factually without chiding the client will obtain more positive results.</li>
<li>Do not label clients as “good” when they avoid purging or eat an entire meal. Otherwise, clients will believe they are “bad” on days when they purge or fail to eat enough food.</li>

<li>Anorexia nervosa is a life-threatening eating disorder characterized by body weight less than below minimum expectations, an intense fear of being fat, a severely distorted body image, and refusal to eat or binge eating and purging.</li>
<li>Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder that involves recurrent episodes of binge eating and compensatory behaviors such as purging, using laxatives and diuretics, or exercising excessively.</li>
<li>Of clients with eating disorders, 90% are females. Anorexia begins between the ages of 14 and 18 years, and bulimia begins around age 18 or 19.</li>
<li>Many neurochemical changes are present in individuals with eating</li>
</ul>
<p>disorders, but it is uncertain whether these changes cause or are a result of the eating disorders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals with eating disorders feel unattractive and ineffective and may be poorly equipped to deal with the challenges of maturity.</li>
<li>Societal attitudes regarding thinness, beauty, desirability, and physical fitness may influence the development of eating disorders.</li>
<li>Severely malnourished clients with anorexia nervosa may require intensive medical treatment to restore homeostasis before psychiatric treatment can begin.</li>
<li>Family therapy is effective for clients with anorexia; CBT is most effective for clients with bulimia.</li>
<li>Interventions for clients with eating disorders include establishing nutritional eating patterns, helping the client identify emotions and develop coping strategies not related to food, helping the client deal with body image issues, and providing client and family education.</li>
<li>Focus on healthy eating and pleasurable physical exercise; avoid fad or stringent dieting.</li>
<li>Parents must become aware of their own behavior and attitudes and the way they influence children.</li>

<p>In the early 1800s, the medical field began to consider the various social and psychological factors that influence illness. The term <strong>psychosomatic</strong> began to be used to convey the connection between the mind (<em>psyche</em>) and the body (<em>soma</em>) in states of health and illness. Essentially, the mind can cause the body either to create physical symptoms or to worsen physical illnesses. Real symptoms can begin, continue, or be worsened as a result of emotional factors. Examples include diabetes, hypertension, and colitis, all of which are medical illnesses influenced by stress and emotions. When a person is under a lot of stress or is not coping well with stress, symptoms of these medical illnesses worsen. In addition, stress can cause physical symptoms unrelated to a diagnosed medical illness. After a stressful day at work, many people experience “tension headaches” that can be quite painful. The headaches are a manifestation of stress rather than a symptom of an underlying medical problem.</p>
<p>The term <strong>hysteria</strong> refers to multiple physical complaints with no organic basis; the complaints are usually described dramatically. The concept of hysteria is believed to have originated in Egypt and is about 4,000 years old. In the Middle Ages, hysteria was associated with witchcraft, demons, and sorcerers. People with hysteria, usually women, were considered evil or possessed by evil spirits. Paul Briquet and Jean-Martin Charcot, both French physicians, identified hysteria as a disorder of the nervous system.</p>

<p>Sigmund Freud, working with Charcot, observed that people with hysteria improved with hypnosis and experienced relief from their physical symptoms when they recalled memories and expressed emotions. This development led Freud to propose that people can convert unexpressed emotions into physical symptoms, a process now referred to as somatization (Esobar &amp; Dimsdale, 2017). This chapter discusses somatic symptom illnesses, or somatoform disorders, which are based on the concept of somatization.</p>

<p>Somatization is defined as the transference of mental experiences and states</p>
<p>into bodily symptoms. Somatic symptom illnesses can be characterized as the presence of physical symptoms that suggest a medical condition without a demonstrable organic basis to account fully for them. The three central features of somatic symptom illnesses are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical complaints suggest major medical illness but have no demonstrable organic basis.</li>
<li>Psychological factors and conflicts seem important in initiating, exacerbating, and maintaining the symptoms.</li>
<li>Symptoms or magnified health concerns are not under the client’s conscious control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients are convinced they harbor serious physical problems despite negative results during diagnostic testing. They actually experience these physical symptoms as well as the accompanying pain, distress, and functional limitations such symptoms induce. Clients do not willfully control the physical symptoms. Although their illnesses are psychiatric in nature, many clients do not seek help from mental health professionals. Unfortunately, many health care professionals who do not understand the nature of somatic symptom illnesses are not sympathetic to these clients’ complaints (Black &amp; Andreasen, 2016). Nurses must remember that these clients really experience the symptoms they describe and cannot voluntarily control them.</p>
<p>Somatic symptom disorders include (Esobar &amp; Dimsdale, 2017):</p>
<ul>
<li>Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by one or more physical symptoms that have no organic basis. Individuals spend a lot of time and energy focused on health concerns, often believe symptoms to be indicative of serious illness, and experience significant distress and anxiety about their health.</li>
<li>Conversion disorder, sometimes called conversion reaction, involves unexplained, usually sudden deficits in sensory or motor function (e.g., blindness, paralysis). These deficits suggest a neurologic disorder but are associated with psychological factors. There is usually significant functional impairment. There may be an attitude of <em>la belle indifférence</em>, a seeming lack of concern or distress, about the functional loss.</li>
<li>Pain disorder has the primary physical symptom of pain, which is generally unrelieved by analgesics and greatly affected by psychological factors in terms of onset, severity, exacerbation, and maintenance.</li>
<li>Illness anxiety disorder, formerly hypochondriasis, is preoccupation with the fear that one has a serious disease (<em>disease conviction</em>) or will get a serious disease (<em>disease phobia</em>). It is thought that clients with this disorder misinterpret bodily sensations or functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Somatic symptom illnesses are more common in women than in men; they may represent about 5% to 7% of the general population, but estimates can vary greatly. Because most people with illness anxiety are seen in general medical or family practice settings, it is difficult to make accurate estimates of occurrence. Reports of pain are one of the most common complaints in medical practice, and it is difficult to distinguish physical from psychological causation.</p>

<p>Clients with somatic symptom disorder often experience symptoms in adolescence, though these diagnoses may not be made until early adulthood (about 25 years of age). Conversion disorder usually occurs between the ages of 10 and 35 years. Pain disorder and illness anxiety disorder can occur at any age.</p>
<p>All somatic symptom illnesses are either chronic or recurrent, lasting for decades for many people. Clients with somatic symptom illness and conversion disorder most likely seek help from mental health professionals after they have exhausted efforts at finding a diagnosed medical condition. Clients with illness anxiety, or pain disorder, are unlikely to receive treatment in mental health settings unless they have a comorbid condition. Clients with somatic symptom illnesses tend to go from one physician or clinic to another, or they may see multiple providers at once in an effort to obtain relief of symptoms. They tend to be pessimistic about the medical establishment and often believe their disease could be diagnosed if providers were more competent.</p>

<p>Matthew, 13 years old, has just been transferred from a medical unit to the adolescent psychiatric unit. He had been on the medical unit for 3 days, undergoing extensive tests to determine the cause of a sudden onset of blindness. No organic pathology was discovered, and Matthew was diagnosed with a conversion disorder.</p>
<p>As the nurse interviews Matthew, she notices that he is calm and speaks of his inability to see in a matter-of-fact manner, demonstrating no distress at his blindness. Matthew seems to have the usual interests of a 13-year-</p>
<p>old, describing his activities at school and with his friends. However, the nurse finds that Matthew has little to say about his parents, his younger brother, or activities at home.</p>
<p>Later, the nurse has a chance to talk with Matthew’s mother when she comes to the unit after work. Soon, Matthew’s mother is crying, telling the nurse that her husband has a drinking problem and has been increasingly violent at home. She admitted that 2 days before Matthew’s symptoms developed, Matthew witnessed one of his father’s rages, which included breaking furniture and hitting her. When Matthew tried to help his mother, his father called him spineless and worthless and told him to go to the basement and stay there. The nurse understands that the violence Matthew has witnessed and his inability to change the situation may be the triggering event for his conversion disorder.</p>

<p>Somatic symptom illnesses need to be distinguished from other body-related mental disorders such as malingering and factitious disorders, also known as fabricated or induced illness, in which people feign or intentionally produce symptoms for some purpose or gain. In malingering and factitious disorders, people willfully control the symptoms. In somatic symptom illnesses, clients do not voluntarily control their physical symptoms.</p>
<p>Malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms; it is motivated by external incentives such as avoiding work, evading criminal prosecution, obtaining financial compensation, or obtaining drugs. People who malinger have no real physical symptoms or grossly exaggerate relatively minor symptoms. Their purpose is some external incentive or outcome that they view as important and results directly from the illness. People who malinger can stop the physical symptoms as soon as they have gained what they wanted (Bass &amp; Wade, 2019).</p>
<p>Factitious disorder, imposed on self, occurs when a person intentionally produces or feigns physical or psychological symptoms solely to gain attention. People with factitious disorder may even inflict injury on themselves to receive attention. The common term for factitious disorder imposed on self is <strong>Munchausen syndrome</strong> (Quinn, Wang, Powsner, &amp; Eisendrath, 2017). A variation of factitious disorder, imposed on others, is commonly called <strong>Munchausen syndrome by proxy</strong>, and occurs when a</p>
<p>914</p>
<p>person inflicts illness or injury on someone else to gain the attention of emergency medical personnel or to be a “hero” for saving the victim. An example would be a nurse who gives excess intravenous potassium to a client and then “saves his life” by performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Although factitious disorders are uncommon, they occur most often in people who are in or are familiar with medical professions, such as nurses, physicians, medical technicians, or hospital volunteers. People who injure clients or their children through Munchausen syndrome by proxy generally are arrested and prosecuted in the legal system. Factitious disorders are also called fabricated or induced illnesses.</p>

<p>Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) and functional somatic syndromes are terms used more frequently in general medical setting. They refer to physical symptoms and limitations of function that has no medical diagnoses to explain their existence. There is overlap between these terms and somatic disorders diagnosed in mental health settings (Esobar &amp; Dimsdale, 2017). MUS is often more acceptable to the patient because it doesn't have the connotation of "it's all in your head" as do psychosomatic descriptors. Many patients are seen by general practitioners and are not involved in mental health settings. Effective treatment from patients' perspectives includes being listened to and heard regarding symptoms, learning to cope with symptoms and limitations, learning to ignore some symptoms when possible, and positive response and support from providers (Sowinska &amp; Czachowski, 2018).</p>

<p>Psychosocial theorists believe that people with somatic symptom illnesses keep stress, anxiety, or frustration inside rather than expressing them outwardly. This is called internalization. Clients express these internalized feelings and stress through physical symptoms (somatization). Both</p>
<p>internalization and somatization are unconscious defense mechanisms. Clients are not consciously aware of the process, and they do not voluntarily control it.</p>
<p>People with somatic symptom illnesses do not readily and directly express their feelings and emotions verbally. Some experience alexithymia, or the inability to identify emotions. This is different than an unwillingness or refusal to identify emotions. They have tremendous difficulty dealing with interpersonal conflict. When placed in situations involving conflict or emotional stress, their physical symptoms appear to worsen. The worsening of physical symptoms helps them meet psychological needs for security, attention, and affection through primary and secondary gain. Primary gains are the direct internal benefits that being sick provides, such as relief of anxiety, conflict, or distress. Secondary gains are the external or personal benefits received from others because one is sick, such as attention from family members and comfort measures (e.g., being brought tea, receiving a back rub). The person soon learns that he or she "needs to be sick" to have his or her emotional needs met.</p>
<p>Somatization is associated most often with women, as evidenced by the old term hysteria (Greek for "wandering uterus"). Ancient theorists believed that unexplained female pains resulted from migration of the uterus throughout the woman's body. Psychosocial theorists posit that increased incidence of somatization in women may be related to various factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boys in the United States are taught to be stoic and to "take it like a man," causing them to offer fewer physical complaints as adults.</li>
<li>Women seek medical treatment more often than men, and it is more socially acceptable for them to do so.</li>
<li>Childhood sexual abuse, which is related to somatization, happens more frequently to girls.</li>
<li>Women more often receive treatment for psychiatric disorders with strong somatic components such as depression.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research has shown differences in the way clients with somatoform disorders regulate and interpret stimuli. These clients cannot sort relevant from irrelevant stimuli and respond equally to both types. In other words, they may experience a normal body sensation such as peristalsis and attach a pathologic rather than a normal meaning to it. Too little inhibition of sensory input amplifies awareness of physical symptoms and exaggerates response to bodily</p>
<p>919</p>
<p>sensations. For example, minor discomfort such as muscle tightness becomes amplified because of the client's concern and attention to the tightness. This amplified sensory awareness causes the person to experience somatic sensations as more intense, noxious, and disturbing (Black &amp; Andreasen, 2016). Research has shown that visceral hypersensitivity is associated with the severity of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in large cohorts of patients with functional GI disorders in a variety of settings (Simren et al., 2018).</p>

<p>The type and frequency of somatic symptoms and their meaning may vary across cultures. Pseudoneurologic symptoms of somatization disorder in Africa and South Asia include burning hands and feet and the nondelusional sensation of worms in the head or ants under the skin. Symptoms related to male reproduction are more common in some countries or cultures—for example, men in India often have dhat, which is a hypochondriacal concern about loss of semen. Somatic symptom disorder is rare in men in the United States but more common in Greece and Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Many cultural concepts of distress have corresponding somatic symptoms not explained by a medical condition (Table 21.1). Koro occurs in Southeast Asia and may be related to body dysmorphic disorder. It is characterized by the belief that the penis is shrinking and will disappear into the abdomen, causing the man to die. Falling-out episodes, found in the southern United States and the Caribbean islands, are characterized by a sudden collapse during which the person cannot see or move. Hwa-Byung is a Korean folk syndrome attributed to the suppression of anger and includes insomnia, fatigue, panic, indigestion, and generalized aches and pains. Sangue dormido (sleeping blood) occurs among Portuguese Cape Verde Islanders who report pain, numbness, tremors, paralysis, seizures, blindness, heart attacks, and miscarriages. Shenjing shuairuo occurs in China and includes physical and mental fatigue, dizziness, headache, pain, sleep disturbance, memory loss, GI problems, and sexual dysfunction (Lewis-Fernandez, Kirmayer, Guarnaccia, &amp; Ruiz, 2017).</p>

<p>The presence of a host of somatic symptoms can also be associated with other diagnoses. Zhao and colleagues (2018) found that patients in China diagnosed with major depression sought treatment in various medical settings. They reported experiencing insomnia, weight loss, low appetite, circulatory system complaints, headache, hyposexuality, GI complaints, and respiratory system problems.</p>

<p>Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. The health care provider must show empathy and sensitivity to the client's physical complaints. A trusting relationship helps ensure clients stay with and receive care from one provider instead of "doctor shopping."</p>
<p>For many clients, depression and anxiety may accompany or result from somatic symptom illnesses. Thus, antidepressants help in some cases (Strohle, Gensichen, &amp; Domschke, 2018). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and paroxetine (Paxil) are most commonly used (Table 21.2).</p>

<p>For clients with pain disorder, referral to a chronic pain clinic may be useful. Clients learn methods of pain management, such as visual imaging and relaxation. Services such as physical therapy to maintain and build muscle tone help improve functional abilities. Providers should avoid prescribing and administering narcotic analgesics to these clients because of the risk for dependence or abuse. Clients can use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents to help reduce pain.</p>
<p>Involvement in therapy groups is beneficial for some people with somatic symptom illnesses. Clients with somatic symptom disorder and anxiety illness disorder who participated in a structured cognitive-behavioral group showed evidence of improved physical and emotional health. The overall goals of the group were offering peer support, sharing methods of coping, and perceiving and expressing emotions. Clients with hypochondriasis who were willing to participate in cognitive-behavioral therapy and take medications were able to alter their erroneous perceptions of threat (of illness) and improve. Cognitive-behavioral therapy also produced significant improvement in clients with somatic symptom disorder (Hedman, Axelsson, Anderson, Lekander, &amp; Ljotsson, 2016).</p>
<p>Education or providing information has also been effective for clients with somatic illness or symptoms. Reading both internet-based educational material and books were other effective therapies (Hedman et al., 2016).</p>
<p>In terms of prognosis, somatic symptom illnesses tend to be chronic or recurrent. With treatment, conversion disorder often remits in a few weeks but recurs in 25% of clients. Somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and pain disorder often last for many years, and clients report being in poor health (Black &amp; Andreasen, 2016).</p>

<p>Clients usually provide a lengthy and detailed account of previous physical problems, numerous diagnostic tests, and perhaps even a number of surgical procedures. It is likely that they have seen multiple health care providers over several years. Clients may express dismay or anger at the medical community with comments such as “They just can’t find out what’s wrong with me” or “They’re all incompetent, and they’re trying to tell me I’m crazy!” The exception may be clients with conversion disorder, who show little emotion when describing physical limitations or lack of a medical diagnosis (la belle indifférence).</p>

<p>Overall appearance is usually not remarkable. Often, clients walk slowly or with an unusual gait because of the pain or disability caused by the symptoms. They may exhibit a facial expression of discomfort or physical distress. In many cases, they brighten and look much better as the assessment interview begins because they have the nurse’s undivided attention. Clients with somatization disorder usually describe their complaints in colorful, exaggerated terms, but often lack specific information.</p>

<p>Mood is often labile, shifting from seeming depressed and sad when describing physical problems to looking bright and excited when talking about how they had to go to the hospital in the middle of the night by ambulance. Emotions are often exaggerated, as are reports of physical symptoms. Clients describing a series of personal crises related to their physical health may appear pleased rather than distressed about these situations. Clients with conversion disorder display an unexpected lack of</p>

<p>Clients who somatize do not experience disordered thought processes. The content of their thinking is primarily about often exaggerated physical concerns; for example, when they have a simple cold, they may be convinced it is pneumonia. They may even talk about dying and what music they want played at their funeral.</p>
<p>Clients are unlikely to be able to think about or respond to questions about emotional feelings. They will answer questions about how they feel in terms of physical health or sensations. For example, the nurse may ask, “How did you feel about having to quit your job?” The client might respond, “Well, I thought I’d feel better with the extra rest, but my back pain was just as bad as ever.”</p>
<p>Clients with illness anxiety disorder focus on the fear of serious illness rather than the existence of illness, as seen in clients with other somatoform disorders. However, they are just as preoccupied with physical concerns as other somatizing clients and are likewise limited in their abilities to identify emotional feelings or interpersonal issues. Clients with hypochondriasis are preoccupied with bodily functions, ruminate about illness, are fascinated with medical information, and have unrealistic fears about potential infection and prescription medication.</p>

<p>Clients focus only on the physical part of themselves. They are unlikely to think about personal characteristics or strengths and are uncomfortable when asked to do so. Clients who somatize have low self-esteem and seem to deal with it by totally focusing on physical concerns. They lack confidence, have little success in work situations, and have difficulty managing daily life issues, which they relate solely to their physical status.</p>

<p>Maude is a 75-year-old, widowed, retired teacher who is admitted for illness anxiety disorder. For the past 18 months, Maude has been evaluated repeatedly by several internists and GI specialists for persistent symptoms of abdominal pain, indigestion, heartburn, and nausea. She is convinced she has cancer of the stomach, even though all test results fail to show any pathology. Despite repeated reassurances from physicians that she is healthy, Maude believes the physicians and clinics are incompetent and thinks her normal lab tests are incorrect. Maude's husband died 2 years ago, and her physical complaints and insistence about having cancer have become markedly worse since then.</p>
<p>In the hospital setting, Maude fumes that she is not a crazy person and denies having any emotional problems. Her grown children report that she has not grieved following their father's death but rather became completely preoccupied with her own health. Maude thinks her children are uncaring and don't want to be bothered with her. She has agreed to this hospitalization just to "prove they don't know what they're talking about."</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Nursing Interventions</th><th>Rationale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The initial nursing assessment should include a complete physical assessment, a history of previous complaints and treatment, and a consideration of each current complaint.</td><td>The nursing assessment provides a baseline from which to begin planning care.</td></tr><tr><td>The nursing staff should note the medical staff’s assessment of each complaint on the client’s admission.</td><td>Genuine physical problems must be noted and treated.</td></tr><tr><td>Each time the client voices a new complaint, the client should be referred to the medical staff for assessment (and treatment if appropriate).</td><td>It is unsafe to assume that all physical complaints are hypochondriacal; the client could really be ill or injured. The client may attempt to establish the legitimacy of complaints by being genuinely injured or ill.</td></tr><tr><td>Work with the medical staff to limit the number, variety, strength, and frequency of medications, enemas, and so forth that are made available to the client.</td><td>A team effort helps prevent the client’s manipulation of staff members to obtain additional medication.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<table><thead><tr><th>When the client requests a medication or treatment, encourage the client to identify what precipitated his or her complaint and deal with it in other ways.</th><th>If the client can obtain stress relief in a nonchemical, nonmedical way, he or she is less likely to use the medication or treatment.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Observe and record the circumstances related to complaints; talk about your observations with the client.</td><td>Alerting the client to situations surrounding the complaint helps him or her see the relatedness of stress and physical symptoms.</td></tr><tr><td>Help the client identify and use nonchemical methods of pain relief, such as relaxation.</td><td>Using nonchemical pain relief shifts the focus of coping away from medications and increases the client's sense of control.</td></tr><tr><td>Minimize the amount of time and attention given to complaints. When the client makes a complaint, refer him or her to the medical staff (if it is a new complaint) or follow the team treatment plan. Then tell the client you will discuss something else, but not bodily complaints. Tell the client you are interested in the client as a person, not just in his or her physical complaints. If the complaint is not acute, ask the client to discuss the complaint during a regular appointment with the medical staff.</td><td>If physical complaints are unsuccessful in gaining attention, they should decrease in frequency over time.</td></tr><tr><td>Withdraw your attention if the client insists on making complaints the sole topic of conversation. Tell the client your reason for withdrawal and that you will return later to discuss other topics.</td><td>It is important to make clear to the client that attention is withdrawn from physical complaints, not from the client as a person.</td></tr><tr><td>Allow the client a specific time limit (like 5 minutes/hour) to discuss physical complaints with one person. The remaining staff will discuss only other issues with the client.</td><td>Because physical complaints have been the client's primary coping strategy, it is less threatening to the client if you limit this behavior initially rather than forbid it. If the client is denied this coping mechanism before new skills can be developed, hypochondriacal behavior may increase.</td></tr><tr><td>Acknowledge the complaint as the client's perception and then follow the previous approaches; do not argue about the somatic complaints.</td><td>Arguing gives the client's complaints attention, albeit negative, and the client is able to avoid discussing feelings.</td></tr><tr><td>Use minimal objective reassurance in conjunction with</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<table><thead><tr><th>questions to explore the client’s feelings. (“Your tests have shown that you have no lesions. Do you still feel that you do? What are your feelings about this?”)</th><th>make the transition to discussing feelings.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Initially, carefully assess the client’s self-image, social patterns, and ways of dealing with anger, stress, and so forth.</td><td>This assessment provides a knowledge base regarding hypochondriacal behaviors.</td></tr><tr><td>Talk with the client about sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, relationships, employment, and so forth.</td><td>Open-ended discussion is usually nonthreatening and helps the client begin self-assessment.</td></tr><tr><td>After some discussion of the above and developing a trust relationship, talk more directly with the client and encourage him or her to identify specific stresses, recent and ongoing.</td><td>The client’s perception of stressors forms the basis of his or her behavior and is usually more significant than others’ perception of those stressors.</td></tr><tr><td>If the client is using denial as a defense mechanism, point out apparent or possible stresses (in a nonthreatening way) and ask the client for feedback.</td><td>If the client is in denial, more direct approaches may produce anger or hostility and threaten the trust relationship.</td></tr><tr><td>Gradually, help the client identify possible connections between anxiety and the occurrence of physical symptoms. What makes the client more or less comfortable? What is the client doing, or what is going on around the client when he or she experiences symptoms?</td><td>The client can begin to see the relatedness of stress and physical problems at his or her own pace. Self-realization will be more acceptable to the client than the nurse telling the client the problem.</td></tr><tr><td>Encourage the client to discuss his or her feelings about the fears rather than the fears themselves.</td><td>The focus is on feelings of fear, not fear of physical problems.</td></tr><tr><td>Explore the client’s feelings of lack of control over stress and life events.</td><td>The client may have helpless feelings but may not recognize this independently.</td></tr><tr><td>Encourage the client to keep a diary of situations, stresses, and occurrence of symptoms and use it to identify relationships between stresses and symptoms.</td><td>Reflecting on written items may be more accurate and less threatening to the client.</td></tr><tr><td>Talk with the client at least once per shift, focusing on the client identifying and expressing feelings.</td><td>Demonstrating consistent interest in the client facilitates the relationship and can desensitize the discussion of emotional issues.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>930</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Encourage the client to ventilate feelings by talking or crying, through physical activities, and so forth.</th><th>The client may have difficulty expressing feelings directly. Your support may help him or her develop these skills.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Encourage the client to express feelings directly, especially feelings with which the client is uncomfortable (such as anger or resentment).</td><td>Direct expression of feelings will minimize the need to use physical symptoms to express them.</td></tr><tr><td>Notice the client’s interactions with others and give positive feedback for self-assertion and expressing feelings, especially anger, resentment, and other so-called negative emotions.</td><td>The client needs to know that appropriate expressions of anger or other negative emotions are acceptable and that he or she can feel better physically as a result of these expressions.</td></tr><tr><td>Teach the client and his or her family or significant others about the dynamics of hypochondriacal behavior and the treatment plan, including plans after discharge.</td><td>The client and his or her family or significant others may have little or no knowledge of these areas. Knowledge of the treatment plan will promote long-term behavior change.</td></tr><tr><td>Talk with the client and significant others about secondary gains, and together develop a plan to reduce those gains. Identify the needs the client is attempting to meet with secondary gains (such as attention or escape from responsibilities).</td><td>Maintaining limits to reduce secondary gain requires everyone’s participation to be successful. The client’s family and significant others must be aware of the client’s needs if they want to be effective in helping to meet those needs.</td></tr><tr><td>Help the client plan to meet his or her needs in more direct ways. Show the client he or she can gain attention when he or she does not exhibit symptoms, deals with responsibilities directly, or asserts him or herself in the face of stress.</td><td>Positive feedback and support for healthier behavior tend to make that behavior recur more frequently. The client’s family and significant others must also use positive reinforcement.</td></tr><tr><td>Reduce the benefits of illness as much as possible. Do not allow the client to avoid responsibilities or allow special privileges, such as staying in bed by voicing somatic discomfort.</td><td>If physical problems do not get the client what he or she wants, the client is less likely to cope in that manner.</td></tr><tr><td>Teach the client more healthful daily living habits, including diet, stress management techniques, daily exercise, rest, possible connection between caffeine and</td><td>Optimal physical wellness is especially important with clients using physical symptoms as a</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Clients are unlikely to be employed, though they may have a past work history. They often lose jobs because of excessive absenteeism or inability to perform work; clients may have quit working voluntarily because of poor physical health. Consumed with seeking medical care, they have difficulty fulfilling family roles. It is likely that these clients have few friends and spend little time in social activities. They may decline to see friends or go out socially for fear that they would become desperately ill away from home. Most socialization takes place with members of the health care community.</p>
<p>Clients may report a lack of family support and understanding. Family members may tire of the ceaseless complaints and the client’s refusal to accept the absence of a medical diagnosis. The illnesses and physical conditions often interfere with planned family events, such as going on vacations or attending family gatherings. Home life is often chaotic and unpredictable.</p>

<p>In addition to the multitude of physical complaints, these clients often have legitimate needs in terms of their health practices (Box 21.2). Clients who somatize often have sleep pattern disturbances, lack basic nutrition, and get no exercise. In addition, they may be taking multiple prescriptions for pain or other complaints. If a client has been using anxiolytics or medications for pain, the nurse must consider the possibility of withdrawal (see Chapter 19).</p>

<p>The nurse must help the client learn how to establish a daily routine that includes improved health behaviors. Adequate nutritional intake, improved sleep patterns, and a realistic balance of activity and rest are all areas with which the client may need assistance. The nurse should expect resistance, including protests from the client that he or she does not feel well enough to do these things. The challenge for the nurse is to validate the client's feelings while encouraging him or her to participate in</p>
<p>activities.</p>
<p><strong>Nurse:</strong> "Let's take a walk outside for some fresh air." (encouraging collaboration)</p>
<p><strong>Client:</strong> "I wish I could, but I feel so terrible, I just can't do it."</p>
<p><strong>Nurse:</strong> "I know this is difficult, but some exercise is essential. It will be a short walk." (validation; encouraging collaboration)</p>
<p>The nurse can use a similar approach to gain client participation in eating more nutritious foods, getting up and dressed at a certain time every morning, and setting a regular bedtime. The nurse can also explain that inactivity and poor eating habits perpetuate discomfort and that it is often necessary to engage in behaviors even when one doesn't feel like it.</p>
<p><strong>Client:</strong> "I just can't eat anything. I have no appetite."</p>
<p><strong>Nurse:</strong> "I know you don't feel well, but it is important to begin eating." (validation; encouraging collaboration)</p>
<p><strong>Client:</strong> "I promise I'll eat just as soon as I'm hungry."</p>
<p><strong>Nurse:</strong> "Actually, if you begin to eat a few bites, you'll begin to feel better, and your appetite may improve." (encouraging collaboration)</p>
<p>The nurse should not strip clients of their somatizing defenses until adequate assessment data are collected and other coping mechanisms are learned. The nurse should not attempt to confront clients about somatic symptoms or attempt to tell them that these symptoms are not "real." They are real to clients, who actually experience the symptoms and associated distress.</p>

<p>Teaching about the relationship between stress and physical symptoms is a useful way to help clients begin to see the mind-body relationship. Clients may keep a detailed journal of their physical symptoms. The nurse might ask them to describe the situation at the time such as whether they were alone or with others, whether any disagreements were occurring, and so forth. The journal may help clients see when physical symptoms seemed worse or better and what other factors may have affected that perception.</p>
<p>Limiting the time that clients can focus on physical complaints alone may be necessary. Encouraging them to focus on emotional feelings is important, though this can be difficult for clients. The nurse should provide attention and positive feedback for efforts to identify and discuss</p>
<p>934</p>
<p>feelings.</p>
<p>It may help for the nurse to explain to the family about primary and secondary gains. For example, if the family can provide attention to clients when they are feeling better or fulfilling responsibilities, the clients are more likely to continue doing so. If family members have lavished attention on clients when they have physical complaints, the nurse can encourage the relatives to stop reinforcing the sick role.</p>

<p>Two categories of coping strategies are important for clients to learn and to practice: emotion-focused coping strategies, which help clients relax and reduce feelings of stress, and problem-focused coping strategies, which help resolve or change a client's behavior or situation or manage life stressors. Emotion-focused strategies include progressive relaxation, deep breathing, guided imagery, and distractions such as music or other activities. Many approaches to stress relief are available for clients to try. The nurse should help clients learn and practice these techniques, emphasizing that their effectiveness usually improves with routine use. Clients must not expect such techniques to eliminate their pain or physical symptoms; rather, the focus is helping them manage or diminish the intensity of the symptoms.</p>

<p>Problem-focused coping strategies include learning problem-solving methods, applying the process to identified problems, and role-playing interactions with others. For example, a client may complain that no one comes to visit or that she has no friends. The nurse can help the client plan social contact with others, can role-play what to talk about (other than the client's complaints), and can improve the client's confidence in making relationships. The nurse can also help clients identify stressful life situations and plan strategies to deal with them. For example, if a client finds it difficult to accomplish daily household tasks, the nurse can help him to plan a schedule with difficult tasks followed by something the client may enjoy.</p>

<p>Somatic symptom illnesses are chronic or recurrent, so changes are likely to occur slowly.

Improved family and social relationships are also a positive outcome that may follow improvements in the client's coping abilities.</p>

<p>Health care professionals often encounter clients with somatic symptom illnesses in clinics, physicians' offices, or settings other than those related to mental health. Building a trusting relationship with the client, providing empathy and support, and being sensitive to rather than dismissive of complaints are skills that the nurse can use in any setting where clients are seeking assistance. Making appropriate referrals such as to a pain clinic for clients with pain disorder or providing information about support groups in the community may be helpful. Encouraging clients to find pleasurable activities or hobbies may help meet their needs for attention and security, thus diminishing the psychological needs for somatic symptoms.</p>

<p>A common theme in somatic symptom illnesses is their occurrence in people who do not express conflicts, stress, and emotions verbally. They express themselves through physical symptoms; the resulting attention and focus on their physical ailments somewhat meet their needs. As these clients are better able to express their emotions and needs directly, physical symptoms subside. Thus, assisting them in dealing with emotional issues directly is a strategy for mental health promotion.</p>
<p>Somatic symptom illnesses have declined over the past few decades, in part due to increased knowledge of the public, increasing self-awareness or self-knowledge, and scientific evidence of mind-body interaction. Some would credit the internet with putting unlimited resources at people's fingertips, and knowledge often precedes understanding and behavior change. Interestingly, there are others who credit the internet accessibility with feeding some peoples' fears about their health—called cyberchondria. Cyberchondria refers to excessive or repeated online searches for health-related information that is distressing or anxiety-provoking for the person (McMullan, Berle, Arnaez, &amp; Starcevic, 2018). The person's anxiety about his or her own health increased as more time is spent online seeking health information.</p>

<p>Currently, medical personnel consider a somatic illness diagnosis when no other medical diagnosis seems to explain a client's symptoms. The self-reported data from clients and the absence of laboratory or other diagnostic tests are used to determine the existence of somatic illness. By that time, both client and practitioner may be frustrated and emotionally focused on symptoms. Use of a self-report questionnaire as a screening tool can point to a somatic illness diagnosis sooner rather than later as a "last resort."</p>
<p>The next step is to select one of the existing questionnaires and encourage use for screening in medical office settings before frustration and emotion further complicate the client's distress. Framing the client's symptoms as medically undiagnosed may also be beneficial.</p>

<p>Clients who cope with physical symptoms can be frustrating for the nurse. Initially, they are unwilling to consider that anything other than major physical illness is the root of all their problems. When health professionals tell clients there is no physical illness and refer them to mental health professionals, the response is often anger. Clients may express anger directly or passively at the medical community and be highly critical of the inadequate care they believe they have received. The nurse must not respond with anger to such outbursts or criticism.</p>
<p>The client's progress is slow and painstaking if any change happens at all. Clients coping with somatization have been doing so for years. Changes are not rapid or drastic. The nurse may feel frustrated because after giving the client his or her best efforts, the client returns time after time with the same focus on physical symptoms. The nurse should be realistic about the small successes that can be achieved in any given period. To enhance the ongoing</p>
<p>relationship, the nurse must be able to accept the client and his or her continued complaints and criticisms while remaining nonjudgmental.</p>

<li>Carefully assess the client’s physical complaints. Even when a client has a history of a somatoform disorder, the nurse must not dismiss physical complaints or assume they are psychological. The client may indeed have a medical condition.</li>
<li>Validate the client’s feelings while trying to engage him or her in treatment; for example, use a reflective yet engaging comment, such as “I know you’re not feeling well, but it is important to get some exercise each day.”</li>

<li>When a client has pain disorder, powerful analgesics such as narcotics are generally contraindicated, even though the client is suffering unremitting pain. How might the nurse feel when working with this client? How does the nurse respond when the client says, “You know I’m in pain! Why won’t you do anything? Why do you let me suffer?”</li>
<li>The nurse hears the parent of a client with somatic symptom illness say to a friend, “The doctor just said that there’s nothing physically wrong with Sally. She’s been lying to me about being sick!” How would the nurse approach Sally’s parent? What intervention(s) is/are indicated?</li>
<li>A parent is found to have caused a medical crisis by giving his or her 6-year-old child a medication to which the child has a known severe allergy. The parent is diagnosed as having Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Should the parent be treated in the mental health setting? Should the parent be charged with a criminal act? Why?</li>

<ul>
<li>Somatization means transforming mental experiences and states into bodily symptoms.</li>
<li>The three central features of somatic symptom illnesses are physical complaints that suggest major medical illness but have no demonstrable organic basis; psychological factors and conflicts that seem important in initiating, exacerbating, and maintaining the symptoms; and symptoms or magnified health concerns that are not under the client’s conscious control.</li>
<li>Somatic symptom illnesses include somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and pain disorder.</li>
<li>Malingering means feigning physical symptoms for some external gain, such as avoiding work.</li>
<li>Factitious disorders are characterized by physical symptoms that are feigned or inflicted for the sole purpose of drawing attention to oneself and gaining the emotional benefits of assuming the sick role.</li>
<li>MUS and functional somatic syndromes are terms used in general medical practice settings when patients have physical symptoms and/or limitations unexplained by a medical diagnosis.</li>
<li>Internalization and somatization are the chief defense mechanisms seen in clients with somatoform disorders.</li>
<li>Clients with somatic symptom disorder and conversion reactions eventually may be treated in mental health settings. Clients with other somatic symptom illnesses are typically seen in medical settings.</li>
<li>Clients who cope with stress through somatizing are reluctant or unable to identify emotional feelings and interpersonal issues and have few coping abilities unrelated to physical symptoms.</li>
<li>Nursing interventions that may be effective with clients who somatize involve providing health teaching, identifying emotional feelings and stress, and using alternative coping strategies.</li>
<li>Coping strategies that are helpful to clients with somatic symptom illnesses include relaxation techniques such as guided imagery and deep breathing; distractions such as music; and problem-solving strategies such as identifying stressful situations, learning new methods of managing them, and role-playing social interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>940</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients with somatic symptom disorder actually experience symptoms and the associated discomfort and pain. The nurse should never try to confront the client about the origin of these symptoms until the client has learned other coping strategies.</li>
<li>Somatic symptom illnesses are chronic or recurrent, so progress toward treatment outcomes can be slow and difficult.</li>
<li>Nurses caring for clients with somatic symptom illnesses must show patience and understanding toward them as they struggle through years of recurrent somatic complaints and attempts to learn new emotion- and problem-focused coping strategies.</li>

<p>Psychiatric disorders are not diagnosed as easily in children as they are in adults. Children usually lack the abstract cognitive abilities and verbal skills to describe what is happening. Because they are constantly changing and developing, children have limited sense of a stable, normal self to allow them to discriminate unusual or unwanted symptoms from normal feelings and sensations. Additionally, behaviors that are normal in a child of one age may indicate problems in a child of another age. For example, an infant who cries and wails when separated from his or her mother is normal. If the same child at 5 years of age cries and shows extreme anxiety when separated only briefly from the mother, however, this behavior would warrant investigation.</p>
<p>Children and adolescents experience some of the same mental health problems as adults, such as mood and anxiety disorders, and are diagnosed with these disorders using the same criteria as for adults. Eating disorders, especially anorexia, usually begin in adolescence and continue into adulthood. Mood, anxiety, and eating disorders are discussed in separate chapters of this book.</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on neurodevelopmental disorders, usually diagnosed in infancy or childhood and sometimes adolescence; many of these disorders persist into adulthood. This chapter presents an in-depth discussion of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with appropriate nursing diagnoses and interventions as well as a sample nursing care plan. It provides an overview of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) along with a briefer discussion of related disorders.</p>
<p>Intellectual disability is the correct diagnostic term for what was once called mental retardation, a term often used in a disparaging manner to bully or ridicule individuals with impaired cognitive abilities. The essential feature of intellectual disability is below-average intellectual functioning (intelligence quotient [IQ] &lt;70) accompanied by significant limitations in areas of adaptive functioning such as communication skills, self-care, home living, social or interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, academic skills, work, leisure, and health and safety. The degree of disability is based on IQ and cognitive functioning, often categorized as mild, moderate, severe, or profound (King, Toth, DeLacy, &amp; Doherty, 2017).</p>
<p>The causes of intellectual disability include hereditary conditions such as Tay–Sachs disease or fragile X chromosome syndrome; early alterations in embryonic development, such as trisomy 21 or maternal alcohol intake, which cause fetal alcohol syndrome; pregnancy or perinatal problems such as fetal malnutrition, hypoxia, infections, and trauma; medical conditions of infancy such as infection or lead poisoning; and environmental influences such as</p>
<p>948</p>
<p>deprivation of nurturing or stimulation. In addition, the cause is sometimes unknown or not yet discovered.</p>
<p>Mood and behavior disturbances vary among people with intellectual disabilities. Some people with intellectual disability are passive and dependent; others are aggressive and impulsive; and still others may have minimal mood and behavior disturbances. Children with mild-to-moderate intellectual disability usually receive treatment in their homes and communities and make periodic visits to physicians. Those with more severe intellectual disabilities may require residential placement or day care services.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition) diagnosis that includes disorders previously categorized as different types of a pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), characterized by pervasive and usually severe impairment of reciprocal social interaction skills, communication deviance, and restricted stereotypical behavioral patterns. Previous PDDs, such as Rett disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Asperger disorder, are now viewed on a continuum called the autism spectrum. This change helps eliminate problems that existed when attempting to distinguish among these sometimes similar disorders. Also, there is a great deal of difference among individuals diagnosed with autism, ranging from mild to very severe behaviors and limitations, which is easier to conceptualize along a continuum.</p>
<p>ASD, formerly called autistic disorder, or just autism, is almost five times more prevalent in boys than in girls, and it is usually identified by 18 months and no later than 3 years of age. The behaviors and difficulties experienced vary along the continuum from mild to severe. Children with ASD have persistent deficits in communication and social interaction accompanied by restricted, stereotyped patterns of behavior and interests/activities. These children may display little eye contact with and make few facial expressions toward others; they use limited gestures to communicate. They can have limited capacity to relate to peers or parents. They may lack spontaneous enjoyment, express no moods or emotional affect, and may not engage in play or make-believe with toys. There can be little intelligible speech. These children engage in stereotyped motor behaviors, such as hand flapping, body twisting, or head banging (Box 22.1). These behaviors and difficulties are less prominent on the milder end of the autism spectrum and more pronounced on the severe end (Volkmar, Klin, Schultz, &amp; State, 2017).</p>

<p>Eighty percent of cases of autism are early onset, with developmental delays starting in infancy. The other 20% of children with autism have seemingly normal growth and development until 2 or 3 years of age, when developmental regression or loss of abilities begins. They stop talking and relating to parents and peers and begin to demonstrate behaviors previously described (Volkmar et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Autism was once thought to be rare and was estimated to occur in four to five children per 10,000 in the 1960s. Current estimates are one in 59 children in the United States across all ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups, and 1% to 2% worldwide (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). The increase in prevalence has been observed worldwide, though it is somewhat lower in countries outside North America and Europe. Figures on the prevalence of autism in adults are unreliable.</p>
<p>Autism does have a genetic link; many children with autism have a relative with autism or autistic traits (Volkmar et al., 2017). Controversy continues about whether measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccinations contribute to the development of late- or regressive-onset autism. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Academy of Pediatrics have all conducted research studies for several years and have concluded that there is no relationship</p>
<p>between vaccines and autism and that the MMR vaccine is safe. Studies specifically targeting children with regressive-onset ASD and any relationship to vaccines have found that no relationship exists (Goin-Kochel et al., 2016). However, litigation and class action lawsuits are still in progress because some parents and public figures refuse to accept these results.</p>
<p>Autism tends to improve, in some cases substantially, as children start to acquire and use language to communicate with others. If behavior deteriorates in adolescence, it may reflect the effects of hormonal changes or the difficulty meeting increasingly complex social demands. Autistic traits persist into adulthood, and most people with autism remain dependent to some degree on others. Current research estimates that 20% of adults with ASD achieve most independent living outcomes, while 46% require substantial levels of support in most independent living outcomes (Farley et al., 2018). Many continue to live with parents or adult relatives. Manifestations vary from little speech and poor daily living skills throughout life to adequate social skills that allow relatively independent functioning. Social skills rarely improve enough to permit marriage and child-rearing. Adults with autism may be viewed as merely odd or reclusive, or they may be given a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizoid personality disorder, or mental retardation.</p>
<p>Until the mid-1970s, children with autism were usually treated in segregated, specialty outpatient, or school programs. Those with more severe behaviors were referred to residential programs. Since then, most residential programs have been closed; children with autism are being "mainstreamed" into local school programs whenever possible. Short-term inpatient treatment is used when behaviors such as head banging or tantrums are out of control. When the crisis is over, community agencies support the child and family.</p>
<p>The goals of treatment of children with autism are to reduce behavioral symptoms (e.g., stereotyped motor behaviors) and to promote learning and development, particularly the acquisition of language skills. Comprehensive and individualized treatment, including special education and language therapy, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety and agitation, is associated with more favorable outcomes. Pharmacologic treatment with antipsychotics, such as haloperidol (Haldol), risperidone (Risperdal), aripiprazole (Abilify), or combinations of antipsychotic medications, may be effective for specific target symptoms such as temper tantrums, aggressiveness, self-injury, hyperactivity, and stereotyped behaviors (Sharma, Gonda, &amp; Tarazi, 2018). Other medications, such as naltrexone (ReVia), clomipramine (Anafranil), clonidine (Catapres), and stimulants to diminish</p>
<p>951</p>
<p>self-injury and hyperactive and obsessive behaviors, have had varied but unremarkable results. There are no medications approved for the treatment of ASD itself.</p>

<p>A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor movement or vocalization. Tics can be suppressed but not indefinitely. Stress exacerbates tics, which diminish during sleep and when the person is engaged in an absorbing activity. Common simple motor tics include blinking, jerking the neck, shrugging the shoulders, grimacing, and coughing. Common simple vocal tics include clearing the throat, grunting, sniffing, snorting, and barking. Complex vocal tics include repeating words or phrases out of context, coprolalia (use of socially unacceptable words, frequently obscene), palilalia (repeating one's own sounds or words), and echolalia (repeating the last-heard sound, word, or phrase). Complex motor tics include facial gestures, jumping, or touching or smelling an object. Tic disorders tend to run in families. Abnormal transmission of the neurotransmitter dopamine is thought to play a part in tic disorders. Tic disorders are usually treated with risperidone (Risperdal) or olanzapine (Zyprexa), which are atypical antipsychotics. It is important for clients with tic disorders to get plenty of rest and to manage stress because fatigue and stress increase symptoms (Jummani &amp; Coffey, 2017).</p>
<p>Tourette disorder involves multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics, which occur many times a day for more than 1 year. The complexity and severity of the tics change over time, and the person experiences almost all the possible tics described previously during his or her lifetime. The person has significant impairment in academic, social, or occupational areas and feels ashamed and self-conscious. This rare disorder (4 or 5 in 10,000) is more common in boys and is usually identified by 7 years of age. Some people have lifelong problems; others have no symptoms after early adulthood (Jummani &amp; Coffey, 2017).</p>

<p>A specific learning disorder is diagnosed when a child’s achievement in reading, mathematics, or written expression is below that expected for age, formal education, and intelligence. Learning problems interfere with academic achievement and life activities requiring reading, math, or writing. Reading and written expression disorders are usually identified in the first grade; math disorder may go undetected until the child reaches fifth grade. Approximately 5% of children in U.S. public schools are diagnosed with a learning disorder. The school dropout rate for students with learning disorders is 1.5 times higher than the average rate for all students (Tannock, 2017).</p>
<p>Low self-esteem and poor social skills are common in children with learning disorders. As adults, some have problems with employment or social adjustment; others have minimal difficulties. Early identification of the learning disorder, effective intervention, and no coexisting problems is associated with better outcomes. Children with learning disorders are assisted with academic achievement through special education classes in public schools.</p>

<p>The essential feature of developmental coordination disorder is impaired coordination severe enough to interfere with academic achievement or activities of daily living. This diagnosis is not made if the problem with motor coordination is part of a general medical condition, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy. This disorder becomes evident as a child attempts to crawl or walk or as an older child tries to dress independently or manipulate toys such as building blocks. Developmental coordination disorder often coexists with a communication disorder. Its course is variable; sometimes lack of coordination persists into adulthood. Schools provide adaptive physical education and sensory integration programs to treat motor skills disorder. Adaptive physical education programs emphasize inclusion of movement games such as kicking a football or soccer ball. Sensory integration programs are specific physical therapies prescribed to target improvement in areas where the child has difficulties. For example, a child with tactile defensiveness (discomfort at being touched by another person) might be involved in touching and rubbing skin surfaces (Patacki &amp; Mitchell, 2017).</p>

<p>Stereotypic movement disorder is characterized by rhythmic, repetitive behaviors, such as hand waving, rocking, head banging, and biting, that appears to have no purpose. Self-inflicted injuries are common, and the pain is not a deterrent to the behavior. Onset is prior to age 3 years and usually persists into adolescence. It is more common in individuals with intellectual disability. Comorbid disorders, such as anxiety, ADHD, OCD, and tics/Tourette syndrome, are common and often cause more functional impairment than the stereotypic behavior (Doyle, 2017).</p>

<p>A communication disorder involves deficits in language, speech, and communication and is diagnosed when deficits are sufficient to hinder development, academic achievement, or activities of daily living, including socialization. Language disorder involves deficit(s) in language production or comprehension, causing limited vocabulary and an inability to form sentences or have a conversation. Speech sound disorder is difficulty or inability to produce intelligible speech, which precludes effective verbal communication. Stuttering is a disturbance of fluency and patterning of speech with sound and syllable repetitions. Social communication disorder involves the inability to observe social "rules" of conversation, deficits in applying context to conversation, inability to tell a story in an understandable manner, and inability to take turns talking and listening with another (Koyama &amp; Beitchman, 2017).</p>
<p>Communication disorders may be mild to severe. Difficulties that persist into adulthood are related most closely to the severity of the disorder. Speech and language therapists work with children who have communication disorders to improve their communication skills and to teach parents to continue speech therapy activities at home.</p>

<p>Encopresis is the repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places such as clothing or the floor by a child who is at least 4 years of age either chronologically or developmentally. It is often involuntary, but it can be intentional. Involuntary encopresis is usually associated with constipation that occurs for psychological, not medical, reasons. Intentional encopresis is often associated with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder.</p>
<p>Enuresis is the repeated voiding of urine during the day or at night into clothing or bed by a child at least 5 years of age either chronologically or</p>
<p>954</p>
<p>developmentally. Most often, enuresis is involuntary; when intentional, it is associated with a disruptive behavior disorder. Of children with enuresis, 75% have a first-degree relative who has had the disorder. Most children with enuresis do not have a coexisting mental disorder.</p>
<p>Both encopresis and enuresis are more common in boys than in girls; 1% of all 5-year-olds have encopresis and 5% of all 5-year-olds have enuresis. Encopresis can persist with intermittent exacerbations for years; it is rarely chronic. Most children with enuresis are continent by adolescence; only 1% of all cases persist into adulthood.</p>
<p>Impairment associated with elimination disorders depends on the limitations on the child's social activities, effects on self-esteem, degree of social ostracism by peers, and anger, punishment, and rejection on the part of parents or caregivers.</p>
<p>Enuresis can be treated effectively with imipramine (Tofranil), an antidepressant with a side effect of urinary retention. Both elimination disorders respond to behavioral approaches, such as a pad with a warning bell, and to positive reinforcement for continence. For children with a disruptive behavior disorder, psychological treatment of that disorder may improve the elimination disorder (Mikkelsen, 2017).</p>
<p>Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) is a syndrome that is not a DSM-5 diagnosis. It includes daydreaming, trouble focusing and paying attention, mental fogginess, staring, sleepiness, little interest in physical activity, and slowness in finishing tasks. Many of these are observed in children with ADHD; however, there is no hyperactivity or impulsivity—just the opposite. This leads some to believe that it is separate for ADHD, while others believe it is a variant of ADHD. Investigation is ongoing (Becker &amp; Willcutt, 2019).</p>

<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by inattentiveness, overactivity, and impulsiveness. ADHD is a common disorder, especially in boys, and probably accounts for more child mental health referrals than any other single disorder. The essential feature of ADHD is a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity more common than generally observed in children of the same age.</p>
<p>ADHD affects 5% to 8% of school-aged children, with 60% to 85% having symptoms persisting into adolescence. Up to 60% continue to be symptomatic into adulthood. The ratio of boys to girls ranges from 2:1 in nonclinical</p>
<p>955</p>
<p>settings to 9:1 in clinical settings (Spaniardi, Greenhil, &amp; Hectman, 2017). To avoid overdiagnosis of ADHD, a qualified specialist, such as a pediatric neurologist or a child psychiatrist, must conduct the evaluation for ADHD. Children who are very active or hard to handle in the classroom can be diagnosed and treated mistakenly for ADHD. Some of these overly active children may suffer from psychosocial stressors at home, inadequate parenting, or other psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>It is essential to have a thorough and accurate diagnosis for ADHD. There are other disorders and situations that may look similar to ADHD, such as bipolar disorder or behavioral acting out in response to family stress, such as divorce, parental mental disorders, and so forth. A key feature of ADHD is the consistency of the child's behavior—every day, in almost all situations, and</p>
<p>with almost all caregivers, the child demonstrates the problematic behaviors. Distinguishing bipolar disorder from ADHD can be difficult but is crucial to prescribe the most effective treatment.</p>

<p>ADHD is usually identified and diagnosed when the child begins preschool or school, though many parents report problems from a much younger age. As infants, children with ADHD are often fussy and temperamental and have poor sleeping patterns. Toddlers may be described as “always on the go” and “into everything,” at times dismantling toys and cribs. They dart back and forth, jump and climb on furniture, run through the house, and cannot tolerate sedentary activities such as listening to stories. At this point in a child’s development, it can be difficult for parents to distinguish normal active behavior from excessive hyperactive behavior.</p>
<p>By the time the child starts school, symptoms of ADHD begin to interfere significantly with behavior and performance. The child fidgets constantly, is in and out of assigned seats, and makes excessive noise by tapping or playing with pencils or other objects. Normal environmental noises, such as someone coughing, distract the child. He or she cannot listen to directions or complete tasks. The child interrupts and blurts out answers before questions are completed. Academic performance suffers because the child makes hurried, careless mistakes in schoolwork, often loses or forgets homework assignments, and fails to follow directions (Zendarski, Sciberras, Mensah, &amp; Hiscock, 2017).</p>
<p>Socially, peers may ostracize or even ridicule the child for his or her behavior. Forming positive peer relationships is difficult because the child cannot play cooperatively or take turns and constantly interrupts others. Studies have shown that both teachers and peers perceive children with ADHD as more aggressive, bossier, and less likable (Grygiel, Humenny, Rebisz, Bajcar, &amp; S’witaj, 2018). This perception results from the child’s impulsivity, inability to share or take turns, tendency to interrupt, and failure to listen to and follow directions. Thus, peers and teachers may exclude the child from activities and play, may refuse to socialize with the child, and/or may respond to the child in a harsh, punitive, or rejecting manner.</p>
<p>Approximately 60% to 85% of children diagnosed with ADHD continue to have problems in adolescence. Typical impulsive behaviors include cutting class, getting speeding tickets, failing to maintain interpersonal relationships, and adopting risk-taking behaviors, such as using drugs or alcohol, engaging</p>
<p>957</p>
<p>in sexual promiscuity, fighting, and violating curfew. Many adolescents with ADHD have discipline problems serious enough to warrant suspension or expulsion from high school. The secondary complications of ADHD, such as low self-esteem and peer rejection, continue to pose serious problems.</p>
<p>Previously, it was believed that children outgrew ADHD, but it is now known that ADHD can persist into adulthood. Estimates are that 60% of children with ADHD have symptoms that continue into adulthood. In one study, adults who had been treated for hyperactivity 25 years earlier were three to four times more likely than their brothers to experience nervousness, restlessness, depression, lack of friends, and low frustration tolerance. Approximately 70% to 75% of adults with ADHD have at least one coexisting psychiatric diagnosis, with social phobia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and alcohol dependence being the most common (McGough, 2017). Box 22.2 contains a screening questionnaire for ADHD in adults.</p>

<p>Etiology</p>
<p>Although much research has taken place, the definitive causes of ADHD remain unknown. There may be cortical-arousal, information-processing, or</p>
<p>958</p>
<p>maturational abnormalities in the brain. Combined factors, such as environmental toxins, prenatal influences, heredity, and damage to brain structure and functions, are likely responsible. Prenatal exposure to alcohol, tobacco, and lead and severe malnutrition in early childhood increase the likelihood of ADHD. Although the relation between ADHD and dietary sugar and vitamins has been studied, results have been inconclusive (Spaniardi et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Brain images of people with ADHD suggest decreased metabolism in the frontal lobes, which are essential for attention, impulse control, organization, and sustained goal-directed activity. Studies have also shown decreased blood perfusion of the frontal cortex in children with ADHD and frontal cortical atrophy in young adults with a history of childhood ADHD. Another study showed decreased glucose use in the frontal lobes of parents of children with ADHD who had ADHD themselves (Spaniardi et al., 2017). Evidence is not conclusive, but research in these areas seems promising.</p>
<p>There seems to be a genetic link for ADHD that is most likely associated with abnormalities in catecholamine and, possibly, serotonin metabolism. Having a first-degree relative with ADHD increases the risk of the disorder by four to five times more than that of the general population (Spaniardi et al., 2017). Despite the strong evidence supporting a genetic contribution, there are also sporadic cases of ADHD with no family history of ADHD; this furthers the theory of multiple contributing factors.</p>

<p>Scott is 8 years old. At 7 AM, his mother looks into Scott's bedroom and sees Scott playing. "Scott, you know the rules—no playing before you are ready for school. Get dressed and come eat breakfast." Although these rules for a school day have been set for the past 7 months, Scott always tests them. In about 10 minutes, he is still not in the kitchen. His mother checks his room and finds Scott on the floor, still in his pajamas, playing with miniature cars. Once he gets started doing or talking about something, it is often difficult for Scott to stop.</p>
<p>"Scott, you need to get dressed first. Your jeans and shirt are over here on the chair." "Mom, after school today, can we go shopping? There is the coolest new car game that anyone can play. I'd love to try it out." As he is talking, Scott walks over to the chair and begins to pull his shirt over his head. "Scott, you're putting your shirt over your pajamas. You need to take your pajamas off first," his mother reminds him.</p>
<p>959</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Scott bounds into the kitchen, still without socks and shoes, hair tousled. "You forgot your socks, and your hair isn't combed," his mother reminds him. "Oh yeah. What's for breakfast?" he says. "Scott, finish dressing first." "Well, where are my shoes?" "By the back door where you left them." This is the special designated place where Scott is supposed to leave his shoes so he doesn't forget.</p>
<p>Scott starts toward his shoes but spots his younger sister playing with blocks on the floor. He hurries to her. "Wow, Amy, watch this—I can make these blocks into a huge tower, all the way to the ceiling." He grabs the blocks and begins to stack them higher and higher. "Scott makes a better tower than Amy," he chants. Amy shrieks at this intrusion, but she is used to Scott grabbing things from her. The shriek brings their mother into the room. She notices Scott's feet still do not have socks and shoes.</p>
<p>"Scott, get your socks and shoes on now and leave Amy alone!" "Where are my socks?" he asks. "Go to your room and get a clean pair of socks and brush your teeth and hair. Then come eat your breakfast or you'll miss the bus."</p>
<p>"I will in just a minute, Mom." "No! Now! Go get your socks." Scott continues stacking blocks.</p>
<p>Wearily, his mother directs him toward his room. As he is looking for the socks, he is still chattering away. He finds a pair of socks and bolts in the direction of the kitchen, grabbing Amy and pinching her cheek as he swirls by her. Amy shrieks again, and he begins to chant, "Amy's just a baby! Amy's just a baby!" "Scott, stop it right now and come eat something! You've got just 10 minutes until the bus comes."</p>

<p>The Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher Report Form, and Youth Self Report (for ages 11–18 years) are rating scales frequently used to determine problem areas and competencies. These scales are often part of a comprehensive assessment of ADHD in children. They have been determined to be culturally competent and are widely used in various countries. The ADHD-FX has also proved to be a valid, reliable, and culturally appropriate measure of functional</p>
<p>impairment of at-risk students (Haack &amp; Gerdes, 2017). Parental beliefs about the causes and treatments of ADHD in their children may influence compliance with prescribed treatments. Therefore, it is important to study, determine, and include parental, cultural beliefs to enhance effectiveness for children.</p>

<p>No one treatment has been found to be effective for ADHD; this gives rise to many different approaches such as sugar-controlled diets and megavitamin therapy. Parents need to know that any treatment heralded as the cure for ADHD is probably too good to be true. ADHD is chronic; goals of treatment involve managing symptoms, reducing hyperactivity and impulsivity, and increasing the child's attention so that he or she can grow and develop normally. The most effective treatment combines pharmacotherapy with behavioral, psychosocial, and educational interventions.</p>

<p>Medications are often effective in decreasing hyperactivity and impulsiveness and improving attention; this enables the child to participate in school and family life. The most common medications are methylphenidate (Ritalin) and an amphetamine compound (Adderall). Methylphenidate is effective in 70% to 80% of children with ADHD; it reduces hyperactivity, impulsivity, and mood lability and helps the child pay attention more appropriately. Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and pemoline (Cylert) are other stimulants used to treat ADHD. The most common side effects of these drugs are insomnia, loss of appetite, and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, and amphetamine compounds are also available in a sustained-release form taken once daily; this eliminates the need for additional doses when the child is at school. Methylphenidate is also available in a daily transdermal patch, marketed as Daytrana. Because pemoline can cause liver damage, it is the last of these drugs to be prescribed.</p>
<p>Giving stimulants during daytime hours usually effectively combats insomnia. Eating a good breakfast with the morning dose and substantial nutritious snacks late in the day and at bedtime helps the child maintain an adequate dietary intake. When stimulant medications are not effective or their side effects are intolerable, antidepressants are the second choice for treatment (see Chapter 2). Atomoxetine (Strattera) is the only nonstimulant drug</p>
<p>964</p>
<p>specifically developed and tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ADHD. It is an antidepressant, specifically a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. The most common side effects in children during clinical trials were decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, tiredness, and upset stomach. In adults, side effects were similar to those of other antidepressants, including insomnia, dry mouth, urinary retention, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and sexual side effects. In addition, atomoxetine can cause liver damage, so individuals taking the drug need to have liver function tests periodically (Burchum &amp; Rosenthal, 2018). Table 22.1 lists drugs, dosages, and nursing considerations for clients with ADHD.</p>

<p>Medications do not automatically improve the child's academic performance or ensure that he or she makes friends. Behavioral strategies are necessary to help the child master appropriate behaviors. Environmental strategies at school and home can help the child succeed in those settings. Educating parents and helping them with parenting strategies are crucial components of effective treatment of ADHD. Effective approaches include providing consistent rewards and consequences for behavior, offering consistent praise, using time-out, and giving verbal reprimands. Additional strategies are issuing daily report cards for behavior and using point systems for positive and negative behavior.</p>
<p>In therapeutic play, play techniques are used to understand the child's thoughts and feelings and to promote communication. This should not be confused with play therapy, a psychoanalytic technique used by psychiatrists. Dramatic play is acting out an anxiety-producing situation such as allowing the child to be a doctor or use a stethoscope or other equipment to take care of a patient (a doll). Play techniques to release energy could include pounding pegs, running, or working with modeling clay. Creative play techniques can help children to express themselves; for example, by drawing pictures of themselves, their family, and peers. These techniques are especially useful when children are unable or unwilling express themselves verbally.</p>

<p>During assessment, the nurse gathers information through direct observation and from the child’s parents, day care providers (if any), and teachers. Assessing the child in a group of peers is likely to yield useful information because the child’s behavior may be subdued or different in a focused one-to-one interaction with the nurse. It is often helpful to use a checklist when talking with parents to help focus their input on the target symptoms or behaviors their child exhibits.</p>

<p>Parents may report that the child was fussy and had problems as an infant, or they may not have noticed the hyperactive behavior until the child was a toddler or entered day care or school. The child probably has difficulties in all major life areas such as school or play, and he or she likely displays overactive or even dangerous behavior at home. Often, parents say the child is “out of control,” and they feel unable to deal with the behavior. Parents may report many largely unsuccessful attempts to discipline the child or change the behavior.</p>

<p>The child is alert and oriented with no sensory or perceptual alterations such as hallucinations. Ability to pay attention or to concentrate is markedly impaired. The child's attention span may be as little as 2 or 3 seconds with severe ADHD or 2 or 3 minutes in milder forms of the disorder. Assessing the child's memory may be difficult; he or she frequently answers, "I don't know," because he or she cannot pay attention to the question or stop the mind from racing. The child with ADHD is distractible and rarely able to complete tasks.</p>

<p>Children with ADHD usually exhibit poor judgment and often do not think before acting. They may fail to perceive harm or danger and engage in impulsive acts, such as running into the street or jumping off high objects. Although assessing judgment and insight in young children is difficult, children with ADHD display more lack of judgment compared with others of the same age. Most young children with ADHD are totally unaware that their behavior is different from that of others and cannot perceive how it harms others. Older children might report, "No one at school likes me," but they cannot relate the lack of friends to their own behavior.</p>

<p>Again, this may be difficult to assess in a very young child, but generally, the self-esteem of children with ADHD is low. Because they are not successful at school, may not have many friends, and have trouble getting along at home, they generally feel out of place and bad about themselves. The negative reactions their behavior evokes from others often cause them to see themselves as bad or stupid.</p>

<p>The child is usually unsuccessful academically and socially at school. He or she is frequently disruptive and intrusive at home, which causes friction with siblings and parents. Until the child is diagnosed and treated, parents often believe that the child is willful, stubborn, and purposefully misbehaving. Generally, measures to discipline have limited success; in some cases, the child becomes physically out of control, even hitting parents or destroying family possessions. Parents find themselves chronically exhausted mentally and physically. Teachers often feel the same frustration as parents, and day care providers or babysitters may refuse to care for the child with ADHD, which adds to the child’s rejection.</p>

<p>Safety of the child and others is always a priority. If the child is engaged in a potentially dangerous activity, the first step is to stop the behavior. This may require physical intervention if the child is running into the street or attempting to jump from a high place. Attempting to talk to or reason with a child engaged in a dangerous activity is unlikely to succeed because his or her ability to pay attention and to listen is limited. When the incident is over and the child is safe, the adult should talk to the child directly about the expectations for safe behavior. Close supervision may be required for a time to ensure compliance and to avoid injury.</p>
<p>Explanations should be short and clear, and the adult should not use a</p>
<p>970</p>
<p>punitive or belittling tone of voice. The adult should not assume that the child knows acceptable behavior but instead should state expectations clearly. For example, if the child was jumping down a flight of stairs, the adult might say,</p>
<p>“It is unsafe to jump down stairs. From now on, you are to walk down the stairs, one at a time.”</p>
<p>If the child cut ahead of others, the adult would walk the child back to the proper place in line and say,</p>
<p>“It is not OK to cut ahead of others. Take your place at the end of the line.”</p>
<p>To prevent physically intrusive behavior, it may also be necessary to supervise the child closely while he or she is playing. Again, it is often necessary to act first to stop the harmful behavior by separating the child from a friend such as stepping between them or physically removing the child. Afterward, the adult should clearly explain expected and unacceptable behaviors. For example, the adult might say,</p>
<p>“It is not OK to grab other people. When you are playing with others, you must ask for the toy.”</p>

<p>It is extremely important to give the child specific positive feedback when he or she meets stated expectations. Doing so reinforces desired behaviors and gives the child a sense of accomplishment. For example, the adult might say,</p>
<p>“You walked down the stairs safely” or “You did a good job of asking to play with the guitar and waited until it was your turn.”</p>
<p>Managing the environment helps the child improve his or her ability to listen, pay attention, and complete tasks. A quiet place with minimal noise and distraction is desirable. At school, this may be a seat directly facing the teacher at the front of the room and away from the distraction of a window or door. At home, the child should have a quiet area for</p>
<p>971</p>
<p>homework away from the television or radio.</p>

<p>Before beginning any task, adults must gain the child’s full attention. It is helpful to face the child on his or her level and use good eye contact. The adult should tell the child what needs to be done and break the task into smaller steps if necessary. For example, if the child has 25 math problems, it may help to give him or her five problems at a time, then five more when those are completed, and so on. This approach prevents overwhelming the child and provides the opportunity for feedback about each set of problems he or she completes. With sedentary tasks, it is also important to allow the child to have breaks or opportunities to move around.</p>
<p>Adults can use the same approach for tasks such as cleaning or picking up toys. Initially, the child needs the supervision or at least the presence of the adult. The adult can direct the child to do one portion of the task at a time; when the child shows progress, the adult can give only occasional reminders and then allow the child to complete the task independently. It helps to provide specific, step-by-step directions rather than give a general direction such as “Please clean your room.” The adult could say,</p>
<p>“Put your dirty clothes in the hamper.”</p>
<p>After this step is completed, the adult gives another direction:</p>
<p>“Now make the bed.”</p>
<p>The adult assigns specific tasks until the child has completed the overall chore.</p>

<p>A structured daily routine is helpful. The child will accomplish getting up, dressing, doing homework, playing, going to bed, and so forth much more readily if there is a routine time for these daily activities. Children with ADHD do not adjust to changes readily and are less likely to meet expectations if times for activities are arbitrary or differ from day to day.</p>

<p>Including parents in planning and providing care for the child with ADHD</p>
<p>972</p>
<p>is important. The nurse can teach parents the approaches described previously for use at home. Parents feel empowered and relieved to have specific strategies that can help both them and their child be more successful.</p>
<p>The nurse must listen to parents' feelings. They may feel frustrated, angry, or guilty and blame themselves or the school system for their child's problems. Parents need to hear that neither they nor their child are at fault and that techniques and school programs are available to help. Children with ADHD qualify for special school services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.</p>
<p>Because raising a child with ADHD can be frustrating and exhausting, it often helps parents to attend support groups that can provide information and encouragement from other parents with the same problems. Parents must learn strategies to help the child improve his or her social and academic abilities, but they also must understand how to help rebuild the child's self-esteem. Most of these children have low self-esteem because they have been labeled as having behavior problems and have been corrected continually by parents and teachers for not listening, not paying attention, and misbehaving. Parents should give positive comments as much as possible to encourage the child and acknowledge his or her strengths. One technique to help parents to achieve a good balance is to ask them to count the number of times they praise or criticize the child each day or for several days.</p>
<p>Although medication can help reduce hyperactivity and inattention and allow the child to focus during school, it is by no means a cure-all. The child needs strategies and practice to improve social skills and academic performance. Because these children are often not diagnosed until the second or third grade, they may have missed much basic learning for reading and math. Parents should know that it takes time for them to catch up with other children of the same age.</p>

<p>Parents and teachers are likely to notice positive outcomes of treatment before the child does.

<p>Early identification and treatment of ASD are needed to help children with these disorders reach their maximum potential. Insufficient knowledge about</p>
<p>ASD and embarrassment or reluctance to have a child diagnosed with ASD are reasons that some parents are hesitant to have children evaluated if signs of developmental delays are present. When any signs of developmental delay are detected, a thorough evaluation by a team of psychiatrist, pediatrician, physiotherapist, and neurologist can accurately identify presence of ASD, intellectual disability, language impairment, motor developmental delays, or global developmental delays. An accurate diagnosis and appropriate interventions are more likely to produce the best long-term outcomes that are available.</p>
<p>In 1998, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, a gastroenterologist, described a type of autism reportedly caused by the MMR vaccination. This led to parental concerns about the safety of immunizations with fewer children receiving this immunization. Ten years later, Dr. Wakefield was found guilty of ethical, medical, and scientific misconduct in the publication of his paper on autism. Additional studies have proved Dr. Wakefield's data fraudulent. However, this publication of the alleged vaccine-induced autism is one of the most damaging medical hoaxes on record.</p>
<p>There is a high comorbidity between ADHD and other disorders including substance use/abuse, antisocial behavior, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders (Spaniardi et al., 2017). To promote health through adulthood, individuals with ADHD could benefit from strategies to prevent other psychiatric disorders as well as early identification and treatment of coexisting disorders.</p>

<p>Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is based on principles of applied behavioral analysis and consists of 20 to 40 hours/week of intensive therapy for several months to years in length. Tasks are broken down into tiny steps that are taught and rewarded, then eventually put together to accomplish the overall task. In addition, improvement in expressive language, receptive language, and daily communication skills occurred for all participants.</p>
<p>The next step involves larger-scale, randomized trials using rigorous research design to strengthen the evidence</p>

<p>Working with children and adolescents can be both rewarding and difficult. Many disorders of childhood, such as severe developmental disorders, severely limit the child's abilities. It may be difficult for the nurse to remain positive with the child and parents when the prognosis for improvement is poor. Even in overwhelming and depressing situations, the nurse has an opportunity to positively influence children and adolescents, who are still in crucial phases of development. The nurse can often help these clients develop coping mechanisms they will use throughout adulthood.</p>
<p>Working with parents is a crucial aspect of dealing with children with these disorders. Parents often have the most influence on how these children learn to cope with their disorders. The nurse's beliefs and values about raising children affect how he or she deals with children and parents. The nurse must not be overly critical about how parents handle their children's problems until the situation is fully understood: Caring for a child as a nurse is different from being responsible around the clock. Given their own skills and problems, parents often give their best efforts. Given the opportunity, resources, support, and education, many parents can improve their parenting.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Psychiatric disorders are more difficult to diagnose in children than in adults because children’s basic development is incomplete, and they may lack the ability to recognize or to describe what they are experiencing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children and adolescents can experience some of the same mental health problems seen in adults, such as depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disorders of childhood and adolescence most often encountered in mental health settings include ASD and ADHD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intellectual disability involves below-average intellectual functioning (IQ below 70) and is accompanied by significant limitations in adaptive functioning, such as communication, self-care, self-direction, academic achievement, work, and health and safety. The degree of impairment is directly related to the IQ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tic disorders involve various combinations of involuntary vocal and/or motor tics. Tourette disorder is most common. Tic disorders are usually treated successfully with atypical antipsychotic medications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elimination disorders cause impairment for the child based on the response of parents, the level of self-esteem, and the degree of ostracism by peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning disorders include categories for substandard achievement in reading, mathematics, and written expression. They are treated through special education in schools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication disorders may involve language, speech, sound or fluency, or social rules and expectations of conversation. They are primarily treated by speech and language therapists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ASD includes a continuum approach to developmental disorders; they are characterized by severe impairment of reciprocal social interaction skills, communication deviance, and restricted, stereotyped behavioral patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children with ASD seem detached and make little eye contact with and few facial expressions toward others. They do not relate to peers or parents, lack spontaneous enjoyment, and cannot engage in play or make-believe with toys. Autism is often treated with behavioral approaches. Months or years of treatment may be needed before positive outcomes appear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The essential feature of ADHD is a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity. ADHD, the most common disorder of childhood, results in poor academic performance, strained family relations, and rejection by peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interventions for ADHD include a combination of medication, behavioral interventions, and parental education. Often, special educational assistance is needed to help with academic achievement.</p>
</li>

<p>Disruptive behavior disorders include problems with the person's ability to regulate his or her own emotions or behaviors. They are characterized by persistent patterns of behavior that involve anger, hostility, and/or aggression</p>
<p>toward people and property. The primary disorders in this category include oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder (IED). It has been posited by some psychiatrists that ODD and conduct disorder can be viewed on a continuum concept that would include antisocial personality disorder (see Chapter 18). Others believe that ODD is a milder variant of conduct disorder. IED is viewed as an impulse control disorder, but it is included in this discussion because it involves aggression toward people and property. The age of onset for IED can occur after age 6, but is often diagnosed from adolescence to young adulthood (Ramesh, Hassamai, &amp; Moeller, 2017).</p>
<p>This chapter presents an in-depth discussion of conduct disorder (the most prevalent disruptive behavior disorder) with appropriate nursing diagnoses and interventions as well as a sample nursing care plan. It discusses the less common disorders of ODD and IED briefly; generally, these disorders are not treated in inpatient psychiatric units unless they coexist with other disorders.</p>

<p>Kleptomania is characterized by impulsive, repetitive theft of items not needed by the person, either for personal use or monetary gain. Tension and anxiety are high prior to the theft, and the person feels relief, exhilaration, or gratification while committing the theft. The item is often discarded after it is stolen. Kleptomania is more common in females and often has negative legal, career, family, and social consequences.</p>
<p>Pyromania is characterized by repeated, intentional fire-setting. The person is fascinated about fire and feels pleasure or relief of tension while setting and watching the fires. There is neither any monetary gain or revenge or other reason, such as concealing other crimes, nor is it associated with another major mental disorder. Pyromania as a primary disorder is rare. Persons, if caught, become part of the legal rather than mental health system.</p>

<p>Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) consists of an enduring pattern of uncooperative, defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority figures without major antisocial violations. A certain level of oppositional behavior is common in children and adolescents; indeed, it is almost expected at some phases such as 2 to 3 years of age and in early adolescence. Table 23.1 contrasts acceptable characteristics with abnormal behavior in</p>
<p>988</p>
<p>adolescents. ODD is diagnosed only when behaviors are more frequent and intense than in unaffected peers and cause dysfunction in social, academic, or work situations. The disruptive, defiant behaviors usually begin at home with parents or parental figures and are more intense in this setting than settings outside the home.</p>

<p>The prevalence rates of ODD vary from 2% up to 15% of the adolescent population, which highlights the difficulty of distinguishing negative behavior from ODD and conduct disorder-type behaviors. Average prevalence in the United States is estimated at 3% (Valley Behavioral Health, 2019). It occurs more often in males; however, ODD in female adolescents has increased in recent years. Most authorities believe that genes, temperament, and adverse social conditions interact to create ODD. Children with ODD have lower self-concept and lack competence in social situations.</p>
<p>Children with ODD have limited abilities to make associations between their behavior and consequences of behavior—both negative and positive, indicative of a reduced sensitivity to reward and punishment. Therefore, learning appropriate behavior and learning to refrain from inappropriate behavior are impaired. They also exhibit impaired problem-solving abilities</p>
<p>989</p>
<p>and deficiencies in attention, flexibility of thinking, and decision-making. All of these problems are also present in children diagnosed with conduct disorder—to an even greater degree.</p>
<p>Prognosis for ODD varies by age of onset, symptom severity, and the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders. Early onset, more severe symptoms, and comorbid conditions are associated with poorer long-term outcomes. Early onset is also associated with an increased risk for developing conduct disorder. Children with this disorder can develop conduct disorder; some will be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder as adults. ODD is often comorbid with other psychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, and/or mood disorders that need to be treated as well.</p>
<p>Treatment for ODD is based on parent management training models of behavioral interventions. These programs are based on the idea that ODD problem behaviors are learned and inadvertently reinforced in the home and school. A hierarchy of problem behaviors is developed, and the most disruptive or problematic behaviors are targeted for intervention. Parents learn to ignore maladaptive behaviors rather than giving the behaviors negative attention, positive behaviors are rewarded with praise and reinforcers, and consistent consequences for the child's defiant behavior are implemented every time the behavior occurs. Adolescent children benefit from interventions that use enhancement of personal strengths to improve behavioral and social functioning. Older children may also benefit from individual therapy in addition to the behavioral program. There is little evidence that medications help ODD behaviors; however, successful pharmacologic treatment of comorbid disorders such as ADHD may also decrease the severity of ODD symptoms. In addition, focus on supporting the parents improves overall outcomes (Ollendick &amp; Greene, 2016). Primary caregivers report that challenges can be overwhelming, demanding, and unrelenting. The two major challenges for parents and caregivers are managing the adolescent's aggressive, defiant, and deceitful behaviors, and interacting frequently with multiple service providers and agencies.</p>

<p>Intermittent explosive disorder (IED) involves repeated episodes of impulsive, aggressive, violent behavior, and angry verbal outbursts, usually lasting less than 30 minutes. During these episodes, there may be physical injury to others, destruction of property, and injury to the individual as well. The intensity of the emotional outburst is grossly out of proportion to the stressor or situation. In other words, a minor issue or occurrence may result in rage, aggression, and assault of others. The episode may occur with seemingly no warning. Afterward, the individual may be embarrassed and feel guilty or remorseful for his or her actions. But that does not prevent future impulsive, aggressive outbursts.</p>
<p>The onset of IED can occur at any time in life but is most common in adolescence and young adulthood. It is more common in males than in</p>
<p>females (Ramesh et al., 2017). Many people with IED have a comorbid psychiatric disorder, most commonly substance use/abuse, ADHD, ODD, conduct disorder, anxiety disorders, and depression. IED is related to childhood exposure to trauma, neglect, or maltreatment. Other potential etiologic factors include neurotransmitter imbalances, especially serotonin; plasma tryptophan depletion; and frontal lobe dysfunction. Some have postulated that IED is correlated with adverse physical outcomes, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, back/neck pain, ulcer, headache, and other chronic pain.</p>
<p>Treatment for IED includes medications, such as fluoxetine (Prozac); lithium; and anticonvulsant mood stabilizers such as valproic acid (Depakote), phenytoin (Dilantin), topiramate (Topamax), and oxcarbazepine (Trileptal). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants particularly seem to reduce aggressive tendencies because serotonin deficiencies are often linked to causation (Kim &amp; Boylan, 2016). Although these medications reduce aggressive impulses and irritability in many people, they do not eliminate the outbursts of IED. Additional interventions can improve outcomes, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, anger management strategies, avoidance of alcohol and other substances, and relaxation techniques. The best outcomes involve a combination of these interventions and treatment.</p>

<p>Conduct disorder is characterized by persistent behavior that violates societal norms, rules, laws, and the rights of others. These children and adolescents have significantly impaired abilities to function in social, academic, or occupational areas. Symptoms are clustered in four areas: aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness and theft, and serious violation of rules. Children with conduct disorder often exhibit callous and unemotional traits, similar to those seen in adults with antisocial personality disorder. They have little empathy for others, do not feel "bad" or guilty or show remorse for their behavior, have shallow or superficial emotions, and are unconcerned about poor performance at school or home. These children have low self-esteem, poor frustration tolerance, and temper outbursts. Conduct disorder is frequently associated with early onset of sexual behavior, drinking, smoking, use of illegal substances, and other reckless or risky behaviors. In the United States, 8% of children and adolescents have conduct disorder (Valley Behavioral Health, 2019). Onset of conduct disorder behaviors before age 10 occurs primarily in boys; onset after</p>
<p>992</p>
<p>age 10 occurs in girls and boys. As many as 30% to 50% of these children are diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder as adults (Connor, 2017).</p>

<p>Two subtypes of conduct disorder are based on age at onset. The childhood-onset type involves symptoms before 10 years of age, including physical aggression toward others and disturbed peer relationships. These children are more likely to have persistent conduct disorder and develop antisocial personality disorder as adults. Adolescent-onset type is defined by no behaviors of conduct disorder until after 10 years of age. These adolescents are less likely to be aggressive, and they have more normal peer relationships. They are less likely to have persistent conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder as adults.</p>
<p>Behaviors associated with conduct disorders fall into categories of</p>
<p>993</p>
<p>aggression, destruction, deceit/theft, and rule violation, but they can vary in intensity. They are often described as mild, moderate, or severe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mild: The child has some conduct problems that cause relatively minor harm to others. Examples include repeated lying, truancy, minor shoplifting, and staying out late without permission.</li>
<li>Moderate: The number of conduct problems increases as does the amount of harm to others. Examples include vandalism, conning others, running away from home, verbal bullying and intimidation, drinking alcohol, and sexual promiscuity.</li>
<li>Severe: The person has many conduct problems that cause considerable harm to others. Examples include forced sex, cruelty to animals, physical fights, cruelty to peers, use of a weapon, burglary, robbery, and violation of previous parole or probation requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The course of conduct disorder is variable. People with the adolescent-onset type or mild problems can achieve adequate social relationships and academic or occupational success as adults. Those with the childhood-onset type or more severe problem behaviors are more likely to develop antisocial personality disorder as adults. Even those who do not have antisocial personality disorder may lead troubled lives with difficult interpersonal relationships, unhealthy lifestyles, and an inability to support themselves.</p>

<p>Researchers generally accept that genetic vulnerability, environmental adversity, and factors such as poor coping interact to cause the disorder. Risk factors include poor parenting, low academic achievement, poor peer relationships, and low self-esteem; protective factors include resilience, family support, positive peer relationships, and good health (Gescher et al., 2018).</p>
<p>There is a genetic risk for conduct disorder, though no specific gene marker has been identified. The disorder is more common in children who have a sibling with conduct disorder or a parent with antisocial personality disorder, substance abuse, mood disorder, schizophrenia, or ADHD.</p>
<p>A lack of reactivity of the autonomic nervous system has been found in children with conduct disorder; this unresponsiveness is similar to adults with antisocial personality disorder. The abnormality may cause more aggression in social relationships as a result of decreased normal avoidance or social inhibitions. Research into the role of neurotransmitters is promising.</p>
<p>Poor family functioning, marital discord, poor parenting, and a family</p>
<p>994</p>
<p>history of substance abuse and psychiatric problems are all associated with the development of conduct disorder. Studies have shown that adolescents with conduct disorder had their first experience with alcohol and other drugs before age 12 years and were more likely to engage in higher risk behaviors, including, but not limited to, continued alcohol and substance use (Connor, 2017). Prenatal exposure to alcohol causes an increased risk for conduct disorder. Child abuse is an especially significant risk factor (Carliner, Gary, McLaughlin, &amp; Keyes, 2017). The specific parenting patterns considered ineffective are inconsistent parental responses to the child's demands and giving in to demands as the child's behavior escalates. Exposure to violence in the media and community is a contributing factor for the child at risk in other areas. Socioeconomic disadvantages, such as inadequate housing, crowded conditions, and poverty, also increase the likelihood of conduct disorder in at-risk children.</p>
<p>Academic underachievement, learning disabilities, hyperactivity, and problems with attention span are all associated with conduct disorder. Children with conduct disorder have difficulty functioning in social situations. They lack the abilities to respond appropriately to others and to negotiate conflict, and they lose the ability to restrain themselves when emotionally stressed. They are often accepted only by peers with similar problems.</p>

<p><strong>CLINICAL VIGNETTE: Conduct Disorder</strong></p>
<p>Tom, 14 years of age, leaves the principal’s office after being involved in a physical fight in the hall. He knows his parents will be furious because he is suspended for 1 week. “It wasn’t my fault,” he thinks to himself. “What am I supposed to do when someone calls me names?” Tom is angry that he even came to school today; he’d much rather spend time hanging out with his friends and having a few drinks or smoking pot.</p>
<p>On his way home, Tom sees a car parked next to the grocery store, and it is unlocked and running. Tom jumps in, thinking, “This is my lucky day!” He speeds away, but soon he can hear police sirens as a patrol car closes in on him. He is eventually stopped and arrested. As he waits for his parents at the station, he’s not sure what to do next. He tells the police officer that the car belongs to a friend, and he just borrowed it. He promises never to get into trouble again if the officer will let him go. But the officer has Tom’s record, which includes school truancy, underage drinking, suspicion in the disappearance of a neighbor’s pet cat, and shoplifting.</p>
<p>995</p>
<p>When Tom’s father arrives, he smacks Tom across the face and says, “You stupid kid! I told you the last time you’d better straighten up. And look at you now! What a sorry excuse for a son!” Tom slumps in his chair with a sullen, defiant look on his face. “Go ahead and hit me! Who cares? I’m not gonna do what you say, so you might as well give up!”</p>

<p>Children respond in different ways to environmental pressures and adversity. Some children externalize their emotional issues by directing anger and frustration into aggressive or delinquent behavior, putting them at risk for diagnoses of ODD and conduct disorder. Other children experiencing the same pressures may internalize their emotions, resulting in somatic complaints, withdrawal, isolative behavior, and problems with anxiety and depression. Box 23.1 lists examples of externalizing behaviors and internalizing behaviors. These behavioral patterns correspond to the problems with self-regulation of emotions (internalizing) and behavior (externalizing).</p>

<p>Concerns have been raised that "difficult" children may be mistakenly labeled as having conduct disorder. Knowing the client's history and circumstances is essential for accurate diagnosis. In high-crime areas, aggressive behavior may be protective and not necessarily indicative of conduct disorder. In immigrants from war-ravaged countries, aggressive behavior may have been necessary for survival, so these individuals should not be diagnosed with conduct disorder. Disruptive behavior disorders are the most frequent diagnoses for children world-wise (Valley Behavioral Health, 2019).</p>

<p>Many treatments have been used for conduct disorder with only modest effectiveness. Early intervention is more effective, and prevention is more effective than treatment. Dramatic interventions, such as "boot camp" or incarceration, have not proved effective and may even worsen the situation. Treatment must be geared toward the client's developmental age; no one treatment is suitable for all ages. Preschool programs, such as Head Start, result in lower rates of delinquent behavior and conduct disorder through use</p>
<p>of parental education about normal growth and development, stimulation for the child, and parental support during crises.</p>
<p>For school-aged children with conduct disorder, the child, family, and school environment are the focus of treatment. Techniques include parenting education, social skills training to improve peer relationships, and attempts to improve academic performance and increase the child’s ability to comply with demands from authority figures. Family therapy is considered to be essential for children in this age group (Carr, Hartnett, Brosnan, &amp; Sharry, 2017).</p>
<p>Adolescents rely less on their parents and more on peers, so treatment for this age group includes individual therapy. Many adolescent clients have some involvement with the legal system as a result of criminal behavior, and consequently, they may have restrictions on their freedom. Use of alcohol and other drugs plays a more significant role for this age group; any treatment plan must address this issue. The most promising treatment approach includes keeping the client in his or her environment with family and individual therapies. The plan usually includes conflict resolution, anger management, and teaching social skills.</p>
<p>Medications alone have little effect, but may be used in conjunction with treatment for specific symptoms. For example, the client who presents a clear danger to others (physical aggression) may be prescribed an antipsychotic medication, such as risperidone (Risperdal). Clients with labile moods may benefit from lithium or another mood stabilizer such as carbamazepine (Tegretol) or valproic acid (Depakote) (Connor, 2017).</p>

<p>Children with conduct disorder have a history of disturbed relationships with peers, aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, and serious violation of rules (e.g., truancy, running away from home, staying out all night without permission). The behaviors and problems may be mild to severe.</p>

<p>Appearance, speech, and motor behavior are typically normal for the age group but may be somewhat extreme (e.g., body piercings, tattoos, hairstyle, clothing). These clients often slouch and are sullen and unwilling to be interviewed. They may use profanity, call the nurse or physician names, and make disparaging remarks about parents, teachers, police, and other authority figures.</p>

<p>Clients may be quiet and reluctant to talk, or they may be openly hostile and angry. Their attitude is likely to be disrespectful toward parents, the nurse, or anyone in a position of authority. Irritability, frustration, and temper outbursts are common. Clients may be unwilling to answer questions or cooperate with the interview; they believe they do not need help or treatment. If a client has legal problems, he or she may express superficial guilt or remorse, but it is unlikely that these emotions are sincere.</p>

<p>Thought processes are usually intact—that is, clients are capable of logical rational thinking. Nevertheless, they perceive the world to be aggressive and threatening, and they respond in the same manner. Clients may be preoccupied with looking out for themselves and behave as though everyone is "out to get me." Thoughts or fantasies about death or violence are common.</p>

<p>Although these clients generally try to appear tough, their self-esteem is low. They do not value themselves any more than they value others.

<p>Relationships with others, especially those in authority, are disruptive and may be violent. This includes parents, teachers, police, and most other adults. Verbal and physical aggression is common. Siblings may be a target for ridicule or aggression. Relationships with peers are limited to others who display similar behaviors; these clients see peers who follow rules as dumb or afraid. Clients usually have poor grades, have been expelled, or have dropped out. It is unlikely that they have a job (if old enough) because they would prefer to steal. Their idea of fulfilling roles is being tough, breaking rules, and taking advantage of others.</p>

<p>Clients are often at risk for unplanned pregnancy and STDs because of their early and frequent sexual behavior. Use of drugs and alcohol is an additional risk to health.

<p>The nurse must protect others from the manipulative or aggressive behaviors common with these clients. He or she must set limits on unacceptable behavior at the beginning of treatment. Limit setting involves the following three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inform clients of the rule or limit.</li>
<li>Explain the consequences if clients exceed the limit.</li>
<li>State expected behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p>Providing consistent limit enforcement with no exceptions by all members of the health team, including parents, is essential. For example, the nurse might say,</p>
<p>&gt; “It is unacceptable to hit another person. If you are angry, tell a staff person about your anger. If you hit someone, you will be restricted from recreation time for 24 hours.”</p>
<p>For limit setting to be effective, the consequences must have meaning for clients—that is, they must value or desire recreation time, for this example. If a client wanted to be alone in his or her room, then this consequence would not be effective.</p>
<p>The nurse can negotiate with a client a behavioral contract outlining expected behaviors, limits, and rewards to increase treatment compliance. The client can refer to the written agreement to remember expectations, and staff can refer to the agreement if the client tries to change any terms. A contract can help staff avoid power struggles over requests for special favors or attempts to alter treatment goals or behavioral expectations.</p>
<p>Whether there is a written contract or treatment plan, staff must be</p>
<p>1003</p>
<p>consistent with these clients. They will attempt to bend or break rules, blame others for noncompliance, or make excuses for behavior. Consistency in following the treatment plan is essential to decrease manipulation.</p>
<p>Time-out is retreat to a neutral place so clients can regain self-control. It is not a punishment. When a client’s behavior begins to escalate, such as when he or she yells at or threatens someone, a time-out may prevent aggression or acting out. Staff may need to institute a time-out for clients if they are unwilling or unable to do so. Eventually, the goal is for clients recognize signs of increasing agitation and take a self-instituted time-out to control emotions and outbursts. After the time-out, the nurse should discuss the events with the client. Doing so can help clients to recognize situations that trigger emotional responses and to learn more effective ways of dealing with similar situations in the future. Providing positive feedback for successful efforts at avoiding aggression helps reinforce new behaviors for clients.</p>

<p>It helps for clients to have a schedule of daily activities, including hygiene, school, homework, and leisure time. Clients are more likely to establish positive habits if they have routine expectations about tasks and responsibilities. They are more likely to follow a daily routine if they have input concerning the schedule.</p>

<p>The nurse must show acceptance of clients as worthwhile individuals even if their behavior is unacceptable. This means that the nurse must be matter of fact about setting limits and must not make judgmental statements about clients. He or she must focus only on the behavior. For example, if a client broke a chair during an angry outburst, the nurse would say,</p>
<p>“John, breaking chairs is unacceptable behavior. You need to let staff know you’re upset so you can talk about it instead of acting out.”</p>
<p>The nurse must avoid saying things like,</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with you? Don’t you know any better?”</p>
<p>Comments such as these are subjective and judgmental and do not focus on the specific behavior; they reinforce the client’s self-image as a “bad person.”</p>
<p>Clients with a conduct disorder often have a tough exterior and are unable or reluctant to discuss feelings and emotions. Keeping a diary may help them identify and express their feelings. The nurse can discuss these feelings with clients and explore better, safer expressions than through aggression or acting out.</p>
<p>Clients may also need to learn how to solve problems effectively. Problem-solving involves identifying the problem, exploring all possible solutions, choosing and implementing one of the alternatives, and evaluating the results (see Chapter 10). The nurse can help clients work on actual problems using this process. Problem-solving skills are likely to improve with practice.</p>

<p>Clients with conduct disorder may not have age-appropriate social skills,</p>
<p>1005</p>
<p>so teaching social skills is important. The nurse can role model these skills and help clients practice appropriate social interaction. The nurse identifies what is not appropriate, such as profanity and name calling, and also what is appropriate. Clients may have little experience discussing the news, current events, sports, or other topics. As they begin to develop social skills, the nurse can include other peers in these discussions. Positive feedback is essential to let clients know they are meeting expectations.</p>

<p>Parents may also need help in learning social skills, solving problems, and behaving appropriately. Often, parents have their own problems, and they have had difficulties with the client for a long time before treatment was instituted. Parents need to replace old patterns such as yelling, hitting, or simply ignoring behavior with more effective strategies. The nurse can teach parents age-appropriate activities and expectations for clients, such as reasonable curfews, household responsibilities, and acceptable behavior at home. The parents may need to learn effective limit setting with appropriate consequences. Parents often need to learn to communicate their feelings and expectations clearly and directly to these clients. Some parents may need to let clients experience the consequences of their behavior rather than rescuing them. For example, if a client gets a speeding ticket, the parents should not pay the fine for him or her. If a client causes a disturbance in school and receives detention, the parents can support the teacher's actions instead of blaming the teacher or school.</p>

<p>Clients with conduct disorder are seen in acute care settings only when their behavior is severe and only for short periods of stabilization. Much long-term work takes place at school and home or another community setting. Some clients are placed outside the parents' homes for short or long periods. Group homes, halfway houses, and residential treatment settings are designed to provide safe, structured environments and adequate supervision if that cannot be provided at home. Clients with legal issues may be placed in detention facilities, jails, or jail-diversion programs. Chapter 4 discusses treatment settings and programs.</p>

<p>Parental behavior profoundly influences children's behavior. Parents who engage in risky behaviors, such as smoking, drinking, and ignoring their health, are more likely to have children who also engage in risky behaviors, including early unprotected sex. Group-based parenting classes, as well as individual parent behavior therapy with the child, were both effective to deal with problem behaviors in children and improve parenting skills and</p>
<p>confidence (Kaminski &amp; Claussen, 2017).</p>
<p>The SNAP-IV Teacher and Parent Rating Scale (Swanson, 2000) is an assessment tool that can be used for initial evaluation in many areas of concern such as ADHD, ODD, conduct disorder, and depression (see Chapter 22, Box 22.3). Such tools can identify problems or potential problems that signal a need for further evaluation and follow-up. Early detection and successful intervention is often the key to mental health promotion.</p>

<p>Juveniles often have contact with the law, initially for minor offenses. As part of a juvenile-diversion program, there is opportunity to engage both the client and parents in a program of adaptive treatment strategies, often resulting in successful outcomes. If the client returns to the community without interventions and there are no interventions for parents, it is likely there will be repeat offenses. Additionally, parents cannot change parenting strategies or learn new ones without assistance,</p>
<p>The next step would be making active participation a requirement for the diversion program. It may be the only opportunity for early intervention to prevent conduct disorders or further criminal behavior.</p>

<p>Working with parents and families is a crucial aspect of dealing with children with these disruptive behavior disorders. Parents often have the most influence on how these children learn to cope with their disorders. The nurse's beliefs and values about raising children affect how he or she deals with children and parents. The nurse may also have personal feelings about the disruptive and/or aggressive behaviors, such as thinking that the client should</p>
<p>1008</p>
<p>be able to refrain from hostility and aggression through use of willpower. It can be difficult to reconcile holding clients accountable for their behaviors while avoiding a purely punitive attitude.</p>
<p>Working with aggressive clients of any age may provoke anxiety and fears for personal safety in the nurse. The nurse may even have angry feelings toward the aggressive client. Safety of clients and staff is a priority when working with aggressive clients (see Chapter 11). It is important for the nurse to discuss feelings, fears, or frustrations with colleagues to keep negative emotions from interfering with the ability to provide care to clients with problems with aggression.</p>

<ul>
<li>Disruptive behavior disorders are characterized by persistent patterns of behavior involving anger, hostility, and aggression toward people and property, including ODD, conduct disorder, and IED.</li>
</ul>
<p>1009</p>
<ul>
<li>ODD involves an enduring pattern of uncooperative, defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority figures that far exceeds periodic negative behavior seen in adolescence. Children and adolescents with ODD do not associate their behavior with consequences but blame others for their problems.</li>
<li>Treatment goals for ODD involve learning appropriate behavior and refraining from inappropriate behavior.</li>
<li>Parent management training is based on behavioral principles of decreasing reinforcing attention for negative behaviors, rewarding positive behaviors, and consistent expectations and consequences for both. This training is used for parents of children with ODD and conduct disorder.</li>
<li>Conduct disorder, the most common disruptive behavior disorder, is characterized by aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness and theft, and serious violation of rules.</li>
<li>Interventions for conduct disorder include decreasing violent behavior, increasing compliance, improving coping skills and self-esteem, promoting social interaction, and educating and supporting parents.</li>
<li>Children and adolescents with ODD and conduct disorder may be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorders as adults. Most at risk are clients with more severe conduct behaviors and early onset (before age 10 years) of those behaviors.</li>
<li>Time-out is retreat to a neutral place so that clients can regain self-control.</li>

<p>John is a 12-year-old boy newly diagnosed with ODD. His parents have come to the mental health center, reporting they “are having problems at home and don’t know what we should do.” John argues about everything, will not follow any rules made by his parents, and is having trouble at school, both academic and behavioral. He has been to the principal’s office three times in the past week and is facing expulsion for the next violation. John replies, “Good, I hate the principal anyway; that way I won’t have to see him.” John’s parents report trying all kinds of punishment for his behavior, such as no video games, time-out, and talking and bargaining with him with no results. In this past week, John has begun to strike out physically, kicking furniture and making threatening statements to his parents.</p>
<p>After meeting with the physician, the parents are referred to parent management training as well as counseling. The physician prescribes risperidone (Risperdal) 0.5 mg PO daily to help with the aggressive and destructive behavior. The nurse meets with the parents to provide teaching and answer questions before they go home.</p>

<p>Cognition is the brain's ability to process, retain, and use information. Cognitive abilities include reasoning, judgment, perception, attention, comprehension, and memory. These cognitive abilities are essential for many important tasks, including making decisions, solving problems, interpreting the environment, and learning new information.</p>
<p>A cognitive disorder is a disruption or impairment in these higher level functions of the brain. Cognitive disorders can have devastating effects on the ability to function in daily life. They can cause people to forget the names of immediate family members, be unable to perform daily household tasks, and neglect personal hygiene.</p>
<p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) previously categorized adult cognitive disorders as dementia, delirium, and amnestic disorders. Those categories have been reconceptualized in the DSM-5 as neurocognitive disorders (NCDs). This now includes delirium, major NCD, mild NCD, and their subtypes by etiology. The term dementia is still used, even in the DSM-5, and also in the literature and by practitioners.</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on delirium and dementia. It emphasizes not only the care of clients with cognitive disorders but also the needs of their caregivers.</p>

<p>Delirium is a syndrome that involves a disturbance of consciousness accompanied by a change in cognition. Delirium usually develops over a short period, sometimes a matter of hours, and fluctuates, or changes, throughout the course of the day. Clients with delirium have difficulty paying attention, are easily distracted and disoriented, and may have sensory disturbances such as illusions, misinterpretations, or hallucinations. An electrical cord on the floor may appear to them as a snake (illusion). They may mistake the banging of a laundry cart in the hallway for a gunshot (misinterpretation). They may see “angels” hovering above when nothing is there (hallucination). At times, they also experience disturbances in the sleep-wake cycle, changes in psychomotor activity, and emotional problems such as anxiety, fear, irritability, euphoria, or apathy.</p>
<p>Elderly patients are the group most frequently diagnosed with delirium. Between 14% and 24% of people admitted to the hospital for general medical conditions are delirious, which may worsen in the hospital. Delirium is reported in 10% to 15% of general surgical patients, 30% of open heart surgery patients, and more than 50% of patients treated for fractured hips. Delirium develops in 80% of terminally ill patients. In many cases, the causes of delirium are multiple stressors, such as trauma to the central nervous system (CNS), drug toxicity or withdrawal, and metabolic disturbances related to organ failure (Fabian &amp; Solai, 2017). Risk factors for delirium include increased severity of physical illness, older age, hearing impairment, decreased food and fluid intake, medications, and baseline cognitive impairment such as that seen in dementia. Children may be more susceptible to delirium, especially that related to a febrile illness or certain medications such as anticholinergics.</p>

<p>Delirium almost always results from an identifiable physiological, metabolic, or cerebral disturbance or disease or from drug intoxication or withdrawal. The most common causes are listed in Box 24.1. Often, delirium results from multiple causes and requires a careful and thorough physical examination and laboratory tests for identification.</p>

<p>People from different cultural backgrounds may not be familiar with the information requested to assess memory, such as the name of former U.S. presidents. Other cultures may consider orientation to placement and location differently. Also, some cultures and religions, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, do not celebrate birthdays, so clients may have difficulty stating their date of birth. The nurse should not mistake failure to know such information for disorientation.</p>

<p>The primary treatment for delirium is to identify and treat any causal or contributing medical conditions. Delirium is almost always a transient condition that clears with successful treatment of the underlying cause. Nevertheless, some causes such as head injury or encephalitis may leave clients with cognitive, behavioral, or emotional impairments even after the underlying cause resolves. People who have had delirium are at higher risk for future episodes.</p>

<p>Clients with quiet, hypoactive delirium need no specific pharmacologic treatment aside from that indicated for the causative condition. Many clients</p>
<p>with delirium, however, show persistent or intermittent psychomotor agitation, psychosis, and/or insomnia that can interfere with effective treatment or pose a risk to safety. Sedation to prevent inadvertent self-injury may be indicated. An antipsychotic medication, such as haloperidol (Haldol), may be used in doses of 0.5 to 1 mg to decrease agitation and psychotic symptoms, as well as to facilitate sleep. Haloperidol is useful in a variety of situations because it can be administered orally, intramuscularly (IM), or intravenously (IV). Historically, short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam (Ativan), have been used, but benzodiazepines may worsen delirium, especially in the elderly. Their use should be reserved for treatment of sedative-hypnotic withdrawal (Fabian &amp; Solai, 2017). Clients with impaired liver or kidney function could have difficulty metabolizing or excreting sedatives. The exception is delirium induced by alcohol withdrawal, which is usually treated with benzodiazepines (see Chapter 19).</p>

<p>While the underlying causes of delirium are being treated, clients may also need other supportive physical measures. Adequate nutritious food and fluid intake speed recovery. IV fluids or even total parenteral nutrition may be necessary if a client's physical condition has deteriorated and he or she cannot eat and drink.</p>
<p>If a client becomes agitated and threatens to dislodge IV tubing or catheters, physical restraints may be necessary so that needed medical treatments can continue. Restraints are used only when necessary and stay in place no longer than warranted because they may increase the client's agitation.</p>

<p>Nursing care for clients with delirium focuses on meeting their physiological and psychological needs and maintaining their safety. Behavior, mood, and level of consciousness of these clients can fluctuate rapidly throughout the day. Therefore, the nurse must assess them continuously to recognize changes and to plan nursing care accordingly.</p>

<p>Because the causes of delirium are often related to medical illness, alcohol, or other drugs, the nurse obtains a thorough history of these areas. The nurse may need to obtain information from family members if a client's ability to provide accurate data is impaired.</p>
<p>Information about drugs should include prescribed medications, alcohol, illicit drugs, and over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Although many people perceive prescribed and OTC medications as relatively safe, combinations or standard doses of medications can produce delirium, especially in older adults. Box 24.2 lists types of drugs that can cause delirium. Combinations of these drugs significantly increase risk.</p>

<p>Clients with delirium often have a disturbance of psychomotor behavior. They may be restless and hyperactive, frequently picking at bed clothes or making sudden, uncoordinated attempts to get out of bed. Conversely, clients may have slowed motor behavior, appearing sluggish and lethargic with little movement.</p>

<p>On a hot and humid August afternoon, the 911 dispatcher received a call requesting an ambulance for an elderly woman who had collapsed on the sidewalk in a residential area. According to neighbors gathered at the scene, the woman had been wandering around the neighborhood since early morning. No one recognized her, and several people had tried to approach her to offer help or give directions. She would not or could not give her name or address; much of her speech was garbled and hard to understand. She was not carrying a purse or identification. She finally collapsed and appeared unconscious, so they called emergency services.</p>
<p>The woman was taken to the emergency department. She was perspiring profusely, was found to have a fever of 103.2°F, and was grossly dehydrated. IV therapy was started to replenish fluids and electrolytes. A cooling blanket was applied to lower her temperature, and she was monitored closely over the next several hours. As the woman began to regain consciousness, she was confused and could not provide any useful information about herself. Her speech remained garbled and confused. Several times she attempted to climb out of the bed and remove her IV device, so restraints were used to prevent injury and to allow treatment to continue.</p>
<p>By the end of the second day in the hospital, she could accurately give her name, address, and some of the circumstances surrounding the incident. She remembered she had been gardening in her backyard in the sun and felt very hot. She remembered thinking she should go back in the house to get a cold drink and rest. That was the last thing she remembered.</p>

<p>Speech may also be affected, becoming less coherent and more difficult to understand as delirium worsens.

<p>Clients with delirium often have rapid and unpredictable mood shifts. A wide range of emotional responses is possible, such as anxiety, fear, irritability, anger, euphoria, and apathy. These mood shifts and emotions usually have nothing to do with the client’s environment. When clients are particularly fearful and feel threatened, they may become combative to defend themselves from perceived harm.</p>

<p>Although clients with delirium have changes in cognition, it is difficult for the nurse to assess these changes accurately and thoroughly. Marked inability to sustain attention makes it difficult to assess thought process and content. Thought content in delirium is often unrelated to the situation, or speech is illogical and difficult to understand. The nurse may ask how clients are feeling, and they will mumble about the weather. Thought processes are often disorganized and make no sense. Thoughts also may be fragmented (disjointed and incomplete). Clients may exhibit delusions, believing that their altered sensory perceptions are real.</p>

<p>The primary and often initial sign of delirium is an altered level of consciousness that is seldom stable and usually fluctuates throughout the day. Clients are usually oriented to people but frequently disoriented to time and place. They demonstrate decreased awareness of the environment or situation and instead may focus on irrelevant stimuli such as the color of the bedspread or the room. Noises, people, or sensory misperceptions easily distract them.</p>
<p>Clients cannot focus, sustain, or shift attention effectively, and there is impaired recent and immediate memory. This means the nurse may have to ask questions or provide directions repeatedly. Even then, clients may be unable to do what is requested.</p>
<p>Clients frequently experience misinterpretations, illusions, and hallucinations. Both misperceptions and illusions are based on some actual</p>
<p>1024</p>
<p>stimuli in the environment; clients may hear a door slam and interpret it as a gunshot or see the nurse reach for an IV bag and believe the nurse is about to strike them. Examples of common illusions include clients believing that IV tubing or an electrical cord is a snake and mistaking the nurse for a family member. Hallucinations are most often visual; clients "see" things for which there is no stimulus in reality. When more lucid, some clients are aware that they are experiencing sensory misperceptions. Others, however, actually believe their misinterpretations are correct and cannot be convinced otherwise.</p>

<p>Judgment is impaired. Clients often cannot perceive potentially harmful situations or act in their own best interests. For example, they may try repeatedly to pull out IV tubing or urinary catheters; this causes pain and interferes with necessary treatment.</p>
<p>Insight depends on the severity of the delirium. Clients with mild delirium may recognize that they are confused, are receiving treatment, and will likely improve. Those with severe delirium may have no insight into the situation.</p>

<p>Although delirium has no direct effect on self-concept, clients often are frightened or feel threatened. Those with some awareness of the situation may feel helpless or powerless to do anything to change it. If delirium has resulted from alcohol, illicit drug use, or overuse of prescribed medications, clients may feel guilt, shame, and humiliation, or think, "I'm a bad person; I did this to myself." This would indicate possible long-term problems with self-concept.</p>

<p>Clients with delirium most often experience disturbed sleep-wake cycles that may include difficulty falling asleep, daytime sleepiness, nighttime agitation, or even a complete reversal of the usual daytime waking/nighttime sleeping pattern. At times, clients also ignore or fail to perceive internal body cues such as hunger, thirst, or the urge to urinate or defecate.</p>

<p>Maintaining the client’s safety is the priority focus of nursing interventions. Medications should be used judiciously because sedatives may worsen confusion and increase the risk for falls or other injuries.</p>
<p>The nurse teaches clients to request assistance for activities such as getting out of bed or going to the bathroom. If clients cannot request assistance, they require close supervision to prevent them from attempting activities they cannot perform safely alone. The nurse responds promptly to calls from clients for assistance and checks clients at frequent intervals.</p>
<p>If a client is agitated or pulling at IV lines or catheters, physical restraints may be necessary. Use of restraints, however, may increase the client’s fears or feelings of being threatened, so restraints are a last resort. The nurse first tries other strategies such as having a family member stay with the client to reassure him or her.</p>

<p>The nurse approaches these clients calmly and speaks in a clear low voice. It is important to give realistic reassurance to clients, such as</p>
<p>&gt; “I know things are upsetting and confusing right now, but your confusion should clear as you get better.” (validating/giving information)</p>
<p>Facing clients while speaking helps capture their attention. The nurse provides explanations that clients can comprehend, avoiding lengthy or too detailed discussions. The nurse phrases questions or provides directions to clients in short, simple sentences, allowing adequate time for clients to grasp the content or respond to a question. He or she permits clients to make decisions as they are able to and takes care not to overwhelm or frustrate them.</p>
<p>The nurse provides orienting cues when talking with clients, such as calling them by name and referring to the time of day or expected activity. For example, the nurse might say,</p>
<p>&gt; “Good morning, Mrs. Jones. I see you are awake and look ready for breakfast.” (giving information)</p>
<p>Reminding the client of the nurse’s name and role repeatedly may be necessary, such as</p>
<p>&gt; “My name is Sheila, and I’m your nurse today. I’m here now to walk</p>
<p>1028</p>
<p>in the hall with you." (reality orientation)</p>
<p>Orienting objects such as a calendar and clock in the client's room are useful.</p>
<p>Often, the use of touch reassures clients and provides contact with reality. It is important to evaluate each client's response to touch rather than to assume all clients welcome it. A client who smiles or draws closer to the nurse when touched is responding positively. The fearful client may perceive touch as threatening rather than comforting and startle or draw away.</p>
<p>Clients with delirium can experience sensory overload, which means more stimulation is coming into the brain than they can handle. Reducing environmental stimulation is helpful because these clients are easily distracted and overstimulated. Minimizing environmental noises, including television or radio, should calm them. It is also important to monitor response to visitors. Too many visitors or more than one person talking at once may increase the client's confusion. The nurse can explain to visitors that the client will best tolerate quiet talking with one person at a time.</p>
<p>The client's room should be well lit to minimize environmental misperceptions. When clients experience illusions or misperceptions, the nurse corrects them matter-of-factly. It is important to validate the client's feelings of anxiety or fear generated by the misperception, but not to reinforce that misperception. For example, a client hears a loud noise in the hall and asks the nurse,</p>
<p>“Was that an explosion?”</p>
<p>The nurse might respond,</p>
<p>“No, that was a cart banging in the hall. It was really loud, wasn’t it? It startled me a little when I heard it.” (presenting reality/validating feelings)</p>

<p>The nurse monitors the client's sleep and elimination patterns and food and fluid intake. Clients may require prompting or assistance to eat and drink adequate food and fluids. It may be helpful to sit with clients at meals or to frequently offer fluids. Family members also may be able to</p>
<p>1029</p>
<p>help clients improve their intake. Assisting clients to the bathroom periodically may be necessary to promote elimination if clients do not make these requests independently.</p>
<p>Promoting a balance of rest and sleep is important if clients are experiencing a disturbed sleep pattern. Discouraging or limiting daytime napping may improve ability to sleep at night. It is also important for clients to have some exercise during the day to promote nighttime sleep. Activities could include sitting in a chair, walking in the hall, or engaging in diversional activities (as possible).</p>

<p>Even when the cause of delirium is identified and treated, clients may not regain all cognitive functions, or problems with confusion may persist. Because delirium and dementia frequently occur together, clients may have dementia. A thorough medical evaluation can confirm dementia, and appropriate treatment and care can be initiated (see the section "Dementia").</p>
<p>When delirium has cleared and any other diagnoses have been eliminated, it may be necessary for the nurse or other health care professionals to initiate referrals to home health, visiting nurses, or a rehabilitation program if clients continue to experience cognitive problems. Various community programs provide such care, including adult day care or residential care. Clients who have ongoing cognitive deficits after an episode of delirium may have difficulties similar to those of clients with head injuries or mild dementia. Clients and family members or caregivers might benefit from support groups to help them deal with the changes in personality and remaining cognitive or motor deficits.</p>

<p>Dementia refers to a disease process marked by progressive cognitive impairment with no change in the level of consciousness. It involves multiple cognitive deficits, initially, memory impairment, and later, the following cognitive disturbances may be seen (Graziane &amp; Sweet, 2017):</p>
<ul>
<li>Aphasia, which is deterioration of language function</li>
<li>Apraxia, which is impaired ability to execute motor functions despite</li>
</ul>
<p>intact motor abilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Agnosia, which is inability to recognize or name objects despite intact sensory abilities</li>
<li>Disturbance in executive functioning, which is the ability to think abstractly and to plan, initiate, sequence, monitor, and stop complex behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>These cognitive deficits must be sufficiently severe to impair social or occupational functioning and must represent a decline from previous functioning. In the DSM-5, mild NCD refers to a mild cognitive decline, and a modest impairment of performance that doesn't prevent independent living but may require some accommodation or assistance. A major NCD refers to a significant cognitive decline and a substantial impairment in performance that interferes with activities of daily independent living. As people progress from mild to major NCD, it is not always easy for the diagnostician to decide which one to use (Graziane &amp; Sweet, 2017).</p>

<p>Memory impairment is the prominent early sign of dementia. Clients have difficulty learning new material and forget previously learned material. Initially, recent memory is impaired—for example, forgetting where certain objects were placed or that food is cooking on the stove. In later stages, dementia affects remote memory; clients forget the names of adult children, their lifelong occupations, and even their names.</p>
<p>Aphasia usually begins with the inability to name familiar objects or people and then progresses to speech that becomes vague or empty with excessive use of terms such as it or thing. Clients may exhibit echolalia (echoing what is heard) or palilalia (repeating words or sounds over and over). Apraxia may</p>
<p>cause clients to lose the ability to perform routine self-care activities such as dressing or cooking. Agnosia is frustrating for clients; they may look at a table and chair but are unable to name them. Disturbances in executive functioning are evident as clients lose the ability to learn new material, solve problems, or carry out daily activities such as meal planning or budgeting.</p>
<p>Clients with dementia may also underestimate the risks associated with activities or overestimate their ability to function in certain situations. For example, while driving, clients may cut in front of other drivers, sideswipe parked cars, or fail to slow down when they should.</p>

<p>When an underlying, treatable cause is not present, the course of dementia is usually progressive. Dementia is often described in stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mild: Forgetfulness is the hallmark of beginning, mild dementia. It exceeds the normal, occasional forgetfulness experienced as part of the aging process. The person has difficulty finding words, frequently loses objects, and begins to experience anxiety about these losses. Occupational and social settings are less enjoyable, and the person may avoid them. Most people remain in the community during this stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moderate: Confusion is apparent, along with progressive memory loss. The person no longer can perform complex tasks but remains oriented to person and place. He or she still recognizes familiar people. Toward the end of this stage, the person loses the ability to live independently and requires assistance because of disorientation to time and loss of information, such as address and telephone number. The person may remain in the community if adequate caregiver support is available, but some people move to supervised living situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severe: Personality and emotional changes occur. The person may be delusional, wander at night, forget the names of his or her spouse and children, and require assistance with ADLs. Most people live in nursing facilities when they reach this stage, unless extraordinary community support is available.</p>

<p>Causes vary, though the clinical picture is similar for most dementias. Sometimes no definitive diagnosis can be made until completion of a</p>
<p>1034</p>
<p>postmortem examination. Metabolic activity is decreased in the brains of clients with dementia; it is not known whether dementia causes decreased metabolic activity or if decreased metabolic activity results in dementia. A genetic component has been identified for some dementias, such as Huntington disease. An abnormal APOE gene is known to be linked with Alzheimer disease. Other causes of dementia are related to infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The most common types of dementia and their known or hypothesized causes follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alzheimer disease is a progressive brain disorder that has a gradual onset but causes an increasing decline in functioning, including loss of speech, loss of motor function, and profound personality and behavioral changes such as paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, inattention to hygiene, and belligerence. It is evidenced by atrophy of cerebral neurons, senile plaque deposits, and enlargement of the third and fourth ventricles of the brain. Risk for Alzheimer disease increases with age, and average duration from onset of symptoms to death is 8 to 10 years. Research has identified genetic links to both early- and late-onset Alzheimer disease (Graziane &amp; Sweet, 2017).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NCD with Lewy bodies, or Lewy body dementia, is a disorder that involves progressive cognitive impairment and extensive neuropsychiatric symptoms as well as motor symptoms. Delusions and visual hallucinations are common. Functional impairments may initially be more pronounced than cognitive deficits. Several risk genes have been identified, and it can occur in families, though that is less common than no family history (Vergouw et al., 2017).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vascular dementia has symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer disease, but onset is typically abrupt, followed by rapid changes in functioning; a plateau, or leveling-off period; more abrupt changes; another leveling-off period; and so on. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging usually shows multiple vascular lesions of the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures resulting from the decreased blood supply to the brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (originally called Pick disease) is a degenerative brain disease that particularly affects the frontal and temporal lobes and results in a clinical picture similar to that of Alzheimer disease. Early signs include personality changes, loss of social skills and inhibitions, emotional blunting, and language abnormalities. Onset is most commonly 50 to 60 years of age; death occurs in 2 to 5 years. There is a</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1035</p>
<p>strong genetic component, and it tends to run in families (Kobayashi et al., 2018).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prion diseases are caused by a prion (a type of protein) that can trigger normal proteins in the brain to fold abnormally. They are rare, and only 300 cases per year occur in the United States. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the most common prion disease affecting humans. It is a CNS disorder that typically develops in adults aged 40 to 60 years. It involves altered vision, loss of coordination or abnormal movements, and dementia that usually progresses rapidly (a few months). The cause of the encephalopathy is an infectious particle resistant to boiling, some disinfectants (e.g., formalin, alcohol), and ultraviolet radiation. Pressured autoclaving or bleach can inactivate the particle (Sigurdson, Bartz, &amp; Glatzel, 2019). Mad cow disease and kuru (seen largely in New Guinea from eating infected brain tissue) are other prion diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HIV infection can lead to dementia and other neurologic problems; these may result directly from invasion of nervous tissue by HIV or from other acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related illnesses such as toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus. This type of dementia can result in a wide variety of symptoms ranging from mild sensory impairment to gross memory and cognitive deficits to severe muscle dysfunction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parkinson disease is a slowly progressive neurologic condition characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. It results from loss of neurons of the basal ganglia. Dementia has been reported in approximately 25% (mild NCD) to as many as 75% (major NCD) of people with Parkinson disease and is characterized by cognitive and motor slowing, impaired memory, and impaired executive functioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huntington disease is an inherited, dominant gene disease that primarily involves cerebral atrophy, demyelination, and enlargement of the brain ventricles. Initially, there are choreiform movements that are continuous during waking hours and involve facial contortions, twisting, turning, and tongue movements. Personality changes are the initial psychosocial manifestations followed by memory loss, decreased intellectual functioning, and other signs of dementia. The disease begins in the late 30s or early 40s and may last 10 to 20 years or more before death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traumatic brain injury can cause dementia as a direct pathophysiological consequence of head trauma. The degree and type of cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbance depend on the location and extent of the brain injury. When it occurs as a single injury, the dementia is usually stable rather than progressive. Repeated head injury (e.g., from boxing or</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1036</p>
<p>football) may lead to progressive dementia.</p>

<p>Substance- or medication-induced mild or major NCD is characterized by neurocognitive impairment that persists beyond intoxication or withdrawal. The deficits may stabilize or even show some improvement after a sustained period of abstinence. Long-term use of alcohol that results in dementia is called Korsakoff syndrome or dementia. It was previously known as an amnestic disorder since amnesia and confabulation are common (Andreescu &amp; Varon, 2017).</p>
<p>Mild or major NCD due to another medical condition is caused by diseases such as brain tumor, brain metastasis, subdural hematoma, arteritis, renal or hepatic failure, seizures, or multiple sclerosis. Mild or major NCD due to multiple etiologies is caused by more than one distinct cause of those discussed previously. Unspecified NCD is characterized by neurocognitive symptoms that cause the person distress or impairment, but do not meet the criteria for any other NCD. Neurocognitive deficits due to stroke, head injuries, carbon monoxide poisoning, or brain damage from other medical causes were previously classified as amnestic disorders.</p>
<p>An estimated 5 million people in the United States have moderate-to-severe dementia from various causes. It is estimated that there are 4.6 million new cases each year worldwide. Prevalence rises with age; estimated prevalence of moderate-to-severe dementia in people older than 65 years is about 5%, and 20% to 40% of the general population older than 85 years have dementia. Predictions are that by 2050, there will be 18 million Americans with dementia and 114 million people with dementia worldwide (Graziane &amp; Sweet, 2017). Dementia of the Alzheimer type is the most common type in North America (60% of all dementias), Scandinavia, and Europe; vascular dementia is more prevalent in Russia and Japan. Dementia of the Alzheimer type is more common in women; vascular dementia is more common in men.</p>

<p>Clients from other cultures may find the questions used on many assessment tools for dementia difficult or impossible to answer. Examples include the names of former U.S. presidents. To avoid drawing erroneous conclusions, the nurse must be aware of differences in the person's knowledge base.</p>
<p>1037</p>
<p>The nurse must also be aware of different culturally influenced perspectives and beliefs about elderly family members. In many Eastern countries and among Native Americans, elders hold a position of authority, respect, power, and decision-making for the family; this does not change despite memory loss or confusion. For fear of seeming disrespectful, other family members may be reluctant to make decisions or plans for elders with dementia. The nurse must work with family members to accomplish goals without making them feel they have betrayed the revered elder.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, the underlying cause of dementia is identified so that treatment can be instituted. For example, the progress of vascular dementia, the second most common type, may be halted with appropriate treatment of the underlying vascular condition (e.g., changes in diet, exercise, control of hypertension, or diabetes). Improvement of cerebral blood flow may arrest the progress of vascular dementia in some people.</p>
<p>The prognosis for the progressive types of dementia may vary as described earlier, but all prognoses involve progressive deterioration of physical and mental abilities until death. Typically, in the later stages, clients have minimal cognitive and motor function, are totally dependent on caregivers, and are unaware of their surroundings or people in the environment. They may be totally uncommunicative or make unintelligible sounds or attempts to verbalize.</p>
<p>For degenerative dementias, no direct therapies have been found to reverse or retard the fundamental pathophysiological processes. Levels of numerous neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin are decreased in dementia. This has led to attempts at replenishment therapy with acetylcholine precursors, cholinergic agonists, and cholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl, Razadyne, Nivalin) are cholinesterase inhibitors and have shown modest therapeutic effects and temporarily slow the progress of dementia (Table 24.2). They have no effect, however, on the overall course of the disease. Tacrine (Cognex) is also a cholinesterase inhibitor; however, it elevates liver enzymes in about 50% of clients using it. Lab tests to assess liver function are necessary every 1 to 2 weeks; therefore, tacrine is rarely prescribed. Memantine (Namenda) is an NMDA receptor antagonist that can slow the progression of Alzheimer in the moderate or severe stages. Namzaric (memantine and donepezil) is a newer combination of two other medications,</p>

<p>Clients with dementia demonstrate a broad range of behaviors that can be treated symptomatically. Doses of medications are one-half to two-thirds lower than usually prescribed. Antidepressants are effective for significant depressive symptoms; however, they can cause delirium. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are used because they have fewer side effects. Antipsychotics, such as haloperidol (Haldol), olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), and quetiapine (Seroquel), may be used to manage psychotic symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, or paranoia, and other behaviors, such as agitation or aggression. The potential benefit of antipsychotics must be weighed with the risks, such as an increased mortality rate, primarily from cardiovascular complications. Owing to this increased risk, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved antipsychotics for dementia treatment, and there is a black box warning issued. Lithium carbonate, carbamazepine (Tegretol), and valproic acid (Depakote) help stabilize affective lability and diminish aggressive outbursts. Benzodiazepines are used cautiously because they may cause delirium and can worsen already compromised cognitive abilities. These medications are discussed in Chapter 2. Pimavanserin (Nuplazid) has been specifically FDA approved to treat delusions and hallucinations that some experience with</p>
<p>Parkinson disease (Combs &amp; Cox, 2017). One 34-mg capsule per day is the recommended dose. It is known to prolong the Q-T interval.</p>
<p>Both conventional and atypical antipsychotics are associated with an increased risk of mortality in elderly patients treated for dementia-related psychosis.</p>

<p>The assessment process may seem confusing and complicated to clients with dementia. They may not know or may forget the purpose of the interview. The nurse provides simple explanations as often as clients need them, such as "I'm asking these questions so the staff can see how your health is." Clients may become confused or tire easily, so frequent breaks in the interview may be needed. It helps to ask simple rather than compound questions and to allow clients ample time to answer.</p>
<p>A mental status examination can provide information about the client's cognitive abilities, such as memory, concentration, and abstract information processing. Typically, the client is asked to interpret the meaning of a proverb, perform subtraction of figures without paper and pencil, recall the names of objects, make a complete sentence, and copy two intersecting pentagons. Although this does not replace a thorough assessment, it gives a cursory evaluation of the client's cognitive abilities. It is important to remember that people with severe depression or psychosis may also be unable to perform some of these cognitive tasks correctly.</p>

<p>Dementia progressively impairs the ability to carry on meaningful conversation. Clients display aphasia when they cannot name familiar objects or people. Conversation becomes repetitive because they often perseverate on one idea. Eventually, speech may become slurred, followed by a total loss of language function.</p>
<p>The initial finding with regard to motor behavior is the loss of ability to perform familiar tasks (apraxia), such as dressing or combing one's hair, though actual motor abilities are intact. Clients cannot imitate the task when others demonstrate it for them. In the severe stage, clients may experience a gait disturbance that makes unassisted ambulation unsafe, if not impossible.</p>
<p>Some clients with dementia show uninhibited behavior, including making inappropriate jokes, neglecting personal hygiene, showing undue familiarity with strangers, or disregarding social conventions for acceptable behavior.

<p>Initially, clients with dementia experience anxiety and fear over the beginning losses of memory and cognitive functions. Nevertheless, they may not express these feelings to anyone. Mood becomes more labile over time and may shift rapidly and drastically for no apparent reason. Emotional outbursts are common and usually pass quickly. Clients may display anger and hostility, sometimes toward other people. They begin to demonstrate catastrophic emotional reactions in response to environmental changes that clients may not perceive or understand accurately or when they cannot respond adaptively. These catastrophic reactions may include verbal or physical aggression, wandering at night, agitation, or other behaviors that seem to indicate a loss of personal control.</p>

<p>Jack Smith, age 74, and his wife, Marion, age 69, have been living in their home and managing fairly well until lately. The Smiths have two</p>
<p>1041</p>
<p>grown-up children who live out of town but visit about every 2 months and at holidays and birthdays. Jack recently had a stroke and entered a rehabilitation facility to try to learn to walk and talk again. Marion wanted to stay at home and wait for his return. When the children would call to check on her, she would often be crying and confused or frightened. On one visit, they found her looking tired and dressed in a wrinkled, soiled dress. She looked as if she had lost weight, and she couldn't remember what she had eaten for breakfast or lunch.</p>
<p>Marion’s daughter remembered that before her father had the stroke, she had noticed that Jack had taken over several routine tasks her mother had always done, such as making the grocery list and planning and helping with cooking their meals. Her mother seemed more forgetful and would ask the same questions over and over and often related the same story several times during their visits.</p>
<p>A few weeks after Jack entered the rehab center and Marion was living at home alone, the neighbors found Marion wandering around the neighborhood one morning lost and confused. It was now clear to her children that their mother could not remain in her home alone and take care of herself. It was uncertain how long Jack would need to remain at the rehabilitation center, and they were not sure what his physical capabilities would be when he did return.</p>
<p>Her daughter decided that Marion (and eventually Jack) would come to live with her family. They moved her in with them, but even after getting settled at her daughter’s home, Marion continued to be confused and often did not know where she was. She kept asking where Jack was and forgot her grandchildren’s names. At times, she grew agitated and would accuse them of stealing her purse or other possessions. Later, she would always find them. Marion would sometimes forget to go to the bathroom and would soil her clothes. She would forget to bathe or brush her hair and teeth and often needed help with these activities. When her daughter came home from work in the evening, the sandwich she had made for her mother was often left untouched in the refrigerator. Marion spent much of her time packing her bags to go home and “see Jack.”</p>

<p>Initially, the ability to think abstractly is impaired, resulting in loss of the ability to plan, sequence, monitor, initiate, or stop complex behavior. The client loses the ability to solve problems or to take action in new situations</p>
<p>because he or she cannot think about what to do. The ability to generalize knowledge from one situation to another is lost because the client cannot recognize similarities or differences in situations. These problems with cognition make it impossible for the employed client to continue working. The client's ability to perform tasks such as planning activities, budgeting, or planning meals is lost.</p>
<p>As the dementia progresses, delusions of persecution are common. The client may accuse others of stealing objects he or she has lost or may believe he or she is being cheated or pursued.</p>

<p>Clients lose intellectual function, which eventually involves the complete loss of their abilities. Memory deficits are the initial and essential feature of dementia. Dementia first affects recent and immediate memory and then eventually impairs the ability to recognize close family members and even oneself. In mild and moderate dementia, clients may make up answers to fill in memory gaps (confabulation). Agnosia is another hallmark of dementia. Clients lose visual spatial relations, which is often evidenced by deterioration of the ability to write or draw simple objects.</p>
<p>Attention span and ability to concentrate are increasingly impaired until clients lose the ability to do either. Clients are chronically confused about the environment, other people, and, eventually, themselves. Initially, they are disoriented to time in mild dementia, time and place in moderate dementia, and, finally, to self in the severe stage.</p>
<p>Hallucinations are a frequent problem. Visual hallucinations are most common and generally unpleasant. Clients are likely to believe the hallucination is reality.</p>

<p>Clients with dementia have poor judgment in light of the cognitive impairment. They underestimate risks and unrealistically appraise their abilities, which result in a high risk for injury. Clients cannot evaluate situations for risks or danger. For example, they may wander outside in the winter wearing only thin nightclothes and not consider this to be a risk.</p>

<p>Insight is limited. Initially, the client may be aware of problems with memory and cognition and may worry that he or she is "losing my mind." Quite quickly, these concerns about the ability to function diminish, and clients have little or no awareness of the more serious deficits that have developed. In this context, clients may accuse others of stealing possessions that the clients themselves have actually lost or forgotten.</p>

<p>Initially, clients may be angry or frustrated with themselves for losing objects or forgetting important things. Some clients express sadness at their bodies for getting old and at the loss of functioning. Soon, though,</p>
<p>clients lose that awareness of self, which gradually deteriorates until they can look in a mirror and fail to recognize their own reflections.</p>

<p>Dementia profoundly affects the client's roles and relationships. If the client is still employed, work performance suffers, even in the mild stage of dementia, to the point that work is no longer possible given the memory and cognitive deficits. Roles as spouse, partner, or parent deteriorate as clients lose the ability to perform even routine tasks or recognize familiar people. Eventually, clients cannot meet even the most basic needs.</p>
<p>Inability to participate in meaningful conversation or social events severely limits relationships. Clients quickly become confined to the house or apartment because they are unable to venture outside unassisted. Close family members often begin to assume caregiver roles; this can change previously established relationships. Grown children of clients with dementia experience role reversal; that is, they care for parents who once cared for them. Spouses or partners may feel as if they have lost the previous relationship and now are in the role of custodian.</p>

<p>Clients with dementia often experience disturbed sleep-wake cycles; they nap during the day and wander at night. Some clients ignore internal cues such as hunger or thirst; others have little difficulty with eating and drinking until dementia is severe. Clients may experience bladder and even bowel incontinence or have difficulty cleaning themselves after elimination. They frequently neglect bathing and grooming. Eventually, clients are likely to require complete care from someone else to meet these basic physiological needs.</p>

<p>Many nursing diagnoses can be appropriate because the effects of dementia on clients are profound; the disease touches virtually every part of their lives. Commonly used nursing diagnoses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk for injury</li>
<li>Disturbed sleep pattern</li>
<li>Risk for deficient fluid volume</li>
<li>Risk for imbalanced nutrition: Less than body requirements</li>

<li>Impaired environmental interpretation syndrome</li>
<li>Impaired memory</li>
<li>Impaired social interaction</li>
<li>Impaired verbal communication</li>
<li>Ineffective role performance</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the nursing diagnoses of disturbed thought processes and disturbed sensory perception would be appropriate for a client with psychotic symptoms. Multiple nursing diagnoses related to physiological status may also be indicated based on the nurse's assessment, such as alterations in nutrition, hydration, elimination, physical mobility, and activity tolerance.</p>

<p>Treatment outcomes for clients with progressive dementia do not involve regaining or maintaining abilities to function. In fact, the nurse must reassess overall health status and revise treatment outcomes periodically as the client's condition changes. Outcomes and nursing care that focus on the client's medical condition or deficits are common. Current literature proposes a focus on psychosocial care that maximizes the client's strengths and abilities for as long as possible. Psychosocial care involves maintaining the client's independence as long as possible, validating the client's feelings, keeping the client involved in the environment, and dealing with behavioral disruptions respectfully. Treatment outcomes for a client with dementia may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client will be free of injury.</li>
<li>The client will maintain an adequate balance of activity and rest, nutrition, hydration, and elimination.</li>
<li>The client will function as independently as possible given his or her limitations.</li>
<li>The client will feel respected and supported.</li>
<li>The client will remain involved in his or her surroundings.</li>
<li>The client will interact with others in the environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Psychosocial models for care of clients with dementia are based on the approach that each client is a unique person and remains so, even as the disease's progression blocks the client's ability to demonstrate those unique characteristics. Interventions are rooted in the belief that clients</p>
<p>1048</p>
<p>with dementia have personal strengths. They focus on demonstrating caring, keeping clients involved by relating to the environment and other people, and validating feelings and dignity of clients by being responsive to them, offering choices, and reframing (offering alternative points of view to explain events). This is in contrast to medical models of care that focus on progressive loss of function and identity.</p>
<p>Nurses can use the following interventions in any setting for clients with dementia. Education for family members caring for clients at home and for professional caregivers in residential or skilled facilities is an essential component of providing safe and supportive care. The discussion provides examples that apply to various settings.</p>

<p>Safety considerations involve protecting against injury, meeting physiological needs, and managing risks posed by the environment, including internal stimuli such as delusions and hallucinations. Clients cannot accurately appraise the environment and their abilities; therefore, they do not exercise normal caution in daily life. For example, the client living at home may forget food cooking on the stove, and the client living in a residential care setting may leave for a walk in cold weather without a coat and gloves. Assistance or supervision that is as unobtrusive as possible protects clients from injury while preserving their dignity.</p>
<p>A family member might say,</p>
<p>&gt; “I’ll sit in the kitchen and talk to you while you make lunch” (suggesting collaboration) rather than “You can’t cook by yourself because you might set the house on fire.”</p>
<p>In this way, the nurse or caregiver supports the client’s desire and ability to engage in certain tasks while providing protection from injury.</p>
<p>Clients with dementia may believe that their physical safety is jeopardized; they may feel threatened or suspicious and paranoid. These feelings can lead to agitated or erratic behavior that compromises safety. Avoiding direct confrontation of the client’s fears is important. Clients with dementia may struggle with fears and suspicion throughout their illness. Triggers of suspicion include strangers, changes in the daily routine, or impaired memory. The nurse must discover and address these environmental triggers rather than confront the paranoid ideas.</p>
<p>For example, a client reports that his belongings have been stolen. The</p>
<p>1049</p>
<p>nurse might say,</p>
<p>Let's go look in your room and see what's there.</p>
<p>and help the client to locate the misplaced or hidden items (suggesting collaboration). If the client is in a room with other people and says, "They're here to take me away!" the nurse might say,</p>
<p>Those people are here visiting with someone else. Let's go for a walk and let them visit. (presenting reality/distraction)</p>
<p>The nurse then can take the client to a quieter and less stimulating place, which moves the client away from the environmental trigger.</p>

<p>Clients require assistance to meet basic physiological needs. The nurse monitors food and fluid intake to ensure adequacy. Clients may eat poorly because of limited appetite or distraction at mealtimes. The nurse addresses this problem by providing foods clients like, sitting with clients at meals to provide cues to continue eating, having nutritious snacks available whenever clients are hungry, and minimizing noise and undue distraction at mealtimes. Clients who have difficulty manipulating utensils may be unable to cut meat or other foods into bite-sized pieces. The food should be cut up when it is prepared, not in front of clients, to deflect attention from their inability to do so. Food that can be eaten without utensils, or finger foods such as sandwiches and fresh fruit, may be best. In contrast, clients may eat too much, even ingesting inedible items. Providing low-calorie snacks such as carrot and celery sticks can satisfy the desire to chew and eat without unnecessary weight gain. Enteral nutrition often becomes necessary when dementia is most severe, though not all families choose to use tube feedings.</p>
<p>Adequate intake of fluids and food is also necessary for proper elimination. Clients may fail to respond to cues indicating constipation, so the nurse or caregiver monitors the client's bowel elimination patterns and intervenes with increased fluids and fiber or prompts as needed. Urinary elimination can become a problem if clients do not respond to the urge to void or are incontinent. Reminders to urinate may be helpful when clients are still continent but not initiating use of the bathroom. Sanitary pads can</p>
<p>1050</p>
<p>address dribbling or stress incontinence; adult diapers, rather than indwelling catheters, are indicated for incontinence. The nurse checks disposable pads and diapers frequently and changes soiled items promptly to avoid infection, skin irritation, and unpleasant odors. It is also important to provide good hygiene to minimize these risks.</p>
<p>Balance between rest and activity is an essential component of the daily routine. Mild physical activity such as walking promotes physical health but is not a cognitive challenge. Daily physical activity also helps clients sleep at night. The nurse provides rest periods so clients can conserve and regain energy, but extensive daytime napping may interfere with nighttime sleep. The nurse encourages clients to engage in physical activity because they may not initiate such activities independently; many clients tend to become sedentary as cognitive abilities diminish. Clients often are quite willing to participate in physical activities but cannot initiate, plan, or carry out those activities without assistance.</p>

<p>A structured environment and established routines can reassure clients with dementia. Familiar surroundings and routines help eliminate some confusion and frustration from memory loss. Providing routines and structure, however, does not mean forcing clients to conform to the structure of the setting or routines that other people determine. Rather than imposing new structure, the nurse encourages clients to follow their usual routines and habits of bathing and dressing. For example, it is important to know whether a client prefers a tub bath or shower and washes at night or in the morning and include those preferences in the client's care. Research has shown that attempting to change the dressing behavior of clients may result in physical aggression as clients make ineffective attempts to resist unwanted changes. Monitoring response to daily routines and making needed adjustments are important aspects of care.</p>
<p>The nurse needs to monitor and manage the client's tolerance of stimulation. Generally, clients can tolerate less stimulation when they are fatigued, hungry, or stressed. Also, with the progression of dementia, tolerance for environmental stimuli decreases. As this tolerance diminishes, clients need a quieter environment with fewer people and less noise or distraction.</p>

<p>The therapeutic relationship between client and nurse involves "empathic</p>
<p>1051</p>
<p>caring," which includes being kind, respectful, calm, and reassuring and paying attention to the client. Nurses use these same qualities with many different clients in various settings. In most situations, clients give positive feedback to the nurse or caregiver, but clients with dementia often seem to ignore the nurse's efforts and may even respond with negative behavior such as anger or suspicion. This makes it more difficult for the nurse or caregiver to sustain caring behavior. Nevertheless, nurses and caregivers must maintain all the qualities of the therapeutic relationship even when clients do not seem to respond.</p>
<p>Because of their disorientation and memory loss, clients with dementia often become anxious and require much patience and reassurance. The nurse can convey reassurance by approaching the client in a calm, supportive manner, as if nurse and client are a team—a “we can do it together” approach. The nurse reassures the client that he or she knows what is happening and can take care of things when the client is confused and cannot do so. For example, if the client is confused about getting dressed, the nurse might say,</p>
<p>I'll be glad to help you with that shirt. I'll hold it for you while you put your arms in the sleeves. (offering self/suggesting collaboration)</p>
<p>Supportive touch is effective with many clients. Touch can provide reassurance and convey caring when words may not be understood. Holding the hand of the client who is tearful and sad and tucking the client into bed at night are examples of ways to use supportive touch. As with any use of touch, the nurse must evaluate each client's response. Clients who respond positively will smile or move closer toward the nurse. Those who are threatened by physical touch will look frightened or pull away from the nurse, especially if the touch is sudden or unexpected or if the client misperceives the nurse's intent.</p>

<p>In a psychosocial model of dementia care, the nurse or caregiver plans activities that reinforce the client's identity and keep him or her engaged and involved in the business of living. The nurse or caregiver tailors these activities to the client's interests and abilities. They should not be routine group activities that "everyone is supposed to do." For example, a client with an interest in history may enjoy documentary programs on television; a client who likes music may enjoy singing. Clients often need the</p>
<p>1052</p>
<p>involvement of another person to sustain attention in the activity and to enjoy it more fully. Those who have long periods without anything to engage their interest are more likely to become restless and agitated. Clients engaged in activities are more likely to stay calm. A wide variety of activities have proven beneficial for clients with dementia. Music, dancing, pet- or animal-assisted therapy, aromatherapy, and multisensory stimulation are examples of activities that can be explored to maximize the client's involvement with the environment and enhance the quality of his or her life (Cho, 2018; Yackimicki, Edwards, Richards, &amp; Beck, 2019).</p>

</ul>
<p>Reminiscence therapy (thinking about or relating personally significant past experiences) is an effective intervention for clients with dementia. Rather than lamenting that the client is “living in the past,” this therapy encourages family and caregivers to also reminisce with the client. Reminiscing, also called nostalgia, uses the client’s remote memory, which is not affected as severely or quickly as recent or immediate memory. Photo albums may be useful in stimulating remote memory, and they provide a focus on the client’s past. Sometimes clients like to reminisce about local or national events and talk about their roles or what they were doing at the time. In addition to keeping clients involved in the business of living, reminiscence can also build self-esteem as clients discuss accomplishments. Engaging in active listening, asking questions, and providing cues to continue promote successful use of this technique. Reminiscence therapy can also be effective with small groups of clients as they collectively remember their early life activities (Ismail et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Clients have increasing problems interacting with others as dementia progresses. Initially, clients retain verbal language skills, but other people may find them difficult to understand as words are lost or content becomes vague. The nurse must listen carefully to the client and try to determine the meaning behind what is being said. The nurse might say,</p>
<p>“Are you trying to say you want to use the bathroom?” or “Did I get that right, you are hungry?” (seeking clarification)</p>
<p>It is also important not to interrupt clients or to finish their thoughts. If a client becomes frustrated when the nurse cannot understand his or her meaning, the nurse might say,</p>
<p>Can you show me what you mean or where you want to go? (assisting to take action)</p>
<p>When verbal language becomes less coherent, the nurse should remain alert to the client’s nonverbal behavior. When nurses or caregivers consistently work with a particular client, they develop the ability to</p>
<p>1054</p>
<p>determine the client's meaning through nonverbal behavior. For example, if the client becomes restless, it may indicate that he or she is hungry if it is close to mealtime or tired if it is late in the evening. Sometimes it is impossible to determine exactly what the client is trying to convey, but the nurse can still be responsive. For example, a client is pacing and looks upset but cannot indicate what is bothering her. The nurse says,</p>
<p>&gt; You look worried. I don't know what's wrong, but let's go for a walk. (making an observation/offering self)</p>
<p>Interacting with clients with dementia often means dealing with thoughts and feelings that are not based in reality but arise from the clients' suspicion or chronic confusion. Rather than attempting to explain reality or allay suspicion or anger, it is often helpful to use the techniques of distraction, time away, or going along to reassure the client.</p>
<p><strong>Distraction</strong> involves shifting the client's attention and energy to a more neutral topic. For example, the client may display a catastrophic reaction to the current situation, such as jumping up from dinner and saying, "My food tastes like poison!" The nurse might intervene with distraction by saying,</p>
<p>&gt; "Can you come to the kitchen with me and find something you'd like to eat?" or "You can leave that food. Can you come and help me find a good program on television?" (redirection/distraction)</p>
<p>Clients usually calm down when the nurse directs their attention away from the triggering situation.</p>
<p><strong>Time away</strong> involves leaving clients for a short period and then returning to them to reengage in interaction. For example, the client may get angry and yell at the nurse for no discernible reason. The nurse can leave the client for about 5 or 10 minutes and then return without referring to the previous outburst. The client may have little or no memory of the incident and may be pleased to see the nurse on his or her return.</p>
<p><strong>Going along</strong> means providing emotional reassurance to clients without correcting their misperception or delusion. The nurse does not engage in delusional ideas or reinforce them, but he or she does not deny or confront their existence. For example, a client is fretful, repeatedly saying, "I'm so worried about the children. I hope they're OK," and speaking as though his adult children were small and needed protection. The nurse could</p>
<p>1055</p>
<p>reassure the client by saying,</p>
<p>There's no need to worry; the children are just fine (going along),</p>
<p>which is likely to calm the client. The nurse has responded effectively to the client's worry without addressing the reality of the client's concern. Going along is a specific intervention for clients with dementia and should not be used with those experiencing delusions whose conditions are expected to improve.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that different interventions are indicated for dealing with psychotic symptoms, depending on the cause. People with dementia cannot regain their cognitive functions, so techniques like redirection or going along with the person are indicated. However, when psychotic symptoms are due to a treatable illness, such as schizophrenia, the nurse should not say or do anything to reinforce the notion that the delusions or hallucinations are real in any way. This would only interfere with or impede the client's progress.</p>
<p>The nurse can use reframing techniques to offer clients different points of view or explanations for situations or events. Because of their perceptual difficulties and confusion, clients frequently interpret environmental stimuli as threatening. Loud noises often frighten and agitate them. For example, one client may interpret another's yelling as a direct personal threat. The nurse can provide an alternative explanation such as</p>
<p>That lady has many family problems, and she yells sometimes because she's frustrated. (reframing)</p>
<p>Alternative explanations often reassure clients with dementia and help them become less frightened and agitated.</p>

<p>Treatment outcomes change constantly as the disease progresses. For example, in the early stage of dementia, maintaining independence may mean that the client dresses with minimal assistance. Later, the same client may keep some independence by selecting what foods to eat. In the late stage, the client may maintain independence by wearing his or her own clothing rather than an institutional nightgown or pajamas.</p>
<p>1056</p>
<p>The nurse must assess clients for changes as they occur and revise outcomes and interventions as needed. When a client is cared for at home, this includes providing ongoing education to family members and caregivers while supporting them as the client's condition worsens. See the sections that follow on the role of the caregiver and community-based care.</p>

<p>At least half of all nursing home residents have Alzheimer disease or some other illness that causes dementia. In addition, for every person with dementia in a nursing home, two or three with similar impairments are receiving care in the community by some combination of family members, friends, and paid caregivers.</p>
<p>Programs and services for clients with dementia and their families have increased with the growing awareness of Alzheimer disease, the increasing numbers of older adults in the United States, and the fundraising efforts for education by noted figures (e.g., the family of former President Ronald Reagan). Home care is available through home health agencies, public health agencies, and visiting nurses. These services offer assistance with bathing, food preparation, and transportation as well as with other support. Periodic nursing assessment ensures that the level of care provided is appropriate to the client's current needs.</p>
<p>Adult day care centers provide supervision, meals, support, and recreational activities in group settings. Clients may attend the center a few hours a week or full-time on weekdays if needed. Respite care offers in-home supervision for clients so that family members or caregivers can run errands or have social time of their own.</p>
<p>Residential facilities are available for clients who do not have in-home caregivers or whose needs have progressed beyond the care that could be provided at home. These clients usually require assistance with ADLs, such as eating and taking medications. Clients in residential facilities are often referred for skilled nursing home placement as dementia progresses.</p>
<p>The physician, nurse, or family can initiate referrals for community-based services. Families can contact the local public health department or the department of human or social services listed in the phone book. If the client has been admitted to the hospital, social services can also assist in making an appropriate referral.</p>

<p>Research continues to identify risk factors for dementia. People with elevated levels of plasma homocysteine are at increased risk for dementia. As levels of plasma homocysteine increase, so does the risk for dementia (Price, Wilcock, &amp; Weekman, 2018). Because folate, vitamin B₁₂, and betaine are known to reduce plasma homocysteine levels, potential therapeutic strategies using these substances may modify or diminish the risk for dementia. Clinical trials are currently in progress to see if lowering homocysteine levels actually decreases the risk for dementia and whether taking high supplemental doses of B vitamins slows the progression of Alzheimer disease.</p>
<p>People who regularly participate in brain-stimulating activities, such as reading books and newspapers or doing crossword puzzles, are less likely to develop Alzheimer disease than those who do not. Engaging in leisure-time physical activity during midlife and having a large social network are associated with a decreased risk for Alzheimer disease in later life. In addition, healthy eating habits, physical activity, and minimizing health risks help decrease or delay cognitive decline.</p>

<p>About 34% of caregivers for those with dementia are ages 65 or older. Two-thirds of those caring for family members with dementia are women, and over one-third are adult daughters (Alzheimer's Association, 2019). The trend toward caring for family members with dementia at home is largely the result of the high costs of institutional care, dissatisfaction with institutional care, and difficulty locating suitable placements for clients with behaviors that are sometimes disruptive and difficult to manage. Family members identify many other reasons for becoming primary caregivers, including the desire to reciprocate for past assistance, to provide love and affection, to uphold family values or loyalty, to meet duty or obligation, and to avoid feelings of guilt.</p>
<p>Caregivers need to know about dementia and the required client care as well as how client care will change as the disease progresses. Caregivers may also be dealing with other family members who may or may not be supportive or who may have differing expectations. Many caregivers have other demands on their time, such as their own families, careers, and personal lives. Caregivers must continually deal with their feelings of loss and grief as the health of their loved ones continually declines (Liew, Tai, Yap, &amp; Koh, 2019).</p>
<p>Caring for clients with dementia can be emotionally and physically</p>
<p>exhausting and stressful. Caregivers may need to drastically change their own lives, such as quitting a job, to provide care. Caregivers may have young children as well. They often feel exhausted and as if they are "on duty" 24 hours a day. Caregivers caring for parents may have difficulty "being in charge" of their mothers or fathers (role reversal). They may feel uncomfortable or depressed about having to bathe, feed, or change diapers for parents.</p>
<p>Role strain is identified when the demands of providing care threaten to overwhelm a caregiver. Indications of role strain include constant fatigue that is unrelieved by rest, increased use of alcohol or other drugs, social isolation, inattention to personal needs, and inability or unwillingness to accept help from others. Caregivers may feel unappreciated by other family members, as indicated by statements such as "No one ever asks how I am!" In some situations, role strain can contribute to the neglect or abuse of clients with dementia (see Chapter 12).</p>
<p>Supporting the caregiver is an important component of providing care at home to clients with dementia. Caregivers must have an ongoing relationship with a knowledgeable health professional; the client's physician can make referrals to other health care providers. Depending on the situation, that person may be a nurse, care manager, or social worker. He or she can provide information, support, and assistance during the time that home care is provided. Caregivers need education about dementia and the type of care clients need. Caregivers should use the interventions previously discussed to promote the client's well-being, deal with deficits and limitations, and maximize the quality of the client's life. Because the care that clients need changes as the dementia progresses, this education by the nurse, care manager, or social worker is ongoing.</p>
<p>Caregivers need outlets for dealing with their own feelings. Support groups can help them express frustration, sadness, anger, guilt, or ambivalence; all these feelings are common. Attending a support group regularly also means that caregivers have time with people who understand the many demands of caring for a family member with dementia. The client's physician can provide information about support groups, and the local chapter of the National Alzheimer Disease Association is listed in the phone book. Area hospitals and public health agencies also can help caregivers to locate community resources.</p>
<p>Caregivers should be able to seek and accept assistance from other people or agencies. Often, caregivers believe that others may not be able to provide care as well as they do, or they say they will seek help when they "really need</p>
<p>1059</p>
<p>it." Caregivers must maintain their own well-being and not wait until they are exhausted before seeking relief. Sometimes family members disagree about care for the client. The primary caregiver may believe other family members should volunteer to help without being asked, but other family members may believe that the primary caregiver chose to take on the responsibility and do not feel obligated to help out regularly. Whatever the feelings are among family members, it is important for them all to express their feelings and ideas and to participate in caregiving according to their own expectations. Many families need assistance to reach this type of compromise.</p>
<p>Finally, caregivers need support to maintain personal lives. They need to continue to socialize with friends and engage in leisure activities or hobbies rather than focusing solely on the client's care. Caregivers who are rested, happy, and have met their own needs are better prepared to manage the rigorous demands of the caregiver role. Most caregivers need to be reminded to take care of themselves; this act is not selfish but is in the client's best long-term interests.</p>

<p>The Staff Training in Assisted-Living Residences (STAR) program was initially developed in 2005. It was expanded to area agencies on aging in Oregon. Trained staff recruited patient-caregiver dyads in community settings for an 8-week intervention. At the end of training and at 6-month follow-up, caregivers reported decreases in depression, caregiver burden, and reaction to patient behaviors. They also reported high satisfaction with the program.</p>
<p>The next step is to continue to expand this type of training to larger areas and other states.</p>

<p>SELF-AWARENESS ISSUES</p>
<p>Working with and caring for clients with dementia can be exhausting and frustrating for both nurse and caregiver. Teaching is a fundamental role for nurses, but teaching clients who have dementia can be especially challenging and frustrating. These clients do not retain explanations or instructions, so the nurse must repeat the same things continually. The nurse must be careful not to lose patience and not to give up on these clients. The nurse may begin to feel that repeating instructions or explanations does no good because clients do not understand or remember them. Discussing these frustrations with others can help the nurse avoid conveying negative feelings to clients and families or experiencing professional and personal burnout.</p>
<p>The nurse may get little or no positive response or feedback from clients with dementia. It can be difficult to deal with feelings about caring for people who will never "get better and go home." As dementia progresses, clients may seem not to hear or respond to anything the nurse does. It is sad and frustrating for the nurse to see clients decline and eventually lose their abilities to manage basic self-care activities and to interact with others. Remaining positive and supportive to clients and families can be difficult when the outcome is so bleak. In addition, the progressive decline may last months or years, which adds to the frustration and sadness. The nurse may need to deal with personal feelings of depression and grief as the dementia progresses; he or she can do so by discussing the situation with colleagues or even a counselor.</p>

<ul>
<li>Remember how important it is to provide dignity for the client and family as the client's life ends.</li>
<li>Remember that death is the last stage of life. The nurse can provide emotional support for the client and family during this period.</li>
<li>Clients may not notice the caring, patience, and support the nurse offers, but these qualities will mean a great deal to the family for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p>CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The nurse is working in a long-term care setting with clients with dementia. One of the ancillary staff makes a joke about a client in the client's presence. The nurse tells the staff person that it is unacceptable behavior. The staff person replies, "Oh, he can't understand what I'm saying, and besides, he was laughing too. What's the big deal?" How should this nurse respond?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A client is newly diagnosed with dementia in the early stages. Can the client make decisions about advance medical directives? Why or why not? At what point in the progression of dementia can the client no longer make quality-of-life decisions?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Cognitive disorders involve disruption or impairment in the higher functions of the brain. They include delirium and dementia or mild and major NCDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delirium is a syndrome that involves disturbed consciousness and changes in cognition. It is usually caused by an underlying, treatable medical condition such as physiological or metabolic imbalances, infections, nutritional deficits, medication reactions or interactions, drug intoxication, or alcohol withdrawal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primary goals of nursing care for clients with delirium are protection from injury, management of confusion, and meeting physiological and psychological needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dementia is a disease involving memory loss and multiple cognitive deficits such as language deterioration (aphasia), motor impairment (apraxia), or inability to name or recognize objects (agnosia).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dementia is usually progressive, beginning with prominent memory loss (mild stage) and confusion and loss of independent functioning (moderate), followed by total disorientation and loss of functioning (severe).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medications used to treat dementia, rivastigmine, galantamine, and donepezil, slow disease progression for about 6 months. Other medications such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines help manage symptoms but do not affect the course of dementia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A psychosocial model for providing care for people with dementia</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1062</p>
<p>addresses needs for safety, structure, support, interpersonal involvement, and social interaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many clients with dementia receive care at home rather than in institutional settings (e.g., nursing homes). The caregiver role (often assumed by a spouse or adult child) can be physically and emotionally exhausting and stressful; this contributes to caregiver role strain. To deal with the exhausting demands of this role, family caregivers need ongoing education and support from a health care professional, such as a nurse, social worker, or case manager.</li>
<li>Caregivers must learn how to meet the client's physiological and emotional needs and to protect him or her from injury. Areas for teaching include monitoring the client's health, avoiding alcohol and recreational drugs, ensuring adequate nutrition, scheduling regular checkups, getting adequate rest, promoting activity and socialization, and helping the client to maintain independence as much as possible.</li>
<li>The therapeutic relationship with clients with dementia is supportive and protective and recognizes the client's individuality and dignity.</li>

<p>Think back to Chapter 10. G.P., who is 90 years old, is diagnosed with minor NCD, Alzheimer type, and is living independently in a retirement community since his wife died 3 years ago. His daughter has noticed some cognitive decline and social isolation after the recent loss of his dog. What assessments should the nurse perform during a home visit? How can the nurse determine whether G.P. is receptive to community resources for supporting his independent living and involvement in activities?</p>
<p>Considering his NCD and response to recent loss, how would the nurse approach a discussion on his ability to maintain independence and when he should transfer to a higher level of care?</p>

<p>Martha Smith, a 79-year-old widow with Alzheimer disease, was admitted to a nursing home. The disease has progressed during the past 4 years to the point that she can no longer live alone in her own house. Martha has poor judgment and no short-term memory. She had stopped paying bills, preparing meals, and cleaning her home. She had become increasingly suspicious of her visiting nurse and home health aide, finally refusing to allow them in the house.</p>
<p>After her arrival at the facility, Martha has been sleeping poorly and frequently wanders from her room in the middle of the night. She seems agitated and afraid in the dining room at mealtimes, is eating very little, and has lost weight. If left alone, Martha would wear the same clothing day and night and would not attend to her personal hygiene.</p>

<p>Susan could be treated with SSRI antidepressants, systematic desensitization, and nonchemical methods to manage her anxiety response, such as progressive muscle relaxation, imagery, and cognitive-behavioral reframing techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, Martha’s intended helpfulness is enabling Susan to remain in her apartment without seeking help or treatment. The nurse could suggest to Martha that she work with Susan’s treaters about ways she could be supportive and helpful to Susan without enabling her. Should Susan refuse treatment, Martha could make an appointment with a therapist or counselor for herself to get assistance and support.</p>

<p>(These are examples of correct answers; others are possible.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For how much time each day is Susan having obsessional thoughts? How much time does she spend engaging in ritualistic behaviors? Is Susan willing to participate in behavioral therapy to help her limit rituals and tolerate the anxiety caused by obsessions? What is the condition of Susan’s skin, particularly her hands, from all the cleaning rituals?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anxiety—Overwhelming anxiety caused by obsessional thinking drives Susan to perform rituals. Ineffective coping—Susan attempts to deal with anxiety through ritualistic behavior almost exclusively; she needs to learn or remember previous successful coping skills and begin to use them. Risk for impaired skin integrity—Excessive cleaning rituals can lead to dry, cracked skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Susan will demonstrate effective use of relaxation techniques.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Susan will demonstrate two effective coping skills to manage anxiety; for example, cognitive restructuring techniques.</p>
<p>Susan will have intact skin with no cracking or redness.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Teaching Susan relaxation techniques and helping her practice them when she is less anxious. Helping Susan to identify the cues of increasing anxiety so she can begin using relaxation techniques as soon as she is aware of increasing anxiety. Provide positive feedback for using techniques to help moderate the anxiety response.</li>
</ol>
<p>Discuss coping techniques with Susan—what has worked in the past? Who can she discuss these problems</p>
<p>and feelings with? What new coping skills is she willing to try?</p>
<p>Help Susan to learn response delay (postponing initiation of ritualistic cleaning); help Susan set limited times for cleaning activities. Encourage Susan to use cognitive techniques to help delay the ritualistic cleaning response and tolerate the resulting anxiety.</p>

<p>Ritalin is a stimulant medication that is effective for 70% to 80% of children with ADHD by decreasing hyperactivity and impulsivity and improving the child's attention. Ritalin can cause appetite suppression and should be given after meals to encourage proper nutrition. Substantial, nutritious snacks between meals are helpful. Giving the medication in the daytime helps avoid the side effect of insomnia. Parents should notice improvements in a day or two. Notify the physician or return to the clinic if no improvements in behavior are noted.</p>

<p>The exact cause of ADHD is not known, but it is not due to faulty parenting or anything the parents have done. Taking medications will be helpful with behavioral symptoms, but other strategies are needed as well. The medication will help control symptoms, so Dixie can participate in school, make friends, and so forth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide supervision when Dixie is with her brother, and help her learn to play gently with him. Do not forbid her to touch him, but teach her the proper ways to do so. Give Dixie directions in a clear, step-by-step manner, and assist her to follow through and complete tasks. Provide a quiet place with minimal distraction for</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>1092</p>
<p>activities that require concentration, such as homework. Try to establish a routine for getting up and dressing, eating meals, going to school, doing homework, and playing; don't change the routine unnecessarily. Structured expectations will be easier for Dixie to follow. Remember to recognize Dixie's strengths and provide positive feedback frequently to boost her self-esteem and foster continued progress.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The parents should contact Dixie's teacher, principal, and guidance counselor to inform them of this diagnosis so that special education classes or tutoring can be made available. It would also be helpful to meet with the school nurse who will be giving Dixie her medication at noon on school days. The nurse can refer the parents to a local support group for parents of children with ADHD and provide pamphlets, books, or other written materials, as well as internet addresses if the parents have access to a computer.</li>

<p>Risperdal is a second-generation antipsychotic; at low doses, such as 0.5 mg, it can help decrease aggression and irritability. John may then be less labile, have fewer aggressive outbursts, and be more able to participate in therapeutic interventions. Monitor John for any muscle stiffness, sedation, or confusion. Provide calorie-free beverages and candy for dry mouth. Notify the physician if any rapid behavior changes occur or if there is no improvement in 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Children with ODD are defiant and disobedient toward authority figures such as parents and the school superintendent, even when there are negative outcomes for that behavior.

<p>Parents can learn effective behavior management techniques at the parenting classes. The most important (or disruptive) behaviors are identified, and those are targeted for improvement.

Disorders of Sleep and Wakefulness</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Sleep and wakefulness disorders can be organized into five categories: insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, circadian rhythm disorders, and parasomnias.</p>
<p>INSOMNIA DISORDER</p>
<p>The primary element of insomnia is the dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality. The person has difficulty falling asleep, maintaining sleep, and/or early-morning wakening with inability to return to sleep. Subtypes of insomnia disorder include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inadequate sleep hygiene—Engaging in behaviors not conducive to sleep or interfering directly with sleep. Included are consuming caffeine or nicotine before bed time, excessive emotional or physical stimulation just prior to bedtime, daytime naps, and wide variations of daily sleep–wake routines. Treatment modalities include sleep hygiene measures (see “Sleep Hygiene Measures” box), cognitive–behavioral techniques, and medication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychophysiological insomnia—Involves conditioned arousal associated with the thought of sleep (i.e., the bed, the bedroom). It is often associated with stress and anxiety. Characteristics include excessive worry about sleep problems, trying too hard to sleep, rumination, increased muscle tension, and other anxiety symptoms. Relaxation therapy, sleep hygiene measures, and stimulus control therapy (included in “Sleep Hygiene Measures” box).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paradoxical insomnia—When the individual thinks he or she is awake or is not sleeping even though brain wave activity is consistent with normal sleep. It is usually due to ruminative worrying that continues into sleep but causes the individual to believe he or she is awake. An interruption of rumination and diminished worry about not sleeping usually diminishes or eliminates the problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1097</p>
<ul>
<li>Idiopathic insomnia—A lifelong inability to obtain adequate sleep. It is thought to be a neurologic deficit in the sleep–wake cycle and is, therefore, chronic and lifelong. Treatment consists of improved sleep hygiene, relaxation therapy, and the long-term use of sleep-inducing medication.</li>
<li>Insomnia due to a mental disorder, medical condition, or drug or substance use—Primary treatment of the underlying cause is helpful but may not eliminate the insomnia altogether. Use of medications for sleep, sleep hygiene measures, and the avoidance of stimulants, including caffeine, and of medications that interfere with sleep are also effective.</li>

<p>Excessive sleepiness for at least 1 month that involves either prolonged sleep episodes or daily daytime sleeping that causes significant distress or impairment in functioning. Major sleep episodes may be 8 to 12 hours long, and the person has difficulty waking up. Daytime naps leave the person unrefreshed upon awakening. It may be due to sleep regulation dysfunction in the brain. Treatment with stimulant medication is often effective.</p>

<p>Chronic excessive sleepiness characterized by repeated, irresistible sleep attacks. After sleeping 10 to 20 minutes, the person is briefly refreshed until the next sleep attack. Sleep attacks can occur at inopportune times, such as during important work activities or while driving a car. People with narcolepsy may also experience cataplexy (sudden episodes of bilateral, reversible loss of muscle tone that last for seconds to minutes) or recurrent intrusions of REM sleep in the sleep–wake transitions, manifested by paralysis of voluntary muscles or dream-like hallucinations. Treatment includes stimulant medication, modafinil (Provigil), and behavioral structuring, such as scheduling naps at convenient times.</p>

<p>Sleep disruption leads to excessive sleepiness or, less commonly, insomnia, caused by abnormalities in ventilation during sleep. These sleep-related breathing disorders include obstructive sleep apnea (repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction), central sleep apnea (episodic cessation of ventilation without airway obstruction), and central alveolar hypoventilation (hypoventilation resulting in low arterial oxygen levels). Central sleep apnea</p>
<p>1098</p>
<p>is more common in the elderly, while obstructive sleep apnea and central alveolar hypoventilation are commonly seen in obese individuals.

<p>Persistent or recurring sleep disruption resulting from altered functioning of circadian rhythm or a mismatch between circadian rhythm and external demands. Subtypes include delayed sleep phase (person's own circadian schedule is incongruent with needed timing of sleep, such as an individual being unable to sleep or remain awake during socially acceptable hours as a result of a work schedule or the like), jet lag (conflict of sleep–wake schedule and a new time zone), shift work (conflict between circadian rhythm and demands of wakefulness for shift work), and unspecified (circadian rhythm pattern is longer than 24 hours despite environmental cues, resulting in varying sleep problems). Sleep hygiene measures (see “Sleep Hygiene Measures” box), melatonin, and bright light therapy can be effective treatments. Bright light therapy consists of being exposed to bright light when wakefulness is initiated and avoiding bright lights when sleep is desired.</p>

<p>Parasomnias are disorders characterized by abnormal behavioral or psychological events associated with sleep, specific sleep stages, or sleep–wake transition. These disorders involve activation of physiological systems, such as the autonomic nervous system, motor system, or cognitive processes, at inappropriate times, as during sleep.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nightmare disorder—Repeated occurrence of frightening dreams that lead to waking from sleep. The dreams are often lengthy and elaborate, provoking anxiety or terror and causing the individual to have trouble returning to sleep and to experience significant distress and, sometimes, lack of sleep. There is no widely accepted treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep terror disorder—Repeated occurrence of abrupt awakenings from sleep associated with a panicky scream or cry. Children with sleep terror disorder are confused and upset upon awakening and have no memory of a dream either at the time of awakening or in the morning. Initially, it is difficult to fully awaken or console the child. Sleep terror disorder tends to</p>

<ul>
<li>Sleepwalking disorder—Repeated episodes of complex motor behavior initiated during sleep, including getting out of bed and walking around. Persons appear disoriented and confused and on occasion may become violent. Usually, they return to bed on their own or can be guided back to bed. Sleepwalking occurs most often in children between the ages of 4 and 8 years, and it tends to dissipate by adolescence. No treatment is required.</li>

<p>Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder may involve insomnia or hypersomnia. Mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and other</p>
<p>1100</p>
<p>psychotic disorders are often associated with sleep disturbances. Treatment of the underlying mental disorder is indicated to resolve the sleep disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition</strong> may involve insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnias, or a combination of these attributable to a medical condition. These sleep disturbances may result from degenerative neurologic illnesses, cerebrovascular disease, endocrine conditions, viral and bacterial infections, coughing, or pain. Sleep disturbances of this type may improve with treatment of the underlying medical condition or may be treated symptomatically with medication for sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Substance-induced sleep disorder</strong> involves prominent disturbance in sleep due to the direct physiological effects of a substance, such as alcohol, other drugs, or toxins. Insomnia and hypersomnia are most common. Treatment of the underlying substance use or abuse generally leads to improvement in sleep.</p>

<p>There are three general groups of sexual and gender problems: sexual dysfunctions (desire, arousal, orgasm, pain, and dysfunction due to a medical condition), paraphilias (exhibitionism, fetishism, frotteurism, pedophilia, masochism, sadism, transvestic fetishism, and voyeurism), and gender dysphoria. These disorders are usually identified in primary care or outpatient settings and treated with individual, couple/partner, or group psychotherapy. Occasionally, when the diagnosis coincides with behavior defined as criminal, that is, many of the paraphilias, individuals get involved in the legal system.</p>

<p>Sexual dysfunction is characterized by a disturbance in the processes of the sexual response cycle or by pain associated with sexual intercourse. The sexual response cycle consists of desire, excitement, orgasm, and resolution. Sexual dysfunction may be caused by psychological factors alone or a combination of psychological factors and a medical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Sexual desire disorders</strong> involve a disruption in the desire phase of the sexual response cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypoactive sexual desire disorder</strong>—Characterized by a deficiency or absence of sexual fantasies and a lack of desire for sexual activity that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.</li>
<li><strong>Sexual aversion disorder</strong>—Involves aversion to and active avoidance of genital sexual contact with a sexual partner that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. The individual reports anxiety, fear, or disgust when confronted by a sexual opportunity with a partner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sexual arousal disorders</strong> are a disruption of the excitement phase of the sexual response cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Female sexual arousal disorder</strong>—Persistent or recurrent inability to attain</li>
</ul>
<p>or to maintain, until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate lubrication—swelling response of sexual excitement, which causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.</p>
<ul>
<li>Male erectile disorder—Persistent or recurrent inability to attain or maintain, until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate erection, which causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Orgasmic disorders</strong> are disruptions of the orgasm phase of the sexual response cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Female orgasmic disorders—Persistent or recurrent delay in, or absence of, orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase, which causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.</li>
<li>Male orgasmic disorder—Persistent or recurrent delay in, or absence of, orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase, which causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.</li>
<li>Premature ejaculation—Persistent or recurrent onset of orgasm and ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it, causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sexual pain disorders</strong> involve pain associated with sexual activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dyspareunia—Genital pain associated with sexual intercourse causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulties. It can occur in both males and females, and symptoms range from mild discomfort to sharp pain.</li>
<li>Vaginismus—Persistent or recurrent involuntary contractions of the perineal muscles surrounding the outer third of the vagina when vaginal penetration with penis, finger, tampon, or speculum is attempted, causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulties. The contraction may range from mild (tightness and mild discomfort) to severe (preventing penetration).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sexual dysfunction due to a general medical condition</strong> is the presence of clinically significant sexual dysfunction that is exclusively due to the physiological effects of a medical condition. It can include pain with intercourse, hypoactive sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, orgasmic problems, or other problems as previously described. The individual experiences marked distress or interpersonal difficulty related to the symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Substance-induced sexual dysfunction</strong> is clinically significant sexual dysfunction resulting in marked distress or interpersonal difficulty caused by</p>
<p>1103</p>
<p>the direct physiological effects of a substance (drug of abuse, medication, or toxin). It may involve impaired arousal, impaired orgasm, or sexual pain.</p>

<p>Paraphilias are recurrent, intensely sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors generally involving (1) nonhuman objects, (2) the suffering or humiliation of oneself or partner, or (3) children or other nonconsenting persons. For pedophilia, voyeurism, exhibitionism, and frotteurism, the diagnosis is made if the person has acted on these urges or if the urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. For sexual sadism, the diagnosis is made if the person has acted on these urges with a nonconsenting person or if the urges, fantasies, or behaviors cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. For the remaining paraphilias, the diagnosis is made if the behavior, sexual urges, or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exhibitionism—Exposure of the genitals to a stranger, sometimes involving masturbation; usually occurs before age 18 and is less severe after age 40.</li>
<li><em>Fetishism</em>—Use of nonliving objects (the fetish) to obtain sexual excitement and/or achieve orgasm. Common fetishes include women’s underwear, bras, lingerie, shoes, or other apparel. The person might masturbate while holding or rubbing the object. It begins by adolescence and tends to be chronic.</li>
<li>Frotteurism—Touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person, usually in a crowded place from which the person with frotteurism can make a quick escape, such as public transportation, a shopping mall, or a crowded sidewalk. The individual rubs his genitals against the victim’s thighs and buttocks or fondles breasts or genitalia with the hands. Acts of frottage occur most often between the ages of 15 and 25; frequency declines after that.</li>
<li>Pedophilia—Sexual activity with a prepubescent child (generally 13 years or younger) by someone at least 16 years old and 5 years older than the child. It can include an individual undressing the child and looking at the child; exposing himself or herself; masturbating in the presence of the child; touching and fondling the child; fellatio; cunnilingus; or penetration of the child’s vagina, anus, or mouth with the individual’s fingers or penis or with foreign objects, with varying amounts of force. Contact may involve the individual’s own children, stepchildren or relatives, or</li>
</ul>
<p>1104</p>
<p>strangers. Many individuals with pedophilia do not experience distress about their fantasies, urges, or behaviors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual masochism—Recurrent, intensely sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer. Some individuals act on masochistic urges by themselves, others with a partner.</li>
<li>Sexual sadism—Recurrent, intensely sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving acts in which the psychological or physical suffering of the victim is sexually arousing to the person. It can involve domination (caging the victim or forcing victim to crawl, beg, plead), restraint, spanking, beating, electrical shock, rape, cutting, and, in severe cases, torture and death. Victims may be consenting (those with sexual masochism) or nonconsenting.</li>
<li>Voyeurism—Recurrent, intensely sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the act of observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of undressing, or engaging in sexual activity. Voyeurism usually begins before age 15, is chronic, and may involve masturbation during the voyeuristic behavior.</li>

<p>Gender dysphoria is diagnosed when an individual has a strong and persistent sense of incongruence between experienced or expressed gender and the gender assigned at birth, usually anatomical and called natal. The incongruence is accompanied by the persistent discomfort of his or her assigned sex or a sense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that assigned sex. The person experiences clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. In boys, there is a preoccupation with traditionally feminine activities, a preference for dressing in girls' or women's clothing, and an expressed desire to be a girl or grow up to be a woman. Girls may resist parental attempts to have them wear dresses or other feminine attire, wear boys' clothing, have short hair, ask to be called by a boy's name, and express the desire to grow a penis and grow up to be a man.</p>
