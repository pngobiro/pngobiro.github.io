      ],
      "explanation": "The orientation phase begins when the nurse and client meet. It involves establishing trust, setting parameters (roles, time, place), and identifying problems. The working phase involves problem-solving.",
      "hint": "This is the very first phase where you set the ground rules."

      "partialCredit": true,
      "explanation": "Intimate (0-18in) is for close contact; Personal (18-36in) is for family/friends; Social (4-12ft) is for work/business; Public (12-25ft) is for speakers/audiences. Therapeutic communication is usually most comfortable in the social zone (3-6 ft).",
