                            <p>Focused Antenatal Care is a personalized (individualized) care provided to a pregnant woman which emphasizes on woman's overall health, her preparedness for childbirth and her readiness for complications.</p>
                            <p>Focused Antenatal Care (or targeted Antenatal care) can also refer to a minimum number of four comprehensive personalized antenatal visits, each of which has specific items of client assessment, education and care to ensure prevention or early detection and prompt management of complications.</p>
                            <p>FANC categorizes pregnant women into two groups, namely:</p>

                                <li>Those eligible to receive routine antenatal care (Basic component).</li>
                                <li>Those who need special care based on the specific pregnancy related risk factor (High risk pregnancies) such as previous history of still birth, spontaneous miscarriage, low birth weight or macrocosmic baby, hypertension in pregnancy or current pregnancy factors such as multiple pregnancy, Rh- mothers, pelvic abnormalities, per vaginal bleeding and mothers with medical conditions.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Focused Antenatal care should be:</p>

                                <li>Simple</li>
                                <li>Safe</li>
                                <li>Accessible.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Care provider should be aware that women are more likely to seek and return for services if they feel cared for and respected. This therefore requires that care providers should use excellent interpersonal skills and should respect clients' right to dignity, privacy, confidentiality, full and accurate information.</p>

                            <p>On palpation, use the Leopold’s Maneuver. There are four steps in Leopold’s Maneuver</p>
                            
                            <h5>1. Fundal height and fundal palpation (1st Leopold Maneuver)</h5>
                            <p><strong>a) Fundal Height</strong></p>
                            <p>At about 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy, the uterus is palpated above the symphysis pubis as a firm globular sphere; it reaches the umbilicus at 20 to 22 weeks, the xiphoidal process at 36 weeks, and then often returns to about 4 cm below the xiphoid due to “lightening” at 40 weeks.</p>
                            <p>Method: Measure distance of fundus with points on abdomen and assessing the fundal height in finger breadth below the xiphisternum or measure by centimeter.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>b) Fundal Palpation</strong></p>
                            <p>Purpose - To know lie and presentation.</p>
                            <p>Method: - Use 2 hands using palms of hands palpate on either side of the fundus. Fingers held close together, palpate the upper pole of then uterus and feel that as it is hard or soft or irregular.</p>

                                <li>The client is asked to empty her bladder and then to lie on her back on a couch with the arms by her sides.</li>
                                <li>Inspect the abdomen for the shape, size, scars and foetal movements. Any abnormality detected is referred for further investigations.</li>
                                <li>Estimate the height of the fundus and compare it with the calculated EDD. This helps you to assess foetal growth and detect any deviations from the normal.</li>
                                <li>Check for varicosities at the back of the leg. Ask the woman to remove any tight clothing at the leg. At this time, it is also important to check for phlebitis by looking for any reddened areas.</li>
                                <li>Palpate the sides of the abdomen to locate the foetal back in order to determine the position. You do this by facing the patient and then supporting the uterus with your right hand. Keep pushing the foetus with your left hand towards the right. Reverse the order to feel the left side of the uterus.</li>
                                <li>Palpate the lower pole of the uterus, just above the pelvic brim.</li>
                                <li>Ask the mother to bend her knees slightly in order to relax the abdominal muscles and ask her to breath steadily with her mouth open.</li>
                                <li>Facing the foot of the bed, mark the brim of the pelvis with your hands and cup what presents between them. If the head is presenting, a smooth surface will be felt.</li>
                                <li>If you do not find the head in the pelvic brim or at the fundus, suspect a transverse lie. This will be significant only after the 36th week of gestation.</li>
                                <li>The foetal heart sounds are listened to last, so as to assess the foetal wellbeing. The Pinard's foetal stethoscope is commonly used to hear the foetal heart.</li>
                                <li>As you perform the physical examination, talk to the mother and check her facial reaction as you palpate the abdomen. When you complete the procedure reassure the mother.</li>
