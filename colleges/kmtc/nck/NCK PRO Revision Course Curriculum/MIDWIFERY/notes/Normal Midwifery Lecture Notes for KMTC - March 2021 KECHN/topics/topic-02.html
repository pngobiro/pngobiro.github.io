                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>There are physiological biochemical and anatomical changes that occur during pregnancy. These changes may be systemic or local.</p>
                            <p>Most of the systemic changes return to pre pregnancy status 6 weeks after delivery. These changes occur during pregnancy to maintain a healthy environment for the fetus without compromising the mother’s health as well as preparing for the process of delivery and care of the newborn.</p>
                            <p>Understanding of the normal changes helps to understand coincidental disease processes.</p>
                            <p>Pregnancy is a critical period for both the woman and her unborn child. It is, therefore, very important for you to understand the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy in order to appreciate the effect they may have on the pregnant woman and to be able to manage her pregnancy appropriately.</p>
                            <p>This topic will discuss changes in the following systems and organs:</p>

                            <h4>a) Changes in the Uterus</h4>
                            <p>The uterine muscle fibre increases in size (hypertrophy) and in number (hyperplasia). The uterus continues to grow this way for the first 20 weeks, thereafter, it stretches to accommodate its contents. It increases in size from 60 grams - 900 grams.</p>
                            <p>By the eighth week of gestation it begins to generate small waves of contractions known as Braxton Hicks contractions, which are painless and continue throughout pregnancy. The blood supply to the uterus increases to keep pace with its growth and also to meet the needs of the placenta.</p>
                            <p>In early pregnancy the uterus becomes globular in shape to accommodate the fetal growth, liquor, amnii and placental tissue. This causes pressure on other pelvic organs.</p>
                            <p>Uterus – Upper part fundus and body change in to upper uterine segment</p>

                            <h4>b) Changes in the Cervix</h4>
                            <p>The cervix acts as an effective barrier against infection. It also protects the pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>Under the influence of progesterone, the endo-cervical cells secrete mucus, which becomes a cervical plug known as operculum.</p>
                            <p>This plug provides protection from ascending infection. In late pregnancy, the cervix softens in response to increasing painless contractions.</p>
                            <p>Prostaglandins are thought to have a role in cervical softening in readiness for the onset of labour. Lower part cervix and isthmus change in to lower uterine segment</p>

                            <h4>c) Changes in the Vagina</h4>
                            <p>Estrogen causes the vagina to become more elastic. These changes will allow dilatation during the second stage of labour to receive the descending fetal head.</p>
                            <p>There is an increased amount of the normal white vaginal discharge called leucorrhoea.</p>
                            <p>The vaginal PH becomes more acidic to provide protection to some micro-organisms but also increases susceptibility to others such as candida albicans.</p>

                            <h4>a) Position and Size of Heart</h4>
                            <p>As the uterus enlarges and the diaphragm becomes elevated the heart is displaced upward and somewhat to the left with rotation on its long axis, so that the apex beat is moved laterally.</p>
                            <p>Cardiac capacity increases by 70-80mL; this may be due to increased volume or hypertrophy of cardiac muscle. The size of the heart appears to increase by about 12%</p>

                            <h4>b) Cardiac Output</h4>
                            <p>Cardiac output increases approximately 40% during pregnancy, reaching its maximum at 20-24 weeks gestation and continuing at this level until term.</p>
                            <p>The increase in output can be as much as 1.5L/min over the non pregnant level and is higher in multiple pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>The cardiac output increases from 5L to 7L/min by late pregnancy. This is caused by an increase in resting heart rate of about 15 beats per minute by the end of pregnancy and an increase in blood volume.</p>

                                    <p>Cardiac output is very sensitive to changes in body position. This sensitivity increases with advancing gestation. In a pregnant woman lying flat on her back, the uterus impinges upon the inferior vena cava, thereby decreasing venous return to the heart leading to supine hypotension syndrome.</p>
                                    <p>Clients in advanced pregnancy are therefore discouraged from lying in this position.</p>

                            <h4>c) Blood Pressure</h4>
                            <p>Systemic blood pressure declines slightly during pregnancy. There is a little change in systolic blood pressure, but diastolic pressure is reduced (5-10mmHg) from about 12-26 weeks.</p>
                            <p>Diastolic pressure increases thereafter to pre-pregnancy levels by about 36 weeks. (It is important to know the pre-pregnancy diastolic BP in order to accurately diagnose hypertensive disease in pregnancy).</p>
                            <p>The elevated venous pressure returns toward normal if the woman lies in the lateral recumbent position.</p>
                            <p>The obstruction posed by the uterus on the inferior vena cava and the pressure of the fetal presenting part on the common iliac vein can result in decreased venous return to the heart. This decreases cardiac output, leads to a fall in blood pressure, and contributes to edema in the lower limbs</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>d) Venous pressure</h4>
                            <p>There is no change in the upper body but venous return tends to increase in the lower extremities. There is decrease in venous return to the heart increases pressure and this results in edema.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>e) Peripheral Resistance</h4>
                            <p>Peripheral resistance declines because of decreased blood pressure and increased cardiac output. The red cell mass increases by about 18% by the end of the pregnancy. The plasma volume increases from the 10th week of pregnancy and reaches its maximum level of 50% above non-pregnant values by the 32nd to 34th week, and maintains this until term.</p>
                            <p>As the plasma increase is greater than that of the red cell mass, there is hemo-dilution effect. This results in lowered hemoglobin level. This effect is referred to as physiological anemia. The mean acceptable HB level in pregnancy is 10 - 12 g/dl of blood.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>f) Effects of the Labour on the Cardiovascular System</h4>
                            <p>When a patient is in supine position, uterine contractions can cause a 25% increase in maternal cardiac output, a 15% decrease in heart rate, and a resultant 33% increase in stroke volume.</p>
                            <p>However when the laboring patient is in the lateral recumbent position, the hemodynamic parameters stabilize, with only a 7.6% increase in cardiac output, a 0.7% decrease in heart rate, and a 7.7% increase in stroke volume.</p>
                            <p>These significant differences are attributable to inferior vena cava occlusion caused by the gravid uterus.</p>
                            <p>During contractions, pulse pressure increases 26% in the supine position but only 6% in the lateral recumbent position.</p>
                            <p>Central venous pressure increases in direct relationship to the intensity of uterine contraction and increased intra-abdominal pressure.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, cardiopulmonary blood volume increases 300-500mL during contractions. At the time of delivery, hemodynamic alterations vary with the anesthetic used.</p>

                            <h4>a) Anatomic and Physiologic Changes</h4>
                            <p>Pregnancy produces anatomic and physiologic changes that affect respiratory performance. Early in pregnancy, capillary dilatation occurs throughout the respiratory tract, leading to engorgement of the nasopharynx, larynx, trachea and bronchi.</p>
                            <p>This causes the voice to change and makes breathing though the nose difficult. Respiratory infections and preeclampsia aggravate these symptoms. Chest X-rays reveal increased vascular makings in the lungs.</p>
                            <p>As the uterus enlarges, the diaphragm is elevated as much as 4cm, and the rib cage is displaced upward and widens, increasing the lower thoracic diameter by 2cm and the thoracic circumference by up to 6cm.</p>
                            <p>Elevation of the diaphragm does not impede its movement. Abdominal muscles have less tone and are less active during the pregnancy, causing respiration to be mainly diaphragmatic.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>b) Volumes and Capacities</h4>
                            <p>Alterations occurring in lung volumes and capacities during pregnancy include the following:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                <li>Dead volume increases owing to relaxation of the musculature of conducting airways.</li>
                                <li>Tidal volume increases gradually (35-50%) as pregnancy progresses. Total lung capacity is reduced (4-5%) by the elevation of the diaphragm.</li>
                                <li>Functional residual capacity, residual volume, and respiratory reserve volume all decrease by about 20%.</li>
                                <li>Functional respiratory changes include a slight increase in respiratory rate, a 50% increase in minute ventilation, a 40% increase in tidal volume, and a progressive increase in oxygen consumption of up to 15-20% above non pregnant levels by term. With the increase in respiratory tidal volume associated with a normal respiratory rate, there is an increase in respiratory minute volume of approximately 26%.</li>
                                <li>Larger tidal volume and smaller residual volume cause increased alveolar ventilation (about 65%) during pregnancy. Inspiratory capacity increases by 5-10%.</li>
                                <li>As the respiratory minute volume increases, “hyperventilation of pregnancy “occurs, causing a decrease in alveolar CO2.</li>
                                <li>This decrease lowers the maternal blood CO2 tension; however alveolar oxygen tension is maintained within normal limits.</li>
                                <li>Maternal hyperventilation is considered a protective measure that prevents the fetus from the exposure to excessive levels of CO2.</li>

                            <h4>c) Effects of Labour on the Pulmonary System</h4>
                            <p>There is a further decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) during the early phase of each uterine contraction, resulting from redistribution of blood from the uterus to the central venous pool.</p>
                            <p>Because this decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC) occurs without a concomitant change in dead space, there is little residual dilution and, therefore, presumably more efficient gas exchange.</p>
                            <p>Capillary dilatation occurs in the respiratory route (Nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi) and this make breathing difficult through nose, enlarged Uterus pushes the diaphragm and the lungs as well.</p>

                                <li>Tidal volume increase by 35-50%</li>
                                <li>Residual volume decreased by 20%</li>
                                <li>Expiratory reserve volume decrease by 20%</li>
                                <li>So increase Tidal volume and decrease Residual volume leading to increased alveolar ventilation by 65%.</li>

                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>a) Introduction</h4>
                            <p>There is increased salivation. Women often experience changes in their sense of taste, leading to dietary changes and food cravings. Craving for substances such as bricks/soil is known as pica.</p>
                            <p>Excessive secretion of saliva during pregnancy is called ptyalism gravidarum.</p>
                            <p>Progesterone relaxes the smooth muscles. Gastric emptying and peristalsis are reduced in order to maximize the absorption of nutrients. Heartburn is common and is associated with gastric reflux due to relaxation of the cardiac sphincter.</p>
                            <p>Constipation is also common due to sluggish gut motility. Nausea and vomiting occur mainly during early pregnancy as a result of raised hormonal levels.</p>
                            <p>As the fetus and placenta grow and place increasing demands on the mother, phenomenal alterations in metabolism occur. The most obvious physical changes are weight gain and altered body shape.</p>
                            <p>Weight gain is due not only to the uterus and its contents but also to increase breast tissue, blood and water volume in the form of extra vascular and extracellular fluid.</p>
                            <p>Deposition of fat and protein and increased cellular water are added to the maternal stores.</p>
                            <p>The expected weight gain is approximately 2kg in the first 20 weeks followed by an average of 0.5 kg per week until term leading to 12 kg in total.</p>
                            <p>During normal pregnancy, approximately 1000g of weight gain is attributable to protein. Half of this is found in the fetus and the placenta, with the rest being distributed as uterine contractile protein, breast glandular tissue, plasma protein, and hemoglobin.</p>
                            <p>Total body fat increases during pregnancy, but the amount varies with total weight gain.</p>
                            <p>During the second half of pregnancy, plasma lipids increase, but triglycerides, cholesterol and lipoproteins decrease soon after delivery.</p>
                            <p>The ratio of low density lipoproteins to high density lipoproteins increases during pregnancy.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>b) Oral Cavity:</h4>
                            <p>Salivation may seem to increase due to difficulty in swallowing associated with nausea. This is prevalent mainly in the first trimester and should reduce with time.</p>
                            <p>Tooth decay during pregnancy, is not due to lack of calcium in the teeth. Indeed, dental calcium is stable and not mobilized during pregnancy as is bone calcium. If the pH of the oral cavity increases, tooth decay may occur. Pregnant women are therefore encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene.</p>
                            <p>The gums may become hypertrophic hyperaemic and friable; this maybe due to increased systemic estrogen. Vitamin C deficiency can also cause tenderness and bleeding of the gums. The gums should return to normal in the early puerperium</p>
                            <p>Gums becomes hypertrophic and hyperemic easily bleed (20 to increased systemic estrogen)</p>
                            <p>Gastrointestinal mobility May be reduced due to increased progesterone (w/c decreased the hormone motilin stimulate smooth muscles in GII) hence gastric emptying is slowed.</p>
                            <p>Similarly, in other part of GIT constipation (due to increased water absorption) Stomach Production of gastrin increase increased gastric volume and decreases PH, mucous production increased</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>c) Gastrointestinal Motility</h4>
                            <p>Gastrointestinal motility may be reduced during pregnancy due to increased levels of progesterone, which in turn decrease the production of motilin, a hormonal peptide that is known to stimulate smooth muscle in the gut.</p>
                            <p>This leads to a feeling of bloatedness which is common among pregnant women. Transit time of food throughout the gastrointestinal tract may be so much slower that more water than normal is reabsorbed, leading to constipation.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>d) Stomach and esophagus</h4>
                            <p>Gastric production of hydrochloric acid may be increased leading to hyperacidity (heart burn).</p>
                            <p>Esophageal peristalsis is decreased, accompanied by gastric reflux because of the slower emptying time and dilatation or relaxation of the gastro- esophageal sphincter.</p>
                            <p>Gastric reflux is more prevalent in later pregnancy owing to elevation of the stomach by the enlarged uterus.</p>
                            <p>These alterations as well as lying in the supine position, make the use of anesthesia more hazardous because of the increased possibility of regurgitation and aspiration.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>e) Small and Large Bowel and Appendix</h4>
                            <p>During pregnancy, the large and small bowels are displaced upward and laterally, the appendix is displaced superiorly in the right flank area.</p>
                            <p>These organs return to the normal positions in the early puerperium. As noted previously, motility and gastrointestinal tone are decreased.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>f) Gallbladder</h4>
                            <p>Gallbladder function is also altered during pregnancy because of the hypotonia of the smooth muscle wall.</p>
                            <p>Emptying time is slowed and often incomplete. Progesterone decreased motility leading to decreased empting time of bile hence causing stasis predisposing pregnant women to stone formation and infection.</p>
                            <p>Bile can become thick, and bile stasis may lead to gallstone formation.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>g) Liver</h4>
                            <p>There are no apparent morphologic changes in the liver during normal pregnancy, but there are functional alterations.</p>
                            <p>Serum alkaline phosphatase activity can double, probably because of increased placental alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes.</p>
                            <p>Thus, a decrease in the albumin/globulin ratio occurs normally in pregnancy. This needs to be taken into consideration when interpreting LFT results.</p>

                            <p>Progesterone relaxes the walls of the ureters and allows dilation and kinking. This tends to result in a slowing down or stasis of urinary flow, making infection a greater possibility.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>a) Renal Dilatation</h4>
                            <p>During pregnancy, each kidney increases in length by 1-1.5cm, with a concomitant increase in weight. The renal pelvis usually dilates. The ureters dilate, elongate, widen, and become more curved. Thus there is an increase in urinary stasis; this may lead to infection and may make tests of renal function difficult to interpret.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>b) Renal Function</h4>
                            <p>The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increases during pregnancy by about 50%. The renal plasma flow rate increases by as much as 25-50%. Urinary flow and sodium excretion rates in late pregnancy can be altered by posture, being twice as great in the lateral recumbent position as in the supine position.</p>
                            <p>Even though the GFR increases dramatically during pregnancy, the volume of the urine passed each day does not increase. Consequently, the serum urea and creatinine levels are reduced.</p>
                            <p>The increase in GFR coupled with the impairment of tubular reabsorption capacity for filtered glucose leads to glycosuria. Increased levels of urinary glucose also contribute to increased susceptibility to urinary tract infection (UTI).</p>
                            <p>Normally there is little change in Proteinuria during pregnancy; and therefore if more than 500mg/24h is lost, a disease process should be suspected e.g. pre-eclampsia/ eclampsia.</p>
                            <p>Renal function Change occur due to increased maternal and placental hormones (ACTH, ADH, cortisole, etc.) and increase in plasma volume.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Glomerular Filtration Rate increase by 50% (begins early and last up to term)</li>
                                <li>Renal blood flow rate increase by 20-25% (early to midtrimester) after the end of 2nd trimester remain constant.</li>
                                <li>Urine volume dose not increase although glomerular filtration rate increase because of reabsorption.</li>
                                <li>Creatinine and BUN decrease because of increased clearance rate</li>
                                <li>Proteinuria shows little changes during pregnancy.</li>

                            <h4>c) Water Retention</h4>
                            <p>Fluid retention, swelling or 'edema' affects about 65% of healthy pregnant women with a normal blood pressure.</p>
                            <p>While it can occur at any time in the pregnancy, it more commonly happens in the last 3 months of the pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>This is because by about 32 weeks, the blood circulating in the woman's body has increased by up to 50%.</p>
                            <p>It typically involves the lower extremities but occasionally appears as swelling or puffiness in the face or hands.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>d) Edema</h4>
                            <p>The most common cause of edema in pregnancy is Physiologic edema. This is due to an increase in the total amount of body fluid and a lower concentration of protein to keep the fluid in the blood vessels.</p>
                            <p>It may also result from hormone-induced sodium retention.</p>
                            <p>Pedal edema may also occur when the enlarged uterus intermittently compresses the inferior vena cava during recumbency, obstructing outflow from both femoral veins.</p>
                            <p>Physiological edema is a diagnosis of exclusion. (Physical examination aims to rule out the pathologic causes). Physiologic edema tends to worsen during the day especially when the patient is ambulant.</p>
                            <p>It is reduced by lying in the left lateral decubitus position, elevating the lower extremities, and using compression stockings. Pathological edema on the other hand, usually persists, even after elevating the feet.</p>
                            <p>Pathological causes of edema are less common but often dangerous. They include deep venous thrombosis (DVT), preeclampsia, renal disease and cardiac disease in pregnancy. Extensive, cellulitis, which usually causes focal erythema, may resemble general edema.</p>

                            <p>As the uterus enlarges; the urinary bladder is displaced upward and is flattened in the anterior-posterior diameter.</p>
                            <p>Bladder vascularity increases and muscle tone decreases, thereby increasing its capacity up to 1500ml.</p>
                            <p>Pressure from the uterus leads to increase in urinary frequency. This effect increases as pregnancy advances.</p>

                            <h4>a) Blood Volume</h4>
                            <p>The blood volume increases progressively until term by about 45-50% and is higher in multiple pregnancies.</p>
                            <p>The reason for increase in blood volume are:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                <li>More blood is required for extra blood flow to the uterus.</li>
                                <li>Need for extra metabolic needs of fetus and the mother.</li>
                                <li>Increased perfusion of other organs, especially kidneys.</li>
                                <li>The increased volume also compensates for maternal blood loss during delivery.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>b) Red Blood Cells</h4>
                            <p>The red blood cell mass increases by about 33%, however the plasma volume increases earlier and faster than red blood cell volume. This leads to physiologic anemia in pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>The hematocrit (PCV) then stabilizes or may increase slightly near term.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>c) Iron</h4>
                            <p>With the increase in red blood cells, the need for iron for the production of hemoglobin naturally increases. If supplemental iron is not added to the diet, iron deficiency anemia will result.</p>
                            <p>Maternal requirements can reach 5-6mg/d in the latter half of pregnancy. If iron is not readily available, the fetus uses iron from maternal stores.</p>
                            <p>Thus, the production of fetal hemoglobin is usually adequate even if the mother is severely iron deficient; and therefore anemia in the newborn is rarely a problem.</p>
                            <p>Instead, maternal iron deficiency more commonly may cause preterm labour and late spontaneous abortion, increasing the incidence of fetal wastage and maternal morbidity.</p>

                            <h4>d) White Blood Cells</h4>
                            <p>The total blood leukocyte counts increases during pregnancy from a pre-pregnancy level of 4300-4500/ml to 5000-12000/ml in the last trimester.</p>
                            <p>The polymorphonuclear leucocytes are the main contributors to this increase.</p>
                            <p>Lymphocyte and monocyte numbers stay essentially the same throughout pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>This should be taken into account when interpreting results of WBC counts in pregnancy.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h4>e) Clotting Factors</h4>
                            <p>During pregnancy, levels of several essential coagulation factors increase. There are marked increases in fibrinogen and factor VIII. Factors VII, IX, X, and XII also increased but to a lesser extent.</p>
                            <p>There is a decrease in factors- XI and XIII</p>
                            <p>Fibrinolytic activity is depressed during pregnancy and labour, although the precise mechanism is unknown.</p>
                            <p>Plasminogen levels increase concomitantly with fibrinogens levels, causing equilibrium of clotting and lysing activity.</p>
                            <p>Understanding these physiologic changes is necessary to manage two of the more serious problems of pregnancy – (that is hemorrhage and thromboembolic disease both caused by disorders in the mechanism of hemostasis).</p>

                            <h4>a) Nausea and vomiting</h4>
                            <p>This presents between 4 and 12 weeks’ gestation. Hormonal influences are listed as the most likely causes this are HCG, oestrogen and progesterone. It is usually occurring in the morning but can occur any time during the day, aggravated by smelling of food.</p>

                                <li>Reduce fatty and fried containing foods.</li>
                                <li>Rest</li>
                                <li>Eat small meals frequently, every two to three hours; do not skip meals; avoid hunger.</li>
                                <li>Have a snack before bedtime or during the night.</li>
                                <li>Try eating a piece of bread or a few crackers before getting up in the morning to quell nausea.</li>
                                <li>Get out of bed slowly; avoid sudden movements.</li>
                                <li>Avoid high fat and fried foods; eat lower-fat meats, poultry and fish; use skim or low-fat milk products; try carbohydrate-rich foods such as fruit, fruit juice, breads, cereals, rice, potatoes.</li>
                                <li>Drink fluids between rather than with meals to avoid stomach fullness at meal times.</li>
                                <li>Avoid strong food smells and cooking odours by eating cold foods, opening windows to freshen the air, avoiding coffee, garlic and other spices and having others cook when possible.</li>
                                <li>Avoid highly seasoned foods.</li>
                                <li>Avoid brushing your teeth immediately after eating; avoid brushing your tongue.</li>

                            </ol>

                            <h4>b) Heartburn:</h4>
                            <p>It is a burning sensation in the mid chest region. Progesterone relaxes the cardiac sphincter of the stomach and allows reflex of gastric contents into esophagus. Heart burn is most troublesome at 30-40 weeks gestation because at this stage is under pressure from the growing uterus.</p>
                            <p>Relief from heartburn is often achieved through simple dietary and lifestyle changes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Management:</strong></p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                <li>Eat small, lower-fat meals frequently. Dietary fat lowers the oesophageal sphincter tone, already reduced or relaxed by the hormonal changes associated with pregnancy.</li>
                                <li>Eat slowly, chew food well, avoid tension while eating</li>
                                <li>Drink fluids between meals rather than with meals to avoid stomach fullness</li>
                                <li>Avoid spicy foods that seem to exacerbate heartburn</li>
                                <li>Avoid lying down for at least one to two hours after eating to minimize reflux</li>
                                <li>Elevate the head of the bed</li>
                                <li>Avoid bending and stooping after eating</li>
                                <li>Avoid eating and drinking, except for water, before bedtime</li>
                                <li>Wear loose-fitting clothing</li>
                                <li>Do not take antacids without consulting a physician</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>c) Excessive Salivation (pytalism)</h4>
                            <p>Occurs from the 8th week of gestation and is thought to be caused by hormones of pregnancy</p>

                            <h4>d) Pica:</h4>
                            <p>This is the term used when mother craves certain foods of unnatural substances such as coal, soil...etc. The cause is unknown but hormones and changes in metabolism are blamed.</p>
                            <p><strong>Management:</strong></p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                <li>Seek medical advice if the substance craved is potentially harmful to the unborn baby.</li>
                                <li>Ask pregnant women if they have cravings for non-food items such as dirt or clay.</li>
                                <li>Advice women you suspect may be eating non-food substances of the potential risks.</li>
                                <li>If the behaviour persists, monitor iron status, maternal health and foetal development carefully.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>e) Constipation</h4>
                            <p>Constipation affects 11 to 38 percent of pregnant women. Constipation during pregnancy is linked to several physiological changes associated with pregnancy as well as an eating pattern low in fibre and liquids.</p>
                            <p>Hormonal changes relax the gastrointestinal tract, decreasing motility and increasing the transit time of waste through the colon.</p>
                            <p>Increases in progesterone levels also promote increased absorption of water from the colon, a factor linked to constipation.</p>
                            <p>The enlarging uterus contributes to constipation by putting pressure on the colon, sometimes displacing it and making bowel movements more difficult. Decreased physical activity, extra bed rest and iron supplements may also contribute to this common discomfort. Dietary and lifestyle changes usually correct it.</p>
                            <p><strong>Management:</strong></p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                <li>Increase the intake of water, fresh fruit, vegetables and ruphages in the diet</li>
                                <li>Exercise is helpful especially walking</li>
                                <li>Increase fibre intake by eating more whole grain breads and cereals; vegetables; and fruit and legumes such as beans, split peas and lentils.</li>
                                <li>Drink between 8 and 12 cups of fluid every day in the form of water, milk and juice. Warm or hot fluids may be particularly helpful.</li>
                                <li>Maintain an active lifestyle, for example, by walking or swimming regularly.</li>
                                <li>Avoid all laxatives unless one is recommended by a physician. Some types of laxatives are contraindicated during pregnancy.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>f) Lack of appetite</h4>
                            <p>This is a common condition in pregnancy which can lead to inadequate intake of food at a time of increased nutrient need.</p>
