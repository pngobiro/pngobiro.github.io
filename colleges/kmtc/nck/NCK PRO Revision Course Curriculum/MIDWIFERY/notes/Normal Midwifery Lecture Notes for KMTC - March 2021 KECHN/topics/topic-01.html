                            <p>This part of lecture notes provides learners with necessary knowledge on how to manage a woman with normal pregnancy, normal labour, normal puerperium and how to manage a normal neonate. It is expected that after acquiring these concepts in normal midwifery you will be able to provide quality care to pregnant women, women in labour and postnatal mothers with their babies.</p>

                                <li><strong>Lie</strong>- This is the relationship of the longitudinal axis of the fetus to the longitudinal axis of the mother (Lie can be longitudinal, oblique, transverse).</li>

                                <li><strong>Moulding</strong> -Refers to the process through which fetal skull bones come closer to each other due to pelvic forces when the fetal head is moving through the pelvis during delivery. Moulding enables reduction of fetal skull diameter and encourages progress of delivery through maternal pelvis. However, in some circumstances moulding can be excessive. Moulding has therefore been graded as follows:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>0 If bones are separated and the sutures can be felt easily</li>
                                        <li>+ If sutures are apposed but no overlap i.e. the bones are just touching each other</li>
                                        <li>++ If there is overlapping of the sutures but it is reducible</li>
                                        <li>+++ If the sutures overlap but not reducible</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Effacement</strong>- It is the process through which cervix shortens as it becomes included in the lower uterine segment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Engagement</strong>- Engagement is said to have taken place when the widest part of the presenting part of the fetus has successfully passed through the pelvic inlet.</li>

                            <h4>a) Possible signs (Presumptive signs)</h4>
                            <p>These are signs reported by the woman. They are signs that accompanies pregnancy but there are other causes to these signs other than pregnancy. These signs include: -</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Amenorrhea (4 weeks +)</strong> but may have other causes e.g. stress. Breastfeeding, menopause, anemia, contraceptive use, emotional stress.</li>
                                <li><strong>Morning sickness (4 – 14 weeks)</strong> especially nausea and vomiting from 6 weeks due to gastric upset related to HcG production. Differential diagnosis is indigestion, emotional stress or appendicitis.</li>
                                <li><strong>Frequency in micturition/Bladder irritability (6 – 12 weeks)</strong> due to increased vascularity and pressure on the bladder. Other than pregnancy this can be caused by Diabetes Mellitus, Urinary tract infections or Urinary system tumors.</li>
                                <li><strong>Breast changes (3-4 weeks +)</strong> e.g. increased vascularity, primary areola become more pigmented and the Montgomery tubercles are more marked. However this can be caused by hormonal changes, contraceptive use among others.</li>
                                <li><strong>Skin changes</strong> at external genitalia and anal area become darker due to increased vascularity. At 12 weeks, abdomen may have striae and linea nigra. Skin changes in pregnancy is mainly due to increased production or sensitivity to adrenocortical hormone during pregnancy. Skin changes may not be definitive sign of pregnancy since it can occur due to Cushing's syndrome or in sudden weight loss. Other skin changes seen in pregnancy include: -Chloasma, Linea nigra, Striae gravidarum, stretch marks and spider telangiectasia.</li>
                                <li><strong>Quickening (16-20 weeks)</strong> – is a feeling of life within the uterus and occurs at about 16 weeks' gestation. This can also be caused by intestinal movement(Wind).</li>
                                <li><strong>Leucorrhea</strong>- This occurs mainly due to hyperplasia of vaginal epithelial cells and also due to cervical changes as a result of increased hormonal levels during pregnancy. It can also be as a result of vaginal infection or vaginal irritants.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>These are signs that are highly suggestive of pregnancy however they are not specific(definitive) to pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>They are signs obtained from physical examination.</p>
                            <p>These signs include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Enlargement of the uterus to become globular in shape. This sign might also be as a result of uterine tumours.</li>
                                <li>Cervix become soft (Hegar's or Goodell's sign or Ladin's sign) – on bimanual examination, a firm cervix is felt softer body and compressible, softer isthmus at about 6 -8 weeks. Although this sign is associated with pregnancy, it may also occur in pelvic congestion.</li>
                                <li>Darkening of the vaginal mucosa from 8 weeks. It reaches maximum intensity at the 16th week and then persists throughout pregnancy. Also known as Chadwick's sign or Jacquemier's sign which is the dark purplish/bluish colour and congestion of the vulva and vaginal mucous membranes.</li>
                                <li>Pulsation in fornices (Osiander's sign). When this is due to pregnancy, it occurs at around 8 weeks. However this can also be found in pelvic congestion.</li>
                                <li>Immunological test in which the HcG secreted by the blastocyst is found in the woman's early morning urine/ blood specimen as early as 2 weeks gestation. HcG is also found in women with Choriocarcinoma and Hydatidiform mole hence making this test not specific to pregnancy.</li>
                                <li>Internal ballotment may be done from 16 weeks but this may be difficult in primigravida and fat women.</li>
                                <li>Ease in flexibility of the body of uterus (McDonald's sign).</li>
                                <li>Irregular softening and enlargement of the uterine fundus (Von Fernwald's sign).</li>
                                <li>Uterine contractions elicited by bimanual examination (Palmer's sign).</li>
                                <li>Piskacek's sign-This refers to a palpable soft prominence in one of the location where uterine tubes meets the uterus (Cornua).</li>
                                <li>Early bleeding that may be associated with implantation process (Hartman's sign). This is not a specific sign to pregnancy as it may be as a result of other causes such as tumors and infections of reproductive tract.</li>
                                <li>Braxton hick's contraction (at 16 weeks)- irregular painless contractions that may be felt upon palpation. They prepare the uterus for labor as well as facilitating circulation of blood to and fro the placenta. However, these may be confused with intestinal movements.</li>
