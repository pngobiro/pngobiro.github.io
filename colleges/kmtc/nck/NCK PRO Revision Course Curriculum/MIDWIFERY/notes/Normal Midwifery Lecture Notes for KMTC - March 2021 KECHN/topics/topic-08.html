                            <p>A normal neonate is a baby born after 38-40 weeks of gestation with no complications or requires minimal resuscitation.</p>
                            <p>Neonate refers to period of life within the first 28 days of life.</p>

                            <h3>Characteristics of a normal neonate (Baby)</h3>
                            <p>Characteristics of a normal neonate includes:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> The normal term baby weighs 2500 – 3500 gms, has average height of 50cm from the crown of the head to the heels with an approximate occipital-frontal circumference of 33-35cm. Most of the babies are plump and have prominent abdomen. They lie in an attitude of flexion with arms extended, their fingers reach upper thigh level.</li>
                                <li><strong>The skin</strong> of a mature newborn is then delicate and easily traumatized by friction pressure. On the skin appear downy with hair called lanugo, which is often fond over the face, shoulders, upper arms and thighs. The general colour of the skin depends on the baby's ethnic origin ranging from pink and white to olive or dark brown. Pigmentation of nipples and genitalia is deeper in babies with dark skins. A mature baby has may skin creases on palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Nails are fully formed and adherent to the lip of fingers. The eyebrows and eye lashes present a similar variation. The cartilage of the ears is well formed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Respiration:</strong> The normal baby has a shallow erratic and diaphragmatic breathing pattern, with resting respiratory rate ranging between 35-40 breaths per minute with chest and abdomen rising and falling synchronously.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cardiovascular system:</strong> The heart rate varies between 120-160 beats per minute and fluctuates in accordance with baby's respiratory function and activity, blood pressure average in full term baby ranges from 50-55 mmHg systolic and 25mmHg – 30 mmHg diastolic.</li>
                                <li><strong>Temperature regulation:</strong> A normal baby's axillary temperature ranges between 36.50°C – 37.20°C. A healthy clothed term baby will maintain the body temperature satisfactorily provided that the environmental temperature is sustained between 180°C – 210°C, nutrition is adequate and movements are not restricted.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reproductive System(Genitalia):</strong> Boys-Testes are descended into scrotum, which has plentiful rugae. The urethral meatus opens at the tip of the penis and the prepuce adherent to the glans. Girls-born at term the labia majora normally covers the labia minora, the hymen and clitoris may appear disproportionately large. Withdrawal of Maternal Oestrogen in both sexes result into breast engorgement, sometimes accompanied by secretion of milk by the 4th or 5th day. Girls may develop pseudo-menstruation for the same reason. Both sexes have a nodule of breast tissue around the nipple.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reflexes:</strong> mature infant has all the reflexes developed to include moro, walking, sucking, rooting, grasping, swallowing and sneezing.</li>

                            <p>Intrauterine and extra uterine environments are markedly different from each other. The intrauterine environment is entirely life sustaining in oxygen, nutrition, excretion and thermoregulation. The transition from intra-uterine life to extra-uterine life is dramatic and demands effective physiological adaptations by the new-born for survival. Therefore, expected changes following birth includes: -</p>

                            <h3>A. Changes in the Lungs</h3>
                            <p>The onset of respiration in a newborn confirms life. The start of pulmonary respiration is due to physiological and mechanical reasons. Lack of oxygen and high levels of carbon dioxide in the circulation occur when placental circulation ceases. This stimulates the respiratory centre in the medulla to initiate normal respiration.</p>
                            <p>Mechanically, respiration is stimulated when the chest wall, which was compressed during the passage of the baby in the birth canal, allows the fluid to drain from the lungs. Consequently, the cool air on the baby's face and handling during birth will stimulate the baby to cry as soon as they are born. After the baby takes in their first breath, the blood vessels in the lungs expand to initiate respiration.</p>
                            <p>At first the baby's breathing may be rapid and irregular. It is mainly abnormal at a rate of 40 - 50 respirations per minute.</p>
                            <p>Pulmonary adaptation to extra-uterine life can be summarized as:</p>
                            <p>The onset of respiration immediately after birth of a newborn confirms life. The start of pulmonary respiration is due to physiological and mechanical factors. Lack of oxygen and high level of carbon dioxide in the circulation when placental circulation ceases. This stimulates the respiratory centre respiratory centre in the brain (medulla) to initiate normal breathing. Mechanically, respiration is initiated when the chest wall which was compressed during passage of the baby through the birth canal. Cool air on the baby's face and handling of the baby during birth stimulate the baby to cry as soon as they are born. During this first cry, the baby takes in the first breath, this leads to the expansion of blood vessels in the lungs and respiration is initiated.</p>

                            <h3>B. Circulatory Changes</h3>
                            <p>After birth:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Foetal type of circulation ceases as the respiration commences</li>
                                <li>Normal circulation starts when the temporary structures stop functioning</li>
                                <li>As the placental circulation ceases soon after birth when the umbilical cord is ligated, the blood flow to the right side of the heart decreases and the blood on the left side increases causing the foreman ovale to close.</li>
                                <li>With the establishment of pulmonary respiration, the ductus arteries close. Complete closure happens within eight to ten hours of birth.</li>
                                <li>The cessation of placental circulation will result in the collapse and subsequently drying of the umbilical veins, the ductus venosus and the hypogastric arteries.</li>
                                <li>Anatomical closure by fibrous tissue occurs within two to three months, resulting in the formation of the ligamentum teres, ligamentum venosum and obliterated hypogastric arteries.</li>
                                <li>Cardiopulmonary adaptations, which take place at birth, are interdependent. This means that failure to establish respiration and satisfactory tissue oxygenation presents a life threatening situation to the neonate.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In summary, cardiopulmonary adaptation can be summarized as follows: -</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Immediately after separation of the placenta, the baby's circulatory system must divert deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation.</li>
                                <li>This involves several mechanisms influenced by the umbilical cord clamping and the lowered resistance in the pulmonary vascular bed.</li>
                                <li>At birth lung expansion and lowered pulmonary vascular bed, leads to all the cardiac output being sent to the lungs.</li>
                                <li>Oxygenated blood returning to the heart from the lungs, increases the pressure within the left atrium</li>
                                <li>At almost the same time pressure in the right atrium is lowered as blood flow via the cord stops. This leads to the functional closure of foramen ovale.</li>
                                <li>In the first few days of life, this closure is reversible—especially if pulmonary resistance is high; eg during crying leading to transient cyanotic episodes in the baby.</li>
                                <li>Differences in pressure and oxygen concentration in heart chambers normally facilitates closure of temporally structures of foetal circulation.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>C. Thermal (Heat) Regulation</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The neonate leaves a thermo constant environment of 37.1 degrees Celsius, where they have survived for nine months and enters a much cooler atmosphere at delivery. This leads to rapid cooling of the baby as amniotic fluid evaporates from the skin.</li>
                                <li>Baby’s large surface area—body mass ratio potentiates heat loss especially from the head (comprises 25% of body mass).</li>
                                <li>Firstly, heat regulation in the neonate is poor because of their inefficient heat regulating centre. The subcutaneous fat layer of the neonate is thin and provides poor insulation, allowing the transfer of core heat to the environment and also cooling of the baby’s blood.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In addition to evaporation, further heat will be lost by conduction when the baby is in contact with cold surfaces, by radiation to cold objects in the environment and by convection caused by currents of cool air passing over the surface of their body. Incidences of the latter may be substantially increased by air conditioning systems in some of our modern delivery rooms. Since the neonate’s temperature regulating centres are not very efficient, there is a risk of either overheating or chilling. Means through which neonate loss heat can be summarized as:</p>

                                <li>Physiological jaundice is usually seen in 50% of normal neonates from the third to the sixth day of life. This is due to excessive break down of red blood cells resulting from a high haemoglobin level (Hb of 14 - 18mgs/100mls).</li>
                                <li>The process of breaking down red blood cells leads to formation of bilirubin. The liver is not able to conjugate the excess bilirubin to enable its secretion through the kidneys. This leads to jaundice</li>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The neonate is capable of passing the first stool, known as meconium, within the first two to three days of life. This is because the foetus swallows liquor amnii in utero. Thus, their sucking and swallowing reflexes are usually present at birth.</li>
                                <li>The colour of the meconium is dark greenish and later changes to a mustard (yellowish) colour. The bowels may be opened three to five times daily.</li>
                                <li>Hydrochloric acid is present in the stomach in high concentration within the first day of life</li>
                                <li>Enzymes such as amylase from saliva and pancreas are present in low quantities and hence the poor digestion of carbohydrates in the early weeks in life.</li>
                                <li>Trypsin and lipase are present from intrauterine life.</li>
                                <li>Population of the gut by microorganisms (normal flora) is important for synthesis of some vitamins i.e. vitamin K which is important for formation of clotting factors</li>
                                <li>Feeding must start early to allow the colonization of the gut.</li>

                                <li>At birth the new-born is susceptible-to infections, especially those gaining entry the mucosa of the respiratory and GIT systems. Localization of infection is poor and minor infections have the potential to become generalized very easily.</li>
                                <li>Some immunoglobulins are present at birth but no learnt immune response to specific antigens due to sheltered intrauterine life. There are three main. Immunoglobulins-IgG, IgA and IgM and among the three only IgG is small enough to cross the placental barrier-offers immunity to specific viral infections.</li>
                                <li>Levels of IgG at birth are usually equal or slightly higher than mother's, providing passive immunity for the first few months of life. IgM and IgA are manufactured by the fetus. Levels of IgM at term are at 20% of adult's, takes 2 years to reach adult levels. (High IgM levels at birth is suggestive of intrauterine infection). Low levels of IgM at birth thought to predispose baby to enteric infections.</li>
                                <li>IgA are usually very low at birth and increase slowly but secretory salivary levels reach adult values within 2 months. IgA protects against infections of the respiratory, gastrointestinal tracts and eyes.</li>
                                <li>Breast milk esp. colostrum provides passive immunity in the form of Lactobacillus bifidus, lactoferrin, lysozyme and secretory IgA among others. The thymus gland where lymphocytes are produce is relatively large at birth and continues to grow until 8 years of age.</li>

                            <p>The average normal birth weight ranges from 2.5 - 3.5 kilograms. During the first three days of life, the baby loses approximately 10 - 20% of their birth weight but regains it again within one to two weeks. Reasons for weight loss includes: -</p>

                                <li>Due to tissue fluid loss during the heat loss when the baby is born</li>
                                <li>When the baby opens their bowels, the meconium which was present in the gut is lost, leading to weight reduction</li>
                                <li>Poor sucking on the breast due to tiredness incurred during the baby's passage through the birth canal during labour will affect the baby's weight since they are not getting enough fluid intake</li>

                                <li>The skin of a newborn is covered with vernix caseosa in utero to protect and help retain heat and also act as a lubricant during delivery.</li>
                                <li>The sebaceous glands cease to produce vernix after birth, which may lead to dryness of the skin. The vernix caseosa will peel off within three days of delivery if left alone. There is also plenty of fine hair (lanugo) on the skin which falls off in the first month of life.</li>

                                <li>The long bones are incompletely ossified to facilitate growth at the epiphyses. The bones of the skull also reveal lack of ossification. This is essential for growth of the brain and facilitates moulding during labour-moulding resolves a few days after birth.</li>
                                <li>The posterior fontanelle closes at 6-8 weeks with anterior remaining open until 18 moths of age. This makes assessment of dehydration and intracranial pressure possible by palpation of fontanelle tension.</li>

                            <h3>1. Immediate care of the baby</h3>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>The baby is laid across the mother's abdomen as the cord is clamped, ligated and cut. The timing of the clamping of the cord is not crucial unless asphyxia, prematurity or rhesus incompatibility.</li>
                                <li><strong>Airway:</strong> As soon as the baby is born, airway is cleared to allow him/her breath well by removing any mucus that would cause obstruction for air entry. During this time the baby is put in supine position with the head turned and tilted to the side. The airway may be cleared using suction apparatus which should have been prepared ready before hand. During the delivery of the baby's head, excess mucus may be wiped gently from the mouth. Immediately the baby is born, they should be held slanting with the head at a lower angle for a short period to allow drainage of mucus and liquor amnii, which may have been swallowed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stimulate the baby to cry.</strong> The baby is stimulated to cry in order to take its first breath is present.</li>
                                <li><strong>Keeping the baby warm:</strong> As soon as the baby is born, he/she should be covered warm by use of linen and should be handled gently to reduce heat loss hence hypothermia. The delivery room should be at a temperature ranging between 180c – 210c and any baby with difficulty in controlling temperature should be taken to incubator to have the temperature controlled. Wrap the baby with a towel and place them in a warm cot with their head to one side. The head should be lower than the body in order for the secretions to drain and not block the airway. Ensure that the baby has an identification wristlet, which should be put on before the baby leaves the delivery couch/bed. Note that cold stress in a newborn can lead to :- Increased oxygen demand, Decreased surfactant production, Respiratory distress, Hypoglycemia, Metabolic acidosis, and Jaundice</li>
                                <li>Provide the baby to rest for an hour in order to recuperate from the strain of labour and birth. Frequent observations should be made during this period to ensure that the baby's respiration is normal, and that they are not bleeding or hemorrhaging from the cord.</li>
                                <li>Perform an APGAR score within the first minute, then after five minutes and lastly at ten minutes after birth. This baby's condition should be scored using APGAR scored method at 1 minute and 5 minutes to be able to assess the condition and decide on the care to be given to this baby.</li>
                                <li>Encourage Early breast feeding: The baby should be put on the mother's breast as soon as it is convenient to allow early feeding and prevention of hypoglycemia and also establishment of lactation earlier enough.</li>
                                <li>Weigh the baby and tell the mother the weight of the baby.</li>
                                <li>Identification: Ensure that the baby has an identification wristlet, which should be put on before the baby leaves the delivery couch/bed.</li>
                                <li>Show the mother the baby and let the mother identify the sex of the baby</li>
                                <li>Apply T.E.O to prevent Ophthalmia neonatorum (Congenital conjunctivitis)</li>
                                <li>Administer Vitamin K. 1mg I.M on the Vastus Lateralis (For term baby)</li>

                                <li><strong>Perform 1st examination of the newborn:</strong> to rule out any congenital malformation and to rule out any birth injury and finally to confirm the gestation of the baby in relation to gestation by date, this will be done daily to assess the progress of the baby.</li>
                                <li><strong>Maintenance of the Established Respiration:</strong> A normal baby should continue to breathe and maintain a good skin colour without medical intervention. The head of the cot should also be lowered in such circumstances. Measures should be taken to avoid suffocation from the pillow, clothes covering the baby or mother lying over the baby.</li>
                                <li><strong>Observations:</strong> The baby is observed twice a day to assess the condition and rule out any complications which would be either minor, major and or both are taken for appropriate action. The colour of urine and stool should also be done with energy passage for colour, amount and frequency to not deviation from normal</li>
                                <li><strong>Personal hygiene:</strong> The baby is done top tailing daily to keep him/her clean and the umbilical cord is cleaned using methylated spirit to reduce chances of infection through this route.</li>
                                <li><strong>Breast Feeding and nutrition:</strong> The baby should be put on the breast with the assistant of the nurse. The breast feeding therefore continues on demand and the mother should also be advised to bathe twice a day and wash hands every after visiting the toilet.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mother to baby bounding:</strong> The midwife will encourage the mother to core of the baby very closely and carefully especially while breast feeding to allow the bondage to take place, and also to assist new mother to have the confidence in the care of the baby through education and demonstration.</li>
                                <li><strong>Protection from Injury and Infection:</strong> The midwife should instruct the mother on how to handle her baby, and teach the mother not to use appliances that can cause injuries to the baby. Infection, especially cross infection, can be minimized by encouraging mothers to handle their own babies. Anybody in contact with the child should be encouraged to wash their hands before handling the baby. Immunization should be administered to protect the neonate from certain preventable diseases</li>
                                <li><strong>Skin Care:</strong> The neonate's skin is fragile and easily bruised. Therefore, irritants such as antiseptics, fabric softeners are discouraged.</li>

                                <li><strong>Moro Reflex:</strong> Support the baby's head and body in supine position about a centimetre from the cot. Allow the head to drop back. Look at the baby's response. The baby throws out his arms extending the elbows and fingers with embracing movements of the arms</li>
                                <li><strong>Tonic Neck Reflex:</strong> A fencing position is assumed, that is, the baby lies on the back, head rotated to one side with one arm and leg partially or completely extended</li>
                                <li><strong>Rooting Reflex:</strong> To test for the rooting reflex, gently touch the corner of the baby's mouth with clean fingers. The baby will open his mouth turning towards the stimulus in anticipation of the mother's nipple.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stepping Reflex:</strong> Hold the infant up, with the feet touching a surface. The infant will attempt to make some steps or pressing movements.</li>
                                <li><strong>Grasping Reflex:</strong> At birth, the grasping reflex of both hands and feet is present. The infant will grasp any object you place in their hand, and then let it go</li>
                                <li><strong>Protective Reflex:</strong> Other reflexes include protective reflexes such as:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The blinking reflex, which protects the eyes from bright light</li>
                                        <li>Sneezing and coughing reflexes used to clear the infant's throat</li>
                                        <li>The yawn reflex, which draws additional oxygen</li>
                                        <li>Cry reflex, which helps to withdraw from painful stimuli</li>
                                        <li>Swallowing reflex.</li>
