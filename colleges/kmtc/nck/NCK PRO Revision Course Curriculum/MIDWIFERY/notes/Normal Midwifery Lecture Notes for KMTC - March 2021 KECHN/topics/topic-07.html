                            <p>Puerperium is defined as the time from the delivery of the placenta through the first six (6) weeks after the delivery.</p>
                            <p>It is expected that by the sixth week after delivery, most of the changes of pregnancy, labor, and delivery have resolved and the body has reverted to the non-pregnant state.</p>
                            <p>In the puerperium period, various physiological and psychological changes occur, namely:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Reproductive organs return to the non-gravid state. Eg. uterus shrinks and shed its linings. Her cervix closes, her vagina returns to normal size, breast produce milk.</li>
                                <li>Previous physiological changes which occurred during pregnancy are revered.</li>
                                <li>Bonding between the newborn and parents is established.</li>
                                <li>The mother recovers from stresses of pregnancy and delivery.</li>
                                <li>Initiation of lactation begins.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Post-partum period is the interval between the birth of the placenta and the return of the reproductive organs to their normal no pregnant state</p>

                            <h3>The Psychology of the Mother during Puerperium</h3>
                            <p>During the puerperium the mother is subjected to emotional turmoil and you must be supportive and observant. She should be allowed to cuddle her baby and express her love as she wishes. This maternal instinct is at times delayed.</p>
                            <p>The midwife should be kind, patient, and compassionate towards the mother and give her the necessary education concerning her and the baby. Each mother should be taken as an individual based on her maternal experience, educational background, maturity and parity. Mothers should be given all the information necessary to ensure they know how to care for their babies.</p>
                            <p><strong>Rooming</strong> is the term given when a hospital plans for the mother to stay with the baby for most of the 24 hours in a day. It is highly recommended because it has been seen to have great psychological advantages for both mother and baby. Bonding commences immediately and demand breast-feeding can be successfully practised. Most baby-friendly hospitals in this country encourage rooming in.</p>

                            <h4>Processes leading to involution of the uterus</h4>
                            <p>Involution of the uterus occurs as a result of two mechanisms, namely: -</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li><strong>Autolysis</strong> is a process by which muscle fibres are digested by the proteolytic hormone. The muscle fibres have to dissolve a large amount of their protein in order to achieve this reduction in size. This means that a great deal of nitrogen is excreted by the body in the urine together with the excess fluid retained during pregnancy. This explains why a lot of urine containing large amounts of nitrogen is excreted during the first few days after delivery. Loss of lochia further assist in reduction of the uterus.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ischaemia</strong> is localised anaemia of the uterus, which occurs when the placenta is expelled. Blood vessels are constricted, which results in the reduction of the blood supply to the uterus.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>How to promote involution</h4>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Promote good health and nutrition to the mother during puerperium</li>
                                <li>Early ambulation and exercises (eg Kegel’s exercise).</li>
                                <li>Preventing infection by observing universal infection prevention protocols.</li>
                                <li>Encourage exclusive breastfeeding</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>Ways of knowing involution of the uterus is taking place:</h4>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Taking the measurements of the fundal height which supposed to be reduced by 1cm daily as shown in the above diagram.</li>
                                <li>The rectum and bladder should be emptied before examination because when they are full they displace the uterus upwards. The measurement is done from the level of the symphysis pubis to the fundus.</li>
                                <li>Observation of the normal lochia loss persistent red lochia indicates sub involutions of the uterus.</li>

                            <h3>Changes in the Uterus</h3>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li><strong>There is reduction in uterine size mainly as evidenced by:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The uterus sinks into the pelvis and the fundus is felt midway between the umbilicus and symphysis</li>
                                        <li>One week after completion of labour, the fundus is approximately 7.5cm above the symphysis pubis.</li>
                                        <li>In 10-12 days after labour the fundus is not usually palpable</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>There is endometrial regeneration.</strong> Endometrial Regeneration takes place within 2 or 3 days after delivery, the remaining decidua becomes differentiated into two layers: superficial layer becomes necrotic, and it is sloughed in the lochia and the basal layer adjacent to the myometrium remains intact and is the source of new endometrium. Endometrial regeneration is rapid, except at the placental site which within a week or so, becomes covered by epithelium, and the entire endometrium is restored during the third week.</li>
                                <li><strong>Placental Site Involution.</strong> Complete extrusion of the placental site takes up to 6 weeks. When this process is defective, late puerperal hemorrhage may ensue. Immediately after delivery, the placental site is about the size of the palm of the hand, but it rapidly decreases thereafter. By the end of the second week, it is 3 to 4 cm in diameter. Within hours of delivery, the placental site normally consists of many thrombosed vessels that ultimately undergo the typical organization of a thrombus.</li>
                                <li><strong>Changes in the Uterine Vessels:</strong> After delivery, the caliber of extra-uterine vessels decreases. Within the puerperal uterus, blood vessels are obliterated by hyaline changes, and vessels that are smaller replace them.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lochia:</strong> Discharge from the uterus during puerperium, it is alkaline in nature in which microorganisms can flourish more rapidly than in the normally acid situation of the vagina. It has a heavy but non offensive odour, it undergoes sequential changes s the involution of the uterus progresses. There are three types of lochia, namely:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Lochai Rubra.</strong> Occurs from 1st 3- 4th day. Immediately after delivery, a large amount of red blood flows from the uterus until the contraction phase occurs. Thereafter, the volume of vaginal discharge (lochia) rapidly decreases. Usually consist of blood from placental site, debris arising from the decidua and chorion</li>
                                        <li><strong>Lochia Serosa.</strong> Occurs from 5th -9th day. The red discharge progressively changes to brownish red, with a waterier consistency. It is pink in colour, has less blood and more serum also contains leucocytes from the placental site.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Lochia alba.</strong> It occurs from 10th day to 2-3 weeks. Over a period of weeks, the discharge continues to decrease in amount and color and eventually changes to yellow. period of time the lochia can last varies, although it averages approximately 5 weeks. Contains leucocytes, cervical mucus, and debris from healing tissues</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                            <h3>Changes in the Cervix</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>After delivery, the cervix appears soft and edematous and has little tone.</li>
                                <li>The cervix constricts rapidly and regains its shape by the end of the first week. Then, it is firm and thicker.</li>
                                <li>The external os is contracted, only about one cm dilated. The cervix is healed by the fourth to sixth week after delivery.</li>
                                <li>The external os assumes a typical transverse slit of a parous woman.</li>
                                <li>Immediately after delivery, the cervix is soft and vascular and may be seen protruding in the vagina. It admits 2-3fingers.</li>
                                <li>It usually loses its vascularity to hardness with 2-4 days.</li>
                                <li>By the 4th week after delivery, cervix has completely closed.</li>
                                <li>The form of the cervix after delivery depends on the number of pregnancies the woman had and whether the woman had any lacerations during delivery.</li>
                                <li>During delivery, lacerations in the cervix and the vagina heal well spontaneously unless infected.</li>
                                <li>The cervix also begins to rapidly revert to a non-pregnant state, but it never returns to the nulliparous state. By the end of the first week, the external os closes such that a finger cannot be easily introduced.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Changes in the Vagina</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The vagina also regresses but it does not completely return to its prepregnant size. Resolution of the increased vascularity and edema occurs by 3 weeks, and the rugae of the vagina begin to reappear in women who are not breastfeeding. At this time, the vaginal epithelium appears atrophic on smear. This is restored by weeks 6-10; however, it is further delayed in breastfeeding mothers because of persistently decreased estrogen levels.</li>
                                <li>The woman's vagina is stretched, smooth and swollen and has very little muscle tone after delivery.</li>
                                <li>Within one to two days, the swelling decreases and the vagina starts to return to its normal shape.</li>
                                <li>Exercises can improve the muscle tone of the vagina</li>
                                <li>The mucosa remains atrophic in lactating woman at least until menstruation begins again.</li>
                                <li>Thickening of vaginal mucosa occurs with the return of ovarian function.</li>
                                <li>The reduced estrogen levels also responsible for causing a decreased amount of vaginal lubrication, so localized dryness and dyspareunia may persist until ovarian function returns and menstruation resumes.</li>

                            <h3>Systemic Changes</h3>
                            
                            <h4>Changes in the Perineum</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The perineum has been stretched and traumatized, and sometimes torn or cut, during the process of labor and delivery.</li>
                                <li>The swollen and engorged vulva rapidly resolves within 1-2 weeks.</li>
                                <li>Most of the muscle tone is regained by 6 weeks, with more improvement over the following few months.</li>
                                <li>The muscle tone may or may not return to normal, depending on the extent of injury to muscle, nerve, and connecting tissues.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Changes in the Abdominal wall</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The abdominal wall remains soft and poorly toned for many weeks.</li>
                                <li>The return to a prepregnant state depends greatly on maternal exercise.</li>
                                <li>Abdominal muscles protrude during the first days after birth.</li>
                                <li>During the first 2 weeks after birth the abdominal wall is relaxed and it takes approximately 6 weeks to return almost to its nonpregnant state</li>
                                <li>The skin regains most of its previous elasticity, but some striae may present</li>
                                <li>The return of muscle tone depends on previous tone, proper exercise, and the amount of adipose tissue.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Changes in the Ovaries</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The resumption of normal function by the ovaries is highly variable and is greatly influenced by breastfeeding the infant.</li>
                                <li>The woman who breastfeeds her infant has a longer period of amenorrhea and anovulation than the mother who chooses to bottle-feed.</li>
                                <li>The mother who does not breastfeed may ovulate as early as 27 days after delivery. Most women have a menstrual period by 12 weeks; the mean time to first menses is 7-9 weeks.</li>
                                <li>In the breastfeeding woman, the resumption of menses is highly variable and depends on a number of factors, including how much and how often the baby is fed and whether the baby's food is supplemented with formula.</li>
                                <li>The delay in the return to normal ovarian function in the lactating mother is caused by the suppression of ovulation due to the elevation in prolactin.</li>
                                <li>Half to three fourths of women who breastfeed return to periods within 36 weeks of delivery.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Changes in the Breasts and lactation</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The changes to the breasts that prepare the body for breastfeeding occur throughout pregnancy. If delivery ensues, lactation can be established as early as 16 weeks' gestation.</li>
                                <li>Lactogenesis is initially triggered by the delivery of the placenta, which results in falling levels of estrogen and progesterone, with the continued presence of prolactin.</li>
                                <li>If the mother is not breastfeeding, the prolactin levels decrease and return to normal within 2-3 weeks.</li>
                                <li>The colostrum is the liquid that is initially released by the breasts during the first 2-4 days after delivery.</li>
                                <li>High in protein content, this liquid is protective for the newborn.</li>
                                <li>The colostrum, which the baby receives in the first few days postpartum, is already present in the breasts, and suckling by the newborn triggers its release.</li>
                                <li>The process, which begins as an endocrine process, switches to an autocrine process; the removal of milk from the breast stimulates more milk production.</li>
                                <li>Over the first 7 days, the milk matures and contains all necessary nutrients in the neonatal period. The milk continues to change throughout the period of breastfeeding to meet the changing demands of the baby.</li>
                                <li>The actual secretion of milk starts from the 2nd day puerperium because the oestrogen level in blood circulation is still high and they reduce gradually. This is because prolactin which is responsible for production of breast milk acts on the lower levels of oestrogen.</li>
                                <li>The human breast milk is white and rich in sugar (lactose) which is more than any other milk.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Changes in the Endocrine system</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Placental hormones.</strong> Expulsion of the placenta results in dramatic decreases of hormones produced by placenta. The placental enzyme insulinaze causes the diabetogenic effects of pregnancy to be reversed, resulting in significantly lower blood sugar levels in the immediate postpartum period.</li>
                                <li>Estrogen and progesterone levels decrease markedly after expulsion of the placenta, reaching their lowest levels 1 week into the postpartum period. Decreased estrogen level associated with; breast engorgement, and diuresis of excess extracellular fluid that has accumulated during pregnancy.</li>
                                <li>The estrogen levels in nonlactating women begin to increase by 2 weeks after birth, and higher by postpartum day 17.</li>
                                <li><strong>Pituitary hormones and ovarian function:</strong> -Lactating and nonlactating women differ in the time of the first ovulation. The persistence of elevated serum prolactin levels in breast feeding women appears to be responsible for suppressing ovulation. Prolactin levels decline in nonlactating women, reaching the prepregnant range by third week. About 70% of nonlactating women resume menstruation by 3 months after birth.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Changes in the kidney and renal system</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The diminishing steroids levels after birth may explain the reduced renal function that occurs during the puerperium.</li>
                                <li>Urine components BUN level increases during puerperium as autolysis of the involuting uterus occurs. This breakdown of excess protein in the uterine muscle cells results in a mild (+1) proteinurea for 1-2 days after childbirth.</li>
                                <li>Postpartal diuresis</li>
                                <li>Within 12 hours of birth, women begin to lose the excess tissue fluid that has accumulated during pregnancy.</li>
                                <li>One mechanism responsible for reducing these retained fluids is the profuse diaphoresis that often occurs for the first 2-3 days after childbirth.</li>
                                <li>The fluid loss through increased urinary output accounts for weight loss of approximately 2.25kg during the puerperium.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Changes in Urethra and bladder</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>If trauma to the urethra and bladder occur during the birth process, the bladder wall becomes hyperemic and edematous, often with small areas of hemorrhage.</li>
                                <li>Birth-induced trauma increased bladder capacity and the effects of conduction anesthesia combine to cause a decrease in the urge to void. In addition to pelvic soreness from the forces of labor, vaginal laceration, or an episiotomy which may reduce the voiding reflex.</li>
                                <li>Decreased voiding, along with postpartal diuresis may result in bladder distention.</li>
                                <li>Distended bladder pushes the uterus up and to the side and this prevents the uterus from firmly contracting which may cause excessive bleeding.</li>
                                <li>Bladder tone is usually restored 5-7 days after childbirth</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Changes in Gastrointestinal system</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Appetite.</strong> The mother is usually hungry shortly after giving birth.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bowel evacuation.</strong> A spontaneous bowel evacuation may be delayed until 2-3 days after childbirth. This can be explained by decreased muscle tone of the intestines during labor and the immediate puerperium, prelabor diarrhea, lack of food, or dehydration</li>
                                <li>GI tone and motility decreases in the early postpartum period, commonly causing constipation.</li>
                                <li>Normal bowel function returns approximately 2 to 3 days postpartum.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Changes in the Hepatic system</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Liver function returns to normal approximately 10 to 14 days postpartum.</li>
                                <li>Gall bladder contractility increases to normal, allowing for expulsion of small gallstones</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Changes in Cardiovascular function</h4>

                                <li><strong>Perineum:</strong> If the perineum has been damaged and repaired it may cause considerable pain, requiring analgesics, and women may prefer to sit on a rubber ring. If the perineum is painful, it is important to check the sutures and check for any signs of infection. Occasionally sutures may need to be removed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Micturition:</strong> May be difficult in first 24 hours and may occasionally require catheterisation. Around 1 in 10 women have urinary incontinence and this usually takes the form of stress incontinence. For most women this has resolved after a few weeks. Pelvic floor exercises should be taught and encouraged.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bowel problems:</strong> Constipation may be a problem for a short time and stool softeners may be useful. Haemorrhoids may be more painful after the birth than before. These can occasionally appear for the first time perinatally and these normally disappear within a few weeks.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mastitis:</strong> May be due to failure to express milk from one part of the breast; can treat by ensuring all milk is expressed and cold compresses. May be complicated by infection with Staphylococcus aureus and require treatment with flucloxacillin. Very occasionally a breast abscess develops and requires incision and drainage.</li>
                                <li><strong>Backache:</strong> This may persist after the birth and affects approx. a quarter of women - 50% of these women suffered backache before pregnancy. Pain may be considerable and last for several months.</li>
                                <li><strong>Psychological problems:</strong> Post-natal blues on days 3-5, a large proportion of women become temporarily sad and emotional; approximately 10% of women suffer from postnatal depression which may present at any time during the first year after delivery. The precise cause of this is unknown and may involve hormonal changes, reaction to excitement of childbirth and doubts by the mother about her ability to care for the child. Management consists of talking to the mother and explaining what is happening.</li>

                                <li>Breast milk is clean, while powdered milk usually gets contaminated by the water used to mix it or by being put into a dirty bottle. This may lead to diarrhea and death.</li>
                                <li>Breast milk is a balanced food for the baby, while powdered milk often results in fat or thin babies.</li>
                                <li>Breast milk is always available while powdered milk is imported and expensive. Thus, breast milk is cheaper.</li>
                                <li>Breast milk contains protective antibodies while powdered milk, if badly handled, will contain bacteria.</li>
                                <li>Breastfeeding brings close body contact between mother and baby. There is psychological satisfaction and the mother and baby develop a strong relationship, which leads to good social adjustment later in life. Tell the mother to put the baby to the breast immediately after birth.</li>
                                <li>Breast milk is at the right temperature all the time.</li>
                                <li>Breast milk contains a substance that promotes absorption of iron from the baby's gut.</li>
