                            <h3>What do you understand by the term 'literature review'?</h3>
                            
                            <p>According to by Burns and Grove (1999: 469), 'literature review is a summary of theoretical and empirical sources to generate a picture of what is known and not known about a particular problem'.</p>

                            <p>Literature review involves more than reading through articles in a journal or research paper. As Mugenda and Mugenda (1999) state, it entails the systematic identification, location and analysis of documents containing information related to the research problem being investigated. In fact, the process of literature review should start with identifying and locating the library, identifying sources and locating the sources.</p>

                                <li>In a little or new researched areas, where little depth available, the researcher would require to review any relevant material in order to develop a logical framework for the study and appropriate hypotheses for the study</li>
                                <li>Avoid the temptation to include all available materials. Excessive material does not mean great research information</li>
                                <li>At the point of saturation reencountering already reviewed literature, abandon literature review.</li>

                                <li>Concentrate on the methodology and measurements used and not only findings</li>
                                <li>Copy references correctly and constantly acknowledge sources</li>

                                <li>Be familiar with the library-before beginning the literature review</li>
                                <li>Make a list of key words or phrases to guide your search e.g. female condoms, abortions, nursing, episiotomy</li>
                                <li>Go to the source of the literature</li>
                                <li>Summarize the references on cards for easy organization of the literature</li>
                                <li>Analyze, organize and report the collected data in orderly manner. This is usually the hardest part</li>
                                <li>Make an outline of the main topics or themes in order of presentation. Decide on the number of headlines and sub headlines required depending on how detailed the review is</li>
                                <li>Analyze each reference in terms of the outline made and establish where it will be most relevant</li>
                                <li>Studies contrary to the received wisdom should not be ignored, such studies should be analyzed and possible explanation for the differences given</li>
                                <li>Literature should be organized in such a way that more general issues covered first before the researcher narrows down to that which is more specific to the research problem</li>
                                <li>Some researchers prefer to have a brief summary of the literature and its implications. However this is optional.</li>

                                    <strong>Primary Source</strong><br>
                                    This is the work written by the person who is actually involved in, or is responsible for, the generation of the idea published. It can also be information from a person who actually observed or witnessed the occurrence under investigation. The person who conducts empirical research and publishes it in a journal is usually regarded as the primary source of information. When searching for literature, it is important to rely more on primary sources as these give first hand information.

                                    <strong>Secondary Source</strong><br>
                                    A secondary source involves summaries or quoted content from a primary source. This type of work is usually a paraphrase of the primary source. Often, it does not give the correct interpretation of the primary sources. It is usually information given by someone who was not a direct observer or participant of the events described.

                            <p>When conducting a literature search, the researcher has to be aware that there are certain sources where relevant information on a research topic could be found.</p>

                                    These are very crucial documents and are available in all libraries. However, some are more recent than others. At the same time, there are more scholarly journals on the internet (web), which researchers can access.

                                    These are research projects written by Masters and PhD students. They are quite important, as they are valuable primary sources of information. They are also the original work of the authors.

                                    These are research papers presented at conferences and symposia and are a good source of primary literature.

                                    With current technological advances, researchers doing a literature search can access recent information through the internet. Many of the world's refereed journals are online and investigators can always access these, provided they have access to computers and are able to download information. Computers also have databases prepared for literature search. Examples of such databases are MEDLINE or INDEX MEDICUS as well as Pub Med, which nurses can easily access and search for information on the internet.

It is important to mention that the above sources of information are not only useful to those undertaking research but also to non-researchers aiming to update their professional knowledge and skills.</p>
