                            <p>A research proposal is a detailed statement of what you intend to do, why you want to do it and how you will go about it. Once a proposal has been accepted by an institution, or a funding agency, the writer of the proposal is obliged to follow the steps outlined in the proposal. A proposal demonstrates the researcher's ability to think clearly about the intended research or project.</p>
                            
                            <p>It should be straight forward document, uncluttered with extraneous and irrelevant information. It should also be clearly organized, simple and presented in a logical form.</p>

                            <h3>Why develop a research proposal?</h3>
                            <p>A research proposal helps the researcher:</p>

                                <li>To allow others to examine the research project and its methods.</li>
                                <li>To get clearance and authority from the government and ethics committee to carry out the research.</li>

                            <p>There are main sections of a proposal which are considered mandatory and which should be included regardless of ones discipline. These are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> includes the background to the problem, the statement of the problem, the purpose, objectives and justification of the study.</li>
                                <li><strong>Literature Review:</strong> where the researcher reviews literature related to the topic under investigation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> includes the description of the research design, population, sample and sampling techniques, data collection procedures and methods of analysis.</li>
                                <li><strong>Time Schedule:</strong> in which the researcher explains the time period needed to carry out the research.</li>

                            </ul>

                            <h3>Detailed Component Breakdown</h3>

                            <h4>1. Abstract</h4>
                            <p>A proposal abstract is one paragraph summary of what the researcher intends to do. It should be brief, precise and to the point. It gives the reader an overview of what the problem is and how the researcher intends to solve the problem through the proposed research.</p>

                            <h4>2. Introduction</h4>
                            <p>It is a very important component of a proposal. A well written introduction tells a lot about what to follow in the rest of the proposal. An introduction section should include the background of the problem, the statement of the problem, the purpose of the study, the objectives or research questions, hypotheses, rationale, or justification of the study, the limitations and underlying assumptions, the theoretical framework or conceptual model, wherever possible, and theoretical definition of terms.</p>

                            <h4>3. The Background of the Problem</h4>
                            <p>The researcher should broadly introduce the topic under investigation. This is where a global, regional and national overview of the research topic is briefly discussed. E.g. if the research topic is female education in Kenya, the research should give an overview of the status of female education globally, regionally (ie in Africa) and nationally (ie Kenyan experience). This enables the reader to have an idea of what is happening regarding the area under investigation.</p>

                            <h4>4. The Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>After describing the background of the problem the researcher should narrow down the focus and state the problem under investigation. This section is referred to as "the problem statement section". Here the researcher dates the problem under investigation e.g. high - dropout rates among female pupils in primary schools. The researcher would elaborate on the consequences of girls dropping out of school. The problem statement should be brief and precise. It should range from half a paragraph to two pages.</p>

                            <h4>5. The Purpose of the Study</h4>
                            <p>A purpose is a broad statement indicating what the researcher intends to do about the problem being investigated. A purpose statement is declarative and uses verbs to describe the intended task.</p>

                            <h4>6. Objectives of the Study</h4>
                            <p>Objectives should be stated clearly and should be testable. The difference between the purpose statement and the objectives is that the purpose statement is broad, while the objectives are derived from the purpose statement and are more specific. Objectives determine the kind of questions which will be asked and the data collection and analysis procedures to be used.</p>

                            <h4>7. Research Questions & Hypotheses</h4>
                            <p>Research questions refer to questions which a researcher would like answered by undertaking the study. A hypothesis is the researchers prediction concerning the outcome of the study. It states possible differences, relationships or caused between two variables or concepts.</p>

                            <p>One of the items you will need to include in your proposal is a schedule for your study. The activities you intend to undertake during the process of your study are summarised in a table format. The time lines, activity schedule or Ghent chart are some of the names used to refer to this kind of a table. It has the activities on the first column and on the first row is the duration of time that is required to complete the tasks.</p>

Then present the results of hypotheses tests if any. Graphs, charts and other usual presentations of the data should be included in the results and discussion section of the report if they add value to the content. It is very important for the researcher to point out whether findings are supported by other studies discussed in the literature review section.
