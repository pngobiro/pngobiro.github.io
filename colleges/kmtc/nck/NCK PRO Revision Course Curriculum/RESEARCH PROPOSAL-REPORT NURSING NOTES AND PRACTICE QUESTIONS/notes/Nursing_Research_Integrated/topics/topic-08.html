                            <h3>Review of Existing Records</h3>
                            
                            <h4>Advantages of reviewing existing data</h4>
                            <p>The review of existing records has several advantages. Data collection in any study entails heavy costs in terms of time and money. By reviewing existing data, you should be able to save time and money (Treece and Treece, 1986). For example, if you were to carry out a large scale field survey to determine the national immunisation coverage in Kenya. You would not only require an immense amount of funds but also adequate time to undertake the survey. By reviewing existing data, you the researcher, saves both time and money.</p>
                            
                            <p>Every researcher endeavours to limit respondent bias. Existing data utilises records, which are unbiased, as the person who collected the data had no knowledge of the future use to which it would be put. Additionally, existing records cover a long period of time, which is particularly useful to the researcher who can only dedicate a short time to their research.</p>

                            <p>Existing records also save the researcher from the worries and concerns of seeking the cooperation of the respondents. When you set out to collect data from a respondent for a study, you have to obtain informed consent from the respondent or guardian, where the respondent is a minor or mentally incapable of making decisions. When reviewing existing records, all that you require is the authority to access relevant records, since the data has already been collected.</p>

                            <h4>Disadvantages of existing records or data</h4>
                            <p>Pre-existing data also has its share of shortcomings. Most notably, since the researcher is not responsible for the collection and recording of the data, limiting biases and even ascertaining the authenticity of the data would be difficult. This can often result in doubts about the validity of the data.</p>

                            <h3>Structured Interview Schedule</h3>
                            <p>A structured interview schedule is a formal and written document where questions are asked orally in either face-to-face or telephone interviews.</p>
                            
                            <p>The responses are then recorded by the researcher (Bogdan and Biklen, 1992; Oppenheim, 1993). The main advantage of a highly structured questionnaire is that it provides comparability of responses and facilitates analysis (Polit and Hungler, 1993). Highly structured instruments are quite common in quantitative research methods where the application of statistical tests is used to predict the reliability and validity of the data.</p>
                            
                            <p>The interview schedule is one of the structured instruments used by researchers for collecting data. It is commonly used in telephone interviews but is also applicable to a special category of respondents, such as children, the elderly and the illiterate who may not be able to read and write (Oppenheim, 1993). The instrument is expected to have a high response rate, since the researcher administers it personally. An interview schedule also has the advantage of capturing the respondent's own words.</p>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--warning">
                                <div class="callout-header">
                                    <span class="callout-icon">⚠️</span>

                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>Despite the aforementioned advantages, the instrument has several limitations that the researcher should be aware of. The instrument demands a much longer time to complete than other instruments, such as questionnaires. In addition, due to the presence of the researcher, respondents may withhold certain vital information or even change information to please the researcher.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <h3>Focus Group Discussions</h3>
                            <p>According to Polit and Hungler, (1993:202) 'Focus group interviews are interviews with groups of 5-15 people whose opinions and experiences are solicited simultaneously. The advantage of a focus group discussion is that it is efficient and can generate dialogue. Focus group discussions have the ability to generate information from the group members. The composition of the group is usually limited to those with similar characteristics, such as socio economic status, so that the members feel free in contributing to the issue at hand. The instrument allows the members to share their views, experiences and opinions. The interpersonal interactions create a free and enjoyable environment.</p>
                            
                            <p>Krueger (1994:6) notes that 'the discussion is comfortable and often enjoyable for the participants as they share their ideas and perceptions'. Group members influence each other by responding to the ideas and comments in the discussion.</p>
                            
                            <p>Several advantages accrue from such an instrument. The instrument allows a large number of respondents to be interviewed at one go, which saves time and money. However, one major shortcoming is that the method, because of the number of respondents involved, calls for diligence and skill in ensuring that the process runs smoothly and yields the desired information.</p>
                            
                            <p>Novice researchers often find this very difficult as the researcher is expected to exercise great care in ensuring that the discussion remains within context while at the same time limiting disruption of the discussion process.</p>

                            <h3>In-depth Interviews</h3>
                            <p>The researcher can also utilise face-to-face in-depth interviews using semi-structured questionnaires for key informants. Key informant interviews are defined as interviews with people who have special positions in the community and whose opinions and experiences are seen as representative of a whole group. They often see the problems of a group rather than of an individual, making them a very useful group of people to interview.</p>
                            
                            <p>Semi-structured questionnaires possess a flexibility that allows the researcher to gather in depth information. The instrument enables the participants to give responses in a narrative form and is quite useful in qualitative research (Polit and Hungler, 1993). The respondent takes the lead and determines the flow of the conversation, which is of great importance when new areas are to be investigated (Polit and Hungler, 1993). Key informant interviews provide valuable and independent information about the research population within a short span of time and save time and money. However, Polit and Hungler (1993) suggest that the main weakness of the instrument is that it requires the researcher to be very articulate.</p>

                            <h3>Non Participatory Structured Observation</h3>
                            <p>Another instrument that can be used for data collection is non participatory, semi-structured observation. Non participatory observation is observing a given situation from the outside. The observer declares their intention to observe and goes ahead to watch the activities being carried out without asking questions or interfering in any way. As the activities to be observed progress, the observer remains in the background, keenly observing and noting down events without comment.</p>
                            
                            <p>Polit and Hungler (1993: 220), with reference to the relevance of the observational method as a tool for generating data, state that: 'Observational methods have an intrinsic appeal with respect to their ability to capture a record of behaviours and events.'</p>
                            
                            <p>Furthermore, there is virtually no other data collection method that can provide the depth and variety of information as observation. With this approach, the observers are used as measuring instruments and provide a uniquely sensitive and intelligent tool.</p>

                            <p>Once you have generated the data, it is important to follow a structured method of data processing and entry. The following steps, adapted from Floyd and Fowler (1993:123), provide a useful guideline:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>Decide on a format, that is, the way the data will be organised in a file.</li>
                                <li>Design the code, that is, identify the rules by which respondent's answers will be assigned values that can be processed by a computer.</li>
                                <li>Code the data. This refers to the process of turning responses into standard categories.</li>
                                <li>Input data into the computer if you are going to use analytic software.</li>
                                <li>Completeness and consistency before analysis.</li>

                            <p>Data collection is one of the major steps of the research process. It is the data collection process that will determine the findings of the entire research study. It, therefore, calls for more attention and consideration. There are various data collection methods. However, the approach will depend on the type of study you are undertaking, the study objectives, the design, and above all, the available resources for the study in the form of money, time and the technical skills of the research team.</p>
                            
                            <p>Burns and Grove (1999: 43) define data collection as 'the precise, systematic gathering of information relevant to the research purpose or the specific objectives, questions or hypotheses of a study'.</p>

                            <h3>Data Collection Plan</h3>
                            <p>Before you begin the data collection process, you need to draw up a data collection plan. A data collection can be developed using the following steps:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>List the tasks that have to be carried out and the people responsible for those tasks.</li>
                                <li>Make a rough estimate of the time needed for different parts of the study.</li>
                                <li>Identify the most appropriate period in which to carry out the research.</li>
                                <li>Schedule the different activities that have to be carried out each week in a work plan.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>A plan for data collection should be developed in order to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Have a clear overview of what tasks have to be carried out, who should perform them and the duration of these tasks.</li>
                                <li>Organise both human and material resources for data collection in the most efficient way and minimise errors and delays that may result from lack of planning.</li>
                                <li>Identify problems, for example, limited manpower, that will require modifications to the proposal. Such modification might include adjustment of the sample size or extension of the data collection period.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>There are three main stages in the data collection process:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>Stage One - Permission to Proceed</li>
                                <li>Stage Two - Data Collection</li>
                                <li>Stage Three - Data Handling</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Stage One: Permission to Proceed</h3>
                            <p>Consent must be obtained from the relevant authorities, individuals, and the community in which the project is to be carried out. This may involve organising meetings at national, provincial, district or village level. For clinical studies, this may involve obtaining written informed consent.</p>
                            <p>The principal investigator is likely to be the one responsible for obtaining permission to proceed at the various levels. The health research unit in the Ministry of Health or the institution organising the research may assist in obtaining permission from the national level. In many countries, research proposals have to be screened for scientific and ethical integrity by national research control centres.</p>

                            <h3>Stage Two: Data Collection</h3>
                            <p>When collecting data, you have to consider the logistics. This entails identifying who will collect what, when and with what resources and quality control.</p>

                            <h4>Who will collect what data?</h4>
                            <p>When allocating tasks for data collection, it is recommended that you first list the tasks. You can then identify who could best implement each of the tasks. If it is clear beforehand that your research team will not be able to carry out the entire study by itself, you may look for research assistants to assist in relatively simple but time consuming tasks.</p>

                            </div>

                            <h4>How long does it take to collect the data for each component of the study?</h4>
                            <p>In order to answer this question, you should consider the following points:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The time required to reach the study area(s).</li>
                                <li>The time required to 'walk around', and build rapport in the community.</li>
                                <li>The time required to locate the study units (persons, groups, and records). If you have to search for specific informants, for example, users or defaulters of a specific service, it might take more time to locate informants than to interview them.</li>
                                <li>The number of visits required per study unit. For some studies, it may be necessary to visit informants a number of times, for instance, if the information needed is sensitive and can only be collected after informants are comfortable with the researcher.</li>
                                <li>The time it takes to verify the quality of data collected in order to establish its validity.</li>
                                <li>The time required for taking field notes on the research process.</li>
                                <li>The time required for preliminary analysis of the data.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The data collection plan can be drawn up as follows:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Calculate the number of interviews that can be carried out each day, for example, four per team member.</li>
                                <li>Calculate the number of days needed to carry out the interviews. For example, if you need to do 200 interviews, your research team of five people can do <span class="math-inline">\(5 \times 4 = 20\)</span> interviews per day. You will therefore need 10 (200 ÷ 20) days for the interviews.</li>
                                <li>Calculate the time needed for the other methods used in the study, for instance, five days for familiarisation and rapport building, five days for focus group discussions, three days for participant observation and so on.</li>
                                <li>Determine how much time the research team can devote to the fieldwork.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>If the time required according to calculation is more than the time available, it may be necessary to recruit assistants for certain components of the study, for example for conducting interviews.</p>

                            <p>Recruiting research assistants for data collection may ease the task of the research team, but it must be remembered that the training and supervision of research assistants requires time. Time decisions have to be carefully determined on the basis of an analysis of the pros and cons of the study and its team members. If none of the team has previous research experience, they might prefer a study that they can carry out themselves without, or with only minimum, assistance.</p>
                            
                            <p>If research assistants are required, consider to what extent local health workers can be used. They often have the advantage of being acquainted with the local situations. However, they should never be involved in conducting interviews to evaluate the performance of their own health facility or in studies on people's self care practices in their own catchment areas. Local staff from related services, for example, teachers, community development officers or students could also help with data collection. Occasionally, members or community members can collect certain parts of the village health data.</p>

                            <p>It is advisable to slightly overestimate the period needed for data collection to allow for unforeseen delays. In fact, it is often difficult to implement the fieldwork strictly according to plan, as you may encounter unforeseen problems, for example, adverse weather conditions or transport breakdown. Your philosophy of fieldwork planning should be flexible.</p>

                            <h4>In what sequence should data be collected?</h4>
                            <p>Generally, it is advisable to start with available data. This is essential if the sample of respondents is to be selected from records. Another rule of thumb is that qualitative research techniques, for example, focus group discussions, which are devised to focus the content of questionnaires, should be carried out before the finalisation of the questionnaire. If the focus group discussions are to provide feedback on issues raised in larger surveys, however, they should be conducted after preliminary analysis of the questionnaire.</p>
                            <p>To use time and transport efficiently, data that is to be collected from different sources in one locality should be collected at the same time, for example, interviews with staff in a health centre, observation of the equipment in the centre, and interviews with mothers living nearby should be scheduled together.</p>

                            <h4>When should the data be collected?</h4>
                            <p>The type of data to be collected and the demands of the project will determine the actual period of data collection. The following should be considered:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The availability of research team members and research assistants.</li>
                                <li>The appropriate season(s) to conduct the fieldwork (if the problem is season related or if data collection will be difficult in certain periods).</li>
                                <li>The accessibility and availability of the sample population.</li>
                                <li>Public holidays and vacation periods.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>It is important that the data collected is of good quality, that is, reliable and valid. Otherwise, you may come out with false or misleading conclusions. Therefore, the possible sources of data distortion (bias) should be addressed. Biases you should try to prevent include deviations from the sampling procedures set out in the proposal, variability and bias in observations or measurements made because:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The subject being studied changes their behaviour as a consequence of the research. For example, a subject may act more positively while being observed.</li>
                                <li>The researcher may use non-standard measuring scales, imprecise or no guidelines for interviewing.</li>
                                <li>Researchers themselves vary in what they observe or measure, that is, observer variability. For example, researchers may be selective in their observations, that is, observer bias and measure, question, or note down answers with varying accuracy or follow different interview approaches, with one researcher being more open, friendly and probing than the other.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>As a researcher you should avoid variations in both the measurement criteria and the criteria for categorising answers especially in the course of conducting research. Any changes should have been dealt with prior to conducting the research.</p>

                            <p>There are a number of measures to be taken to prevent or partly correct such distortions, but remember prevention is better than cure. Cure implies surgery. You may have to cut down parts of your data or at best, devise crutches.</p>
                            
                            <p>There are several ways of ensuring data quality. Prepare a fieldwork manual for the research team as a whole. The manual should include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Guidelines on sampling procedures and what to do if respondents are not available or refuse to cooperate.</li>
                                <li>A clear explanation of the purpose and procedures of the study. This should be used as an introduction before each interview.</li>
                                <li>Instruction sheets on how to ask certain questions and how to record the answers.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Ensure that you select your research assistants, if required, with care. Choose assistants who are of the same educational level, familiar with the topic and the local conditions, but are not the subject of study themselves and are not biased concerning the topic.</p>

                            <p>You should train research assistants carefully in all topics covered in the fieldwork manual as well as in interview techniques. Make sure all members of the research team master techniques such as:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Asking questions in a neutral manner.</li>
                                <li>Not showing, by words or expressions, what answers one expects to hear.</li>
                                <li>Not showing agreement, disagreement or surprise.</li>
                                <li>Recording answers precisely as they are provided, without sifting through them or interpreting them.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>You should also pre-test research instruments and research procedures with the whole research team, including research assistants. Take care that research assistants are not placed under too much stress, for example, too many interviews a day.</p>
                            
                            <p>Arrange for ongoing supervision of research assistants. If you are carrying out a substantially large survey, special supervisors may have to be appointed with supervisory guidelines.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is also important to devise methods to ensure that the data collected by all members of the research team is of quality. You can do this by:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Having interviewers check whether the questionnaire is filled in completely before finishing each interview.</li>
                                <li>Asking the supervisors to check at the end of each day during the data collection period whether the questionnaires are filled in completely and whether the recorded information makes sense.</li>
                                <li>Having the researchers review the data during the data analysis stage to check whether data is complete and consistent.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Training of Interviewers</h4>
                            <p>During the fieldwork, interviews or research assistants may work independently or with one of the researchers. If research assistants are to go out independently, they may have to carry out the following tasks:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Do sampling in the field, for example, sampling households.</li>
                                <li>Give clear introductions to the interviewee concerning the purpose and procedures of the interview.</li>
                                <li>Perform the interview. It is important to give interviewers a standard questionnaire to administer. However, it is not wise to assign difficult tasks, like Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), to research assistants.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>It is, therefore, imperative that you properly train interviewers so that they can carry out their tasks accurately and correctly, according to the procedures you have developed. They should never be left to develop their own procedures as this could potentially lead to bias. The training of interviewers may take 2-3 days. The first day should be devoted to theory, followed by one or two days of practical training, depending on the local circumstances and the nature of the study.</p>

                            <h4>Theoretical Training</h4>
                            <p>Research assistants or interviewers must be thoroughly familiar with the research objectives and the methodology. They should, therefore, be provided with a copy of the research protocol. You, as the principle researcher, should discuss important sections of the protocol with them.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Statement of the problem</li>
                                <li>Objectives</li>
                                <li>Data collection tools to be used</li>
                                <li>Sampling procedure</li>
                                <li>Plan for data collection</li>
                                <li>Plan for data analysis</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Practical Training</h4>
                            <p>Practical training in interviewing is very important. This may be provided in two stages. First, a role play can be performed during which one of the trainees assumes the role of an interviewer and the other plays the interviewee. Second, a field test should be conducted which will serve two purposes: the training of interviewers and as a test of the data collection tools.</p>

                            <h4>Supervision of Interviewers</h4>
                            <p>If interviewers are used, the responsibility for the research remains with the principle researcher. To guarantee the quality of the data collected:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>It is important to supervise the performance of the interviewers, especially at the beginning of the data collection period.</li>
                                <li>If they are to go out into the field independently, plans should be made to visit them on different occasions.</li>
                                <li>As a further quality check, it is important that each questionnaire carries the name or initials of the interviewer, so that it is possible to ask for clarification if certain information is not clear.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Once the data has been collected, a clear procedure should be developed for handling and storing it. The following should act as guidelines:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Check that the data gathered is complete and accurate.</li>
                                <li>At some stage questionnaires will have to be numbered. Decide if this should be done at the time of the interview or when the questionnaires are stored.</li>
                                <li>Identify the person responsible for storing data and the place where it will be stored.</li>
                                <li>Decide how data should be stored. Record forms should be kept in the sequence in which they have been numbered.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Data Entry</h3>
                            <p>There are several factors you need to consider when entering your data. First, you will need to decide on a format, that is, the way you will organise the data in a file. Next, you will need to design a code, that is, the rules by which the respondents' answers will be assigned values that can be processed by the computer.</p>
                            
                            <p>After this you then do the actual coding, that is, turn the responses into the standard categories you developed in your coding system. Data entry is the next step, which is keying the data into the computer so that you can process it. Finally, data cleaning is the final check you make on the data file for accuracy, completeness, and consistency prior to the onset of analysis.</p>

                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li>How have you planned to obtain informed consent from your informants?</li>
                                        <li>Are there any categories of informants that need special consideration because of their vulnerable status, for example, children, sick persons, and mentally disabled individuals?</li>
                                        <li>Are certain parts of the research focussed on sensitive issues?</li>
                                        <li>How will you handle problems that may arise?</li>
                                        <li>Do certain parts of your research require extra attention to assure confidentiality?</li>
                                        <li>How will you handle this issue?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Once you have answered all these questions you are well on your way to ensuring that high ethical standards are maintained throughout the course of your research project.</p>
