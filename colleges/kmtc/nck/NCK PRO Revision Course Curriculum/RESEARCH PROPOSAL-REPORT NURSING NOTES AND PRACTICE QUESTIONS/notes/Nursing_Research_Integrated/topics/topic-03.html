                                        <li>It is also unethical to perform bad trials that give misleading results and thereby encourage others not to use a treatment that is beneficial or to use a treatment that is not beneficial, or may indeed have harmful effects.</li>

                            <p>Two important areas of ethical consideration are rights of human subjects and freedom from harm.</p>

                            <h3>Definitions</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Mugenda and Mugenda (2003:190)</strong> describe ethics 'as that branch of philosophy which deals with one's conduct and serves as a guide to one's behaviour'. It is important to note that most professions, including nursing, have a code of conduct to which all members of the profession have to adhere.</li>
                                <li><strong>Plooy (2003:118)</strong> describes ethics in research as 'that which is morally justifiable'. Research ethics fundamentally consists of collecting, analysing and interpreting data in a way that respects the rights of your participants and respondents.</li>

                                Basic Ethical Principles
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>According to Brink (1996: 39), there are three basic ethical principles that guide researchers including nurse researchers. These are:</p>

                            <h3>1. Principle of Respect for Persons</h3>
                            <p>This principle involves two main convictions:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Individuals are autonomous</strong>, that is, they have the right to self-determination and this right should be respected. This means the research respondents have the right to:
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li>a) Accept or decline to participate in the study without punishment or prejudice</li>
                                        <li>b) Withdraw from the study at any stage</li>
                                        <li>c) Withhold information</li>
                                        <li>d) Seek clarification concerning the purpose of the study</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Individuals with diminished autonomy require protection.</strong> This group includes children, the mentally impaired, unconscious patients and institutionalised persons. For this group of persons, you will need to seek the consent of their legal guardian.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>2. Principle of Justice</h3>
                            <p>This includes the subjects' right to fair selection and treatment and their right to privacy:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Right to Privacy</strong><br>
                                    This is the freedom of an individual to determine the time, extent and the circumstances under which private information will be shared with or withheld from others. The privacy of the subject is considered to be protected if the subject is informed and consents to participate in a study and voluntarily shares private information with a researcher. An invasion of privacy occurs when private information is shared without the respondent's knowledge or against their will.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Right to Anonymity and Confidentiality</strong><br>
                                    The research respondents have the right to anonymity and the right to assume that the data collected shall be kept confidential. Complete anonymity exists when the respondents' identity is not revealed and the information collected is not linked to the respondent. Confidentiality refers to the researcher's responsibility to protect all data gathered within the scope of the project from being divulged or made available to any other person, which means the research data should never be shared with outsiders. A breach of confidentiality can occur when a researcher allows an unauthorised person(s) to gain access to the raw data of a study or when the researcher accidentally reveals the identity of the research respondents.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>3. Principle of Beneficence</h3>
                            <p>This principle involves an effort to secure the well being of persons. It is the right to protect respondents from discomfort and harm. This principle states that one should do what is good and above all should do no harm. Discomfort and harm can be physical, emotional, spiritual, economic, social or legal.</p>

                            <p>Informed consent is the process of providing an individual with sufficient understandable information regarding his or her participation in a research project. It includes providing potential participants with information about their rights and responsibilities within the project and documenting the nature of the agreement.</p>
                            
                            <p>All consent forms need to assure potential participants of their right to withdraw from a research study at any time. Informed consent is the researchers conscious and deliberate attempt to clearly and fully provide the potential participant with information about the study.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is a fundamental responsibility of the investigator in human research to ensure research participants understand the nature of the project and the implications of participation and the individual is able to decide freely whether to participate in a project, without fear of reprisal. When the researcher fails to adequately inform potential research participants about full nature of the research, thereby preventing them from making an informed decision on their participation is called <strong>deception</strong>.</p>

                            <h4>The Major Content of an Informed Consent</h4>
                            <p>Patients undergoing any operation are required to give informed consent. You may need to obtain informed consent from research respondents who take part in your research project. According Brink (1996:42), informed consent revolves around the following three major elements:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The type of information you need to obtain from the research subjects.</li>
                                <li>The degree of understanding required of the subject in order to give consent.</li>
                                <li>The fact that the subject has a free choice in giving consent.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Mugenda and Mugenda (2003:192) state that informed consent should be based on the following factors:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>The purpose of the research study</li>
                                <li>Foreseen risks</li>
                                <li>A guarantee of anonymity and confidentiality</li>

                            <h3>Regulatory Bodies</h3>
                            <p>The researcher may need to take permission from regulatory bodies for conducting research investigations, mainly when subjects are human beings. These are regulatory bodies in most of the countries which grant permission after considering ethical issues of study. National council for science and technology deals with approval and authorization of research being done in Kenya.</p>
                            
                            <p>Prior to commencing the study, you as the researcher should make a formal application to the government of Kenya for permission to conduct the research. This should include two or more copies of the research proposal, accompanied by a recommendation letter from the supervisor(s) as required by the Kenyan authorities. Similarly, if your institution is authorised to conduct research, there may be a 'Research and Ethics Committee'. Such a committee is usually vested with the authority of granting research permits, which you could use.</p>
                            
                            <p>Once the authority to conduct the study in the form of a 'Research Clearance Permit' has been granted, the researcher then reports to the 'District Commissioner (DC) of the area'. The DC will then instruct you to report to the District Officer (DO) of your research area. The DO may further require you to report to the area local chief and assistant chiefs. When the above administrative requirement is completed, the researcher then approaches the village leader to grant further access to the respective villagers.</p>

                            <h3>Misuse of Privileges</h3>
                            <p>Researchers have power over their subjects to their training, legal authority to undertake research, and their perceived ability to provide help. Subjects therefore participate in research based on this trust. It is therefore unethical for researchers to abuse this trust by using their powers negatively e.g.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Using obtained data to stigmatize or indict the same subjects</li>
                                <li>Doing research in pretext of providing help</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Financial Issues and Sponsored Research</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>A sponsor may demand compromise on quality to save on costs and time</li>
                                <li>Some sponsors may demand the findings to be reported in a distorted manner for their own selfish reasons</li>
                                <li>Some researchers may divert research funds for their own use</li>
                                <li>All these are unacceptable. A researcher should maintain his/her integrity</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Dissemination of Findings</h3>
                            <p>It is unethical to conceal research findings for some reasons. Even if results are contrary or against the sponsor’s wishes or expectations, they should be disseminated and not concealed.</p>

                            <h3>Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
                            <p>Joint researchers should not be published as personal by one individual.</p>

                            <h3>Plagiarism and Fraud</h3>
