                            <p>Every researcher has to identify an appropriate research design for use in the study. However, the selection or identification of a specific study design will depend on several factors. These, according to Harden et al (1995), include the following:</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>Available information (state of knowledge) about the problem.</li>
                                <li>The nature of the problem and its environment.</li>
                                <li>The availability of resources for the study.</li>
                                <li>The skills and creativity of the researchers.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>It is, therefore, the responsibility of the researcher to make the appropriate research design choice, paying particular attention to its suitability to your research and the available budget for the study.</p>

                            <p>There are several types of common research designs that you may come across.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <p>This is one of the most complex and important research designs. It is also commonly used in clinical settings because of its accuracy and reliability. Experimental research design could be subdivided into true experimental and quasi-experimental.</p>
                            
                            <p>Experimental research designs are concerned with testing hypotheses and establishing causality. This design tests the hypothesis of relationships, that is, attempts to make predictions of future outcomes based on a causal model implementing strategies to control the predicted outcome. If 'X' occurs 'Y' follows and so on.</p>
                            
                            <p>Experimental designs try to establish causal links between several factors, for example the effectiveness of a particular drug such as paracetamol in relieving moderate pain.</p>
                            
                            <p>In an experimental research design, the researcher controls or manipulates the action of the independent or causal variable(s) and observes and measures the action or outcome on the dependant variable. This is the major difference between experimental and non-experimental designs where no control or manipulation is required.</p>
                            
                            <p>Experimental nursing research is the most logically applicable to clinical nursing practice (Brink, 1996).</p>

                            <h3>Characteristics of an experimental research design</h3>
                            <p>An experimental design has certain important characteristics, which you as a research student should be aware of.</p>
                            
                            <div class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <div class="list-item">
                                    <strong>Manipulation</strong><br>
                                    This is where the researcher controls the independent variable, which can be an event, intervention or treatment that is expected to have some effect on the dependant variable.
                                </div>
                                <div class="list-item">
                                    <strong>Control</strong><br>
                                    The researcher exercises control over the experimental situation by eliminating the actions of other possible variables beyond the independent variable. This is achieved through manipulating, randomising and careful preparations of experimental protocols and the use of control groups.
                                </div>
                                <div class="list-item">
                                    <strong>Randomising</strong><br>
                                    This is where every subject is given an equal chance to participate in the study. The researcher assigns the subjects to the experimental or control groups on a random basis. To achieve randomisation, you have to first identify the respondents and then place them into groups using random tables, coin tossing or other techniques.

                            <h3>Sub-divisions of Experimental Design</h3>

                            <h4>1. True or Classical</h4>
                            <p>This is where the researcher has a great deal of control over the research situation. Examples include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>One group pre-test-post-test design.</strong> i.e first measure the dependent variable give experimental treatment or independent variable then do a post test 0x0</li>
                                <li><strong>Pre-test post test control group.</strong> this is where there are two groups one experimental (given Rx) and another control group (no Rx given). A pre-test is done to both groups, treatment is given only to experiment group and then a post test to both groups</li>
                                <li><strong>One short case study.</strong> This is where there is only the experimental group which is given treatment and then a post-test is done to test the effect of the treatment</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>2. Quasi-experimental design</h4>
                            <p>This is where full experimental control is not possible randomization not possible. These involve implementing a specific treatment and later examining the effects of this treatment. Is a type of intervention study.</p>
                            
                            <p>In a quasi-experimental design, some of the above rules are relaxed. For example, there might be no need for having a control group or at times randomisation may not be included. The quasi-experimental design enables the search for knowledge and examination of causality in situations where complete control is not possible.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Non-equivalent control group design:</strong><br>
                                    This is similar to pre-test-post test control group design except that there is no random assignment of subject to the experimental and comparison group.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Time-series design:</strong><br>
                                    In this study, the researcher periodically observes or measures the subjects. The experimental is administered between two of the observations e.g. researcher assesses the level of pain in patients with low back pain weekly and then gives treatment after the third week. He then continues weekly assessment for another 3 weeks to see the effect of the treatment.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
                            
                            <h4>Advantages</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Most powerful design for testing the hypothesis of cause-effect relationships between variables.</li>
                                <li>It is practical, feasible and can be generalised to some extent. This type of design introduces some control over certain extraneous variables.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>In most real situations, it is difficult to conduct a true experimental design, since some of the variables cannot be manipulated or controlled.</li>
                                <li>At times it becomes quite difficult to get randomised research subjects or even a control group. This is to some extent why nurse researchers are not very interested in experimental research designs.</li>
                                <li>As a result of the need for randomisation, control and manipulation with the aim of establishing cause-effect relationships, the design becomes very expensive, both in terms of time and money.</li>

                            <p>The purpose of the study is usually to identify general trends or patterns in the collected data, for example, 'nurses attitudes towards smoking'. A survey is designed to obtain information from the population regarding the prevalence, distribution, and interrelations of variables within those populations, for example, using a census, political opinion polls, immunisation sample surveys and so on.</p>

                            <p>Survey studies primarily yield quantitative data. They are mainly cross sectional in design. They mainly deal with (investigate) what people do, for example, how or what they eat, how they meet their health needs, what kind of family planning behaviour they engage in and so on.</p>

                            <p>Survey data is collected in number of ways.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Questionnaires, which are mainly self-administered.</li>
                                <li>Telephone interviews, which involves phoning people and seeking their opinions.</li>
                                <li>Personal interviews, also known as face-to-face interviews, where the interviewers meet with the interviewee to seek certain information.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Information generated by the survey method is often superficial as the survey rarely probes deeply. The survey design is better suited for extensive rather than intensive analysis of a situation. It is usually descriptive and specific based on the situation that needs intervention, for planning purposes, monitoring and evaluation of services.</p>

                            <p>An example of a survey is the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) carried out every five years.</p>

                            <p>In a survey the researcher designs the phenomenon and study but does not manipulate any variables nor do they make any efforts to determine the relationships between variables.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Comparative Descriptive Survey</h4>
                            <p>Designed to be a comparison between two or more groups to see how they differ on some variables.</p>

                            <h4>Correlation Survey</h4>
                            <p>The researcher attempts to determine and describe what relationship exists between variables. For example, the study of the relationship between maternal 'age' and reports of nausea would then be determined statistically through the use of a statistical test known as the correlation coefficient (Brink 1996: 110). One independent variable is correlated with one or more dependent variables. Then statistical methods are applied to describe if the variables relate at all and what kind of relationship they have, that is, positive correlation or, negative correlation.</p>

                            <p>According to Harden et al (1999), a descriptive study is the systematic collection and presentation of data to give clear picture of a particular situation. Cormack (1982:178) defines descriptive research as research, which involves the systematic collection of information and aims to discover and describe new facts about a situation, people, activities, or events.</p>

                            <p>The descriptive research design is grouped as a non-experimental research design. Its main purposes include observing, describing and documenting all aspects of a situation as it naturally occurs. At times, descriptive designs are used as a starting point for hypothesis generation or theory testing. The descriptive study attempts to obtain complete and accurate information about a phenomenon through observation, description and classification'.</p>

                            <p>Examples of questions in this line of study include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>How prevalent is the measles disease in this district?</li>
                                <li>What are the characteristics of the district's population?</li>
                                <li>When are measles outbreaks experienced?</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>In the exploratory descriptive design, the main purpose is to explore the dimensions of a phenomenon (problem) as well as the major characteristics or facts that influence the phenomenon. Questions to be asked include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>What is the nature of the problem?</li>
                                <li>What factors are related to the problem?</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>In descriptive design, no manipulation of variables is involved as opposed to experimental design. Similarly, no dependent or independent variables are used within a descriptive study design because no attempt is made to establish causality.</p>

                                    In the explorative descriptive design, the researcher explores a particular problem to discover what is there and if it could be solved. The study focuses on new events, evidence, or practices.

                                    The simple design is mainly a follow up of an exploratory design. The variable of interest has already been identified. This design is used when the researcher intends to examine only a single problem.

                                    The comparative descriptive design is mainly used when the researcher intends to examine and describe particular variables in two or more groups. The concept here is to compare the groups and how they differ or how similar they are in relation to the variable of interest.

                                    Time dimensional designs are used in epidemiological studies and are further subdivided into longitudinal that is when it examines changes in a group for a long period and it is cross-sectional where the data is collected at one point in time.

                            <p>The retrospective study design is also known as 'export facts'. It is a study design aimed at a looking back in order to link the present with the past or what happened in the past. People having an outcome of interest, for example skin disease, are interviewed to establish whether or not they have had contact with an exposure of interest in the past, for example spraying of agrochemicals.</p>

                            <h4>Prospective Study Design</h4>
                            <p>The prospective study design is similar to the longitudinal study as it starts from the present and ends by looking into the future. It is further divided into two categories: descriptive and explanatory. The subjects for the study are recruited based on presence or absence of an exposure of interest (workers in x-ray department) and followed up over many years to establish if they will develop outcomes of interest, for example cancer of the skin or reproductive health complications.</p>

A case study is 'an in depth study of one individual, a group of individuals or an institution' (Brink 1996:116). It is a detailed account of a particular experience event or situation. It is meant to provide a description of people's thoughts, feelings and perceptions. A case study research design does not aim at providing a causal relationship.

                            <p>An example of a case study that a nurse researcher would like to investigate could be a mother with a bad obstetric history to determine their knowledge, feelings and perceptions of their condition (situation), or a case study on why in a certain health centres mothers are not coming in for their antenatal services. Such studies could provide significant insight into why things happen as they do.</p>
