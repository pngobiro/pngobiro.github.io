                            <p>It is important to appreciate that the various steps of the research process are not delineated from each other as such, but indeed cyclical in nature, whereby one step leads to the other for its effectiveness. Likewise, it is important to note that researchers have greatly differed in their estimate of the number of steps the research process should consist of. Most researchers have given steps ranging in number from between ten to sixteen.</p>
                            
                            <p>Despite the large difference in the number of steps that should constitute the research process, the majority of researchers do agree on four general phases of the research process. Brink (1996:56) listed the following four phases as being key to the research process:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The conceptual phase, also called the thinking or planning phase.</li>
                                <li>The empirical phase, also called the doing phase.</li>
                                <li>The interpretive phase, or the phase where the researcher looks at the meaning of it all.</li>
                                <li>The communication phase or the phase of writing and disseminating the research report.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>You will now further sub-divide these phases into ten steps for the purpose of your study and look at each step in detail.</p>

                            <p>Having identified some of the characteristics of good nursing research, you need also to learn how to identify a researchable topic. For a researcher to identify a good research topic they will require first to list down some of the topics or problems that need to be investigated. It is important to put this in order of priority and then analyse each topic or problem individually.</p>
                            
                            <p>A research problem is an issue that requires a solution. It could, for instance, involve looking at why certain things are done the way they are done and not the other way round. In actual fact, a research problem endeavours to answer or address a specific problem or situation. In nursing research the issue that needs to be addressed should be one related to the nursing profession.</p>

                            <p>You will note that your research starts with the identification of a research problem, which you feel is serious and important enough for you to spend your time researching. This research problem then becomes your research topic and will become the title of your research paper.</p>

                            <h3>What is a Researchable problem?</h3>
                            <p>It should be an important problem i.e.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Lead to findings that have wide spread implication to a particular area</li>
                                <li>Challenge some commonly held altruism</li>
                                <li>Reviews the inadequacies of existing laws, policies, theories, views e.t.c.</li>
                                <li>Cover a reasonable scope i.e. not too narrow or general</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Certain factors determine the scope of a research study</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>The time available to carry it out</li>
                                <li>The money available to carry out-type print and bind reports</li>
                                <li>The availability of equipments needed to carry out the research</li>
                                <li>The availability of subjects or units of study</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Ways of identifying a specific research problem</h3>
                            <p>A research problem can be identified by several ways from the broad area:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Existing Literature</strong><br>
                                    By doing systematic reading of broad area of interest. This gives a good background of the basic information and insight into various issues that could be studied.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Existing Theories</strong><br>
                                    Existing theories in an area contain generalization and hypotheses and principles which can be scientifically tested. This leads to validation or otherwise invalidate of an existing generalization or principles.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Discussion with Experts</strong><br>
                                    Discussion with subject authorities in seminars, class, workshop, conferences e.t.c. are a source of current problems that could be researched include experienced researchers.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Replication</strong><br>
                                    This involves carrying out a research that has been done previously. The problem and methods are identical to the previous study.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Previous Research Studies</strong><br>
                                    These usually indicate areas of further research or knowledge gaps in previous studies. This helps in building up knowledge from previous researchers.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Media</strong><br>
                                    Frequently reported issues in the media can form the basis of research problem such issues are usually discussed in a public and hence important to majority. Examples: Prostitutions-discordant couples, HIV/AIDS orphans, both injuries related to fuel tanker accidents, husband battering, drug peddling and abuse e.t.c.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Personal Experiences</strong><br>
                                    First hand observations and reflection experiences could be sources of research problems ie. Experiences usually lead and vivid images, a hunch or an intuition on the part of a serious researcher e.g. Post surgical infections, maternal death, and neonatal death.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Criteria for identifying a research topic</h3>
                            <p>There are certain characteristics or criteria that a good research topic in nursing should possess to ensure that the study is relevant not only to the nursing practice but also to the entire health care delivery system.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Improve nursing services by contributing to more knowledge and better skills.</li>
                                <li>Enhance existing knowledge by filling in gaps that exist.</li>
                                <li>Encourage more research on already existing nursing theories.</li>
                                <li>Address current concerns or priority areas in nursing.</li>
                                <li>Pay more attention to ethical issues (this will be discussed in detail later).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In addition to this, the researcher undertaking the study should have the necessary knowledge and skills. They should also be accorded the necessary resources such as money, manpower, materials and access to the research subjects.</p>

                            <h3>Stating the Problem</h3>
                            <p>The researcher usually starts with a brief introductory section of the general study area. Then the researcher narrows down to the specific area of study.</p>

                            <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                            <p>Once the researcher has formulated appropriate objectives, the next move is to formulate relevant research question(s). It is important to understand that without a clearly and well-defined research question, it will be difficult to complete the research process. Sometimes inexperienced researchers find it difficult to formulate questions. Questions can be derived from:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Your working experience (professional experience).</li>
                                <li>Literature search you are undertaking.</li>
                                <li>Theoretical frameworks on nursing.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>It is important to ensure that the research questions are 'good research questions'. One way of doing this is to use the acronym 'FINER'.</p>

                            <div class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <div class="list-item"><strong>F - Feasible</strong>, allowing one to appreciate the practical limitations.</div>
                                <div class="list-item"><strong>I - Interesting</strong>, sustaining the research process.</div>
                                <div class="list-item"><strong>N - Novel</strong>, able to provide new findings</div>
                                <div class="list-item"><strong>E - Ethical</strong>.</div>
                                <div class="list-item"><strong>R - Relevant</strong>, advancing science or influencing clinical care, health care policy among others.</div>
                            </div>

                            <p><strong>Example of a FINER Research Question:</strong> Do nurses in Kalala hospital practice the hand washing procedure as stipulated by the hospital infection control handbook?</p>
                            <p><strong>Example of a non FINER Research Question:</strong> Are nurses washing hands?</p>

                            <h3>Hypothesis of the Study</h3>
                            <p>Brink (1996:91) defines a hypothesis as 'the formulation of the expected relationship between two or more variables in a specific population'. It is the researcher's prediction or explanation of the relationships between two variables.</p>
                            <p>Not all research is tenable to hypothesis testing, hence some research may include hypotheses while others will not. Most of the descriptive studies do not have a hypothesis to test but they generate hypothesis. Experimental studies have hypothesis to test.</p>
                            
                            <p>For example: <em>Persons with Type II diabetes mellitus who have greater knowledge of their diseases will have a higher rate of adherence to treatment regimen than those with less knowledge.</em></p>

                            <h3>Variables</h3>
                            <p>Variables are defined as quality, properties or characteristics of persons, things or situation that change or vary. For example: sex (male and female) age (20–25, 26–30 years) academic success, stress and pain.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Independent Variable (Treatment or Experimental Variable)</strong><br>
                                    This is a variable that influences other variables. It is perceived as contributing to or enabling a particular outcome. It is the intervention or treatment that the researcher performs to see the resulting change in the dependant variable. It is also referred to as the input.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Dependent Variable</strong><br>
                                    This is the outcome variable. It reflects the effects (outcome) or response to the independent variable. The dependent variable is the variable that appears, disappears, diminishes or increases. For example, to determine the effects of salt intake on hypertension, the blood pressure is the dependant variable and salt intake is the independent variable.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Extraneous Variables</strong><br>
                                    These are uncontrolled variables that influence the findings of the research study. They influence both the dependent and independent variables. These are called threats to internal and external validity of the study and may bias the selection, the time factor, and the instrument used.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Demographic Variables</strong><br>
                                    As the name suggests these are demographic attributes. They are variables that cannot be manipulated or influenced by the researcher, for example, age, sex religious beliefs or educational level.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Intervening Variables</strong><br>
                                    This may be considered as a very special case of an extraneous variable. An intervening variable comes between the dependent and independent variables. These independent variables influences the intervening variable which in turn influences to dependent variable.
