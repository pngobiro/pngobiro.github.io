                            <h3>Definition of Research</h3>
                            <p>There are several ways to define the word 'research'. For instance, Treece and Treece (1982, cited in Cormack) define research in its broadest sense as an attempt to gain solutions to problems. More precisely, it is the collection of data in a rigorously controlled situation for the purpose of prediction or explanation.</p>

                            <div class="callout callout--note">
                                <div class="callout-header">
                                    <span class="callout-icon">💡</span>
                                    <h4 class="callout-title">Scientific Definition</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>According to Burns and Grove (1999: 3), the word 'research' means 'to search again' or 'to examine carefully'. More specifically, research is diligent, systematic inquiry or study to validate and refine existing knowledge and develop new knowledge.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>This definition indicates some of the functions of research. It further explains the word 'research' in its literal use and its scientific use at the same time. Take for instance, the terms 'search again' or 'examine carefully'. This means the researcher (the person carrying out the research) has to search for the facts over and over again. They have to re-examine all facts at hand carefully.</p>

                            <p>Similarly as Burns and Grove (1999) indicate 'diligence' and 'systematic study' will include certain activities, such as planning, organisation and persistence. Research is meant to validate, that is, prove or disprove existing knowledge or information.</p>

                            <h3>Definition of Nursing Research</h3>
                            <p>As with the definition of research, there is no single definition for nursing research, either. However, for the purposes of this unit, you will use the following definition by Cormark (1991:5), which states that nursing research is defined as research into those aspects of professional activity, which are predominantly and appropriately the concern and responsibility of nurses.</p>

                            <p>According to Polit and Beck (2010), Nursing research is a systematic inquiry designed to develop trustworthy evidence about issues of importance to the nursing profession including nursing practice, education and administration.</p>

                            <p>Research can be nursing research only when it addresses issues that are relevant to the nursing profession. If the topic is not going to have an impact on the nursing practice, it is not nursing research. Thus, it is important to understand that in order to define your research as nursing research; your study must be geared towards improving certain aspects of the nursing practice, education and administration.</p>

                            <h3>Elements of Good Research</h3>
                            <p>Good research must also possess the following elements:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Clearly defined Purpose:</strong> The problem to be studied should be stated clearly and unambiguously. The statement of the problem (usually 1-2 pages) should include its scope, and the precise meanings of all words and terms significant to the research.</li>
                                <li><strong>Detailed research process:</strong> The research procedures should be described in sufficient detail to permit other researchers to replicate the research. E.g. data gathering procedures, sample selection, sampling methods and representativeness, steps to acquire informed consent. Omission of significant procedural details brings to question the validity and reliability of the data and conclusions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Thoroughly planned research design:</strong> Clear description and rationale of the procedural design of the research is required. Careful planning is important to ensure the research yields objective and credible results. Ensure complete bibliographies, field notes, satisfactory experimental controls. Minimize personal bias in data selection and recording.</li>
                                <li><strong>Adequate analysis for decision-makers:</strong> Data analysis methods should be appropriate and the analysis adequate to provide insights for decision-making. Data should be classified in ways that enable the researcher to reveal how conclusions have been arrived at.</li>
                                <li><strong>Unambiguous presentation of findings:</strong> Language of the report should be restrained, clear and precise. Assertions should be carefully drawn and hedged with appropriate reservations. Avoid generalizations that outrun the statistical findings; exaggerations; and unnecessary verbiage.</li>
                                <li><strong>Conclusions are well justified:</strong> Limit conclusions to those for which the data provide an adequate basis. Avoid interpretations based on personal experiences (however difficult this might be). Avoid using conclusions from previous studies to interpret current research. Specify the conditions under which the conclusions seem valid.</li>
                                <li><strong>Use of empirical research:</strong> This is research that relies on one or more observable aspects of a real situation, and deals with concrete data that provides the basis for external validity to research results. Futuristic research requires a very good rationale and needs to rely on strong theoretical modeling.</li>

                                <li><strong>Evidence Based Practice:</strong> The aim of evidence based practice is to provide the best possible care based on the best available research. Care given to patients/clients is based on accurate and current information.</li>
                                <li><strong>Credibility of the Nursing Profession:</strong> In the past, nursing was taken as a vocation rather than a profession. One of the criteria of a profession is the existence of a body of knowledge that is distinct from that of others. The most valid means of developing this knowledge base is through research. Nurses must demonstrate to the general public that nursing plays a big role in their health.</li>
                                <li><strong>Accountability for Nursing Practice:</strong> To be accountable for nursing practice, nurses must have sound rationale for their actions based on knowledge that is gained through scientific research. Nurses have the responsibility of keeping current their knowledge base and one of the best sources of current knowledge is the research literate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Documentation of the Cost-Effectiveness of Nursing Care:</strong> Consumers have become more aware of the cost of health care and are asking for explanations of services they receive. These consumers need to be made aware of the importance of nursing care in relation to maintaining the health of clients and in promoting the recovery and rehabilitation of ill clients. Nursing services consume a large percentage of a hospital's budget, and if nursing is demonstrated to be cost effective, hospitals will be looked to other areas to cut costs. Many studies have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of nursing care.</li>
                                <li><strong>Providing Basis for Standard Setting and Quality Assurance:</strong> Research provides the evidence needed to establish standards of care and ensure quality in service delivery.</li>
                                <li><strong>Enhance Social Relevance:</strong> The society is dynamic and becoming complex everyday. People now know their rights and therefore nursing has to change to maintain its relevance.</li>

                            <p>There are many roles that nurses can assume in association with research projects. These include:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">

                                    <strong>1. Principal Investigator</strong><br>
                                    Nurses can serve as principal investigators in scientific investigations. However one needs special research preparations. Nurses can also conduct small-scale survey study.

                                    Nurses can serve as members of research team. They may act as data collectors or administer the experimental intervention of the study. As nurses participate in research interest in research increases and the enthusiasm to conduct their own research grow.

                                <li>
                                    <strong>3. Identifier of Researchable Problems</strong><br>
                                    Nurses of all levels have responsibility of trying to identify areas of needed research. Nurses at the bedside are particularly well situated to identify patient related researchable problem.

                                    <strong>4. Evaluator of Research Findings</strong><br>
                                    Every nurse should be involved in the evaluation of research findings. As research consumers, nurses have the obligation to become familiar with research findings and determine the usefulness of these findings in the practice area. Beginning researchers should critique research articles with experienced researchers and eventually on their own. Evaluation of research is not an easy task and one needs to acquire some of the skills needed to critique research articles and reports.

                                    All nurses have the responsibility to act as patient/client advocates when their patient/clients are involved in research. The advocacy involves making sure that the ethical aspects of research are upheld. Nurses might help in explaining a study to potential participants before study begins.
                                </li>
