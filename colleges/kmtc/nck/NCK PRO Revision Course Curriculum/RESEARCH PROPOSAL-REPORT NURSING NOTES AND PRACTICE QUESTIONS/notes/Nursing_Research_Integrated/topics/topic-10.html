In section two of this unit, you covered the major types of research, which you broadly classified as qualitative and quantitative. You also identified the specific characteristics of each type. In this part of the research process, you will look at how data from either type are presented and analysed.</p>

                            <p>The data presentation and analysis of qualitative research is quite different from that of presenting data collected when using the quantitative research method. This is because qualitative research uses words while quantitative uses numbers (numerical).</p>
                            
                            <p>However, the principles are the same for both types. In both cases the researcher has to do the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>a) Describe the sample population by providing a description of the:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Respondents, for instance, key informants or focus group members.</li>
                                        <li>Age, sex, occupation, educational background and so on.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>b) Order, reduce and/or code the data (data processing).</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>c) Display the summaries of data for interpretation.</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>d) Draw conclusions.</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>e) Develop strategies for testing or confirming the findings to prove their validity.</strong></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The following steps can be used when presenting and analysing qualitative data:</p>

                                    <strong>1. Organising the Data</strong><br>
                                    The data collected through qualitative techniques is usually quite large, therefore, the researcher will need to put all this information in a simple format that can be understood. This is known as 'cleaning' the data.
                                </div>
                                <div class="list-item">
                                    <strong>2. Creating Categories, Themes and Patterns</strong><br>
                                    Since the notes from interviews and focus group discussions are not well organised and tend to be fragmented, there is need to put them into categories, themes and patterns. The researcher needs to be very familiar with the data so as to establish relationships among these categories. One way to achieve this is using the research questions or discussion topics. The researcher may need to put this into matrix form on which the data can be displayed.
                                </div>
                                <div class="list-item">
                                    <strong>3. Analysing and Interpreting the Data</strong><br>
                                    Once themes, categories and patterns have been identified, the researcher then evaluates the data to determine its usefulness and accuracy. It is important to note that there are nowadays computer programs that can be used to generate themes and categories. You have to follow the set research objectives when analysing and evaluating the data.

                                    It is important to appreciate that unlike the quantitative research where the report writing is done after analysing the data, in qualitative research techniques, the writing and the analysis go hand in hand.

                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>So far you have seen how qualitative data is analysed and presented in a research report. You will now look at how to analyse and present quantitative data. You will note that here the raw data you collect will usually be in the form of numbers. The process of organising, summarising and visualising quantitative data is referred to as 'descriptive statistics' (Eden, 2003: 211).</p>
                            
                            <p>The purpose of descriptive statistics is to help the researcher to visualise and identify the patterns that may emerge from the data collected. This will, in turn, assist the researcher in making meaningful conclusions from the results of the study. The main types of descriptive statistics are mode, median, mean and measures of central tendency among others.</p>

                            <p>In presenting quantitative data, it is very important that you use what is referred to as dummy tables. A dummy table contains all the characteristics of a table but the cells are left empty. Dummy tables are usually constructed during the planning stage of data collection. This helps the researcher visualise how to organise the data and put it in a summarised format. Dummy tables can be used for depicting simple data as well as complex data that could be used for cross tabulation.</p>
                            
                            <p>In presenting data you can use some of the following methods detailed on the next page in order to make sense of what the results mean.</p>

                            <h3>Tabular Method</h3>
                            <p>As the name suggests, this is where data is presented in tables. Depending on your skills in research and the type of study you have carried out, there are various tabular methods that you could use.</p>

                            <h4>Simple Table</h4>
                            <p>This is usually a single line of characters explaining a few columns of information.</p>

                            <h4>Measures of Central Tendency</h4>
                            <p>Measures of central tendency (mean, mode, median) are statistics that describe the average, typical or most common value for a group of data. A measure of central tendency summarizes a frequency distribution by the use of a single number.</p>

                                    <strong>The Mode</strong><br>
                                    This is the most commonly occurring value or category among a sample of subjects. This is the only measure of central tendency appropriate for nominal data. Mode may also be reported for ordinal, interval or ratio. A set of data with one value that occurs most frequently is unimodal. Two is biomodal and if more than two values occurring more frequently it is multimodal. It is possible to have no mode. e.g. 3 5 8 9 9 10 11. Mode = 9.

                                    <strong>The Median</strong><br>
                                    This is the score that divides ranked scores into two equal parts, such that half of the scores are larger than the median and the other half are smaller. Median is appropriate for ordinal, interval and ratio data influenced by extreme values. Media is frequently used in reporting average income because extreme values do not affect the median.

                                    <strong>The Mean</strong><br>
                                    This means the average of a set of scores or measurements. It is most frequently used measure of central tendency. Is arrived at by adding all values and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is appropriate for interval and ratio data. It is the most stable measure of central tendency for these levels of data if the distribution is normal. If the distribution is not normal and extreme values are present, the mean will not represent an accurate picture of the distribution.

                            <p>Measures of variability described how spreads out values are a distribution of values. Variability is the distribution of scores around a particular central score or value (usually the mean).</p>
                            
                            <p>Although measures of central tendency are important, sometimes it may be interesting to know how spreads out the values are in the distribution.</p>

                                    <p>For this example, the pulse rates for both is 78. However the pulse of group A seems homogeneous, or alike, while group B are heterogeneous, or dissimilar. This information is very important because the arithmetic mean is not appropriate to use in describing group B or to use in comparing the two groups of pulse rates.</p>

                                    <strong>Range</strong><br>
                                    This is the difference between the highest and the lowest value in the group of values or scores in a distribution. This is determined by subtracting the lowest value from the highest score. E.g scores 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85. The range is 85-78. A small range signifies that scores are not spread out and vice versa. Range is used to gain a quick picture of the dispersion of data. Range has limited usefulness because one extreme score can change the range drastically.

                                    <strong>Standard Deviation and the Variance</strong><br>
                                    Standard deviation is defined as the extent to which scores I a distribution deviate from their mean average. The standard deviation therefore involves subtracting the mean from each score to obtain the deviation.

                                        <li><strong>Positive skew</strong> is where the tail of the measures of a particular variable are low with very few high measures. A variable that tends to be positively skewed is personal income while few earn large income.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Negative skew</strong> is where the tail of the distribution points to the left i.e. the majority of the scores/measures of a variable are very high and very few low measures. An example of a negatively skewed distribution would be age of people who have chronic illnesses (a few young and middle aged men and women have chronic illnesses, but many elderly people have chronic conditions).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>A part from skewness, another deviation from the standard normal curve is <strong>kurtosis</strong>-is the vertical departure from the normal. This is the peakedness or the flatness of a curve.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A curve that is peaked is called <strong>leptokurtic</strong>.</li>
                                        <li>A relatively flat curve is said to be <strong>platykurtic</strong>.</li>
                                        <li>The kurtosis of the standard curve lies between the two extreme and is called <strong>mesokurtic</strong>.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>Most values cluster around the mean</li>
                                <li>The tails of the curve never touch the base because the distribution is theoretical, rather than empirical</li>

                            <p>Another format for presenting research data is the graphic method. In this method graphs are used to organise and describe data. This enables the reader to see at a glance the trend of distribution of the data. Graphs have two axes: vertical and horizontal. Scores are usually presented along the horizontal axis, while the frequency is placed along the vertical axis. It is important to note that the intersection point between the vertical and horizontal axes is usually represented by a zero (0). Graphs should be well labelled both along the vertical axis and the horizontal.</p>

                            <p>There are three common graphic methods that you may use for presenting your data. These are:</p>

                            </ul>

                            <h3>Histograms</h3>
                            <p>Histograms consists of a series of adjacent bars whose x-axis represent the number of subjects obtaining a particular score, number of respondents belonging to a particular category. X-axis usually has the scores. Exact limits are commonly used to construct a histogram hence the bars are continuous with no space in between.</p>
                            <p>Unlike the bar chart, in the histogram there are no spaces between the bars. A histogram in many cases is used to represent continuous variables.</p>

                            <h3>Frequency Polygons</h3>
                            <p>A polygon is a many-sided figure. To plot a frequency polygon, one must establish the midpoint of the class interval. The midpoint is established by summing up the lower and upper class limits of each interval then divide by 2. The midpoint are then plotted against the frequencies and the points are joined using straight lines. A frequency polygon is a closed figure and so the ends meet the horizontal line one limit after the highest and score and one unit from the lowest score.</p>
                            <p>Frequency polygons are drawn based on the frequencies of the observations along the vertical axis against the group or class midpoints. They form a polygon shape hence the name.</p>

                                <li>For discrete variables a bar chart is better</li>
                                <li>Frequency polygons have an advantage that several polygons can be superimposed with less crossing of lines. This allows for comparisons among various distributions</li>
                                <li>Histograms are easier to understand especially when only one distribution is being represented. However, histograms give the impression that subjects fitting within each interval are evenly distributed over the interval which is not always the case</li>

                            <h3>Charts Method</h3>
                            <p>Another way to present your data is to place it on a chart. One of the commonest types of charts used is the pie chart. Pie charts are relatively easy to interpret. Each portion represents a variable. The adjacent figure shows the top four outpatient cases in a hospital. Note that, in order to present your data on a pie chart, you have to convert it into percentages.</p>

                            <p>These are statistics that use sample data to make decisions or "inferences" about a population. inferential statistics are concerned with determining how likely it is for results obtained from a sample to results expected from the entire population.</p>
                            <p>There are many statistical techniques used in testing hypotheses. The commonest ones include:</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Correlation</strong><br>
                                    Used to analyze the degree of relationship between two variables. There are various correlation techniques that are normally used.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Chi-square (<span class="math-inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>)</strong><br>
                                    Is a statistical technique which attempts to establish relationship between two variables both of which are categorical in nature. e.g. to test the hypotheses that there is a relationship between gender and number of road accidents caused by drivers, here "gender" is categorized as "male" and "female" and no. of accidents is categorized as "no", "few" and "many".
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Regression</strong><br>
                                    This is used when a researcher is interested in finding out whether an independent variable predicts or given dependent variable. Regression the researcher can deal with one dependent variable and one dependant variable (simple regression) or a group of variables together and a dependant variable (multiply regression).
                                    <p><em>Example of simple regression:</em> A researcher might be interested in finding out whether education predicts the financial status of households. Education is independent variable while financial status is the dependent variable.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>ANOVA</strong><br>
                                    Other inferential statistics include analysis of variance (ANOVA).
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Factors influencing choice of test:</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Sample size</strong> - some tests cannot be used if sample is too small e.g. regression</li>
                                <li><strong>Types of variables and measurements</strong> - most data analysis procedures are suitable for variables measured at interval or ratio scales. Some are suitable for variables measured at ordinal or nominal scales</li>
                                <li><strong>Types of research design</strong> - for example, data from experimental study that compares differences between two or more groups is best analyzed using analysis of variance(ANOVA)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Relationships and predictions among variables are best determined using correlation and regression techniques.</p>
