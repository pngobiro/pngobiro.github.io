                            <p>When describing types of research, researchers use several methods of classification. According to UNISA (2000: 83), research can be classified as follows:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Categories, that is, what the study is to be used for.</li>
                                <li>Methodological approaches, which includes the research approaches that the researcher intends to adapt in the course of the study.</li>
                                <li>Aims of the study, including what the study aims at achieving.</li>
                                <li>The time dimension referring to the time factor of the study, that is, is the study a 'one off' case or one that will take months or even years.</li>

                            <p>In broad terms, research can be classified into qualitative and quantitative research approaches.</p>

                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>According to Burns and Grove (1999:338), qualitative research is 'a systematic, subjective approach used to describe life experiences and give them meaning'. It focuses on the whole issue under investigation, which is in line with the holistic approach the nursing profession advocates for in patient care.</p>
                            
                            <p>Qualitative research is a type of research where the data collected is in the form of words rather than numbers. The data collected from this type of research is then grouped into categories, themes and patterns (Maalim, 1999).</p>

                            <p>The data from qualitative research is usually collected through:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Observation, that is, a participant observer or a non participant observer.</li>
                                <li>Focus group discussions.</li>
                                <li>Face to face interviews.</li>
                                <li>Posted or self administered questionnaires.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                                        <li>Allows the researcher direct participation to go beyond the statistical results usually reported in quantitative research.</li>
                                        <li>Human behavior is explained best by using qualitative research behavior such as emotions and attitudes that cannot be studied by direct observation are best studied by qualitative method.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </div>

                            <p>Qualitative research can further be sub divided into several categories including historical, case studies, observations, and rapid rural appraisal (which is a more recent innovative approach used in participatory research).</p>

                            <h3>Historical Research</h3>
                            <p>This is a type of qualitative research that attempts to describe and learn from the past. This type of research is mainly used by social scientists. Historical research is a descriptive type of research where the investigator attempts to record and describe, in a sequential manner, the events under investigation. The findings are then presented in the fullest possible picture. A good example is where a nurse may investigate the historical development of nursing in Kenya and show the events and trends associated with the profession in Kenya.</p>
                            <p>Historical research has the advantage of teaching us about the past so as to put the problems of today into their proper context. However, when doing historical research, it is important that the researcher plans properly, laying out clear objectives to ensure that they are not overwhelmed by the large amount of materials, losing track of the study. In the recent past, many nurse researchers have ventured into this type of research and produced important results.</p>
                            
                            <p>Sources of data/information include;</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Eye witness reports, original documents as examples of primary sources</li>
                                <li>Second hand information i.e. other people's account (secondary sources)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Case Study</h3>
                            <p>Another type of a qualitative research method is the case study. A case study is defined as 'an in-depth investigation of an individual, group, institution or phenomena' (Mugenda & Mugenda, 1999: 173). According to Moore (1988) case studies are used when narrowing the research focus into fewer units or increasing the range of units within the study.</p>
                            
                            <p>Case studies are commonly used when the investigator is attempting to understand complex phenomena, or the various causes and effects of a certain phenomenon. This is one of the most common research methods used by nurses. Case studies have the advantage of requiring minimal resources when compared with other types of research. Case studies also provide a means of looking in depth at complex situations. At the same time, there are certain limitations associated with case studies, which researchers need to be aware of. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Results from case studies cannot be statistically validated because no sampling strategy is involved.</li>
                                <li>Case studies can be time consuming, particularly when looking into complex long term issues or phenomena.</li>
                                <li>Case studies are more susceptible to the 'Hawthorne effect', where the research process influences the study outcome.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <div class="callout callout--note">

                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li>There is a need to demonstrate the effectiveness of a specific therapeutic technique</li>
                                        <li>Generating and testing hypotheses</li>
                                        <li>There is need to generate knowledge on a particular issue or situation that has not been adequately researched on</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <h3>Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA)</h3>
                            <p>A third type of qualitative research is referred to as Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA). This is an innovative research method used for collecting data in participatory research. This approach emphasises the need for the researcher to acknowledge and appreciate that local research respondents have the knowledge and skills to be partners in the research process (Maalim, 1999). In RRA, both the researcher and the respondents collaborate and learn from each other, getting possible solutions for the research questions (Rifkin, 1996). RRA is important for generating data from the local community such as disease patterns which they (community members) are quite familiar with. There are many RRA tools and techniques for data collection but the following are some of the more common ones.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Mapping</strong><br>
                                    This is drawing of sketch maps by the research respondents to identify the comparative location and importance of different resources within the research area. This may include health facilities, social amenities and infrastructure like roads, transport and means of communication (Maalim, 1999).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Daily Schedules</strong><br>
                                    This involves outlining the daily activities of community members. Daily schedules are used to identify daily labour patterns and other activities (Jones, 1996:2). This tool enables the researcher to identify and discuss the daily workloads of the community members according to individuals, gender and seasons.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Venn Diagrams</strong><br>
                                    This is the use of circles to indicate the relationships, importance and interactions between individuals and institutions within the research areas. Usually the respondents draw circles of varying sizes. The size of the circle and the distance from the centre indicate the importance of the institution, for example a health centre, to the respondent.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Seasonal Calendars</strong><br>
                                    As the name suggests, this tool is used for gaining information from the research respondents concerning seasonal variations in patterns concerning certain issues of interest. This tool could, for example, enable the researcher to gather data on disease patterns according to the seasons.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Having covered qualitative research as one of the major research types, you will now look at quantitative research. Burns & Grove (1999:23) defined quantitative research as a 'formal, objective, rigorous, systematic process for generating information about the world', with respect to populations' dynamics, characteristics and phenomenon.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is important to note that, for many years, the quantitative research method has been the preferred method by nurse researchers. This was primarily because, in the early days, quantitative research was seen as the only recognised research or, as it was then called, 'the scientific method'. However, this no longer is the case as researchers have now understood that qualitative research is as important as, and complementary to, quantitative research methods.</p>
                            
                            <p>Researchers now appreciate that the selection of either quantitative or qualitative research types depends on many factors, including:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The issue (phenomenon) under investigation.</li>
                                <li>The aims and objectives of the research.</li>
                                <li>The state of existing knowledge.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Quantitative research is also subdivided into several types, which you will now cover in detail.</p>

                            <h3>Descriptive Research</h3>
                            <p>Descriptive research is 'the exploration and description of a phenomenon in real-life situations' (Burns & Grove 1999: 24). It involves the systematic collection and presentation of data to give a clear picture of a particular situation. A good example of descriptive study is a survey. Descriptive research also involves the systematic collection of information and aims to explore and describe new facts about a situation, people, activities or events.</p>
                            
                            <p>Descriptive research is important in nursing for the following reasons:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Assists in the development of new knowledge.</li>
                                <li>Forms the basis for future research.</li>
                                <li>Generates questions and hypotheses for further experimental study.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In descriptive research, the main focus is the investigation of existing practices, beliefs and attitudes held by people or investigating current trends of nursing</p>

                            <h3>Experimental Research</h3>
                            <p>This is one of the most complex and important research types. It is also commonly used in clinical settings because of its accuracy and reliability. Experimental research has, for several decades, been referred to as the true or scientific research because of its strict adherence to the three major characteristics of control, manipulation and randomisation.</p>
                            
                            <p>A major difference between experimental and non experimental research types that you as a research student need to note is that, in experimental research, the researcher is the active agent rather than remaining a passive observer (Polit and Hungler, 1999). According to Burnard and Morrison (1990: 30), the major distinction between experimental and descriptive research types include the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Descriptive research merely describes something, whereas experimental research tests a hypothesis.</li>
                                <li>Researchers can control variables in experimental research but cannot do this with descriptive research.</li>
                                <li>Descriptive research may not have control of the study subjects but experimental research has full control of the subjects under study.</li>
                                <li>Experimental research can lead to predictions but descriptive research may not.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Many times, experimental research is subdivided into 'true experimental' and quasi-experimental. The true experimental definition refers to the method you have just covered.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is characterized by 3 properties:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Manipulation</strong><br>
                                    This is where the researcher controls the independent variable, which can be an event, intervention or treatment that is expected to have some effect on the dependant variable. A process in which the researcher manages the independent variable in order to study the effect on dependent variable e.g. relationship between day of removal of stitches and post operative infection. Day of removal is manipulated. Some in 5th day and another group day on 7th day and see effect. Be removed in the 5th day and the other the 7th day.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Randomisation</strong><br>
                                    This is where every subject is given an equal chance to participate in the study. The researcher assigns the subjects to the experimental or control groups on a random basis. To achieve randomisation, you have to first identify the respondents and then place them into groups using random tables, coin tossing or other techniques.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Control</strong><br>
                                    The researcher exercises control over the experimental situation by eliminating the actions of other possible variables beyond the independent variable. This is achieved through manipulating, randomising and careful preparations of experimental protocols and the use of control groups. This is where comparison group(s) is used. One has an equal chance of being in either experimental or control group.
                                </li>

                            <h4>Advantages</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Most powerful design for testing the hypothesis of cause-effect relationships between variables.</li>
                                <li>It is practical, feasible and can be generalised to some extent. This type of design introduces some control over certain extraneous variables.</li>

                            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>In most real situations, it is difficult to conduct a true experimental design, since some of the variables cannot be manipulated or controlled.</li>
                                <li>At times it becomes quite difficult to get randomised research subjects or even a control group. This is to some extent why nurse researchers are not very interested in experimental research designs.</li>
                                <li>As a result of the need for randomisation, control and manipulation with the aim of establishing cause-effect relationships, the design becomes very expensive, both in terms of time and money.</li>

                            <h3>Quasi-experimental Research</h3>
                            <p>This is a type of quantitative research whose purpose is to examine causal relationships or to determine the effects of one variable on another (Burns & Grove, 1999). Quasi-experimental studies involve implementing a specific treatment and then later examining the effects of this treatment using selected methods of measurement. Quasi-experimental study is a type of intervention study.</p>

                            <p>The purpose of quasi-experimental study is to examine causality. Quasi-experimental designs are developed in order to provide alternative means of examining causality in situations not conducive to experimental control.</p>
                            
                            <p>In a quasi-experimental design, some of the above rules are relaxed. For example, there might be no need for having a control group or at times randomisation may not be included. The quasi-experimental design enables the search for knowledge and examination of causality in situations where complete control is not possible.</p>

                            <h3>Survey Research Design</h3>
                            <p>Survey research design is 'the systematic gathering of information' (Bernard and Morrison, 1992:35). Survey studies are concerned with gathering information from a sample of population. The purpose of the study is usually to identify general trends or patterns in the collected data, for example, 'nurses attitudes towards smoking'.</p>
                            <p>A survey is designed to obtain information from the population regarding the prevalence, distribution, and interrelations of variables within those populations, for example, using a census, political opinion polls, immunisation sample surveys and so on.</p>
                            <p>Survey studies primarily yield quantitative data. They are mainly cross sectional in design. They mainly deal with (investigate) what people do, for example, how or what they eat, how they meet their health needs, what kind of family planning behaviour they engage in and so on.</p>
                            
                            <p>Survey data is collected in number of ways.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Questionnaires, which are mainly self-administered.</li>
                                <li>Telephone interviews, which involves phoning people and seeking their opinions.</li>
                                <li>Personal interviews, also known as face-to-face interviews, where the interviewers meet with the interviewee to seek certain information.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>There are several advantages to the survey design. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>It is flexible and broad in scope</li>
                                <li>It can be applied to many people</li>
                                <li>It can focus on wide range of topics</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Information generated by the survey method is often superficial as the survey rarely probes deeply. The survey design is better suited for extensive rather than intensive analysis of a situation. It is usually descriptive and specific based on the situation that needs intervention, for planning purposes, monitoring and evaluation of services.</p>
                            <p>An example of a survey is the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) carried out every five years.</p>
                            
                            <p>In a survey the researcher designs the phenomenon and study but does not manipulate any variables nor do they make any efforts to determine the relationships between variables. However, a comparative descriptive survey is designed to be a comparison between two or more groups to see how they differ on some variables.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the correlation survey meanwhile, the researcher attempts to determine and describe what relationship exists between variables. For example, the study of the relationship between maternal 'age' and reports of nausea would then be determined statistically through the use of a statistical test known as the correlation coefficient (Brink 1996: 110). One independent variable is correlated with one or more dependent variables. Then statistical methods are applied to describe if the variables relate at all and what kind of relationship they have, that is, positive correlation or, negative correlation.</p>

                            <p>These are the types of studies that are conducted over a long duration of time. A good example is the cohort study where individuals having a characteristic of interest (exposure) are followed over a duration of time. During the time of study the subjects are observed to see if they develop an outcome of interest.</p>
                            <p>Two or more studies are done on a specific topic or phenomenon over a longer period of time.</p>
                            <p>The instruments used must be standardized as far as possible. Research determines if there are changes over a given period of time.</p>
                            <p>It is predominantly descriptive and explanatory in nature.</p>
                            <p>It is more complex and more expensive.</p>

                            <h4>Sub types of longitudinal Research</h4>

                                <li><strong>Panel study</strong> - the same people, group or organization is investigated over various periods of time</li>
                                <li><strong>Cohort</strong> - cohorts is a group of individuals with similar characteristics and are treated as one for the purposes of research</li>
                                <li><strong>Time series</strong> - the research is on what happened to people over a period of time. Information is collected at a specific point in time.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Cross Sectional Studies</h3>
                            <p>These are the studies that are conducted over a short duration of time, for example, a few weeks. Unlike the longitudinal studies they tend to be relatively cheaper. They are initiated where results are required as a matter of urgency.</p>
                            <p>Used when all the information on a specific topic is collected at the same time.</p>
                            <p>It is non-recurrent in nature and done at specific point in time.</p>
                            <p>It concentrates only on here and now.</p>
                            <p>It is cost effective than longitudinal.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Retrospective Study Design</h3>
                            <p>The retrospective study design is also known as 'export facts'. It is a study design aimed at a looking back in order to link the present with the past or what happened in the past. People having an outcome of interest, for example skin disease, are interviewed to establish whether or not they have had contact with an exposure of interest in the past, for example spraying of agrochemicals.</p>
                            <p>This begins with a phenomenon of interest (dependable variable) in the present and examines the relationship to other variables in the past. E.g. case studies, causes of heart attack and the investigating the associated factors e.g. contraceptive use, activity, childhood infections, atherosclerosis</p>

                            <h3>Prospective Study Design</h3>
                            <p>The prospective study design is similar to the longitudinal study as it starts from the present and ends by looking into the future. It is further divided into two categories: descriptive and explanatory. The subjects for the study are recruited based on presence or absence of an exposure of interest (workers in x-ray department) and followed up over many years to establish if they will develop outcomes of interest, for example cancer of the skin or reproductive health complications.</p>
