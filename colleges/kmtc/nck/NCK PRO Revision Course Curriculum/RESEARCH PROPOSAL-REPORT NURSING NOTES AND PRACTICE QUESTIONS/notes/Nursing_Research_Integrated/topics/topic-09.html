                            <p>This is the degree to which a research instrument yields consistent results or data after repeated trials.</p>
                            
                            <p>Reliability is influenced by random error in deviation from true measurement due to factors that have not effectively been addressed by the researcher. As random error increases, reliability decreases.</p>

                            <p>Random error may arise from:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Inaccurate coding</li>
                                <li>Ambiguous instructions</li>
                                <li>Interviewers fatigue</li>
                                <li>Interviewees fatigue</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>Random errors will always exist regardless of the design. Example of error: In a study done on the effect of drug A on blood pressure; If the BP machine used underestimates or overestimates the readings, this will lead to unreliable result.</p>

                            <p>There are 3 types of random errors:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list ordered">
                                <li>Error due to instrument inaccuracy</li>
                                <li>Error due to inaccuracy of scoring by researcher</li>
                                <li>Unexplained errors</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The research process is aimed at reducing the random error and increase reliability.</p>

                                    This technique involves administering the same instrument twice to the same group of subjects with a time lapse between (1-4 weeks).
                                    
                                    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

                                    <p>Disadvantages of this technique includes subjects sensitization as subjects may tend to remember their previous response and also difficulties in establishing a reasonable period between the two test sessions.</p>

                                    <strong>2. The Equivalent Form Technique</strong><br>
                                    This uses two equivalent instruments. Specific items in each form are different but are designed to measure the same concept. The items are the same in number, structure and level of difficulty.
                                    
                                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Using one scale to measure the weight of subjects today and after a week using different scale to measure weight of the same subject.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

                                        <li>Divide the items thus sampled into two groups or form</li>
                                        <li>Administer one form to a group of subjects randomly selected</li>
                                        <li>After a period of time administer the other form of instrument to the same group keeping all the conditions constant</li>

                                    This requires only one testing session. An instrument is designed with two parts. Subject's scores from one part are correlated with scores from the second part. Major advantage with this technique is that it eliminates advance error.

                            <p>Validity is the accuracy and meaningfulness of inferences, which are based on the research findings. Or: It is the degree to which results obtained from the analysis of the data actually represent the phenomena understudy.</p>

                            <p>Validity is largely determined by the presence or absence of systematic/non-random error. This is an error that has a consistent boosting effect on the measuring instrument. E.g. A faculty weighing scale overestimating subject weight.</p>

                            <p>This error is non-random because the obtained readings are either always above or below the true score i.e. always in one direction.</p>

                            <p><strong>Internal validity</strong> is the degree to which extraneous variables are controlled in a study. If extraneous variables have not been controlled for we will not know the observed effects on the dependent variable due to the independent variable or to extraneous variables. When extraneous variables are controlled for, the effects can accurately be attributed to independent variable. Therefore such research study is said to have high internal validity. Randomization is an important component of the internal validity of a study.</p>

                            <p><strong>External validity</strong> refers to the degree to which research findings can be generalized to populations and environment outside the experimental settings. If research findings are only applicable to the sample, the study findings are not externally valid and hence not generalizable to other populations.</p>

                                    <strong>1. History</strong><br>
                                    Occurrence of events that influence experimental units during the course of the study is called history. Some researches especially physical and biological extend over a period of time. During this extended period, events occur which have influence on the subject such that results may partly be due to extraneous factors such factors influence research findings and hence internal validity is reduced.

                                    <strong>2. Maturation</strong><br>
                                    This refers to biological or psychological process which occur among subjects in a relatively short time and which influence research findings. This can be more intellectually enlightened, motivated, fatigued, irritable or discouraged. Maturation can be controlled by application of appropriate research designs.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>3. Instrumentation</strong><br>
                                    This occurs when the measuring instrument is unreliable. It can also occur when research assistants are not consistent among themselves in observing, scoring or assessing the characteristics under study. To avoid this, the researcher should develop accurate tools and standardize data collection by holding a training session for all before data collection.

                                    <strong>4. Pretesting</strong><br>
                                    In a pretest and post test experimental research, pretest sensitizes the subjects and therefore they tend to perform better in post test. The better performance in post test is not due to the treatment alone, but the pretest sensitized them. A reliable method to avoid this problem is to use equivalent form tests.

                                    <strong>5. Statistical regression</strong><br>
                                    This is a problem where the selection of subjects is based on their performance in the pretest for example giving a pretest to students and selecting the top scores to take in a study. On completion they are given a post test. In this scenario, it is likely that their mean score of post test will be lower than the pretest mean score. The explanation in the above situation is that extreme scores tend to have the highest errors of measurements. On retesting, external scores tend to regress towards the mean score.

                                    <strong>6. Attrition</strong><br>
                                    Attrition or experimental mortality refers to the situation where many subjects drop out of the study before the study is completed. It may occur that only subjects with common characteristics are left in the study. E.g. Less motivated and lower performers drop out and leave well motivated and higher performers. This has some effect as biased sampling. Attrition interferes with original randomness of the sample and this leads to errors.

                                <li>
                                    <strong>7. Differential selection</strong><br>
                                    This occurs when subjects are systematically selected into a treatment group. This selection interferes with randomness of the sample. For example, if subjects are selected for a study because they volunteered, comparing such a group to a control group of non-volunteers introduces bias and error in the results. Volunteers are more motivated and are more interested unlike non-volunteers. Differential selection is a factor when a researcher uses a whole, in fact group as a sample. Commonly occurs in studies such as case study or where multi-stage sampling technique has been used.

                            <h3>Threats to External Validity</h3>
                            <p>Various factors pose a threat to external validity or generalization of research findings. These include:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Accessible and target population:</strong> Subjects are sampled from the accessible population. If the sample, accessible and target population are similar on salient characteristics, then generalization will be made. If accessible and target population are not similar in salient characteristics, then generalization of the research findings are only limited to the accessible population. This occurs when random sampling is not applied and hence, inference to any population is not possible.</li>
                                <li><strong>Control of extraneous variables:</strong> Research controls the subjects of extraneous variables by including them in the study. E.g. if gender is a possible extraneous variable in a study, one may consider only one level of the variable (male or female only). Strong control may increase the internal validity of a study but it may, at the same time reduce the generalizability of the results because such control may mean taking a smaller sample. A balance is needed between internal and external validity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Pre-test treatment interaction:</strong> In a pre-test and pilot-test study, subjects may score higher on the post-test due to the treatment given and pre-test sensitization. Pre-test treatment interaction makes the results only applicable or generalizable to the target population.</li>
                                <li><strong>Explicit description of the variables:</strong> Study variables must specifically be defining both conceptually and operationally. To increase the degree to which results are generalizable to other population, a researcher must operationalize the variables in such a way that the measures have a meaning outside the setting of the particular study. Generalization of the research findings is made on the assumption that there exists a universal language and a universal way of measuring a particular variable.</li>
                                <li><strong>Non-randomness of the sample:</strong> Results from studies, which are done with non-random groups can only be generalized to those groups because of the unrepresentativeness of the sample used. Randomness increases representation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Multi-treatment inference:</strong> Occurs when two treatments are applied to the same group but at different times. One drug may have a long duration and therefore its effect may interfere with effect of the other. In such situation it's difficult to determine the difference(true difference) between the treatments. The solution to this problem is to lengthen the duration between the treatments. Alternatively randomly assigns subjects to two sub-groups and administer the different treatment to the subgroups.</li>

There must be influential factor is not independent variable but the awareness is being in the special groups. Hawthorne effect is particularly in observational studies. One of the solutions is possible use hidden cameras to observe the behavior of subjects during the study or the researcher can become a participant in whatever the subject are to do.

Researchers may act or behave in away suggestive of his/her expectations to the subjects. The subjects in an attempt to please the researcher may work much harder than usual and give responses which meet the researchers expectations. This may be during the time of instructions.

                            <h3>Appropriate Time to Conduct a Pilot Study</h3>
                            <p>Ideally, a pre-test of data collection and data analysis procedures should be made before the actual full-scale study. The advantages of conducting the pre-test before you finalise your proposal is that you can draft the work plan and budget based on realistic estimates, as well as revise the data collection tools before you submit your proposal for approval. The pre-test of the data collection instruments could be done either before training your research assistants or immediately after.</p>
                            
                            <p>However, if this is not possible, for example, if the proposal is drafted far from the field, and there are no similar research settings available close to the drafting site, the field test may be done after finishing the proposal. However, it should be carried out long enough before the actual field work to allow for a thorough revision of data collection tools and procedures.</p>

                            <h3>Using the Pre-Test Findings</h3>
                            <p>It is important that you, as a researcher, utilise appropriately the lessons learnt from the pre-test or pilot study. For instance:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Identify any sensitive or irrelevant items in the instruments and rectify them.</li>
                                <li>If there was any question that the interviewers had to repeat and explain several times for the respondents, this needs to be rectified.</li>
                                <li>Analyse the results of the pre-test or pilot study as it helps to develop dummy tables.</li>
