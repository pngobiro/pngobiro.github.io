                                <li>A written report prepared for managers and policy implementers (some of whom have no knowledge of research methodology). In such reports you need to have a very clear and succinct report without the academic jargons.</li>
                                <li>A written report sent as an article for publication in refereed journals.</li>

                            <p>Because publication in journals which is referred takes long (up to 3 years), presentation of research findings is more rapid in distribution of study results. Presentation should be in nursing conferences as well as interdisciplinary conferences.</p>
                            
                            <p>Research results can be presented at professional conferences in two ways:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Oral presentation</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>Potential participants are contacted through "call for abstracts". The call for abstracts is a request for a summary for a study that the researcher wishes to present at a conference. These requests are published in professional journals and distributed to educational institutions, health care agencies and potential participants from professional organizations notices of research.</p>

                            <p>Conferences are generally distributed 6-12 months before the event. Each conference or seminar provide guidelines for presenters and for submission of abstracts. Abstract length varies from 50-1000 words, but many have 200-300 word limitations. It contains the purpose, research question(s), hypothesis, design, methodology, major findings and conclusions.</p>
                            
                            <p>Generally, those selected to participate receive no pay and are required to cover their own travel expenses. In some cases conference registration fee is waived or reduced for participants.</p>

                            <h3>Presenting a Research Paper (Oral)</h3>
                            <p>An oral presentation of a research report is usually referred to as paper presentation. Paper because it has been written on paper and is read by the investigator. If principal investigator is unable to attend the conference, a co-investigator or another person familiar with the study presents the paper.</p>

                            <h4>Advantages</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>The researcher presents findings that are current/recent unlike publication that lags behind for up to 3 years.</li>
                                <li>The researcher has an opportunity to interact with those people who are interested in the study and will be able to locate other researchers who are studying the same or similar phenomena.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The presenter is usually given 10-15 minutes. Sometimes additional time is allocated for questions or during break, other questions are dealt with. Format for oral presentation is the same as that of the journal but condensation of material is done to fit the time given.</p>

                            <h3>Presenting a Research Poster</h3>
                            <p>Has become popular. This is a visual method of presentation. During a poster session, the presenters usually remain with their posters and interact with viewers. Posters sessions generally are held during research conferences where oral presentations are also given. 1-2 hours is devoted to posters. Some conferences may have only poster presentation.</p>
                            
                            <p>Poster presentation sessions are an excellent way for beginning research to 'get their feet wet' is not scary as standing up in front of an audience and orally discussing a study.</p>

                                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Sizes of posters vary according to different research conference requirements. Common size is 4 feet by 8 feet.</li>
                                <li><strong>Design:</strong> Posters should be carefully constructed, colour combinations should be used to be attractive. Do not put too much material on a poster, diagrams, graphs, and tables are effective means of presenting certain aspects of the study such as findings.</li>
                                <li><strong>Content:</strong> Posters should contain the research problem, hypothesis, research question, description of the sample, methods, findings, major conclusions.</li>

                            <p>The use research findings in nursing practice is called research utilization. In the past, many actions of nurses have been based on tradition or authority. This is no longer acceptable in this day of evidence-based practice. Nurses should be able to justify the discussions they make and the care they give.</p>

                            <p>Barriers to the utilization of nursing research have been identified with means to bridge them. These barriers include:</p>

                                    <strong>i. Nurses lack of knowledge</strong><br>
                                    Many nurses are unaware of many research findings. Role models in research for less experienced stuff, create nursing research department, creation of formal nursing committee and presentation of research grand round are just but few suggested ways to improve utilization.

                                    <strong>ii. Nurses negative attitudes</strong><br>
                                    Negative attitudes towards research has contributed to underutilization of research findings. Can be addressed by having role models in clinical area who value research, have research courses at all levels of education and also having faulty with positive attitudes who help students early in their careers.

                                    <strong>iii. Inadequate dissemination of research findings</strong><br>
                                    Most nursing research studies are never published or presented at research meetings or workshops. Also those that are published or presented are not written or verbally presented at a level where the practicing nurse can understand the findings. Many practicing nurses complain about their ability to understand articles in the research journals, language is technical and length for researchers rather than for clinicians. Researchers in academic settings are sometimes rewarded for publication in practice journals. Nurses need to publish in popular journals, make research findings understandable. Also consider publication and presentation for the lay media to counter this problem.

                                    <strong>iv. Lack of institutional support</strong><br>
                                    Nurses frequently perceive that there is little institutional support for nursing research. To remove this barrier, nurses should get time off to attend nursing conferences; institutions should make available current journals available in the institution’s library and allocating time for nurses to read research reports during the workday.

                                    <strong>v. Findings are not ready for use in practice</strong><br>
                                    Study findings is not something that can be crammed over night and ingested in the morning. No study findings should be implemented if the study has not been replicated in several clinical settings, with similar results being found. For research findings to be ready for use in practice, the findings must have been replicated at least once and demonstrated to be true with "red" patients as well with "normal" subjects.
