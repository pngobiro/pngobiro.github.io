                            <p>The process of identifying the appropriate sampling techniques is very important in the research process. However, it is impossible to collect data from the whole population that a researcher may be interested in or intends to investigate. Since the essence of any research is to investigate a particular population, the selection of a representative sample from the specific population is vital. The type of sampling method a researcher uses will depend mainly on the type of research one intends to undertake, the methodology to be applied and the time available for the tasks. Sampling pertains to the identification of the study subjects from the general population a researcher is interested in. A researcher uses a specific sampling strategy because it is the most 'feasible and logical way of making a statement about a larger group' (Rensburg 2000:149).</p>

                            <p>According to Brink (1996) and Rensburg (2000) state, before discussing the type of sampling strategies available, one needs to define certain important terms that are associated with sampling methods.</p>

It is also referred to as all the possible entities or individuals that have the characteristic(s) of interest to the study. The most important aspect is that the population must possess all the characteristics the researcher is interested in.</p>

It is a representative group of individuals selected form a population. A sample aids the researcher to get access to the general population. A sample that is selected appropriately generates data that reflects the true status of the population in relation to the characteristic(s) or variables under study.</p>

An important point to note is that it is not always possible to get a sampling frame. In this case it becomes incumbent on the researcher to prepare their own sampling frame.</p>

It is usually the fault of the researcher and can have a negative impact on the entire findings of the research (Rensburg, 2000 and Brink, 1996). Causes of sampling bias could arise from the data collection process, for example, what time of the day the data was collected, languages of communication or how the data was collected.</p>

                            <p>Probability sampling allows for a much more representative sample of the population and enables the estimation of sampling error. It also enables the calculation of differential statistics and allows the study to be generalised to other areas.</p>
                            <p>Random sampling should take into account knowledge of every element of the population and the availability of a list of all those eligible to make a random selection.</p>
                            <p>Probability sampling involves a random selection procedure to ensure that each unit of the sample is chosen on the basis of chance. All units of the study population have an equal or at least a known chance of being included in the sample from list provided (Hardon et al., 1995).</p>
                            
                            <p>The following include some of the commonly used probability sampling techniques.</p>

                                    <strong>Simple Random Sampling</strong><br>
                                    Simple Random Sampling is one of the commonest and the simplest methods of sampling. In simple random sampling, each unit (subject) has the chance to be selected. It involves one stage selection. It also allows the researcher access to the study population. Various ways of selecting the subjects exist among which are:
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list compact" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                                        <li>Identifying the specific target population.</li>
                                        <li>Formulating an appropriate sampling frame.</li>
                                        <li>Determining the sample size for the study.</li>
                                        <li>Adapting a consecutive identification number for each unit in the sampling frame.</li>
                                        <li>Selecting the desired subjects using a randomised technique.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">There are several ways of selecting a random sample using this technique. These include, the lottery method, use of random tables, or tossing a coin to help you decide where and how to start.</p>
                                    <p>For example, if you need to select 30 subjects from a sampling frame of 100, you get 100 pieces of papers and write 'Yes' on 30 of them and 'No' on the rest. You then ask all the 100 subjects to pick a piece of paper each. Those who pick 'Yes' are included in the study.</p>

                                    <strong>Systematic or Interval Sampling</strong><br>
                                    <p>Systematic sampling is the selection of every <span class="math-inline">\(n^{th}\)</span> element from a sampling frame, where <span class="math-inline">\(n\)</span>, the sampling interval, is calculated as:</p>
                                    <div class="equation">

                                    </div>
                                    <p>Using this procedure each element in the population has a known and equal probability of selection. This makes systematic sampling functionally similar to simple random sampling. It is however, much more efficient and much less expensive to do.</p>

                                            <p>For example, suppose you intend to interview 200 KRCHN in-service students out of a total of 2000. To get the sampling interval you would divide the total number of students with the desired sample size, that is, <span class="math-inline">\(2000 / 200 = 10\)</span>. Your sampling interval is 10, that is, in a list of 2000 students you will pick every <span class="math-inline">\(10^{th}\)</span> student.</p>
                                            <p>The next step is to decide your starting point. You may use simple random method to do this by writing the numbers 1 to 10 on 10 different pieces of paper. Ask someone to pick any of the pieces and the number that is picked will be your starting point. If 8 becomes the <span class="math-inline">\(1^{st}\)</span> person, then every <span class="math-inline">\(10^{th}\)</span> person, that is, <span class="math-inline">\(18^{th}, 28^{th}, 38^{th}\)</span> and so on is picked for the study.</p>

                                    <strong>Stratified Random Sampling</strong><br>
                                    <p>When sub-populations vary considerably, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently. Stratification is the process of grouping members of the population into relatively homogeneous subgroups, for example, by education level, socioeconomic structure and so on before sampling. The strata should be mutually exclusive, that is, every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. The strata should also be collectively exhaustive, that is, no population element can be excluded. Random sampling is then applied within each stratum. This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error.</p>

                                    <p>For example, you may wish to conduct a study on contraceptive use in a community and you realise you need to stratify the subjects based on their religious beliefs, being a significant characteristic or variable in decision on usage of contraceptives. This calls for you to divide your desired sample into strata on religious lines, for example, Christians Protestants, Christian Catholics, Christians others, Muslims, Hindu and Buddhists just to mention a few. Each strata is then apportioned a sample size based on the proportion of the number of the people from that religious affiliation in the population. If Protestants are 40%, Catholics 30%, others 5%, Muslims 20% and so on, the samples are apportioned based on those percents.</p>

                                    <strong>Cluster Sampling</strong><br>
                                    <p>Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when 'natural' groupings are evident in the population. The total population is divided into these groups (or clusters), and a sample of the groups is selected. The required information is then collected from the elements within each selected group. This may be done for every element in these groups, or a subsample of elements may be selected within each of these groups.</p>
                                    <p>Elements within a cluster should ideally be as homogeneous as possible. However, there should be heterogeneity between clusters. Each cluster should be a small scale version of the total population. The clusters should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. A random sampling technique is then used on any relevant clusters to choose which clusters to include in the study.</p>
                                    <p>Used where sampling frame is not possible e.g. Where population is too large or if its scattered.</p>

                                Non Probability Sampling
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>There are two principle methods of non probability sampling. These are known as purposive or judgmental sampling and quota sampling. Used when a researcher is not interested in selecting a sample that is representative of a population. Is common in quantitative research because the focus is on depth information and not making references or generalizations.</p>

                            <h3>Purposive or Judgmental Sampling</h3>
                            <p>Purposive or judgmental sampling is where the researcher selects a particular group or groups based on certain criteria (Wilson, 1993:179). In this method the researcher determines who should be included in the study. It is, in fact, the researcher's opinion that the sample is representative of the target population.</p>
                            <p>Purposive sampling is commonly used in qualitative studies. The main advantage of this method of sampling is that it gives the researcher a free hand to respond according to their judgment. Disadvantages include sampling biases, the possibility of unrepresentative samples and lack of generalisations of the study findings.</p>
                            <p>The researcher specifies the criteria e.g. certain age, range, region, education level, specified group etc. After the criteria has been set, random sampling is then applied.</p>

                            <h3>Quota Sampling</h3>
                            <p>In quota sampling, the population is first segmented into mutually exclusive sub-groups, just as in stratified sampling. Then judgement is used to select the subjects or units from each segment based on a specified proportion. For example, an interviewer may be told to sample 200 females and 300 males between the age of 45 and 60.</p>
                            <p>Is similar to stratified random sampling and the objective is to include various groups or quota of the population in the study based on some criteria. Researcher purposely chooses the subject to fit the quota.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Steps</h4>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                                <li>Identify the population of interest</li>
                                <li>Determine size of sample</li>
                                <li>Stratify population into quota, depending on criteria</li>
                                <li>Cases are purposely selected to fill the quotas</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>Convenience or Accidental Sampling</h3>
                            <p>Convenience sampling is also referred to as accidental or availability sampling. In convenience sampling the researcher is unable to control bias at all. This is a method in which, for convenience sake, the study units that happen to be available at the time of data collection are selected and used as a sample (Hardson et al 1995:207).</p>
                            <p>This type of sampling allows the utilisation of any available target population. For example, if you need to assess the blood pressure of females using depo provera who are above 40 years of age, you will need to check the blood pressure of any female patient above this age irrespective of her parity or other characteristics. In such circumstances there is no sample representation.</p>
                            <p>Involves selecting cases or units of observation as they become available to the researcher, also called "volunteer sampling".</p>

                            <h3>Snow Ball Sampling</h3>
                            <p>In social science research, snowball sampling is a technique for developing a research sample where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances. Thus the sample group appears to grow like a rolling snowball. This sampling technique is often used in hidden populations which are difficult for researchers to access. Example populations include drug users and commercial sex workers. Sample members are not selected from a sampling frame, therefore, snowball samples are subject to numerous biases. For example, people who have many friends are more likely to be recruited into the sample.</p>
                            <p>In this method, initially the researcher identifies few subjects with desired characteristics using purposive method. This few respondent direct the researcher to other subject with similar characteristics. This continues until the researcher gets the number of cases/subjects he requires.</p>

                                Access to Research Population

                            <p>In order to gain access to a research population, there is need to specify how you as the researcher achieved this goal. You need to describe how the research areas were identified, the selection process involved, the type of sampling method used and how you managed to gain access to the specific research participants. You will also have to specify some of the ethical considerations involved and how these are professionally managed before the respondents take part in the study.</p>

                            <p>Prior to commencing the study, you as the researcher should make a formal application to the government of Kenya for permission to conduct the research. This should include two or more copies of the research proposal, accompanied by a recommendation letter from the supervisor(s) as required by the Kenyan authorities. Similarly, if your institution is authorised to conduct research, there may be a 'Research and Ethics Committee'. Such a committee is usually vested with the authority of granting research permits, which you could use.</p>

                            <p>Once the authority to conduct the study in the form of a 'Research Clearance Permit' has been granted, the researcher then reports to the 'District Commissioner (DC) of the area'. The DC will then instruct you to report to the District Officer (DO) of your research area. The DO may further require you to report to the area local chief and assistant chiefs. When the above administrative requirement is completed, the researcher then approaches the village leader to grant further access to the respective villagers.</p>

                                    <p>As a requirement, each research respondent should be requested to accept in writing and sign or affix a thumb print. In cases where a respondent can neither read nor write, a consent form should be completed and duly signed after you have clearly explained the purpose of the research.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Always attach a copy of this consent in the appendix section!</strong></p>

                            </div>

                            <p>You should inform the respondents that their participation is absolutely voluntary and they may pull out of the study whenever they so wish. As part of the contract, you should guarantee the respondents absolute confidentiality during and after the study.</p>

                            <p>The process described above may vary depending on the type and area of study. For example if you want to conduct a study specific to your hospital or a few hospitals in your catchment area you may need authority from the hospital administrator and heads of departments that are going to be involved.</p>
