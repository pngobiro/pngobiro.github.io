                            <p>Safety, often defined as freedom from psychological and physical injury, is a basic human need that must be met. Healthcare provided in a safe manner and a safe environment is essential for a patient's survival and wellbeing. The nurse incorporates critical thinking skills when using the nursing process, and is responsible for assessing the patient and the environment for hazards that threaten safety, as well as planning and intervening appropriately to maintain a safe environment. By doing this, the nurse is not only a provider of safe acute, restorative and continuing care, but also an active participant in health promotion. These principles are particularly important when performing the skills presented in this chapter—applying restraints and seizure precautions—given the inherent risk of injury to both patients and healthcare workers in carrying out these skills.</p>
                            
                            <p>The nurse integrates knowledge from nursing and other scientific disciplines, previous experience in caring for patients who had an injury or were at risk, critical thinking attitudes such as perseverance and any standards of practice that are applicable. For example, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Accreditation Council National Competency Standards for the Registered Nurse (2006) discuss the nurse's responsibility in maintaining patient safety. The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards also provides standards for safety (e.g. in the administration of medications, use of restraints and use of medical devices). All this information and experience is referred to by nurses as they conduct a detailed assessment of a specific patient.</p>
                            
                            <p>A physical restraint is a device used to immobilise a patient or an extremity and to restrict the freedom of movement of, or normal access to, a person's body. Restraints were commonly used in the past to limit the activities of patients who were confused, combative or at high risk of falling when unattended. Restraints include both physical and chemical means of controlling a person's behaviour and come with inherent risks—hence correct use is paramount for patient and staff safety.</p>
                            
                            <p>Special precautions are necessary to prevent injury in patients susceptible to seizures, encompassing all nursing interventions to protect the patient from traumatic injury, positioning for adequate ventilation and drainage of oral secretions, and providing privacy and support following the seizure.</p>
                            
                            <p>This chapter explores the psychomotor skills that focus on creating a safe clinical environment for the client. The skills addressed include applying restraints (15-1) and seizure precautions (15-2).</p>

                            <p>Interventions for a patient who is experiencing a seizure cannot be delegated. The nurse must constantly assess the patient's airway patency, adequacy of breathing and circulatory status. Clinical judgments must be made quickly, using the elements of critical thinking. Nurse assistants can remain with the nurse during a seizure, to obtain needed supplies and notify other personnel at the nurse's request.</p>
