                                Overview
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Vital signs are the most frequent measurements obtained by nurses; they include temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure. Vital sign assessment and interpretation are integral in determining a patient's health status. Careful measurement techniques and knowledge of the normal range in vital signs will ensure more accurate findings and interpretation of those findings. The primary indication for assessing a patient's vital signs is to establish a baseline for comparison of alterations in health. An important aim of measuring vital signs is to identify early patient deterioration.</p>
                            
                            <p>Accurate monitoring and consistency in the method used to collect vital signs is essential. Variations in the methods used to collect a patient's vital signs may result in false identification of alterations in health patterns. Careful measurement techniques, knowledge of normal ranges and specifications of reportable altered vital signs parameters, and clear and effective communication channels for reporting abnormal patient vital signs and deterioration ensure more accurate interpretation in a timely manner.</p>
                            
                            <p>Vital signs are routinely collected:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>on patient admission to a healthcare facility</li>
                                <li>before and after a surgical or an invasive procedure</li>
                                <li>before, during and after the administration of medications that affect cardiovascular, respiratory and temperature-control functions</li>
                                <li>as indicated by any significant change in the patient's health status</li>
                                <li>before and after nursing interventions that affect vital signs</li>
                                <li>if a patient reports nonspecific symptoms of physical distress</li>
                                <li>on a schedule according to agency policy or the medical practitioner's prescription.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>General observation charts exist for recording vital signs. The nurse needs to identify the institution's procedure for documenting information. In addition to the actual vital sign values, the nurse records in the patient's case notes any accompanying or precipitating symptoms, such as chest pain and dizziness with abnormal blood pressure, shortness of breath with abnormal respirations, cyanosis with hypoxaemia, or flushing and diaphoresis with elevated temperature. The nurse also documents any interventions initiated as a result of vital sign measurement, such as administration of oxygen therapy or antihypertensive medication.</p>
                            
                            <p>This chapter explores the psychomotor skills that focus on specific nursing care of the patient requiring measurement and recording of vital signs. The skills addressed include measuring body temperature (28-1), assessing the radial and apical pulses (28-2), assessing respirations (28-3), measuring oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry, \(\mathrm{SpO}_2\)) (28-4), measuring blood pressure (28-5) and performing a brief body systems assessment of the hospitalised patient (28-6).</p>

                                                (2) Remove thermometer pack from charging unit. Attach oral probe (blue tip) to thermometer unit. Grasp top of probe stem, being careful not to put pressure on the ejection button.<br>
                                                (3) Slide disposable plastic probe cover over thermometer probe until cover locks in place (see illustration).<br>
                                                (4) Ask patient to open mouth; then gently place thermometer probe under tongue in posterior sublingual pocket lateral to centre of lower jaw.<br>
                                                (5) Ask patient to hold thermometer probe with lips closed.<br>
                                                (6) Leave thermometer probe in place until audible signal occurs and patient's temperature appears on digital display; remove thermometer probe from under patient's tongue.<br>
                                                (7) Push ejection button on thermometer stem to discard plastic probe cover into appropriate receptacle.<br>

                                                Allows for accurate assessment of presence and significance of pulse alterations.<br>
                                                Acceptable range of pulse rate changes with age (see Table 28-2).<br>
                                                Physical activity requires an increase in cardiac output that is met by an increased heart rate and stroke volume.<br>
                                                Heart rate increases temporarily when changing from lying to sitting or standing position.<br>
                                                Antiarrhythmics, sympathomimetics and cardiotonics affect rate and rhythm of pulse; opioid analgesics and general anaesthetics slow heart rate; central nervous system stimulants such as caffeine increase heart rate.<br>
                                                Fever or exposure to warm environments increases heart rate; heart rate declines with hypothermia.<br>
                                                Results in stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, which increases heart rate.

                                                (1) Help patient assume a supine or sitting position.<br>
                                                (2) If supine, place patient's forearm straight alongside or across lower chest or upper abdomen with wrist extended straight (see illustration). If sitting, bend patient's elbow 90 degrees and support lower arm on chair or on nurse's arm. Slightly flex the wrist with palm down.<br>
                                                (3) Place tips of first two fingers of hand over groove along radial or thumb side of patient's inner wrist (see illustration).<br>
                                                (4) Lightly compress against radius, obliterate pulse initially and then relax pressure so pulse becomes easily palpable.<br>
                                                (5) Determine strength of pulse. Note whether thrust of vessel against fingertips is bounding, strong, weak or thready.<br>
                                                (6) After pulse can be felt, look at watch's second-hand and begin to count rate; when second-hand hits number on dial, start counting with 0, then 1, 2 and so on.<br>
                                                (7) If pulse is regular, count rate for 30 s and multiply total by 2.<br>
                                                (8) If pulse is irregular, count rate for 60 s. Assess frequency and pattern of irregularity.

                                                Relaxed position of lower arm and extension of wrist permits full exposure of artery to palpation.<br>
                                                Fingertips are the most sensitive parts of hand to palpate arterial pulsation.<br>
                                                Pulse is more accurately assessed with moderate pressure. Too much pressure occludes pulse and impairs blood flow.<br>
                                                Strength reflects volume of blood ejected against arterial wall with each heart contraction.<br>
                                                Rate is determined accurately only after nurse is assured pulse can be palpated. Timing begins with 0. Count of 1 is first beat palpated after timing begins.<br>
                                                A 30 s count is accurate for rapid, slow or regular pulse rates.<br>
                                                Inefficient contraction of heart fails to transmit pulse wave, interfering with cardiac output, resulting in irregular pulse. Longer time ensures accurate count.

                                                (2) Locate anatomical landmarks to identify the point of maximal impulse (PMI), also called the apical impulse. Heart is located behind and to left of sternum with base at top and apex at bottom. Find angle of Louis just below suprasternal notch between sternal body and manubrium; can be felt as a bony prominence. Slip fingers down each side of angle to find second intercostal space (ICS). Carefully move fingers down left side of sternum to fifth ICS and laterally to the left midclavicular line (MCL). A light tap felt within an area 1–2 cm of the PMI is reflected from the apex of the heart.<br>
                                                (3) Place diaphragm of stethoscope in palm of hand for 5–10 s.<br>

                                                (5) When S_{1} and S_{2} are heard with regularity, use watch's second hand and begin to count rate: when second hand hits number on dial, start counting with 0, then 1, 2 and so on.<br>
                                                (6) If apical rate is regular, count for 30 s and multiply by 2.<br>
                                                (7) If heart rate is irregular or patient is receiving cardiovascular medication, count for 1 min (60 s).<br>
                                                (8) Note regularity of any dysrhythmia (S_{2} and S_{3}) occurring early or later after previous sequence of sounds; for example, every third or every fourth beat is skipped).<br>
                                                (9) Replace patient’s gown and bedclothes; help patient return to comfortable position.<br>

                                                Use of anatomical landmarks allows correct placement of stethoscope over apex of heart, enhancing ability to hear heart sounds clearly. If unable to palpate the PMI, reposition patient on left side. In the presence of serious heart disease, the PMI may be located to the left of the MCL or at the sixth ICS.<br>
                                                Warming of metal or plastic diaphragm prevents patient from being startled and promotes comfort.<br>
                                                Allow stethoscope tubing to extend straight without kinks that would distort sound transmission. Normal sounds S_{1} and S_{2} are high-pitched and best heard with the diaphragm.<br>
                                                Apical rate is determined accurately only after nurse is able to auscultate sounds clearly. Timing begins with 0. Count of 1 is first sound auscultated after timing begins.<br>
                                                Regular apical rate can be assessed within 30 s.<br>
                                                Irregular rate is more accurately assessed when measured over longer interval.<br>
                                                Regular occurrence of dysrhythmia within 1 minute may indicate inefficient contraction of heart and alteration in cardiac output.<br>
                                                Restores comfort and promotes sense of wellbeing.<br>
                                                Controls transmission of microorganisms when nurses share stethoscope.
