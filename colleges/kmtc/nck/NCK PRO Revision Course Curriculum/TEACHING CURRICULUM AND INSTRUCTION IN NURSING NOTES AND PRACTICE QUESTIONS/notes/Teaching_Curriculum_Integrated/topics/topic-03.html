The teacher should talk as little as possible and encourage the students to think and learn independently.</p>

                            <h3>Guideposts to Choosing an Appropriate Method</h3>
                            <p>There are few guideposts to choosing an appropriate method. Usually, the choice is primarily based on the lesson objectives. The objective is what you want your learner to be able to do at the end of the session.</p>
                            <p>For example, you may want the learner to be able to:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>List the steps in taking a patient's blood pressure.</li>
                                <li>Take a blood pressure reading</li>
                                <li>Share a health message with a patient, for example, explain to a pregnant woman her dietary requirements.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The skills involved in the three examples are all different.</p>
                            <p>The next step in choosing a teaching and learning method is to consider its practicality.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>How much time does it require?</li>
                                <li>Where will the teaching take place?</li>
                                <li>How many learners are involved?</li>
                                <li>At what level are the learners?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Finally, you should gather the resources required to deliver the lesson. Whatever method you choose, keep in mind that effective learning should always be fun. By gathering resources in advance, you will be sure that your simulators are functioning well and can be manipulated to suit the learning environment.</p>

                            <p>There are different types of teaching skills. Cognitive skills refer to knowledge application, while thinking skills, refer to the ability to make decisions, choose appropriate alternatives and exercise caution. Finally, psychomotor skills relate to the use of the hands, the ability to do things or perform procedures.</p>
                            <p>There are several methods used for teaching skills. These include:</p>

                            <h3>What innovative teaching and learning methods do you know?</h3>
                            <p>All of the methods discussed in the previous section fall in the category of what are referred to as traditional teaching methods. Some of these methods, however, have been improved in implementation to be referred to as modern or innovative methods. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Problem Based Learning (PBL).</li>
                                <li>Self Directed Learning (SDL).</li>
                                <li>Small Group Tutorial (SGT).</li>
                                <li>Community Based Education and Service (COBES).</li>
                                <li>Computer Aided Education (CAE).</li>
                                <li>Student-centred, Problem-Based, Integrated, Community-Oriented, Electives and Systematic (SPICES).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Of all the innovative methods mentioned, the best known is probably PBL. In this method, instead of hours of lectures and demonstrations by the teacher, a problem is used to guide student learning using the innovative teaching and learning process (steps 3, 7, 10, 15) previously outlined. All that is needed to guide learning is a tutorial problem. Students then follow the steps as guided by their tutor and achieve the intended learning outcomes.</p>

                            <h3>Tutorial Problem</h3>
                            <p>What does a 'problem' in PBL mean?</p>
                            <p>A problem may mean any of the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>A problem that is clinical, theoretical, research based or related to real life.</li>
                                <li>An idea.</li>
                                <li>A situation.</li>
                                <li>An event.</li>
                                <li>An outbreak of disease or disaster.</li>
                                <li>A newspaper cutting.</li>
                                <li>A list of objectives.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Innovative methods are often used in combination with other methods to facilitate student learning. The SPICES method, which is also a curriculum development strategy, has several characteristics that distinguish it from traditional teaching and learning methods as illustrated in the following table.</p>

                            <p>The main advantage of the innovative methods is that the responsibility for learning is placed on the learner's shoulders. In the process of learning, the learner develops many skills, which gradually transform them into an independent learner. The learning skills they develop include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>Problem solving skills</li>
                                <li>Communication skills</li>
                                <li>Clinical reasoning skills</li>

                            <p>The only disadvantages of innovative educational methods are their resource-intensive nature and the need to have many tutorial rooms to accommodate the small groups of students instead of the traditional huge lecture hall.</p>

                            <h3>Can attitudes be taught?</h3>
                            <p>Attitudes are rather vague things and are hard to define or explain. They are influenced by one's values and feelings. Despite these problems, you have to try to teach your learners how to acquire the right attitudes to enable them to assist and care for patients.</p>
                            <p>An attitude is a tendency to behave or think in a certain way, for example, having respect for ideas that other people have. Certain attitudes are formed or changed during training. Attitudes can be taught by providing information to shape ideas through lectures, films, stories, providing live examples and so on. In the latter, the teacher acts as a model by letting the learner take part in a role-play.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>List five words that describe feelings/values then click the following link to compare your answer.</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>Kindness</li>
                                <li>Willingness</li>
                                <li>Accuracy</li>
                                <li>Empathy</li>
                                <li>Dedication</li>
                                <li>Honesty</li>
                                <li>Patience</li>
                                <li>Respectfulness</li>
                                <li>Gentleness</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>There are several ways in which you can provide experiences for learners to develop the right attitudes. For example, seeing a patient suffering from a particular disease touches the feelings of the learner, who may feel sorry for the patient, and may later internalise the situation by imagining themselves in a similar situation. The learner makes a resolution to avoid such a situation and learns how to advise and react towards such patients with empathy.</p>
                            <p>You can also organise small group discussions with seven to twelve participants with specific objectives. You can also provide role-play exercises where learners act the part of different people or patients to reveal some of the feelings involved.</p>
                            
                            <p>In summary, you can best teach attitudes by providing:</p>

                                <li>Information to shape attitudes, for example, facts about AIDS.</li>

                                <li>Experience to shape attitudes, for example, opportunities to work in a hospital.</li>
                                <li>Discussion to shape attitude, for instance, by sharing your own opinions.</li>

                            <h3>The Role of the Student in the PBL Process</h3>
                            <p>The student in the PBL process plays more roles than the student in the traditional teaching and learning methods. Such roles include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Active participation, which includes listening, contribution to the discussion and asking questions.</li>
                                <li>Carrying out analysis, synthesis and evaluation of the whole learning process.</li>
                                <li>Making connections, linking concepts and applying principles.</li>
                                <li>Reviewing and redefining explanations.</li>
                                <li>Evaluating achievements.</li>
                                <li>Summarising at various stages.</li>
                                <li>Acting as a change agent, that is, as a solution giver, process helper, resource linker and catalyst.</li>
                            </ul>

                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>How would you describe clinical teaching?</h3>
                            <p>Clinical teaching is teaching in the clinical or practical setting, similar to the environment within which the learner will practice in future.</p>

                            <h3>What is nursing?</h3>
                            <p>The answer to this question has been provided elsewhere in this module. Earlier on, you identified that your learner is going to be a nurse. Since you have already covered the methods of teaching, you will now highlight the issues that affect the quality of work (nursing) in this section.</p>
                            
                            <blockquote class="callout callout--note">
                                Virginia Henderson (1958) states that 'the unique function of the nurse is to assist the individual (sick or well), in the performance of those activities contributing to health, to recovery (or to a peaceful death) that they would perform unaided if they had the necessary strength, will or knowledge.'
                            </blockquote>

                            <p>Essentially, nursing is nurturing people back to optimal health. It involves specific tasks or skills each of which can be split up into specific activities to complete a task. The task or skill has content, information or knowledge that explains its purpose, that is, what it is for? and how it should be done?</p>
                            <p>In clinical teaching, you want your learner to put that knowledge into action. You want your student to get involved with the patient. Involvement brings in emotions and feelings. Nursing is 'caring'. It is here that you must teach the learner to empathise. They can nurture and care without getting carried away by the effects of the illness or situation through empathising. Empathising helps the learner to get involved and yet stand apart enough to carry out the necessary professional activities.</p>
                            <p>No learning can take place until certain basic needs have been met. You need to ensure that the physical needs of the learner have been met for them to concentrate. For example, if the learner is wearing uncomfortable shoes on duty, you need to advise them of the importance of wearing comfortable shoes.</p>
                            <p>You may offer alternative solutions or refer the student to somebody who can help them directly. You may not be in a position to do much but the fact that you showed concern will move your learner. The learner also needs to feel that they belong, which is a good way to boost self-esteem. The learner needs to feel welcome. It is important that you establish a good working relationship. A warm smile and a few encouraging words will go a long way to make your student feel settled.</p>
                            <p>When the basic needs mentioned previously get fulfilled, your learner will want to learn at a higher level and exercise mastery of the skills. At this point, you should find out the relevant learning situations available in the clinical setting. Give the students the necessary support to remain successful and encourage them to look for other learning situations on their own.</p>
                            <p>While nursing, the nurse shares the triumphs, sense of achievement, and sadness of the bereaved who have lost a loved one, or the amputee, or the young with a terminal disease. Nursing is giving hope and support toward recovery or relief from discomfort, or toward a peaceful, dignified death.</p>
                            <p>Hope and support will help the patient regain confidence and self reliance.</p>
                            <p>Throughout this process, confidentiality must be maintained to enhance the trust of the patient.</p>
                            <p>As the learner carries out procedures, they need to learn how to contain personal negative feelings, for example, contempt, revulsion of unpleasant sights or aversion. Above all, the learner must learn how to maintain their integrity and the professional code of ethics and etiquette (see module one of this programme for more information). This is necessary because the student will be learning how to protect their patient from malpractice and negligence.</p>

                            <h3>How do you ensure that you are providing quality nursing care?</h3>
                            <p>Mastery of the theory is important because it gives you the foundation. Scientific knowledge adds appropriate technical skills and encourages you to develop the right attitudes. The result is the development of sound clinical judgment, which is the sign of an experienced nurse.</p>

                            <h3>Role of a Clinical Teacher</h3>
                            <p>As you plan to teach in a clinical setting, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Is the learner performing safely, kindly and with confidence?</li>
                                <li>Is the learner aware of the reason for each procedure?</li>
                                <li>Is the patient the focus of the procedure?</li>
                                <li>Is the demonstration enabling the learner to link with the theory covered earlier?</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>As a clinical teacher, you therefore should be:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>A skilled, experienced nurse concerned with the maintenance and improvement of standards of patient care.</li>
                                <li>Concerned to help your learner to develop their potential as a nurse.</li>
                                <li>Able to gain satisfaction from caring for patients.</li>
                                <li>Able to gain satisfaction from teaching, especially individuals and small groups.</li>
                                <li>Keen to create a favourable environment for learning.</li>
                                <li>Alert to the opportunities available for facilitating learning in the clinical situation</li>
                                <li>A model for your learner.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The theories of learning can help yet again. Revise these!</p>
