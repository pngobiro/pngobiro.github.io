                            <p>All age groups and all regions are affected by NCDs. NCDs are often associated with older age groups, but evidence shows that 16 million of all deaths attributed to non-communicable diseases occur before the age of 70. Of these "premature" deaths, 82% occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Children, adults and the elderly are all vulnerable to the risk factors that contribute to non-communicable diseases, whether from unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, exposure to tobacco smoke or the effects of the harmful use of alcohol.</p>
                            
                            <p>These diseases are driven by forces that include ageing, rapid unplanned urbanization, and the globalization of unhealthy lifestyles. For example, globalization of unhealthy lifestyles like unhealthy diets may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, increased blood glucose, elevated blood lipids, and obesity. These are called 'intermediate risk factors' which can lead to cardiovascular disease, a NCD.</p>
                            
                            <p>A risk factor is any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual that increases the likelihood of developing a disease or injury. The following are risk factors:</p>

                                    <p>There are numerous common communicable diseases, such as throat colds and the flu. They often produce symptoms like sore throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, headache, fever and nausea. These can typically be treated with adequate rest and over-the-counter medication. Medication for common communicable diseases may include pain relievers like Tylenol as well as nasal decongestants, cough syrups, anti-nausea pills and throat drops. Common communicable diseases usually dissipate over the course of a few days or weeks.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Chronic</strong>
                                    <p>Chronic communicable diseases are severe and not usually spread from person to person via airborne pathogens. They may be spread via parasites, sexual contact or transmission of bodily fluids like blood. Unlike throat colds or other common illnesses, chronic communicable diseases may last months or even a lifetime. Examples of chronic communicable disease include malaria, Lyme disease, diphtheria and hepatitis. Treatment for chronic communicable diseases usually involves some form of hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics, prescription medication and intensive care.</p>

                                    <strong>Vaccines</strong>
                                    <p>One effective way to treat a communicable disease is by receiving a vaccine before your body becomes infected. Vaccines work by infecting your body with a weakened strain of the actual disease. Your body then produces antibodies to fight the disease. Antibodies remain in the system after the weakened strain is gone and protect the body from later infections. Certain vaccines need only to be administered once, such as vaccines for mumps, measles, whooping cough and polio. Others, like the flu vaccine, should be taken annually.</p>

                                    <strong>Prevention/Solution</strong>
                                    <p>Prevention is the most effective form of treatment for communicable disease. Boost your immune system by incorporating high levels of antioxidants, fruits, vegetables and antihistamines into your diet. Engage in at least 30 minutes of exercise daily to maintain strength and proper circulation. Drink high amounts of water (in excess of two liters per day) and maintain adequate rest for your body. Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, handling uncooked meat, sneezing, coughing or touching a dirty surface.</p>

                            <p>The strategic directions provide a strong foundation for all of our nation’s prevention efforts and include core recommendations necessary to build a prevention-based strategy.</p>
                            <p>Each Strategic Direction guides actions that will demonstrably improve health. Together, the Strategic Directions create the web needed to fully support in leading longer and healthier lives.</p>

                            <p>The overarching goal of the National Prevention Strategy is to increase the number of people who are healthy at every stage of life. The strategy provides evidence-based recommendations that are fundamental to improving the nation's health through the active engagement of all sectors of society to help achieve four broad strategic directions:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Building Healthy and Safe Community Environments</strong><br>
                                    Prevention of disease starts in our communities and at home; not just in the doctor's office. For example, businesses and employers can adopt practices to encourage their workforce to increase physical activity and reduce pollution (e.g., workplace flexibility, rideshare and vanpool programs, park-and-ride incentives, travel demand management initiatives, and telecommuting options).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Expanding Quality Preventive Services in Both Clinical and Community Settings</strong><br>
                                    When people receive preventive care, such as immunizations and cancer screenings, they have better health and lower health care costs. For example, expanding the linkages between clinical and community prevention efforts, such as diabetes prevention programs that support preventive efforts among underserved groups and can improve access to preventive services.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Empowering People to Make Healthy Choices</strong><br>
                                    Policies and programs can make healthy options the easy and affordable choice, and when people have access to actionable and easy-to-understand information and resources, they are empowered to make healthier choices. For example, health care professionals can use multiple communication tools (e.g., mobile phone applications, personal health records, and credible health websites) and culturally competent methods to support more traditional written and oral communication.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Eliminating Health Disparities</strong><br>
                                    By eliminating disparities in achieving and maintaining health, we can help improve quality of life for all Americans. For example, health care providers can train and hire more qualified staff from underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups and people with disabilities.
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>Ecosystem</strong> – Environment is where man, pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi and protozoa) live. The interaction between man with environment enable transfer of germs to human system</li>
                                <li><strong>Difficulties in changing behavior</strong> - To prevent disease we increasingly ask people to begin do things that they have not done previously, to stop doing things that they have been doing for years and to do more of some things and less of others</li>
                                <li><strong>Pattern of disease rate</strong> - Some groups often have a characteristic over time even though individuals come and go from these groups.

                                <li><strong>Socio-economic status</strong> - A consistent finding dated from the twelfth century, is that people in the lowest socioeconomic groups have the highest rates of morbidity and mortality, whether the socioeconomic status was studied in relation to education, income, or occupation: the lower the level the higher the death and morbidity rate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Marital status</strong> - It has been known for many years that people who are not married-whether single, separated, widowed or divorced- have higher mortality rates than married people.</li>
                                <li><strong>Gender</strong> - One of the most well-established facts among students of health and disease is that men have higher mortality rates than women.

                                    <p>Interventions that address patients' personal health behaviors and practices are vitally important. Clinicians can help individuals change their health-related behaviors by using efficient, patient-centered counseling strategies that are based on an understanding of how people change.</p>

                                    <p>Another central health promotion/disease prevention strategy that students need to be skilled in is screening, or testing for health problems in the absence of symptoms or signs indicating the presence of such a problem.

                                    <p>Although health care professionals traditionally have focused on individual patients who present themselves for care one at a time in the office or clinic, students preparing for practice in today's health care system also must learn to focus on the care of populations of patients.</p>
