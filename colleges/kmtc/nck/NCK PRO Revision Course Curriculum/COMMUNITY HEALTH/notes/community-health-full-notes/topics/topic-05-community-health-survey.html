                                        <li><strong>Unrepresentative sample</strong> - Bias often occurs when the survey sample does not accurately represent the population. It is also called selection bias.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Under coverage</strong> - occurs when some members of the population are inadequately represented in the sample</li>
                                        <li><strong>Nonresponse bias</strong> - Sometimes, individuals chosen for the sample are unwilling or unable to participate in the survey.</li>

                                                <li>Social desirability - Most people like to present themselves in a favorable light, so they will be reluctant to admit to unsavory attitudes or illegal activities in a survey, particularly if survey results are not confidential. Instead, their responses may be biased toward what they believe is socially desirable.</li>
