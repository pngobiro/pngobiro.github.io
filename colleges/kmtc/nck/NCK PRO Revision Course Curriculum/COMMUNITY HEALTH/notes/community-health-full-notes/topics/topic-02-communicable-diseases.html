                                <li>Germs are tiny organisms (living things) that may cause disease. Germs are so small and sneaky that they creep into our body without being noticed. In fact, germs are so tiny that you need to use a microscope to see them. We don't know what hit us until we have symptoms (runny nose, cough, sore throat, fever, etc.)</li>
                                <li>Germs are microbes. A microbe is a tiny living organism that can only be seen with a microscope. Microbes are the smallest form of life on Earth. Although some microbes can make you sick or may even kill you, most are harmless, and some are extremely helpful. Microbes can be found virtually anywhere - in air, water, plants, animals and humans. A Germ is a microorganism that causes disease. Germs are also known as pathogens.</li>

                                    <p>Are everywhere. They live in sub-freezing cold temperatures and boiling hot temperatures. They live up high in the sky and down deep below the ocean. In fact scientists have found colonies of bacteria thriving 1,600 feet below sea level without oxygen or sunlight. Scientists also think there are signs of microbial life on Mars! Some bacteria are harmful but most are harmless or even helpful.</p>

                                    <p>Depend upon a host to survive, grow, and reproduce. A host is the plant or animal on which or in which another organism lives. Viruses can't live outside of other living cells. Once they are inside the body, viruses can spread and make people sick. They reproduce by injecting their genes into a cell to produce thousands of new viruses. Viruses cause chicken pox, measles, flu, and many other diseases.</p>

Instead, fungi get their nutrition from plants, food, and animals. Fungi thrive in warm, damp environments. Most fungi are not dangerous. An example of something caused by fungi is athlete's foot - that itchy rash that teens and adults sometimes get between their toes.</p>

                            <p>After an agent exists its natural reservoir, it may be transmitted to a susceptible host in numerous ways. These modes of transmission are classified as:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Direct (Direct contact and direct spread)</strong> - There is immediate transfer of the agent from a reservoir to a susceptible host by direct contact or droplet spread. It occurs through kissing, skin-to-skin contact. Also refer to contact with soil or vegetation harboring infectious organisms</li>
                                <li><strong>Indirect (Airborne, Vehicle borne, Vector borne)</strong> – This can be mechanical or biologic. An agent is carried from a reservoir (a susceptible host) by suspended air particles or by animate (vector) or inanimate (vehicle) intermediaries. Most vectors are arthropods such as mosquitoes, fleas and ticks. This is in contrast of instances in which an agent undergoes part of its life cycle inside a vector before being transmitted to a new host. When the agent undergoes changes within the vector, the vector is serving as both intermediate host and a mode of transmission. This type of direct transmission is called a biologic transmission</li>
                                <li>Vehicles that may directly transmit an agent include food, water, blood, handkerchiefs, bedding etc</li>
