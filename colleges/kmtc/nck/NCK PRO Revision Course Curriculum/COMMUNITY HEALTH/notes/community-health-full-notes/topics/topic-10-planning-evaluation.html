                                <li>As the community group reviews different types of data, it develops criteria for determining priorities within the data. For example, as members review mortality data, they might consider something a priority if:

                            <p>Most communities do not have the resources to address all of their health problems and target groups at once. They must set priorities and plan to address some problems initially and others over time. We recommend that the community group select only one or a limited number of health problems to better focus resources in a comprehensive manner. The following are priority setting techniques:</p>

                                    <strong>Problem/Preference Ranking</strong>
                                    <p>Is a participatory technique that allows analyzing and identifying problems or preferences stakeholder share in order to implement adequate improvements and solutions in their community and area. First, the stakeholders have to decide which the most important problems they face in their community are. Afterwards, the participants have to rank these problems/preferences in regards to their importance. The result of this method provides the starting base for discussions on possible solutions to the priority problems.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Pairwise Ranking</strong>
                                    <p>A more systematic technique is called "pairwise ranking" and uses cards to represent the different problems. The facilitator shows the "problem cards", two at a time, each time asking, "Which is the bigger problem?" As the participants make the comparisons, the results are recorded in a matrix.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The criteria attached to make up a choice are used to consider in the community action plan. Community action plans are developed on the basis of people's preferences. The problems, solutions technical inputs are arranged on the interests of the users.</p>

                            <p>When examining priority behavioral risk factors, you might consider the following:</p>

                            <p>Many community groups find it helpful to use the nominal group process or other techniques to identify the top three to five health problems. These three to five problems are then analyzed further to determine which to address first. Some issues to consider when ranking problems include:</p>

                            <p>Goal setting involves establishing specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-targeted (S.M.A.R.T) goals. Setting goals helps people work towards their own objectives. Goal setting features as a major component of personal development literature.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li><strong>Specific</strong> - When setting goals, they should answer the highly specific questions of who, what, where, when, and why.</li>
                                <li><strong>Measurable</strong> - In order for us to track our progress, goals should be quantifiable.</li>
                                <li><strong>Attainable</strong> - It is important to evaluate your situation honestly and recognize which goals are realistic, and which are a little far-fetched.</li>
                                <li><strong>Relevant</strong> - Is this goal relevant to your life? Does this match my needs?</li>
                                <li><strong>Time-related</strong> - Setting a "due date" to meet goals not only keeps you on track, but it prevents pesky daily roadblocks from getting in the way.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>It takes time for a change to become an established habit</li>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li><strong>Think about the "big picture."</strong> - Ask yourself some important questions about what you want for your life.</li>
                                <li><strong>Break the "big picture" down into smaller and more specific goals</strong> - Consider areas of your life that you either want to change or that you feel you would like to develop with time. Begin to ask yourself specific questions about what you'd like to achieve in each area and how you would like to approach it within a five year timeframe.</li>
                                <li><strong>Make each goal a positive statement</strong> - Using positive statements is a direct way to affirm your commitment to completing your goals.</li>
                                <li><strong>Set priorities</strong> - At any given moment, you have a number of goals all in different states of completion. Deciding which goals are more important, or time-sensitive, than others is crucial. If you have a college interview scheduled on the same day as a training session for your big half-marathon, the interview would take precedent as it is far more time-sensitive, and probably more important.</li>
                                <li><strong>Keep track of your progress</strong> - Journaling is a great way to keep track of both personal and professional progress. Checking in and acknowledging the progress made towards a certain goal is key to staying motivated.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reward your accomplishments</strong> - Acknowledge when you have reached goals and allow yourself to celebrate accordingly.</li>

                                <li>Goals are broad, abstract statements of intent that help create a vision of what you are striving to accomplish.</li>
                                <li>Objectives are measurable, specific statements that lead toward program goals and define what change the community will try to achieve.</li>

                            <p>Each objective should answer these questions:</p>

                            <p>Community health planning uses two types of objectives to clarify community goals:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Behavioral objectives</strong>—for the leading behaviors that contribute to death or disability and are the focus of the intervention</li>
                                <li><strong>Intervention objectives</strong>—for the interventions you wish to undertake</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Behavioral objectives refer to those behavioral risk factors that contribute to the cause of death specified in your community goals.</p>
                            <p>The intervention objectives refer to the intervention activities you plan to undertake.</p>
                            <p>The community goal is more general, the behavioral objectives are more specific, and the intervention objectives the most specific. Using the above example, the hierarchy of objectives would include the following:</p>

                                <li>By 2000, the prevalence of physically inactive adults in our county will be reduced by 15%, from 38% (1994 BRFSS data) to 32%.</li>

                                <li>By January 1996, the rate of onset of smoking among county school students, grades 6-9, will be reduced by 20% from 158/1,000 (1993 YRBS data) to 128/1,000.</li>
                                <li>By January 1995, the county school board will set policy that allows the community to use school playing fields for evening and weekend recreational activities.</li>

Phases can be repeated as new health priorities are identified, new target groups are selected, or new interventions are developed. The activities within phases may overlap as the process is carried out. Each of the five phases that constitute plan is described hereafter.</p>

                                    <p>During this phase, objectives related to the health priorities are set. The health priorities to be addressed initially are selected.</p>

                                    <p>Evaluation is an integral part of the planning process. It is ongoing and serves two purposes: to monitor and assess progress during the five phases of planning and to evaluate interventions.

                            <p><strong>Outcome indicators</strong> – are long terms effects as a result of the outputs. Outcome evaluations examine the results of a program (intended or unintended) to determine the reasons why there are differences between the outcomes and the program's stated goals and objectives. Outcome measurement is a systematic way to assess the extent to which a program has achieved its intended outcomes. It helps understand whether the program is effective or not.</p>
