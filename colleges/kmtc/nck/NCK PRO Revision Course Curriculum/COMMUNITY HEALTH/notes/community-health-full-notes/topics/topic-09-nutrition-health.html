                                    <p>Nutrition is the intake of food, considered in relation to the body's dietary needs. Good nutrition is an adequate, well balanced diet combined with regular physical activity. It is the cornerstone of good health. Poor nutrition can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity. Eating well is important for everyone's health and wellbeing and is vital for preventing chronic disease in later life.</p>

It is a cause and consequence of ill health across many groups; however, older people tend to be more vulnerable to this condition, which can severely impact on health outcomes and quality of life.</p>

People tend to have supplementary feeds in between the main meals. Children are required to be fed every time according to their demand. Food intake is influenced by income, appetite, exposure to food and social status.</li>
                                <li><strong>Dietary nutrients</strong> – Our body requires essential dietary nutrients for its normal function. The nutrient requirements are: Carbohydrates, Proteins, Water, Vitamins, and Minerals. Essential nutrient are substance that must be obtained from the diet because the body cannot make it in sufficient quantity to meet its needs. In establishing dietary requirements the goal is to determine what amount is high enough, if ingested routinely, to prevent impairment of health even if intake becomes inadequate for a short period</li>

                                    <p>Starting early with breastfeeding and providing good nutrition for children gives the best start to a healthy life. Good nutrition in pregnancy is essential for keeping a developing baby and mother healthy. Breastfeeding is the natural way to feed babies. Breastfeeding is extremely important for the health outcomes of infants and their mother. Not breastfeeding is associated with adverse health outcomes for both mothers and infants, ranging from infectious illness to chronic diseases later in life. Solids should be introduced at around six months of age when the infant is developmentally ready. For young children, a healthy diet is required for optimal growth and development. It can also help to improve concentration, fight illnesses, and prevent long term health complications.</p>

                            <p>Growth failure malnutrition, as the name suggests, is the failure of an individual to grow as expected in stature or weight, according to his/her age and gender. Growth failure malnutrition can take three serious types:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">

                                    <p>Arises out of sudden, drastic weight loss. It leads to three clinical malnutrition types:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li><strong>Marasmus:</strong> this occurs when body fat and tissues degenerate at an alarming rate to compensate for the lack of nutrients. As a result, the body’s internal processes begin to slow down alarmingly fast as does the activity of the immune system.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Kwashiorkor:</strong> this is characterized by bilateral pitting oedema (fluid retention) in the legs and feet. As a result, the under-nourished child may actually look plump.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Marasmic-kwashiorkor:</strong> This is characterized by both severe wasting and oedema.</li>

                                    <p>Happens over a long period of time and has more long-lasting consequences. It begins before birth due to poor maternal health and leads to stunted growth in an otherwise normally proportioned child. Poor breast feeding, infections and lack of availability of proper nutrients are the main causes behind it. Stunting is dangerous because it becomes irreversible after an age. Therefore, it becomes important to nip it in the bud by providing proper medical treatment to pregnant women and young girls.</p>

                            <p>Micronutrient malnutrition implies a moderate to severe lack of Vitamins A, B, C and D, Calcium, Folate, Iodine, Iron, Zinc and Selenium.

                                <li><strong>Vitamin D deficiency</strong> causes rickets and other bone development related disorders.</li>

                                <li><strong>Poor diet</strong> - if a person does not eat enough food, or if what they eat does not provide them with the nutrients they require for good health, they suffer from malnutrition. Poor diet may be caused by one of several different factors. If the patient develops dysphagia (swallowing difficulties) because of an illness, or when recovering from an illness, they may not be able to consume enough of the right nutrients.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mental health problems</strong> - some patients with mental health conditions, such as depression, may develop eating habits which lead to malnutrition. Patients with anorexia nervosa or bulimia may develop malnutrition because they are ingesting too little food.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mobility problems</strong> - people with mobility problems may suffer from malnutrition simply because they either cannot get out enough to buy foods, or find preparing them too arduous.</li>
                                <li><strong>Digestive disorders and stomach conditions</strong> - some people may eat properly, but their bodies cannot absorb the nutrients they need for good health.</li>
                                <li><strong>Alcoholism</strong> - this is a chronic (long-term) disease. Individuals who suffer from alcoholism can develop gastritis, or pancreas damage. These problems also seriously undermine the body's ability to digest food, absorb certain vitamins, and produce hormones which regulate metabolism. Alcohol contains calories, reducing the patient's feeling of hunger, so he/she consequently may not eat enough proper food to supply the body with essential nutrients.</li>
                                <li><strong>Food shortage, price and distribution</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>Lack of breastfeeding</strong></li>

                            <p>Malnourished children experience developmental delays, weight-loss and illness as a result of inadequate intake of protein, calories and other nutrients. Because orphaned and institutionalized children may experience one or several macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies, they are at risk for a variety of short-term and long-term complications:</p>

                            <p>Because so much development occurs in the first few years of life, nutrient deficiencies can have major short-term implications in young children.</p>

                                    <p>Malnourishment can greatly compromise a child's immune system, making them more susceptible to infectious diseases. Particularly in institutions where there are poor sanitary practices, children are vulnerable to infections from other children or caregivers.</p>

                                    <strong>Growth Implications</strong>
                                    <p>A child may contract an infection due to poor nutritional status. In turn, a gastrointestinal infection places the child at even greater risk for nutrient deficiencies because nutrients are unable to be absorbed properly. Consequently, nutrient deficiency combined with infection can cause growth retardation.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, a deficiency in one nutrient may lead to a deficiency in another nutrient. For example, deficiencies in iron, magnesium and zinc can cause anorexia and thereby result in reduced intake of other important nutrients such as protein. Low lipid intake can also affect the absorption of important fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A and Zinc and protein deficiencies can retard bone growth and development, putting a child at risk for long-term complications.</p>
