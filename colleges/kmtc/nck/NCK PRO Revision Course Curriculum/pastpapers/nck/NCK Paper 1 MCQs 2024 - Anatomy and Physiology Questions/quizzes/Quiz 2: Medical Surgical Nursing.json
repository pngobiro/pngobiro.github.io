    {
      "id": "q26",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is experiencing respiratory distress. Which nursing intervention is the priority for managing the patient's respiratory status?",
      "points": 10,

        { "id": "d", "text": "Administering oxygen therapy", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Positioning is the priority independent nursing action. High Fowler's position allows for maximum chest expansion and diaphragmatic excursion, providing immediate mechanical relief for breathing. Medications require orders or time to work.",
      "hint": "Think about mechanical interventions that maximize lung expansion immediately."
    },
    {
      "id": "q27",
      "type": "multiple-choice",

      "explanation": "Symptomatic hypocalcemia (tetany, laryngospasm risk) is a medical emergency post-thyroidectomy. The nurse must notify the provider immediately to obtain an order for IV Calcium Gluconate.",
      "hint": "This is a potential airway emergency requiring immediate medical intervention."
    },
    {
      "id": "q28",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Administering oral antibiotics prophylactically", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "A sterile dressing acts as a barrier against environmental pathogens, maintaining a clean wound bed. Debridement is a specialized procedure, not routine nursing preventative care.",
      "hint": "Think about the primary way to block environmental pathogens from entering a wound."
    },
    {
      "id": "q30",

      ],
      "explanation": "Patients with CKD must avoid foods high in phosphorus. Cheese/dairy, whole grains/nuts, and peanut butter are high in phosphorus. White meat like chicken breast is a lower phosphorus protein choice.",
      "hint": "Dairy, nuts, and whole grains are typically high in phosphorus."
    },
    {
      "id": "q33",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient with a history of peptic ulcer disease is prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for ulcer healing. Which information is important for the nurse to include in patient education about PPI therapy?",

      "explanation": "Proper MDI technique involves a slow, deep inhalation to carry the medication deep into the lungs rather than impacting the throat. While other steps are involved, the coordination of actuation and inhalation is critical.",
      "hint": "How should the patient breathe in to ensure the mist reaches the lower airways?"
    },
    {
      "id": "q35",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is prescribed insulin glargine (Lantus) once daily. Which statement indicates understanding of insulin glargine administration?",
