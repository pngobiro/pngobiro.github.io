    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient presents with muscle weakness and fatigue. Upon further examination, it is revealed that the patient has decreased acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this presentation?",
      "points": 10,
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Myasthenia gravis", "isCorrect": true },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)", "isCorrect": false },

        { "id": "d", "text": "Muscular dystrophy", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of antibodies that block or destroy acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This prevents proper muscle contraction, leading to weakness and fatigue that worsens with activity.",
      "hint": "This is an autoimmune disorder specifically affecting the neuromuscular junction receptors."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Following a severe traumatic brain injury, a patient is experiencing alterations in consciousness characterized by periods of wakefulness but with no meaningful interaction with the environment. Which term best describes this state?",
      "points": 10,
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Coma", "isCorrect": false },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Vegetative state", "isCorrect": true },

        { "id": "d", "text": "Locked-in syndrome", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "A vegetative state is defined as wakefulness without awareness. The patient may have sleep-wake cycles and open their eyes (wakefulness), but lacks cognitive function or meaningful interaction with the environment (awareness).",
      "hint": "Think about the distinction between being 'awake' (eyes open) and being 'aware' (cognition)."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "In response to chronic hypoxia, which physiological adaptation occurs in the body to increase oxygen delivery to tissues?",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Decreased ventilation rate", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The body compensates for hypoxia by attempting to deliver more blood to tissues per minute. While the primary long-term adaptation is increased red blood cell production (Polycythemia) driven by increased erythropoietin, increased cardiac output is a correct compensatory mechanism among the choices provided.",
      "hint": "Consider how the heart compensates for low oxygen carrying capacity."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents with increased dyspnea and cough productive of purulent sputum. On auscultation, coarse crackles are heard bilaterally. Which complication of COPD is the patient most likely experiencing?",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Pleural effusion", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "An Acute Exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is characterized by a worsening of respiratory symptoms, specifically increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, and sputum purulence (The Winnipeg Criteria). The presence of purulent sputum suggests an infectious trigger.",
      "hint": "Look for the worsening of baseline symptoms like increased sputum and dyspnea."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient with a spinal cord injury at the level of T6 presents with hypotension, bradycardia, and diaphoresis following a sudden change in position from supine to sitting. Which condition is the patient most likely experiencing?",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Orthostatic hypotension", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "The key trigger here is the 'sudden change in position.' Patients with spinal cord injuries often lack the sympathetic tone required to vasoconstrict peripheral vessels when standing up, leading to a drop in blood pressure. Autonomic dysreflexia usually presents with hypertension.",
      "hint": "Focus on the trigger: 'sudden change in position'."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "type": "multiple-choice",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Decreased renal excretion of bicarbonate ions", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "In metabolic acidosis, the lungs compensate by increasing the respiratory rate (hyperventilation/Kussmaul breathing) to blow off CO2 (an acid). The kidneys are the cause of the problem in CKD, so they cannot effectively compensate.",
      "hint": "When the kidneys fail (metabolic issue), which organ system steps in to compensate?"
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient presents with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia. Laboratory tests reveal hyperglycemia and glycosuria. Which type of diabetes mellitus is the patient most likely experiencing?",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "While the '3 Ps' (Polyuria, Polydipsia, Polyphagia) occur in both types, they are the classic abrupt presentation of Type 1 Diabetes (along with weight loss). Type 2 is often asymptomatic or gradual.",
      "hint": "This triad of symptoms (3 Ps) appearing significantly is the textbook presentation for insulin-dependent diabetes."
    },
    {
      "id": "q8",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient with a history of chronic liver disease presents with jaundice, ascites, and spider angiomas. Laboratory tests reveal elevated serum bilirubin levels, prolonged prothrombin time, and hypoalbuminemia. Which condition is the patient most likely experiencing?",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Acute liver failure", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The constellation of symptoms (spider angiomas, ascites, jaundice) combined with lab findings (low albumin, high bilirubin, prolonged PT) indicates decompensated chronic liver disease, which defines Cirrhosis.",
      "hint": "The symptoms describe end-stage scarring of the liver."

      "id": "q9",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is prescribed albuterol (salbutamol) inhaler as a rescue medication. Which of the following best describes the pharmacological action of albuterol?",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Methylxanthine", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Albuterol is a Short-Acting Beta Agonist (SABA). It stimulates beta-2 receptors in the smooth muscle of the airways, causing bronchodilation.",
      "hint": "It stimulates the sympathetic nervous system receptors in the lungs."
    },
    {
      "id": "q10",
      "type": "multiple-choice",

      ],
      "explanation": "Furosemide is a loop diuretic that inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the loop of Henle. This action significantly increases the excretion of potassium, placing the patient at high risk for hypokalemia.",
      "hint": "Loop diuretics are known as 'potassium-wasting' diuretics."
    },
    {
      "id": "q11",

      ],
      "explanation": "ESAs stimulate red blood cell production. They must be monitored closely to ensure Hemoglobin does not rise too high (usually >11-12 g/dL), as this increases the risk of stroke, thrombosis, and hypertension.",
      "hint": "Think about the primary effect of erythropoietin on blood cells."
    },

    },
    {
      "id": "q15",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
