    {

      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient presents with sudden-onset, painless vision loss in the right eye. Fundoscopic examination reveals a cherry-red spot at the macula and attenuated retinal vessels. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this presentation?",
      "points": 10,
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Central retinal artery occlusion", "isCorrect": true },

        { "id": "d", "text": "Acute angle-closure glaucoma", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The 'cherry-red spot' is the classic sign of Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO). The retina becomes pale due to ischemia (edema), but the macula remains red because it receives blood supply from the choroid.",
      "hint": "The pale retina contrasts with the red fovea in this ischemic event."

      "id": "q202",
      "type": "multiple-choice",

      ],
      "explanation": "Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is characterized by a gradual, painless increase in IOP leading to optic nerve damage and peripheral visual field loss ('tunnel vision').",
      "hint": "This is often called the 'silent thief of sight' because it is painless."

    {
      "id": "q203",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient presents with redness, pain, and photophobia in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination reveals ciliary injection, corneal edema, and a mid-dilated pupil with fixed reaction to light. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for this presentation?",

      "explanation": "This is a classic medical emergency. The 'steamy cornea' is due to corneal edema from high pressure. The systemic symptoms (nausea/vomiting) are triggered by the intense pain and vagal stimulation.",
