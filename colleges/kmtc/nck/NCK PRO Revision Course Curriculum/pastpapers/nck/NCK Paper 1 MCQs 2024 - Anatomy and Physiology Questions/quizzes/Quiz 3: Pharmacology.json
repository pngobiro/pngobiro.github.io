      "question": "A patient is prescribed a beta-blocker for the management of hypertension. Which adverse effect should the nurse monitor closely in the patient?",
      "points": 10,
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Bradycardia", "isCorrect": true },

        { "id": "d", "text": "Tachycardia", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Beta-blockers work by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, which decreases heart rate and myocardial contractility. A heart rate below 60 bpm (bradycardia) is a direct therapeutic extension and a common adverse effect requiring monitoring.",
      "hint": "The drug's mechanism 'blocks' the stimulation that speeds up the heart."
    },
    {
      "id": "q52",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "A patient is prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for heart failure. Which laboratory parameter should the nurse monitor closely during ACE inhibitor therapy?",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Serum creatinine levels", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "ACE inhibitors reduce Aldosterone secretion. Since Aldosterone normally excretes potassium, blocking it causes potassium retention, leading to a risk of Hyperkalemia.",
      "hint": "Aldosterone inhibition leads to the retention of this electrolyte."

      ],
      "explanation": "Loop diuretics inhibit the reabsorption of sodium and chloride, causing significant excretion of Potassium along with Sodium and water. Hypokalemia is the most frequent and clinically significant electrolyte imbalance.",
      "hint": "Loop diuretics are 'potassium-wasting'."
