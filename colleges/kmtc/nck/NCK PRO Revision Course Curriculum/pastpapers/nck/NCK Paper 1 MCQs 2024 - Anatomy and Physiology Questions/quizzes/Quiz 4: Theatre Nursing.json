        { "id": "d", "text": "Assess the patient's respiratory status", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "In the operating room, airway and breathing management is primarily the responsibility of the anesthesia provider. The circulating nurse's priority is to communicate the critical change to the team immediately so the expert (anesthesiologist) can assess the cause and intervene.",
      "hint": "In the OR, the anesthesia provider manages the airway, but the nurse must alert the team to changes."
    },
    {
      "id": "q77",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Before transferring the patient to the operating room (OR), the nurse notices a discrepancy between the surgical consent form and the planned procedure. What should the nurse do?",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Document the discrepancy in the patient's chart", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "This is a 'Stop the Line' moment. Informed consent is a legal requirement. The procedure cannot proceed until the discrepancy is resolved. The surgeon is responsible for obtaining consent and clarifying the procedure.",
      "hint": "The person performing the surgery is responsible for the consent validity."

      "explanation": "While all information is relevant, details about complications (e.g., hemorrhage, difficult airway) and interventions (e.g., fluids given, packing left in) are critical for immediate safety monitoring in the PACU.",
      "hint": "The PACU nurse needs to know what went wrong or changed during surgery to anticipate problems."

        { "id": "d", "text": "Continue with the surgical procedure as scheduled", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Safety first. The anesthesia provider needs to be aware so they can secure a working machine or postpone induction. The nurse facilitates this, but communication is step one.",
      "hint": "The person who uses the machine needs to know it's broken before the patient arrives."
    },
    {
      "id": "q84",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "During surgery, the nurse notices a discrepancy between the surgical count and the number of instruments on the sterile field. What should the nurse do?",
