      "question": "A nurse is preparing to perform a tracheostomy tube change for a patient. What action should the nurse prioritize to ensure patient safety during the procedure?",
      "points": 10,
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Using sterile technique during the tube change", "isCorrect": true },
