                                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C</p>
                                    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Community empowerment emphasizes active participation and ownership by the target population. Organizing youth forums allows adolescents to be actively involved in discussing and determining solutions for their own health issues. While providing resources or education is helpful, empowerment focuses on enabling people to make informed choices, enhancing long-term outcomes.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Addressing undernutrition in the presence of sufficient food requires more than just nutritional advice—it involves analyzing the interplay of knowledge, beliefs, and social factors. Assessing the caregiver’s understanding and cultural practices provides insight into behavioral patterns that might hinder proper feeding, aligning with a more holistic and synthesized intervention.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Integrating community participation involves empowering local members to take responsibility for health initiatives. Training local volunteers to lead education fosters sustainability, ownership, and relevance. While policies and resources are important, participatory approaches have shown greater success in maintaining behavior change in rural settings.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Long-term transformation is evident when the community sustains and owns health initiatives independently. While attendance and short-term outcomes show engagement, community-led continuation signals empowerment and internalization of health practices.

                                    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Gaining trust in a previously neglected community requires leveraging respected local structures and leadership. Involving leaders in planning and dialogue demonstrates respect for local knowledge and promotes ownership, which is more sustainable than temporary incentives or services.
