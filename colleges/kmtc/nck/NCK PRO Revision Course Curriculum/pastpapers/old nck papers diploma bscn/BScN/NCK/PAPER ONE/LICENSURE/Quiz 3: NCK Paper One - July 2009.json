        { "id": "d", "text": "Lumbar arteries", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The abdominal aorta terminates by bifurcating into the left and right Common Iliac Arteries at the level of the L4 vertebra. These subsequently divide into internal and external iliacs.",
      "hint": "It splits into two main branches named 'common' before splitting further."

        { "id": "d", "text": "Metabolic disorders, poor nutrition, tuberculosis", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Failure to thrive is classified as Organic (medical/physical causes) or Non-organic (psychosocial/environmental). Option B contains only medical conditions. Options A, C, and D contain non-organic factors like 'lack of active feeding', 'emotional deprivation', and 'poor nutrition'.",

      ],
      "explanation": "Indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin is a byproduct of heme breakdown. Elevated levels usually indicate excessive destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis) which overwhelms the liver's conjugation capacity.",
      "hint": "This substance comes from the breakdown of RBCs."

      "id": "q4",

        { "id": "d", "text": "100 - 200 mg twice daily", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The classic dosing for immediate-release Nitrofurantoin is 50-100 mg QID (four times daily). Sustained release formulations (Macrodantin) may be dosed BID.",
      "hint": "It is typically taken with meals, four times a day."

        { "id": "d", "text": "The tube does not get entangled in the naso-pharynx", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Swallowing triggers the laryngeal elevation and epiglottic closure, blocking the airway and opening the esophageal sphincter, allowing the tube to pass into the GI tract rather than the lungs.",
      "hint": "Think about the anatomy of the throat and protection of the airway."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the appropriate nursing intervention for a patient with 'ineffective airway clearance related to weak cough'?",

        { "id": "d", "text": "Suction the patient's airway", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "For a 'weak cough', the priority is to improve the cough mechanism itself through teaching techniques like splinting or huff coughing. Suctioning is a secondary measure if the patient cannot clear secretions independently.",
      "hint": "Address the specific problem ('weak cough') with a skill-based intervention."

      ],
      "explanation": "Bell's Palsy presents with sudden unilateral facial weakness. Pain behind the ear (mastoid) often precedes it. Hyperacusis (sounds seeming louder) occurs on the AFFECTED side, not the unaffected side.",
      "hint": "Onset is usually rapid, not insidious."

      ],
      "explanation": "The nurse must identify painful areas first to examine them LAST. Palpating a painful area first causes muscle guarding, which interferes with the rest of the examination.",
      "hint": "You want to avoid causing pain at the beginning of the exam."

      ],
      "explanation": "Systemic chemotherapy is standard for node-positive breast cancer to treat micrometastases and reduce recurrence risk, regardless of menopausal status.",
