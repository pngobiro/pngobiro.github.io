        { "id": "d", "text": "18 weeks.", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "Quickening is the first perception of fetal movement by the mother. In a multipara, this is typically felt earlier, around 16-18 weeks. In a primigravida, it is usually felt around 18-20 weeks.",
      "hint": "Multiparas feel movement earlier than first-time mothers because they recognize the sensation."

      ],
      "explanation": "Antenatal exercises aim to promote relaxation (essential for labor management) and improve posture (to relieve backache).",
      "hint": "Think about what helps most during labor pain and carrying the pregnancy weight."

      ],
      "explanation": "PPH management requires rapid volume replacement. A large-bore cannula is needed. The gauge number is inverse to size, so 16G (grey) is larger than 18, 20, or 22.",
      "hint": "For rapid fluid resuscitation, you need the widest needle (lowest number)."
