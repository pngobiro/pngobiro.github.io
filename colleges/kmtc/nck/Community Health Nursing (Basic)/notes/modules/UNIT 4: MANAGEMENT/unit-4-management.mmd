\section*{SECTION 1: THE CONCEPT OF MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Introduction}

During the course of your practice as a nurse and in your day to day life, you have come across some aspects of management even though you may not have been aware of it. This section will introduce you to the concept of management and briefly describe the developments in some of the management theories which have influenced health and nursing management practice.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- Describe the meaning of management.
- Describe different approaches to the definition of management.
- Describe the importance of studying management.
- Describe the main approaches to the study of organisation's structure and management.
- Describe the historical development of management.
- Describe how management theories apply to nursing practice.

\section*{Definitions of Management}

\section*{Different Approaches to the Definition of Management}

Management may be viewed as:
- A social position
- A function
- The people who discharge it
- An authority
- A discipline
- A field of study

Different writers have defined management in various ways. The common definitions are listed below.
Management is:
- The people charged with the responsibility of running an organisation, for example, the management of Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH).
- The process by which resources are mobilised, combined and coordinated effectively to achieve organisational objectives.
- Getting things done.
- Getting work done through the efforts of other people.That is:
1. People are the most important means or resource for getting things done.
2. People must work, performing certain activities and tasks to reach certain ends or objectives.
3. Managers are judged not just on their performance but on the results achieved by their subordinates.
- The efficient use of resources.
- Getting people to work harmoniously together, that is, careful balancing of resources and where everyone knows what they are supposed to do.
- Making a decision, that is, making a choice between two or more courses of action, around an act (what), quantity, quality or authority needed.
- The process of achieving organisational effectiveness within a changing environment by balancing efficiency, effectiveness and equity thereby obtaining the most from limited resources and working with and through other people.

The definition of management is based on two main principles:
- The first principle lays emphasis on people, who are the most important resource in any organisation.
- The second principle emphasises a commitment to the achievement of organisational goals. This is the primary task of management.
Management is active and involves changing behaviour and making things happen, It is also an everyday activity involving interactions between people that are not unrelated or entirely dissimilar to other spheres of life.
It can be regarded as:
- Taking place within a structured organisational setting and with prescribed roles
- Directed towards the attainment of aims and objectives
- Achieved through the efforts of other people
- Using systems and procedures

\section*{Why Study Management?}
- To learn what leading writers say about management.
- To understand the interrelationship between development of theory and management practice.
- To understand the principles underlying the process of management.

\section*{Management Theories}

Management theories describe how managers conduct activities, and keep institutions operating in an effective way in order to meet their objectives. The different approaches used by managers have gone through an evolutionary process. In practice, no single approach will be sufficient. Most managers use a combination of approaches to create effectiveness within the organisation. The four main classifications are:
- Classical Theories (Scientific Management)
- Human Relations or Behavioural Approach Theories
- Systems Theories
- Contingency Theories

The theories outlined above are covered in the pages that follow.

\section*{Classical Theories}

Classical theories, also known as the scientific approach to management started in the later part of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The approach relied on systematic information collection, analysis and identification of causes and effects, followed by effective organisation of management structure.
The objective was to develop basic principles that could guide the design, creation and maintenance of organisations. The emphasis was on efficiency and effectiveness. Some of the prominent figures that may be identified with the classical school of thought are:
- Frederic W. Taylor
- Henri Fayol
- Max Weber

\section*{Frederic W. Taylor}

Frederic W. Taylor, an engineer, was instrumental in conducting research on methods of training workers for increased production. He believed in the principle 'best management is a true science'.

According to Taylor the objective of management is to secure the maximum prosperity for the employer, as well as each employee. Taylor's system for work improvement consisted of the following steps:
- Observing the workers' performance through time and motion to determine the best way to carry out each task.
- Scientifically selecting the best worker to perform each job, that is, the person with the characteristics and abilities needed to carry out tasks efficiently.
- Training the selected worker to perform tasks in the most efficient manner.
- Appointing a few highly skilled workers in managerial positions.

Most of the views expressed by Taylor can be, and are, applied in nursing, where our aim is to recruit the best qualified workers, train them and appoint them to precise specialised positions.

\section*{Henri Fayol}

Henri Fayol came up with the functions of a manager, which he identified as planning, organising, coordinating and controlling.
He also identified a set of fourteen principles which managers might apply as they perform their duties. Some of these include the division of labour and specialisation, chain of command, centralisation and responsibility. These will be covered in

\section*{Max Weber}

Max Weber advocated bureaucracy as the ideal form of organisation for a complex institution. He described bureaucracy as having a well defined hierarchy of authority, pyramidal in shape, division of labour based on specialisation and highly specific rules governing employers' duties and rights. He claimed that bureaucracy was superior because it provided stability and reliability in controlling employees.

Although Weber meant well, the term bureaucracy implies slowness and inefficiency in today's
society. Bureaucracies are often seen as too rigid to respond to current and rapid changes in the society.

\section*{Human Relations or Behavioural Approach Theories}

This is the second set of management theories. These differ from scientific theories in that they focus on the use of people as a support service to machines. They also see economic forces as motivators of human performance. The behavioural approach focuses on the manner in which managers interact with subordinates. It is based on an analysis of the relationship between human factors and productivity. Besides meeting the economic goals of the organisation, the managers must try to improve the social and psychological needs of workers, which in turn improve productivity. The following is a brief overview of four of these theories which may be applied in health care institutions.
- Abraham Maslow's Theory
- Douglas McGregor: Theory x and Theory y
- Vroom's Expectancy Theory
- Fredrick Herzberg's Two Factor Theory

\section*{Abraham Maslow's Theory}

According to Maslow's theory, every human being has basic needs. People are motivated by the desire to satisfy these needs. Once a need is satisfied it ceases to be a motivator. As one need is satisfied, another appears and takes its place, and the individual is then motivated to satisfy the new need.
The theory also assumes that a person can satisfy one need at a time.
Maslow, a psychologist, developed the hierarchy of needs with the physiological needs at the bottom, which the individuals must satisfy before realising higher level needs. Maslow visualised needs as arranged in hierarchical order starting with basic needs, progressing to higher needs depending on the individual.
There are more people at the base of the triangle still trying to satisfy the basic needs and fewer people were on the higher subsequent levels. Only a small percentage of people can reach the top of the hierarchy.
The various needs can be further defined as follows:
- Physiological needs are those needs that are required for survival.These include food, oxygen and sleep, sex and rest.
- Safety needs refer to the need for job security, shelter and a stable environment.
- Love and belonging indicate a need for affectionate relations with others as well as the need to belong to a group.
- Self esteem refers to the need for self respect and recognition. At this stage people strive for power, achievement and status.
- Self actualisation is a need for self fulfilment and is the culmination of all other needs.

People at work experience a variety of needs. Managers should identify ways in which to meet group or individual needs in order to motivate them to work. It is the responsibility of the manager to enable employees to fulfil their needs.

\section*{Douglas McGregor: Theory X and Theory Y}

McGregor's theory ' X ' and ' Y ' are a set of management assumptions about the behaviour of subordinates. He noted that most managers make these assumptions about their employees. The first sets of assumption are known as Theory ' X ' they include:
- An average human being has an inherent dislike for work and will avoid it if possible.
- As a result of the assumption above, most people must be coerced, controlled, directed and threatened with punishment in order to produce.
- The average human being has to be closely directed, wishes to avoid responsibility and only wants security.
The second set of assumptions known as Theory ' Y ' regard people in a more favourable way. They state that:
- Employees like work, which is as natural as rest or play.
- Human beings do not have to be controlled or coerced as long as commitment to the organisation is present.
- Under proper conditions, they will not only accept but also seek responsibility.
Theory ' X ' and Theory ' Y ' concern the attitudes management has towards the employee. The manager holding Theory X assumptions tends to be tough, authoritarian and supports tight controls with punishments. As a result, they tend to supervise workers very closely.
On the other hand, the manager using Theory Y believes in self control, is democratic, and consults staff. They encourage participation in decision making by subordinates. Generally a blend between 'Theory X ' and 'Theory Y ' is more likely to provide effective management although this also depends on the prevailing environmental conditions.

\section*{Vroom's Expectancy Theory}

This theory of motivation was put forward by Victor Vroom. It examines motivation from the perspective of why people choose to follow a particular course of action.
Vroom introduces three variables. These are:

\section*{Valence}

This is the importance that the individual places upon the expected outcome of a situation.

\section*{Expectancy}

This is the belief that output from the individual and the success of the situation are linked, for example, if I work harder then the outcome will be better.

\section*{Instrumentality}

This is the belief that the success of the situation is linked to the expected outcome of the situation, for example, it's gone really well, so I'd expect praise.
At first glance, this theory would seem most applicable to a traditional attitude work situation where the level of motivation depends on whether the employee wants the reward on offer for doing a good job and whether they believe more effort will lead to that reward.
However, it could equally apply to any situation where someone does something because they expect a certain outcome. For example, I recycle paper because I think it is important to conserve resources and take a stand on environmental issues (valence), I think that the more effort I put into recycling, the more paper I will recycle (expectancy) and I think that the more paper I recycle, the less resources will be used (instrumentality).

\section*{Fredrick Herzberg's Two Factor Theory}

Frederick Herzberg proposed a theory of motivation based on the idea that some factors motivate and some demotivate. He called this theory the 'Two Factor Theory'. According to Frederick Herzberg, these factors fall into two categories. These are:

\section*{Two Factor Theory - Hertzberg}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-08.jpg?height=348&width=768&top_left_y=1642&top_left_x=260)

\section*{Hygiene Factors}

Hygiene factors are needed to ensure an employee does not become dissatisfied. They do not lead to higher levels of motivation, but without them there is dissatisfaction. Typical hygiene factors are:
- Interpersonal relationships
- Work conditions
- Salary
- Status
- Security

\section*{Motivation Factors}

Motivation factors are needed in order to motivate an employee into higher performance.
These include:
- Achievement
- Growth
- Responsibility for task
- Interest in the job

According to Herzberg, merging the hygiene and motivation factors results in four scenarios:

\section*{High Hygiene + High Motivation}

This is the ideal scenario where employees are highly motivated and have few complaints.

\section*{High Hygiene + Low Motivation}

In this scenario, employees have few complaints but are not highly motivated. The job is perceived as a pay check.

\section*{Low Hygiene + High Motivation}

In this scenario, employees are motivated but have a lot of complaints. This is a situation where the job is exciting and challenging but salaries and work conditions are not up to par.

\section*{Low Hygiene + Low Motivation}

This is the worst situation where employees are unmotivated and have lots of complaints.

\section*{Systems Theory}

The third management theory is known as the systems theory.
Unlike the previous theories you have covered, this theory places an emphasis on organisations as cooperative systems. A system is defined as 'a set of arrangements of things so related or connected as to form a unit or organic whole'. The organisation is, therefore, defined as 'a system of consciously coordinated personal activities or forces'(Basawanthappa, 2000). The systems theory explains that organisations come into existence when there are persons able to communicate with each other who will each contribute an action to accomplish a purpose. For cooperation to be effective the following must be present:
- Place where work is done
- Time when work is done
- Person with whom work is done
- Things upon which work is done
- Method or process by which work is done

This helps in understanding the organisation in a better way.

\section*{Contingency Theory}

The contingency theory asserts that when managers make a decision, they must take into account all aspects of the current situation and act on those aspects that are key to the situation at hand.

The continuing effort to identify the best leadership or management style might now conclude that the best style depends on the situation. If one is leading troops in the Persian Gulf, an autocratic style is probably best (of course, many might argue here, too). If one is leading a hospital or university, a more participative and facilitative leadership style is probably best.

\section*{SECTION 2: LEADERSHIP}

\section*{Introduction}

As a practising nurse, you will spend most of your working life in health care institutions at all levels, from staff nurse to the highest positions of responsibility. Whatever your role, it is important to understand that all nurses lead and manage to some degree. In this section, you will look at leadership and the qualities of leadership in the twenty first century.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- Define leadership
- Differentiate between leadership and management
- Describe the different styles of leadership
- Describe the principles of management

\section*{Leadership}

The word leadership is an intriguing one and brings up images of all kinds of people. Some names that come to mind include former leaders like President Julius Nyerere, President Jomo Kenyatta and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In nursing, Florence Nightingale may be considered an example of a leader in the profession.
You may also think of a relative or a nurse who has had notable leadership skills.
A leader is anyone who uses interpersonal skills to influence others to accomplish a specific goal. A leader can also be defined as a person who exerts influence by using certain personal behaviours and strategies or a person given authority by the statutes of an organisation to lead a group of people.
Leadership can be defined as 'the use of one's skills to influence others to perform to the best of their ability towards the achievement of goals' (Douglas, 1996). It is the art of getting others to want to do what one deems as important.
Leadership is not a fixed position. It is a process which changes on a situational basis. A manager leads by personally and actively working with subordinates for two main reasons:
- To guide and motivate their behaviour to fit the plans that have been established
- To understand the feelings of employees and the problems they face as they translate plan into action
Managers and leaders are different in the following ways:
- Managers think incrementally while leaders think radically
- Managers do things right while leaders do the right things
- Leaders stand out by being different
- Leaders question assumptions and are suspicious of tradition

\section*{'Manager' is derived from the Latin term 'managere', that is, 'someone in control'. A manager uses authority, the legitimate right to govern}

\section*{Types of Leadership}

There are two types of leadership. These are:

\section*{Formal}

This is when an appointed leader is chosen by the administration and given official or legitimate authority. This form of leadership has the greatest impact when followers accept the leader.

\section*{Informal}

An informal leader does not have official authority to direct activities of others. They are usually chosen from within a specific group, for example, social group, church organisation or work group. An individual may become an informal leader as a result of a variety of factors including age, seniority, special competencies or personality.

\section*{Theories of Leadership}

Various writers have attempted to explain the theoretical basis for leaders and leadership. You will look at the two following theories in detail:
- Trait Theory of Leadership
- Situational or Contingency Theory of Leadership

\section*{Trait Theory of Leadership}

This was the first theory to emerge and was studied from approximately 1900 to 1950. This theory states that leaders possess a set of physical and emotional characteristics that are important for inspiring others towards a common goal.

Some theorists who subscribe to this theory believe that leaders are born with certain qualities that determine leadership ability and success.
The leader is seen as gifted or develops certain characteristics including:
- Physique, that is, weight, height.
- Intellect, that is, knowledge, judgement.
- Personality, that is, aggressiveness, dominance and authoritarianism.

According to this theory, the leader behaves according to the role expectations of the group.

\section*{Situational or Contingency Theory of Leadership}

This theory states that the effectiveness of leadership depends on the relationship among the leaders and the task at hand, interpersonal skills and the favourability of the work situation. However, there are critical factors that must be considered in the above relationships, these include:
- The degree of trust and respect between the leader and follower
- The clarity of goals to be accomplished
- The ability of the leader to reward followers and exert influence

As a result of all the above, leaders were viewed as able to adapt their style according to the situation. For example, if one is faced with a specific situation, they consider the challenges and encourage an adaptive leadership style to understand the issue being faced. The implication here is that you, as a nurse manager, must assess each situation and determine appropriate action, based on the people involved.

\section*{Leadership Styles}

The styles of leadership used by managers vary from organisation to organisation and are tailored to fit their needs and individual behaviour. There are too many kinds of leaders, personnel, tasks, organisations and environments for any one leadership style to apply. There are three main styles of leadership, namely:
- Authoritarian or Autocratic
- Democratic or Participative
- Laissez faire or Permissive

You shall now examine each of the leadership styles individually.

\section*{Authoritarian or Autocratic}

In this leadership style, the leader assumes full responsibility for all decisions and actions. The characteristics of an autocratic leader include:

This style of leadership may be counter productive. It may cause employees to lose interest and initiative and stop thinking for themselves because there is no need for independent thought. It may also lead to loss of motivation, especially where employees find it necessary to adopt an attitude of obedience to an autocratic leader. Due to lack of motivation, the employee may perform dismally. As a result, less than optimal goals are achieved because the resources utilised are the manager's only.
Some forms of authoritarian leadership are applicable to nursing. It is particularly suitable in crisis situations, when clear directions are of highest priority. It may also apply in situations where the people being led are inexperienced.

\section*{Democratic or Participative Leadership}

Democratic leadership refers to a situation where people are free to express themselves. In contrast to the autocratic style of leadership, the manager here is 'people oriented' and focuses attention on human aspects as well as on building effective work groups. A collaborative spirit or joint effort exists which allows for group participation in decision making. The leader assumes that employees are eager to perform their jobs and are capable of doing so. The group is seen as having responsibility for goal determination and achievement.Democratic leadership encourages enthusiasm, high morale and increased satisfaction.
Research has shown that this style of leadership leads to high productivity and is the most desirable form in a wide variety of work situations.

\section*{Laissez-Faire or Permissive Leadership}

Laissez-faire leadership is at the opposite end of the continuum from authoritarian leadership. In this style, the leader lets people do what they want. The leader plays down their role in the group's activity and exercises minimum direction or control. The leader wants everyone to feel good about what they are doing and often avoids responsibility by relinquishing power to followers and permitting them to engage in managerial activities, for example, decision making, planning, setting goals, structuring and controlling the organisation.

This style is often evident when a manager is too weak or feels too threatened to exercise the
function of leadership. It is also visible where the manager has a great need for approval and does not want to offend anybody. In this leadership style, the following can be observed:
- Little or no visible leadership
- The manager's tend to be preoccupied with their own work
- There is no communication and direction to the employee
- There is very little teamwork and employees do as they wish

It should be noted, however, that this style could be highly effective in motivated professional groups, for example, in research projects in which independent thinking is rewarded.

\section*{Qualities of Effective Leadership}

For leaders to be effective in influencing others to perform, they should possess the following qualities:
- Empathy, that is, an ability to look at things from another person's point of view.
- Respect, that is, an effective leader should respect others as unique individuals.
- Objectivity, that is, no bias or prejudice.
- Self awareness, that is, self knowledge, being aware of the impact you have on others and being aware of your ability to make decisions or involve yourself with specific problems.
A nurse manager uses all the leadership styles separately or together depending on their flexibility and the circumstances inherent in each situation. There are many similarities and differences in the behaviour, attitude and conditions present in the various leadership styles. Not all of the behaviours are evident at any one time.

\section*{Levels of Leadership}

Your success as a leader may also depend on your level of leadership. John C. Maxwell lists the five levels of leadership as:

\section*{Position}

This is the lowest level of leadership and is based solely on title and position.

\section*{Permission}

As relationships are developed with others, they give permission to the leader to lead beyond the limits of their job description.

\section*{Production}

As the group becomes more productive together, leadership is advanced.

\section*{People Development}

This level of leadership involves developing people and assisting them to reach their potential.

\section*{Personhood}

This level of leadership involves a lifetime of developing others to their highest potential

\section*{Principles of Management}

You have previously seen that for a leader to be effective in influencing others to perform, they need to possess certain qualities as well as the ability to use different management styles depending on the situation. You have been exploring the various principles of nursing. You will now look at the management principles that a nurse requires to function effectively and efficiently as a leader.
In section one, you looked at the development of management theories and how they influenced management practice. The principles you are now going to cover were identified by Henri Fayol. He came up with fourteen principles, which might apply to nurses as they perform their duties. You will look at the most important ones that apply in your day to day work. These include:
- The Division of Labour.
- Responsibility, Accountability and Authority.
- Unity of Command.
- Teamwork.
- Centralisation and Decentralisation.
- Discipline.
- Line of Authority.

\section*{You should bear in mind the theories covered in section one.}

\section*{Division of Labour}

This is one of the basic principles applied in nursing practice to a large extent.
It is a way of determining who is responsible for what. In an organisation, no single person can do everything.In order to achieve organisational goals, people must be assigned tasks according to their skills. The objective of division of work is to produce more and better work with the same effort.The tasks that individuals perform must be related to each other and integrated. This calls for an adequate definition of duties to be duly communicated to all the people concerned. The idea of division of labour in an organisation makes it possible for work to proceed quickly and smoothly. For example, in a hospital, there is a chief nurse, senior nursing officers and nursing officers. Each of these people have a specific job to perform in order to ensure the success of the organisation. Each person has the responsibility to perform their task in coordination with other
people's duties.

\section*{Responsibility, Accountability and Authority}

Once the employees have been given different tasks to perform, the leader is responsible for the work to be done. Similarly, employees are responsible for the completion of their specific tasks. Both the leader and the employees are accountable for their tasks and responsibilities. Appropriate authority to perform certain functions is also necessary. You will now examine the three terms and see how the nurse manager applies them in nursing practice.

\section*{Responsibility}

This is a duty or assignment related to a job. It also refers to each person's obligation to perform at an acceptable level. For example, one responsibility common to a nurse in charge is
establishing the patient care assignment for a specific area of work. Nurse managers should always be assigned responsibilities with accompanying authority because, if the latter is not given, role confusion occurs for all individuals involved. For example, a nurse manager may have the responsibility for maintaining high professional standards, but if they are not given the authority to discipline employees as needed, this responsibility may be difficult or impossible to implement.

\section*{Accountability}

This means that someone must be able to explain actions and results or accept ownership for the results or lack thereof. For example, a qualified registered nurse is accountable for nursing care given to a patient or client.

\section*{Authority}

Authority has its base in responsibility. Dictionaries define authority as 'legal or rightful power, a right to command or act, domination, jurisdiction'. Authority defines which position will be superior and which will be subordinate.
The various levels of divisional activities in health organisations are a direct result of the size and complexity of modern institutions. For example, in a hospital, at the top level is the operating authority, that is, the chief nurse who takes the place of employer in the superior versus subordinate relationship. Policy and decisions are made at this level. They delegate responsibility to a group of nurse managers who exercise the delegated authority in supervising the work of others. This is formal authority. On the other hand, responsibility can be delegated for performance of specific functions. This functional authority is based on technical knowledge and personal skills. Both forms of authority are necessary for achieving goals and satisfying individual needs.

\section*{Unity of Command}

This is another important principle of management. The concept of unity of command is described as 'one person to one boss' or 'one person to one supervisor'. Each individual has one manager to whom they report and to whom they are responsible. This concept is illustrated in the diagram next.

This makes the manager-employee relationship as simple as possible and puts a limit to confusion, mistakes, excuses and delays in the daily performance of duties. For example, in a hospital, the nurses in various wards are responsible to those in charge of the departments or wards, who in turn, are responsible to the chief nurse. All problems are channelled through this unity of command.

\section*{Teamwork}

In many areas of your work, you are required to work with others in a smooth and efficient manner in order to achieve your objectives. Teamwork has been defined as 'coordinated action by a group of individuals in regular contact wherein members contribute toward task achievement' (Sikula and McKenna 1994). A health care team includes nurses, doctors, allied health professionals and support staff who have to work together in order to deliver quality services to the patients.
A team usually has a leader. Leadership is an important part of efficient teams. Group members support one another and their leader because they are all mutually responsible for the objectives and subsequent action. Openness and acceptance are the prime characteristics of an ideal team situation. The nurse manager is tasked with building an effective team in order to accomplish their objectives.

\section*{Centralisation and Decentralisation}

Centralisation and Decentralisation is frequently applied in health care systems. It refers to the extent to which decision making is concentrated or dispersed within the health care unit. You will now cover each one of them and see how they differ.

\section*{Centralisation}

This is the systematic retention of power and responsibility at higher levels of the organisation. Organisations vary greatly in their degree of centralisation. The degree may differ for different tasks and responsibilities. The Chief Nurse is responsible for centralised departments where major decision making and responsibility for key functions is centralised at the top level. Thus, for example, the Chief Nurse would be responsible for budgeting, staffing and quality assurance.

\section*{Decentralisation}

Decentralisation is where decision making and responsibility for key functions is delegated to the lowest possible managerial level in the department. Thus, a decentralised nursing department
places most decision making at the head nurse level with each individual head nurse running their unit independently.

\section*{Centralisation and Decentralisation}

Centralisation and Decentralisation has its advantages and disadvantages.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Advantages and Disadvantages} \\
\hline Advantages & \\
\hline Centralised & Decentralised \\
\hline No duplication of efforts, that is, special services grouped together. & Increased levels of decision making in organisation. \\
\hline High cost effectiveness. & Quicker and better decision making. \\
\hline Managers are experts only in concentrated range of skills. & Increased freedom and flexibility of staff. \\
\hline Disadvantages & \\
\hline Centralised & Decentralised \\
\hline Decisions take too long. & Decisions can be made where action takes place. \\
\hline Increased levels of organisation are cumbersome. & Risk of employees being treated unequally. \\
\hline & May shift respnsibility and authority to managers unprepared or it. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Discipline}

The last principle of management to be covered is discipline. You should be familiar with the term because you may have been involved in disciplining someone, for example, your child or a sibling. On the other hand, you may have been disciplined or punished after violating rules and regulations either at home or in the work place.
The word 'discipline' originates from the latin term 'disciplina', which means teaching or learning. As it was put forward by Fayol, discipline is 'respect for agreements which are directed at achieving obedience, application, energy and the outward marks of respect'. The primary emphasis in discipline is in assisting employees to behave in a manner that allows them to be self directed in meeting organisational goals. Punishment may be applied for improper behaviour in constructive discipline. This should be carried out in a supportive, corrective manner. Management usually disciplines an employee for:
- Not meeting laid down standards of performance.
- Violating the rules and policies.
- Insubordination, that is, lack of respect for authority.

The highest level and most effective form of discipline is self discipline because the roles are internalised and become part of the individual's personality (Curtin, 1996). The manager plays a vital role in this. There are several factors that must be present to foster a climate of self discipline.You will cover the factors cited by Health Care Education Associates (1987). They include:
- Employee awareness and understanding of rules and regulations that govern behaviour. These must be clearly written and communicated to subordinates.
- An atmosphere of mutual trust should exist. The manager must believe that employees are capable of actively seeking self discipline. Conversely, the employees must perceive the manager as honest and trustworthy.
- Employees should identify with the goals of the organisation. When this happens, they are more likely to accept the standards of conduct deemed acceptable by the organisation.
Discipline, therefore, is important for the smooth running of the organisation. It should be used as a means of helping the employees grow but not as a punitive measure.

\section*{Disciplinary Process}

The following is a guideline on the steps in the disciplinary process that can be applied to an employee who has violated rules or regulations.
1. Preliminary investigation and caution to the employee about the problem.
2. A cordial discussion with the offender and a brief warning as to why further violations will not be tolerated.
3. A stronger verbal warning after a further violation of regulation.
4. A formal written warning.
5. A written warning accompanied by suspension from the job for a prescribed number of days.
6. Suspension from the job for a longer period of time.
7. Discharge with opportunity to appeal.

This process provides an opportunity to make amends for violations of the rules and regulations. Administering discipline is one of the most difficult and resented tasks, but as a manager, this is your final responsibility. Your main concern should be to provide staff that can give safe care to patients and to help employees grow as individual human beings.

\section*{Line Authority}

Authority is the formal and legitimate right of a manager to make decisions, issue orders, and allocate resources to achieve organisational goals. Line authority is a manager's right to direct the work of their employees and make decisions without consulting others.

\section*{SECTION 3: FUNCTIONS OF MANAGEMENT}

\section*{Introduction}

You have so far covered the topics of leadership and principles of management. You will now find out what manager's do in their day to day work and how the principles of management are applied.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of the section you should know the five main functions of management. These are:
- Planning
- Staffing
- Organising
- Delegating
- Controlling

\section*{Definition of a Function}

\section*{What is a function?}

A function is a broad area or responsibility with many activities aimed at achieving a predetermined objective. Management is viewed as consisting of many functions. The three main functions of management are:
- Planning
- Implementation
- Evaluation

These have however been expanded to include:
- Planning
- Organising
- Staffing
- Delegating or Directing
- Controlling
- Budgeting

All together, they form the acronym POSDCoB.

\section*{Functions of Management}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-21.jpg?height=435&width=651&top_left_y=593&top_left_x=317)
$\mathbf{P}$ stands for planning
I stands for implementation
$\mathbf{E}$ stands for evaluation

\section*{Planning}

This is the first function of management. In module one, you learnt about the nursing process and the various stages involved. Planning is also a continuous process, it involves going through similar stages. You live in an era of change and therefore, you need to plan your activities.

Planning is a never ending process. It is the beginning of management. Planning is simply defined as deciding in advance what will and will not be done in the next minute, hour, day, month or year. Planning is advance thinking as a basis for action. It involves what needs to be done, how it will be done and mechanisms of evaluating work done. Planning, therefore, is having a specific objective or purpose and mapping out a method before hand. When planning, you should consider the seen and unseen factors, and keep in mind that all factors influence one another.

\section*{Purpose of Planning}
1. Unleash and capitalise on creativity that resides in people
2. Provide enabling mechanism to question the assumptions on which previous decisions were made.

\section*{The Planning Process}

The planning process includes a series of activities that the nurse manager sets out to do. The process is subject to change as new facts become available. If plans are fixed and unchangeable, then they may fail.
The activities involved in planning include:
- Gathering information.
- Setting goals and objectives, that is, what you want to achieve.
- Policy formulation, that is, guiding statements in decision making.
- Developing strategic plans, that is, long term plans designed to achieve goals and objectives.
- Developing tactical plans.
- Developing procedures.
- Budgeting or resource allocation.

The nurse plans and develops specific goals and objectives for their area of responsibility. The process of planning includes:
- Assessment
- Setting goals
- Implementation
- Evaluation

\section*{Assessment}

This is the first stage in the process. It involves identifying and clarifying or diagnosing the problem. A good diagnosis pinpoints what is wrong. It may identify a particular situation that needs improvement, for example, the standards of nursing care.

The main questions you should ask are:
- Where is the problem?
- What are the obstacles that are preventing achievement?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-22.jpg?height=773&width=784&top_left_y=1455&top_left_x=246)

\section*{Setting Goals}

The next stage of the planning process is establishing goals to be achieved. These goals determine the direction of activities and serve as a guide for action. This stage also involves developing a set of actions for achieving the objectives and selecting
promising solutions from the alternatives. One should be concerned with what can be done to overcome the problems identified. This requires imagination and originality.Alternatives must be analysed, compared and costed. The alternatives can range from doing nothing or finding a means around the problem, for example, dismissing a member of staff or discharging a patient.

\section*{Implementation}

This is the third stage, it is very important because if plans are not implemented, they remain theoretical. Some of the principles of management covered in section two, for example, the division of labour, responsibility and accountability are put into practice.
Implementation involves decision making, which is the core of planning. These decisions deal with the following issues:
- Activities, that is, noting whether they are carried out as planned and whether services are delivered as intended.
- Manpower should be adequate, at the right place and right time to perform the activities.
- Resources, that is, the physical, financial and information resources needed to perform the activities.

\section*{Evaluation}

This is the last stage in the planning process. It involves determining the extent to which objectives have been achieved. The main concern for the nurse is to find out the effectiveness of the results, as well as the efficiency in the performance of activities and the economic use of resources. You should ask the following questions:
- Are the results as intended?
- Are the results of value?

If the answer to both questions is 'yes', then the decision would most likely be to carry on as planned. If the answer is in the negative, then a decision will have to be made on whether to reexamine the objectives, activities or both.
Planning is necessary for several reasons. Planning:
- Contributes to purposeful organisation of work
- Reduces costs because efforts are directed towards desired results
- Provides for integration and coordination of activities
- Minimises haphazard approaches and avoids duplication

The nurse utilises the nursing process in planning for care of specific patients.

\section*{***The management process supports the nursing management process***}

\section*{The Nursing Management Process}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-24.jpg?height=695&width=1250&top_left_y=298&top_left_x=249)

\section*{Staffing}

\section*{Staffing Process}

Staffing involves hiring and retaining staff in an organisation.
The staffing process involves a situation analysis, looking into what you want and whom you can get. It includes:
- Recruitment
- Selection
- Induction
- Scheduling

\section*{Recruitment}

This is the first part of the process and it involves filling a vacancy. It includes the examination of the vacancy and consideration of sources of suitable candidates. The sources could be internal, that is, from within the organisation, or external.

\section*{Selection}

This is the next stage, it includes assessing the candidate by various means, for example, interviewing and making a choice between candidates to be followed by an offer of employment.If no suitable candidates are found, the post is advertised again with a wider scope or catchment area. This may include advertising abroad.
During selection, at least the three best candidates are chosen.
In case the best candidate is not in a position to take the job, then the second best is approached until the vacancy is filled.

\section*{Scheduling (Duty Roster)}

After the orientation is done, the employee is assigned tasks to be performed. Work schedules and time off should meet organisational goals with fairness and equity among personnel. A schedule should adhere to the following:
- Policies, standards and practices of the organisation on the hours worked by professional and support staff.
- Appropriate ratio or balance between professional and support staff.
- Continuity of nursing services and twenty four hour coverage.
- Approved budget.
- Consideration of vacations.
- Allowance of adjustment in case of illness, emergencies or changes in patient care needs.
- Individual needs of staff.

Staff members should be informed of their work schedules at least one to two weeks in advance.
The schedules may be either centralised or decentralised.
A centralised schedule is controlled by the chief nurse, matron or a designate who develops a master plan for nursing personnel in the hospital. One of the advantages of this method is that it provides an overall picture of the staffing situation in the organisation. However, it denies the manager the right to make scheduling decisions based on workers' abilities and needs. In the decentralised schedule, the
middle and lower levels of management determine scheduling, for example, ward in charges. The manager is, therefore, more accountable at their level and has a greater control of activities.

\section*{Factors Affecting Staffing}

There are many variables that may affect staff numbers and placement. These include:
- The need to provide nursing services coverage.
- Staff factors, for example, job descriptions, education level of staff, experience and expectations from the organisation.
- Patient factors, including variety of patient conditions, length of stay, the patient population, care needs and fluctuation in numbers.
- Health care organisation factors, including policies and procedures, financial resources available, number of beds per unit, staffing norms, issues of professional coverage and nursing assignment systems.
Since each setting is unique, there is no guide that can stipulate the correct number of personnel needed to provide quality care. However, systems have been developed for guidance, for example, the patient classification system which is a method of grouping patients according to the amount and complexity of their nursing care requirements. In this case, patients are grouped according to the nursing time, effort and ability required to provide care.

\section*{Organising}

Nurses work in organisations. Nurse managers are expected to organise their work activities based on the staffing patterns.Organising is the process of grouping the necessary responsibilities and activities into workable units, determining the lines of authority, communication, developing patterns of coordination and giving feedback. By organising, you are attempting to answer the question:

\section*{How will the work be divided and accomplished?}

To answer the question, the manager must define groups and assign duties. There are certain basic issues to consider:
- Set up structure, that is, the structured aspects of the organisation that must be set up to indicate activities to be performed and lines of responsibility and authority.
- Develop procedures and policies.
- Determine requirements and decide how duties will be performed.

\section*{Organisation}

Organisation refers to the structure that is designed to support organisational processes. It is important to design organisational structures that will respond to changes taking place in the current health care environment. The key factors influencing organisations are the:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-27.jpg?height=629&width=518&top_left_y=265&top_left_x=251)

\section*{Vision}

The vision is future oriented, purposeful and designed to identify the desired future of the organisation, for example, the hospital intends to be the best in terms of quality of services delivered.

\section*{Mission}

The mission communicates the reason for the organisation's existence or being. It identifies the organisation's customers and types of services offered. It enacts the vision.

\section*{Philosophy}

The philosophy of an organisation is the values and beliefs held about the nature of work required to accomplish the mission and the nature and rights of both the customers and employees.

\section*{Organisational Structure}

Organisational structure refers to how work is organised and the levels of decision making, authority and responsibility of workers. Structure is a map for communication and decision making paths. The chain of command is depicted in vertical dimensions of organisational charts. The charts are tools to graphically portray the organisational structure. The chart shows:
- Areas of responsibility
- To who and for whom each person is accountable
- Major channels of formal communication
- Interdepartmental relationships

\section*{Organisational Chart for the Ministry of Health Division of Nursing.}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-28.jpg?height=755&width=789&top_left_y=262&top_left_x=248)

In organising, the emphasis should be placed on interrelating activities, practices and resources into a systematic and practicable pattern. In this case, the following are necessary:
- There should be a clear goal toward which work effort is directed
- Need for clear authority and responsibility relationships
- Power and authority factors must be present
- Unity of command must be clear
- Authority must be delegated
- Decision making issues must be considered

The supervisor determines and enumerates the various activities, which are required, assigns these activities and gives subordinates the authority needed to carry out the assigned activities.
Communication is an important factor in the organisational process. Effective organising can have several benefits. It can:
- Enlighten and help eliminate weaknesses, including gaps in responsibility, overlapping of functions, and duplication of effort.
- Provide employee with a well defined hierarchy and set of rules and procedures.
- Enable clear understanding of management expectations.

\section*{Types of Organisational Structures}

There are various types of organisational structures. Some of them are listed below:

\section*{Functional Structure}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-28.jpg?height=515&width=740&top_left_y=2087&top_left_x=274)

A functional organisation divides units according to their functions. A hypothetical functional organisation might have a chief executive, general manager in charge of human resources, general manager in charge of marketing, general manager in charge of production and so on.

\section*{Product Structure}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-29.jpg?height=521&width=774&top_left_y=482&top_left_x=274)

A product organisation divides units according to its products. This kind of organisation might have a chief executive, general manager in charge of consumer products, general manager in charge of industrial products and so on.

\section*{Market Structure}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-29.jpg?height=515&width=781&top_left_y=1262&top_left_x=256)

A market organisation divides units according to its target market.
For example, this kind of organisation might have a chief executive officer, director of paediatrics, director of gynaecological services and so on.

\section*{Geographical Structure}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-29.jpg?height=515&width=769&top_left_y=2081&top_left_x=254)

A geographic organisation divides units according to the geographic regions from where it carries out its business.
For example, this kind of organisation might have a chief executive officer, director for East Africa, director for North Africa and so on.

\section*{Matrix Structure}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-30.jpg?height=398&width=792&top_left_y=536&top_left_x=242)

A matrix organisation structure contains teams of people created from various sections of the organisation. These teams will be created for the purposes of a specific project and will be led by a project manager. Often, the team will only exist for the duration of the project.

\section*{Tall Structure}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-30.jpg?height=581&width=780&top_left_y=1187&top_left_x=251)

A tall organisation has many levels of management and supervision. There is a 'long chain of command' running from the top of the organisation, for example, chief executive down to the bottom of the organisation, for example, shop floor worker.

\section*{Flat Structure}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_10_24_8960a5f3dcf73bbc077fg-30.jpg?height=518&width=746&top_left_y=2010&top_left_x=256)

A flat organisation will have relatively few layers or just one layer of management. This means that the 'chain of command' from top to bottom is short and the 'span of control is
wide'. Due to the small number of management layers, flat organisations are often small organisations.

\section*{Organisational Communication}

In units one and two of module one, you covered the various principles of communication. Please refer to your notes on this topic, as they will be useful for the following topic. In this section, you will specifically focus on organisational communication. There is no organisation that can exist without communication.
Communication is referred to as the lifeblood of any organisation. Communication refers to the need to create
common understanding. It is, therefore, the process of transmitting ideas and information from one person, the sender, to another or group of people, receivers.
Organisational communication is the exchange of information withinthe organisation. While employee communication is the responsibility of the manager, the manager's work may be supplemented through some already established means of communication within an organisation.
The manager is charged with the responsibility of passing information through various channels.

\section*{Formal and Informal Communication}

The formal communication system is mainly used. It is based on a chain of command from the top of the organisation to the bottom. This is used for all official messages including directives, procedures, policies, job instructions and so on. An informal communication system can also be used. This is usually oral and not crucial to the functioning of the organisation.
It originates from informal groupings, for example, associations or welfare groups. In most cases, messages are transmitted through the 'grapevine' (also known as rumours) and sometimes the communication is distorted or groundless. Such types of communication can cause fear and anxiety among staff and the manager should be aware of its existence and reinforce stability using more formal methods of communication. You will now look at some of the different types of formal organisational communication.

\section*{Vertical Flow}

The manager is responsible for passing information through vertical channels of communication, which includes both a downward and an upward flow of communication. A two way exchange of information is essential in organisations and managers must ensure that there is feedback at all levels.

\section*{Downward Communication}

Most information within organisations moves from the top downward, that is, from the top levels of management to employees. This may be through face to face communication or written materials, for example, memos or circulars.
The purpose of this form of communication is mainly to inform employees of their responsibilities, commitment to the objectives of the organisation and any other relevant information. Barriers to this form of communication may include:
- The manager may withhold information
- The employee may fail to understand the message
- The employee may get information but this may not be relevant to their needs

\section*{Upward Communication}

This is the flow of information from the bottom up or from the subordinates to the supervisor. Ideally information should pass freely up the chain of command so that management gets the feedback needed to evaluate results and initiate improvements. Barriers to upward communication may include:
- If employees feel management is not interested in their ideas, they will not offer them.
- At times, bad news gets blocked and is not communicated to the top management.
- Delays in relaying messages.

\section*{Delegating}

Once you are responsible and accountable for patient care activities, you will find that there are times when a job gets too big and part of it must be entrusted to someone else.
Delegation is the process through which responsibility and authority for performing a task, function, activity or decision is transferred to another individual who accepts that authority and responsibility (Sullivan and Decker 1992: 216).
Although the delegator remains accountable for the task, the delegate is also accountable to the delegator for responsibilities assumed.
Delegation is a dynamic process, which involves three factors:
- Responsibility for work delegated, that is, willingness to do the assigned work or an obligation to accomplish a task.
- Accountability or the obligation to carry out the responsibility or authority or act of accepting ownership for the results or lack thereof.
- Authority, that is, the right to act or empower.

\section*{You can delegate only those tasks for which you are responsible.}

In delegation, responsibility and authority are transferred, while accountability is shared.
To clearly understand who is responsible for certain tasks, it is important to look at:
- Practice acts, that is, the scope of nursing practice.
- Standards of care.
- Job descriptions for various positions.
- Policy statements regarding the quality of care.

For delegation to be effective, the following must be considered:
- The manager and immediate subordinate must have a good interpersonal relationship.
- The manager must have good administrative skills to be able to delegate.
- The assigned duties should be well understood, well defined and well written to both of them.
- The person to whom work is to be delegated must be assisted to become self sufficient.
Every activity you perform has some benefits to the people involved as well as the organisation. The delegator benefits as they are able to devote more time to those tasks that cannot be delegated and with more time available can develop new skills and abilities.

Meanwhile, the delegate benefits because they gain new skills and abilities that can facilitate upward mobility and build self esteem and confidence resulting in job motivation and satisfaction. They also have the freedom to exercise initiative and learn how to make decisions independently.
The organisation benefits in that teamwork improves and the organisation achieves its goals more efficiently. Finally, the patient benefits as the quality of care improves leading to increased patient satisfaction.

\section*{Delegation Process}

The process of delegation involves the following steps:

\section*{Defining the Task}

This involves determining what can and should be delegated, for example, routine tasks, tasks for which you do not have time and tasks that have moved down in priority. It also includes problem solving and staff development.

\section*{Evaluating the Task}

You should analyse whether the task involves technical skill or cognitive abilities, for example, the performance of specific procedures and the knowledge level needed to carry out certain tasks.

\section*{Determining Who Should Perform the Task}

You should be able to match the tasks to the individual. To do this, you should analyse individual skills and capabilities, experiences and individual characteristics, for example, initiative, enthusiasm and knowledge.

\section*{Providing Clear Communication About Expectations Regarding the Task}

You should plan your meeting with the delegate. Describe the task and give reasons for the task. Inform the delegate by what standards the task will be evaluated and identify any constraints to completing the tasks.

\section*{Reaching Agreement}

Seek agreement from the delegate that they are accepting responsibility and authority for the task.

\section*{Monitoring Performance and Providing Feedback}

Analyse performance according to established goals. Monitoring provides a mechanism for feedback and control and ensures that delegated tasks are carried out as agreed. Delegation is good because it enables the manager to concentrate on the most important tasks. However, there are some problems which may affect both the delegator and delegate. On the part of the manager they may:
- Be reluctant to delegate adequately to their subordinates. In some cases, the manager might delegate responsibility and not authority.
- Fail to delegate because they can do a better job.
- Lack the ability to communicate to people what is to be done.

As a general guideline, only routine activities may be delegated. Sensitive issues, for example, disciplinary and staff performance appraisal should not be delegated.

\section*{Delegating Process}

On the other hand, the subordinate may:
- Decline delegated tasks because it could be easier to ask the manager than to decide for themselves how to deal with a problem.
- Fear criticism for mistakes made, which keeps them from accepting responsibility.
- Lack the necessary information and resources which creates an attitude that might make a person reject further assignments (non supportive environment).
- Lack self confidence.
- Fear liability, keeping in mind that some individuals are not risk takers.

\section*{Controlling}

\section*{Controlling}

Controlling is the managerial function concerned with making sure plans succeed.
It means measuring and correcting the performance of employees to ensure that the planned objectives of an organisation are achieved. Controlling involves the regulation of activities so that some targeted element of performance remains within acceptable limits. It also guides activities and assures certain minimum standards.
The nurse manager needs to take into account both external and internal environments because they will influence the way they exercise control.

\section*{External Environment}

This includes the laws and acts that regulate institutions, for example, the Nursing Practice Act, which regulates nursing practice in terms of registration and licensure, in order to maintain standards of nursing services.

\section*{Internal Environment}

This includes self regulation within the organisation or nursing department, for example, quality control relating to care of patients, staffing and budget reports.

\section*{Importance of Control}

Control is important for several reasons including the following:
- To ensure work is done according to the objectives set and activities are carried out as planned, within the allocated time and with the resources provided.
- To enable supervisors to recognise gaps in the knowledge and understanding of the staff, and arrange for appropriate training.
- To enable management to ensure that the resources provided for work are adequate and are being properly used.
- To enable management to identify the cause of work deficiencies.
- To facilitate the recognition and reward for good work done and recognise suitable staff.
- To identify mistakes before they become critical, bearing in mind that prevention is better than cure.

\section*{Elements of Control}

The nurse manager must ensure that all staff members are conversant with the elements of control. You will now cover each of these elements individually.

\section*{Establishing the Standards}

The first step involves formulating standards. Standards are yardsticks against which nurse managers devise controls. They are a way to measure and evaluate quality and quantity of performance. They are closely related to organisational goals but are more specific. People must understand the results desired to avoid confusion. Standards may be classified as:

\section*{Tangible and Objective}

Tangible standards are physical standards, which pertain to actual operation of the department. They can be quantitative or qualitative, for example, the number of nurses to cover the duty per shift and quality of care expected, for instance, every patient will have a nursing care plan twelve hours after admission.

\section*{Intangible and Subjective}

Intangible standards may include the reputation of the hospital based on good or bad publicity. They can also refer to the morale of employees, attitudes and relationships between employees and complaints. These are difficult to measure but can be assessed with a degree of confidence.

\section*{Actual Performance}

After setting standards, they must be measured to identify their achievement. This can be done by direct observation and checking on employees. Observations for control should attempt to identify:
- Inadequate output or improperly performed jobs.
- Deviations from expected standards. Assuming a questioning rather than confrontational attitude.
- Comparisons between actual performances with the laid down standards.

\section*{It is important to correctly interpret reasons for deviations from standards. Some deviations may be due to temporary circumstances, for example, patients may not have had bed baths due to fewer nurses on duty rather than due to poor performance. Corrective Action}

If performance falls short of standards, then analysis indicates that corrective action is required. Supervisors must decide what remedial action is necessary to get improved results in the near future. These corrections may require:
- A revision of standards
- A simple discussion with those responsible for taking corrective action
- Verbal reprimand
- At times disciplinary action may be taken where rules and policies are involved
- Better selection and training of staff to enable them to be more effective and efficient
- Reinforcement of strengths by the manager so that the staff are motivated

\section*{SECTION 4: MANAGING RESOURCES, CHANGE AND HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS}

\section*{Introduction}

In the preceding sections, you covered the various concepts, principles and functions of management which a nurse manager utilises in the day to day running of a unit. This involves a series of activities that must be performed to achieve certain objectives.
The achievement of these objectives will depend on how well knowledge and skills are applied to a problem, using resources in the most efficient way. To some extent, you have already referred to some of the most important resources, for example, manpower. Nursing management often takes place in situations of scarce resources, and therefore, the main role of the nurse manager is to achieve the greatest results with the resources available. You will also cover change management and health information systems.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- Describe human resource management
- Describe elements of financial management
- Describe materials management
- Describe time management
- Describe the process of managing change
- Describe the health information systems used to provide patient care information

\section*{Human Resource Management}

The shift in terminology from 'personnel' to 'human resources' is symbolic of a true change in the field. The term human resource reflects the position that people are a resource that needs to be managed strategically in support of the organisation's mission.
The effective functioning of an organisation depends upon various resources. Human resources or manpower is one of the most vital resources for the labour intensive health institution.
Human resource management can be said to be an integral part of the role of any person who is responsible for the work of others. In this module, human resource management will refer to a group of specialists concerned with increasing the effectiveness of staff performance in an organisation.
According to Basawanthappa (2002), the main objectives of human resource management are:
- Effective utilisation of human resources to enable the achievement of organisational goals.
- Establishment and maintenance of an adequate organisational structure and desirable working relationship among staff.
- Securing integration of the individual and informal groups with the organisation and thereby ensuring their commitment, involvement and loyalty.
- Recognition and satisfaction of individual needs and group goals.
- Provision of maximum opportunities for individual development and advancement.
- Maintenance of high morals in organisations.

Bearing in mind the objectives covered previously, you will now look at the main aspects of human resource management. These include:

\section*{Forecasting Future Manpower Requirements}

This involves estimating the institution's demand for labour and matching this with what is available.

\section*{Formulating and Proposing Policies}

Formulation of human resource policies is done by the human resource management department. The policies have to be agreed upon by top management. The key areas of personnel policy include recruitment and selection, terms and conditions of employment, training and development as well as labour union issues, for example, laid down procedures on how to handle strikes and disputes. These personnel policies are guidelines for behaviour and state how the organisation will respond in relation to employee affairs.

\section*{Recruitment of Staff}

This involves preparing job descriptions and specifications, drafting job advertisements, interviewing candidates and assessing appropriate salary levels for new employees. A job description states the principal duties, responsibilities and the scope of authority. A job specification also spells out the vital qualities required in an employee for them to be able to perform a job adequately, for example, specific knowledge, skills, ability and behaviour. These must be prepared before advertising for any job.

\section*{Staff Training and Development}

Once the employees join the organisation, they require training. This involves induction of new employees as well as training and development. This was covered in more detail in section two. Human resources are the most dynamic of all the organisation's resources. Training and development is important in order to maintain the key skills within the organisation and motivate the staff. This is to enable them to realise their full potential. The human resources department has the responsibility of assessing the training needs, designing training methodology and evaluating training activities to determine their effectiveness.

\section*{Staff Retention}

It is essential to retain employees within an organisation. Promoting staff is one way of retaining employees. This allows them to advance from one given grade to a higher one. Promotions are based on whether an individual meets the requirements as specified in the job description. The career structure or recognised promotional path should provide an opportunity for all workers to get promoted.

\section*{Health and Safety}

The employees should be informed about their rights and duties, occupational hazards should be identified and accident prevention measures put in place. First aid facilities should also be at hand.

\section*{Welfare}

Welfare services are provided for matters concerning employees which are not immediately connected with their jobs although they may be connected generally with their place of work.

These include counselling, problems of health or sickness, social and sporting activities, restaurants, child care facilities and special services for retired employees.

\section*{Consultation and Negotiation}

Opportunities should exist for collective bargaining and liasing with trade unions. Trade unions should be utilised by management as an avenue for consultation and joint planning with employees. Trade unions should not be viewed as antagonists but a partner in planning and decision making. If employees through their trade unions felt appreciated, they would be motivated to perform better and improve the image of the organisation.

\section*{Labour Management Relations}

Labour management relations has been defined as 'the effort to develop harmonious working relations between employees and management in order for a firm to increase productivity, improve quality of work life and remain competitive'.

\section*{Objectives of Labour Management Relations}
- To enhance a healthy relationship between employers and employees, that is, a sound, harmonious and mutually beneficial relationship.
- To safeguard the interests of employees and management by securing mutual understanding and goodwill between them.
- To avoid industrial and workplace conflict that could affect production and productivity.
- To preventing or reduce labour turnover and frequent absenteeism.
- To nurture and sustain workplace democracy in order to enhance employee participation in decision making and problem solving.
- To eliminate strikes, lockouts and go slows.
- To allow the government some control over private means of production, distribution and service provision in the public interest.
The management should never be caught up in a surprise strike if they have been in good relations and communication with the employees. Those in Management positions should not be members of trade unions.

\section*{Financial Resource Management}

In the previous section, you covered the management of human resources. In this part, you are going to examine financial resource management. Managing finances is one of the most important roles of a nurse manager. Arguments have been put forward that this function should be left to accountants who are specialised in this area. However, if nurses do not have the basic skills to enable them manage finances, they will not succeed in providing nursing services. Most of the resources you will be managing are acquired with money.
Financial planning requires that the manager identifies objectives, policies and procedures. The budget is one of the main tools of financial management.

\section*{Budgeting}

In simple terms, budgeting involves managing money and how it is used to maintain other resources.
A budget is a means of control, which reflects the plan against which actual performance is measured. It can also be defined as a means of checking the progress made in keeping the
expenses and costs in compliance with an organisation's financial plans. Budgeting is the process of planning and controlling future operations by comparing actual results with planned budgetary expectations.
The following are some of the purposes of a budget:
- To avoid spending more than an organisation can afford
- To aid in planning and controlling
- To assist in assessing the financial requirements of the institution
- To indicate the areas in which money raised or received will be spent
- To facilitate comparison of actual performance with budgeted targets
In order to draw up a meaningful budget, the hospital should have a clearly defined organisational structure with responsibilities defined and assigned. Personnel at all levels of management should participate in budget development. The personnel involved should have an understanding of the ideas and financial goals of the hospital.
There must be an adequate system, which provides reliable financial and statistical information to the responsible people. The budget should allow enough freedom to accomplish departmental objectives and must be flexible enough to allow for unpredictable expenditures.
There are two main types of budgets, which the nurse may be involved in preparing:
- Operational or Annual Budget
- Capital Budget

\section*{Operational or Annual Budget}

This is the organisation's statement of expected revenue or income and expenses for the coming year. It coincides with the fiscal year. The fiscal year is a specified twelve month period during which the operational and financial performance of the organisation is measured. It usually coincides with the calendar year, that is, it runs from January to December or may follow another time frame, for example, the government calendar, which runs from July to June.
The operational budget includes the accumulated estimates of operating revenues and expenses. In nursing management, the revenue is derived from patient fees. Actual payment is generated by a given service or procedure.
The expenses consist of salary and non salary items, for example, personnel emoluments and education, including in service training, on the job training, educational leave and travel scholarships. They may also include personnel uniforms, books, periodical subscriptions, laundry, medical equipment and maintenance, drugs and pharmaceuticals, non pharmaceutical supplies, legal and professional fees and stationery.
The expenses should be comprehensive and thorough. Budgets are prepared by the heads of each ward or department in consultation with staff. Thereafter, the matron, chief nurse or director of nursing services compiles the nursing division budget. In some cases, the director of nursing services prepares a budget for the whole of the nursing division.

\section*{Balanced Budget}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline A. & Income for May 2003 & Kshs \\
\hline & Expected Income (Patients Fees) & 300,000/= \\
\hline & Other sources of income & 100,000/= \\
\hline & Total Income & 400,000/= \\
\hline B. & Expenditure for May 2003 & Kshs \\
\hline $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ & Recurrent & \\
\hline & Food & 100,000/= \\
\hline & Drugs & 100,000/= \\
\hline & Linen & 20,000/= \\
\hline & Surgical Materials & 60,000/= \\
\hline & Miscellaneous & 20,000/= \\
\hline & Total & 300,000/= \\
\hline $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ & Capital Expenditure & \\
\hline & Purchase of suction machine & 100,000/= \\
\hline & Total Expenditure & 400,000/= \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

As you can see from the figure, the income and expenditure parts of the budget have the same totals, that is, they balance. A budget that has a higher income than expenditure is said to show a surplus while the one with a higher expenditure shows a deficit. If there is a deficit in the budget, it means you have spent more money than you have. This may require you to borrow money or be indebted to your suppliers.

\section*{Capital Budget}

This is the second type of budget. It outlines the need for major equipment or physical changes in the organisation requiring large sums of money, for example, physical renovations, new construction and new or replacement equipment. Organisations define capital items based on certain criteria, for instance, the item must have an expected performance of a minimum of one year or more and exceed a certain shilling value, for example, fifty thousand. The criteria vary from one hospital to another.
Requests for capital items are usually made on a special form or letter, accompanied by a written justification for the item. If there are a large number of items requested, a priority list should be set.
Where possible, the period within which items are needed should be specified. Capital costs should consider long term goals and must complement the organisational objectives.
All nurse managers are involved in the budgeting process.
Preparation begins several months before the end of the fiscal year to allow time for careful preparation. In a decentralised system, budget preparation has several steps:
- Review of policies, standards and objectives.
- Top level management projections for the future and preparation of guidelines.
- Middle level nurse managers prepare the annual budget.
- The administrator of nursing services, finance director or manager reviews the budget.
- Budget is accepted or modified.
- Budget is implemented and regularly evaluated.

\section*{Capital Budget}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline \multirow[t]{4}{*}{A.} & Income for May 2003 & Kshs \\
\hline & Expected Income (Patients Fees) & 300,000/= \\
\hline & Other sources of income & 100,000/= \\
\hline & Total Income & 400,000/= \\
\hline B. & Expenditure for May 2003 & Kshs \\
\hline $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ & Recurrent & \\
\hline & Food & 100,000/= \\
\hline & Drugs & 100,000/= \\
\hline & Linen & 20,000/= \\
\hline & Surgical Materials & 60,000/= \\
\hline & Miscellaneous & 20,000/= \\
\hline & Total & 300,000/= \\
\hline $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ & Capital Expenditure & \\
\hline & Purchase of suction machine & 100,000/= \\
\hline & Total Expenditure & 400,000/= \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

As you can see from the figure, the income and expenditure parts of the budget have the same totals, that is, they balance. A budget that has a higher income than expenditure is said to show a surplus while the one with a higher expenditure shows a deficit. If there is a deficit in the budget, it means you have spent more money than you have. This may require you to borrow money or be indebted to your suppliers.

\section*{Managing Materials}

So far you have managed human resources and money. The other resource that a manager is concerned with in the organisation is the materials. Materials refer to drugs, supplies and equipment needed by the nurses and other health personnel to deliver services.
For quality and efficient services, the materials must be provided at the right place, at the right time and in the right quantity.
Materials are essential if the health care institution is to achieve its objectives. The nurse manager should know the policies and procedures that relate to materials management. You should be familiar with the following activities:

\section*{Demand Estimation}

Since a large quantity of materials is used in hospitals, you need to identify your requirements or needs beforehand.

\section*{Procurement}

Having developed your list of requirements, the next step is procurement or ordering. Some institutions have laid out specific rules and regulations regarding procurement. This is aimed at reducing wastage and maximising the value of money.

\section*{Receipt and Inspection}

The materials received should be subjected to either physical or chemical inspection. This ensures that you received the right quality and quantity of materials as requested by the organisation.

\section*{Inventory Control}

Adequate quantities of materials should be available whenever required. Close supervision of movement of materials or consumption rate is a good tool for proper control.

\section*{Storage}

The materials should be placed in a store within or near the institution. The store should be of adequate size to accommodate all the different materials required, for example, fridges, shelves and cupboards.
The materials should also be stored in appropriate conditions, for example, temperature, light as specified by the manufacturer.
It is, therefore, important that the nurse manager adopts the proper procedures for materials management.

\section*{Managing Time}

Time is an important resource although in many cases, it is not thought of as such. It is sometimes referred to as one of the M's of management and stands for moments. The other M's being money, manpower and materials. For example, you may recall times when you have wished that a day had more than twenty four hours or that a week had more than seven days so that you can accomplish the tasks you had set out to do. This often happens when you are not managing time well.
The demands on time as a manager and a health care provider fall into three categories (Nduba 1999):
- Tasks that have to be performed. These relate to key responsibilities, for example, clinical or administrative duties.
- Tasks that other people pressurise you into doing. Some of these are important and must be done while others you do because you do not want to say no.
- Tasks that you perform because you want to.

These are usually out of choice and include tasks that someone else could do just as well, for example, attending a nurses' association meeting.

\section*{Time Waster}

This is something that prevents a person from accomplishing a job or achieving a goal. Some of the common time wasters include:
- Interruptions such as telephone calls and drop in visitors.
- Lack of clear cut goals, objectives and priorities.
- Meetings both scheduled and unscheduled.
- Lack of daily or weekly plans.
- Lack of self discipline.
- Failure to delegate.
- Ineffective communication.
- Inability to say no.

\section*{Principles of Time Management}

The following are techniques that you can use to deal with time management constraints.

\section*{Goal Setting}

The nurse manager sets both organisational and personal goals. The goals are either short or long term and provide direction and vision for actions as well as time frames in which activities will be accomplished.

\section*{Time Analysis}

The manager should conduct a survey of how they spend a day. Reviewing the daily schedule and keeping it accurate may demonstrate how time is used.

\section*{Priority Setting}

The nurse manager identifies time frames for achievement of goals. The 'to do' list should be prioritised by classifying activities as 'one' for urgent, 'two' for not urgent but important and 'three' for less important.

\section*{Delegation}

The nurse manager can delegate those activities that can be effectively handled by juniors.

\section*{Controlling Interruptions}

The nurse manager should identify causes of interruption and plan to reduce them. One way of doing this is incorporating some of these interruptions into planned and scheduled activities.

\section*{Nurse managers must use time wisely to accomplish everything that is expected of them. This takes a lot of planning.}

By now you should be able to manage resources within the organisation. However, in the current health care system, there are a lot of changes including social, technological and educational, which a nurse manager should be able to respond to and manage. According to the theory of evolution, plants and animals have survived countless changes in the earth's environment. For example, the cockroach has been around for three hundred million years and the shark two hundred million years. This is because they have learnt how to adapt to their environment.They have learnt how to survive. The strong survive and the weak die, it is survival for the fittest.
Change has always been, and will always be, a part of us. During your lifetime you must have experienced change in one form or the other, such as moving from one workstation to another, acquisition of new skills or introduction of new methods of nursing care delivery. Change is the process of making something different from what it was. Change is inevitable and nurse managers should understand and anticipate the reactions to change.
"It is no longer enough to be a 'change agent.' You must be a change insurgent provoking, prodding, warning everyone in sight that complacency is death." Bob Reich There are two basic approaches to the management of change (Bennett, 1997). These are:
- To predict all environmental changes relevant to the organisation that might occur and then anticipate how the organisation will be affected by them
- To list all the organisation's major functions and follow this by an analysis of environmental factors that might affect the functions
Once the organisation identifies the need for change, it should assess the possible implications of this change. This may require:
- Definition of alterations in operational methods, staffing levels and the employee's attitudes and perspectives necessary to implement alterations.
- New equipment and systems.
- Redesigning of jobs.
- Restructuring of jobs.
- Restructuring the organisation.

\section*{Resistance to Change}

Employees may fear change because of its potential for the disruption of the existing status quo in the organisation. The following are some of the reasons why people resist change:
- Insecurity, fear of unforeseen consequences and threats to individual status.
- Skills and experience acquired may have no further value.
- Possible collapse of work groups and interpersonal relationships.

To reduce or avoid resistance to change, we can help the employees go through a change process. Kurt Lewin suggested three steps to overcome resistance:
- Unfreeze, that is, getting rid of existing practices and ideas that stand in the way of change. This requires a high level of communication with employees to convince them that change is necessary.
- Change, that is, teaching employees to think and perform differently.
- Refreeze, that is, establishing new norms and standard practices.

To implement the change process the following approaches will be necessary.

\section*{Education and Communication}

This is to make employees fully aware of all aspects of the situation and convince them that change is essential.

\section*{Participation and Involvement}

The employees should actively participate and get involved from the beginning so as to stimulate commitment.

\section*{Patience and Tolerance}

Management should give support and assistance needed.
A nurse manager has an important role in initiating and managing change. They should recognise the obstacles to change and assist employees to go through the change process.

\section*{Health Information Systems}

The use of computers in health care is a rapidly growing area. As nursing care becomes more computerised and geared towards telehealth, nurses must be well prepared to be at the cutting edge of information technology (IT). The health care system in Kenya is rapidly changing for the better and the nurse in Kenya needs to be well prepared in meeting the information technology challenges. One of the nurses' new roles will be agents of change in health care revolution (Ball 2005). Studies have shown that nurses spend as little as $15 \%$ of their time on direct patient care. As much as half their time goes into documentation. Clinical documentation is an area where IT has had a major influence. As they help coordinate all the multifaceted activities related to
patients, nurses must ensure that every aspect of diagnosis and care is carefully documented. Documentation poses a tremendous, often unmanageable, challenge and has become the root cause of many patients' safety and related legal problems (Ball 2005). The key to embracing IT is computer literacy among the nurse care providers.

\section*{Information Technology}

This is the acquisition, processing and dissemination of information using computers. Whereas in the past and even today in some institutions, information handling involved dependence on paper, the emphasis is now shifting to creation, storage and transmission of information through tiny electrical impulses. Paper no doubt will continue to be important as a tangible product of the interchange of information. Nevertheless, computers are likely to dominate the scene.
Most healthcare institutions collect comprehensive information about their patients. They also have information on administrative matters related to staff, equipment, supplies and so on. All this information is kept in records, which are either in written documents, tapes or computers.
Records are an important tool in controlling and assessing the workplace. Records should be accurate, accessible and useful.
To achieve goals and maintain efficiency and effectiveness, the organisation uses a variety of tools to collect information, analyse data and make predictions about outcomes. The facts used to produce information, for example, admissions, invoices, receipts, stock issues are termed as 'data' while the process that transforms raw data into information, useful items or summaries of data, is called data processing. The raw data is input into the system whereas information is output, that is, processed data. The process that converts input into output involves sorting, storing, amending, calculating, deleting or retrieving data. Information must be relevant, easily understood, up to date and easily available to the users. This can only be achieved if nurses are computer literate.

\section*{Computer Literacy}

Computer literacy is 'the minimum knowledge, know how, familiarity, capabilities and abilities in regard to computers' (Burk 1985, 33). According to the western Illinois university senate's committee on computer literacy, the basic competencies considered for academic success are:
- Use of word processing programs effectively
- Use of library databases and catalogues to locate print materials
- Ability to find information on the Internet and evaluate its reliability and usefulness
- Ability to write email effectively and appreciate the ethical issues of computing Information literacy is a fundamental skill. It is, in fact, the first component on the continuum of critical thinking skills. It includes the ability to identify a lack of information, and decide what information is needed as well as the ability to evaluate and organise the available information (Brevet 1991).

\section*{Nursing Informatics}

Nursing Informatics is a specialty that integrates nursing science, computer science, and information science to manage and communicate data, information, and knowledge in nursing practice.
Nursing informatics facilitates the integration of data, information and knowledge to support patients, nurses and other providers in their decision making in all roles and settings. This support is accomplished through the use of information structures, information processes, and
information
technology (ANA 2001, vii).
Ball and Hannah (1988), provide a comprehensive description of nursing informatics as the use of any information technology by nurses in relation to the care of patients, the administration of health care facilities, or the educational preparation of individuals to practice the discipline of nursing.
They suggest that nursing informatics includes, but is not limited to:
- The use of artificial intelligence or decision making systems to support the nursing process.
- The use of a computer based scheduling package to allocate staff in a hospital or health
care organisation.
- The use of computers for patient education.
- The use of computer assisted learning in nursing education.
- The use of hospital information systems.
- The use of data and information generated from research to form a basis for evidence based practice.

\section*{Advantages of Computers to Nurses and Nursing Services}
- Time saving is often the most sought after benefit since nurses are keener on doing than on recording (Strachen, 1994).
Speedier recording is possible using core care plans, and with the use of technology such as bar coders, light pens, or voice recognition.
All that is required is a structured language or terminology that can be coded.
- Computers can process information far quicker than the human brain .The vast amount of data nurses collect and record is put to very little use because it takes too long to analyse. All the nurse needs to do is to decide what information they need, what data to collect, how it should be analysed and the computer will do the rest.
- Printed care plans are easier to read than manual records with numerous changes by unknown nurses. The computer can automatically track any changes made to a care plan.
- Computers improve accuracy. A person repeating the same complex calculation one hundred times is likely to get a dozen
different answers. A rigorously tested computer repeating the same calculation one hundred times will get the same answer each time.
- Computer software can be designed to undertake validity checks on data, rules can be added, comparisons made and reminders given. These help reduce human error and improve the accuracy of nursing records.
- Improved communication can offer patients considerable benefits.

If a network is in place, a computer terminal can be used to access nursing records, day or night, by those who have been granted access to the system through use of passwords. The possibility of better access increases the risk of unauthorised entry into
the system. These concerns must be compared with the present reality, for example, how secure are the current records and does the computer offer better security. All that is required is good design, user education and a well managed computer system.
- Computers can offer easier retrieval of information simply through the touch of a button. Nurses can ask questions and get answers from their own data, for example, how many patients developed pressure sores or how many patients with a sore had a high risk on the Norton scale.

\section*{Advantages of Computers to Nurses and Nursing Services}

Other benefits include:
- Preventing the duplication of collection and recording of demographic details.
- Linking treatments and procedures with orders to suppliers, pharmacy or catering services.
- Linking nursing cases to research references, producing discharge plans for patients or summaries of care and treatment for other health care professionals and so on.
A Health information system is an integrated system used in health care settings to manage patient information. It is primarily a centralised patient record of demographics, health and financial information (Yoderwise 1999). The information is entered, stored, retrieved, displayed and communicated. A major function is to communicate and integrate patient care data and information, and provide management support.
Health data is entered into the system from computer stations located in the various departments in the organisation and stored in a central computer to be accessed by all patient care services. The systems contain a central database that is written to and accessed by all departments, for example, nursing, laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, physiotherapy and so on. The programs that link the individual departments must be able to 'talk' to one another in order to exchange patient data. For example, the wards need access to laboratory results or the pharmacy may need access to the ward for information like patient height, weight or allergies as entered by the nurse in the patient's clinical chart.
The nurse managers and staff must understand the patient care process from a data information knowledge perspective. They must be aware of the data collected, reasons why it is collected and decisions made based on the data.
The type of information that can be tracked in this system includes:
- Appointments, admissions, discharges and transfers.
- Medication profiles, for instance, prescriptions and allergy reports.
- Care planning.
- Patient acuities.
- Human resources, including staff pay roll, performance, incident reports and staff scheduling.
- Plans, for example, budgeting information.

An information system must provide the following (Yoder-Wise, 1999):
- Information confidentiality and security
- Uniform data definitions
- Standard format for transmitting data
- Sharing of information between departments
- Linking of clinical and financial information
- Patient specific data

An effective health information system is important in order to get the health information required for appropriate planning and decision making. It also assists in monitoring and evaluating the various activities within the organisation.

\section*{SECTION 5: MANAGING NURSING CARE SERVICES}

\section*{Introduction}

This section will examine the different health care organisations within which the nurse manager functions and the types of nursing care delivery systems. You will be able to apply various concepts already learned, which will enable you manage the nursing care services in your organisation more effectively and efficiently.

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this section you will be able to:
- Analyse the different types of health care organisations
- Describe the management of nursing care services
- Describe the different types of nursing care delivery systems
- Identify legal and ethical issues in nursing practice

\section*{Health Care Organisations}

\section*{Ownership}

Health care organisations have various designations. Private organisations are directed and supported by private citizens. They are usually owned by corporations, associations or religious groups, for example, private or mission hospitals. They can further be divided into two categories. The non profit category ploughs back all profits to its operation or the community while the commercial category distributes profits to investors or shareholders. Meanwhile, government health care organisations are government or state owned. The majority of our organisations in Kenya fall under this category.

\section*{Role or Services Offered}

These range from specialty institutions, which provide for a specific disease or section of the population, for example, psychiatric or children's needs, to those referred to as general, which provide a full range of services for the whole population. These services may include acute care, ambulatory and rehabilitative services.

\section*{Activity and Size}

These mainly refer to teaching institutions, which have both a general hospital and a teaching hospital, for example, the Kenyatta National Hospital.

In section four, you covered what an organisation is and how organisations are structured. You will now look at health care organisations. Nurses practice in many different types of health care organisations where they provide direct and indirect care services to patients.

\section*{For more information on the different services provided by nurses, refer to module three.}

Health care organisations make up the health care system, which provides all the services offered by all health disciplines. Today, many types of health care organisations exist. These differ in terms of:

\section*{Types of Health Care Organisations}

You have looked at how health care organisations are classified. There are four main types of health care organisations. These are:

\section*{Hospitals}

These are institutions whose purpose is to serve the whole community, sick or well. Hospitals play a significant role and provide preventive, curative, rehabilitative and health promotion services as well as education and research.

Hospitals are classified into acute care facilities, where the average length of stay is less than thirty days and chronic or long term hospitals, which are designated to care for patients whose average length of stay is longer than thirty days.
The services provided by hospitals include:
- Medical care, that is, the care given by doctors to meet the needs of patients, for example, surgical.
- Nursing services, that is, the care given by the nurses in coordination with other health care team members.
- Emergency care, that is, care given at any time of need for people requiring emergency measures, for instance, acute trauma accident cases, intoxication or poisoning.
- Diagnostic services, which include radiological and pathological services.
- Drug therapy, that is, most hospitals should have a good pharmacy with the drugs required for the care of patients.
- Dietary services, which are important for the nutrition of patients.
- Rehabilitative and recreational services, which contribute to the well being of patients and are therefore, therapeutic.

\section*{Ambulatory Based Organisations}

This is the second type of health care organisation. Many health services are provided on an ambulatory basis. This refers to the care given by private physicians or in hospitals as outpatient care. The goal is to focus on out patient preventive care and patient follow up care. This serves to reduce the cost of expensive acute hospital care.

\section*{Health Managed Organisation (HMO)}

The other type of health care organisation is the HMO. This is a new concept in Kenya, which is catching up quickly. This is where an organisation gets people to enrol and pay a fixed periodic fee to the organisation, which determines the kind of services used. The HMO offers hospital and out patient services. Examples of these include insurance companies who cover medical expenses.

\section*{Home Health Care Organisation}

The last type of health care organisation is home based. The services in this case are offered at home. Professional nurses provide care. They assess the patients' ability to take care of themselves and identify the resources needed to overcome problems and meet patients' needs. These include patients' requiring palliative care, chronically ill patients, the disabled or the elderly.
The nurse manager plays a significant role in all the above health care organisations particularly in managing nursing services.

\section*{Managing Nursing Services}

The nurse as a leader and manager must ensure that the nursing services are run effectively and efficiently.
This refers to the coordinating responsibility of the nurse, who, in addition to giving care, also works with members of the health care team in providing a comprehensive programme of nursing care (Basavanthappa 2000). The nurse's main task is to link the team or a nursing department to the larger organisation and to the resources necessary to achieve the objectives. The following are the main responsibilities as regards to managing nursing services:
- The nursing service must be operational twenty four hours a day, seven days a week all year round.
- High quality nursing care must be provided to patients taking into consideration their physical, social, psychological and spiritual needs.
- Resolution of health care delivery problems.
- Policy development.
- Planning, organising, directing and controlling materials and human resources in order to provide effective care. This was covered in sections two and three.
- Utilising the appropriate methods of patient assignment in order to deliver care to patients.
- Research for knowledge generation, better understanding of issues and engineering new methods of management, that is, innovation.

\section*{Nursing Care Delivery Systems}

The practice of nursing has emerged as an aggregate of complicated duties and responsibilities. There is, therefore, a need to develop certain systems, methods or modalities to ensure delivery of quality care. There are four methods of assignment of patient care in a hospital. These are:
- Case Assignment
- Functional Nursing
- Team Nursing
- Primary Nursing

The changes in these modalities or systems are a response to ever changing needs. These methods may be used separately or to complement one another.

\section*{Case Assignment Method}

This was the first method to be identified in nursing care delivery.
It was popular in the 1920's. Each patient is assigned to a nurse for total patient care while the nurse is on duty. If they go off duty, the work is handed over promptly to another nurse. This means that the patient has a different nurse each shift. Assignment is made according to the
severity of illness and tends to be mostly for acutely ill patients, for example, in the intensive care unit (ICU).

\section*{Functional Nursing}

The second method is known as the functional nursing method.It was the first major deviation from case method. It began in the early 1950's when there were few registered nurses and more practical nurses available.
Nurse aides provided most of the patient care.
This method emphasises the division of labour according to specific tasks. It is 'task or thing oriented' and is determined by the technical aspects of the job to be done. Each nurse has a clearly defined set of tasks determined by complexity, including skills, knowledge and experience in certain nursing techniques, for example, drug administration, wound dressing, bed baths and so on.
In this approach, the nurse in charge must have experience and exceptional knowledge in nursing. The nurse must know the skill level of their workers in order to make accurate assignments. The nurse in charge establishes rigid routines, structures and time schedules. This method has several advantages:
- It emphasises the efficient delivery of care
- There is little likelihood of confusion over who will do what
- Minimal time is spent coordinating activities
- It is economical in that it allows for the use of less skilled personnel
- Each member can become highly skilled if they do the same tasks repetitively

It proves particularly useful when workers have limited knowledge and experience, facilities and equipment and there is a shortage of staff.
However, there are some disadvantages. These include:
- The nurse tends to lose close contact with patients.
- Fragmentation of care rather than total care. This means that the patient's needs may be overlooked because of failure to fit in compartments or task categories, for example, there may be a nurse skilled in administering medication but none skilled in dealing with anxiety.
- Continuity of care is difficult if not impossible since no single staff member has a complete picture of the client's needs and responses to nursing or medical interventions.
- There is little avenue for development.

\section*{Team Nursing}

Team nursing was introduced in the late 1950's to improve nursing services by utilising the knowledge and skills of professional nurses and to supervise the increasing number of auxiliary staff. The philosophy supports achieving goals through group action or team spirit. Team nursing can be organised in the following manner:
- A group or team of nurses with different levels of skills are assigned to a group of patients. The size and composition of the team is dependent upon the setting.
- The team works together to accomplish a goal.
- They focus on patient centred as opposed to task oriented assignments. These are based on patient needs and the knowledge, skills and experiences of team members.
- A member of the work group is assigned as a leader. In the original concept, the team was led by a registered nurse.
- The leadership role may be permanent or rotated.
- The team works together with each member performing the tasks for which they are best prepared.
- Team members report to the team leader who reports to the head nurse.
- Success is dependent upon effective communication.

This approach has several strengths. These include:
- It allows individual members to make personal and useful suggestions.
- It combines the best thinking of all team members about patients' problems and improves the quality of decision making.
- It cultivates team spirit, which affects the climate and continuity of care.
- There is fragmentation of care and better utilisation of personnel in the performance of quality care.
- There is also the potential for leadership development and it encourages greater staff satisfaction due to increased guidance and better matching of assignments to skills.
As an individualised care approach, it is often more satisfying to patients. The patients are cared for by a limited number of nurses who know them better. This provides an opportunity for more therapeutic and enhanced nurse patient relationships.
However, there are also weaknesses associated with this approach. These include:
- It may be difficult to find the time needed for team planning and conferences. This would mean that at times, care plans are not comprehensive enough.
- The time spent in coordinating delegated work and supervision can prove expensive.
- Logistics may hamper team nursing, for example, four or five nurses converging at a medicine cupboard designed to support one nurse

\section*{Primary Nursing}

This is a newer approach to the delivery of nursing services.
The concept was developed in the early 1970s and is used by many institutions in the developed world. People are becoming more aware of it in this country and some institutions have begun to incorporate it.
The following is the basis for assignment:
- A professional nurse, usually a registered nurse, is assigned to a patient for their total hospital stay or to a small group of patients, not more than four or five.
- This nurse assumes responsibility for twenty four hours a day for the duration of the patient's stay in hospital.
- The primary nurse assesses plans and executes the plan or may delegate to a secondary or associate nurse to execute the plan during her absence.
- Every nurse serves as the primary nurse for a few patients and as an associate nurse for other patients on other shifts.
- The primary nurse communicates with the physician and coordinates care with other health workers.
- The chief nurse functions as a coordinator of the unit and is a resource person for the primary nurses.

This system has the following advantages:
- It encourages a one to one relationship and in so doing promotes total patient care by virtue of the quality of interaction.
- The nurse coordinates all aspects of care, including the physical, social and psychological, which ensures the continuity of care.
- This method promotes increased autonomy and responsibility leading to job satisfaction due to involvement.
- Clients are satisfied as a result of their increased interaction with one nurse who is knowledgeable.
However, there are also several disadvantages associated with this method. These include:
- It limits professional mobility. An associate nurse may find it difficult to follow plans made by another nurse.
- It requires high levels of expertise and commitment from all nurses, that is, patient care may suffer if the nurse is not competent enough to perform all the tasks assigned.
- Primary nursing requires competent practitioners who can function independently when utilising the nursing process. However, not all nurses are comfortable in accepting this responsibility.
- It may be less economical than the other methods since it may require a larger percentage of registered nurses.

\section*{Legal and Ethical Issues In Nursing}

You have examined the different types of health care organisations and the responsibilities of the nurse manager in the management of nursing services within these organisations. As the manager works and supervises the work of employees, they must be knowledgeable and conversant with the laws and ethics that govern nursing practice.
In module one, you covered legal and ethical issues in nursing.In this section, you will examine the role of the manager in this area.
The manager has a responsibility to apply legal and ethical principles in their work and monitor the practice of employees under their supervision.

\section*{Legal Issues}

The legal responsibility refers to the obligation upon nurses to obey the law in professional activities. The professional nurse should understand their legal responsibility when taking care of patients and be aware of their limitations.
Patients have a right to expect professionals to live up to certain safety standards and to demonstrate responsibility and accountability.
The scope of nursing practice is defined and guided by the nursing practice act and the common law. The nursing practice act provides legal regulation for licensure, while common law is derived from legal doctrine and consists of both broad and comprehensive principles based on justice, reason and common sense. The two are responsible for educational and examination requirements, providing licensing for those who meet professional requirements and defining the functions of each category, for example, registered nurse or enrolled nurse. Nursing practice should not leave room for negligence or malpractice because this can lead to litigation. Litigation is being taken to a court of law by a patient who makes a claim for damages or compensation.

\section*{Ethical Issues}

Ethics have always been an integral part of nursing. Throughout your nursing practice you have applied the nursing code of ethics. The ethics provide the standards for professional behaviour in terms of what is expected of nurses. They are based on the principles of what is right or wrong. The nurses' code of ethics serves as a self regulatory mechanism and a source of guidelines for individual behaviour and responsibility.

As mentioned earlier, the nurse manager plays a significant role to ensure that the law and ethics are applied appropriately in
nursing practice. The following are some of the roles and functions expected of them:
- Serves as a role model by providing care that meets and exceeds accepted standard of care.
- Ensures that their conduct is as per the nursing code of ethics.
- Makes sure that their staff confine themselves to the scope of nursing practice according to registration, licensure and enrolment.
- Delegates to subordinates wisely.
- Provides educational and training opportunities for staff on legal issues.
- Is aware and makes staff aware about their own values and basic beliefs about the rights of human beings.
- Advocates for clients, subordinates and the profession.
