                        <p>In the preceding sections, you covered the various concepts, principles and functions of management which a nurse manager utilises in the day to day running of a unit. This involves a series of activities that must be performed to achieve certain objectives. The achievement of these objectives will depend on how well knowledge and skills are applied to a problem, using resources in the most efficient way. To some extent, you have already referred to some of the most important resources, for example, manpower. Nursing management often takes place in situations of scarce resources, and therefore, the main role of the nurse manager is to achieve the greatest results with the resources available. You will also cover change management and health information systems.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Objectives</h2>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Human Resource Management</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The shift in terminology from 'personnel' to 'human resources' is symbolic of a true change in the field. The term human resource reflects the position that people are a resource that needs to be managed strategically in support of the organisation's mission. The effective functioning of an organisation depends upon various resources. Human resources or manpower is one of the most vital resources for the labour intensive health institution. Human resource management can be said to be an integral part of the role of any person who is responsible for the work of others. In this module, human resource management will refer to a group of specialists concerned with increasing the effectiveness of staff performance in an organisation.</p>
                        <p>According to Basawanthappa (2002), the main objectives of human resource management are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Effective utilisation of human resources to enable the achievement of organisational goals.</li>
                            <li>Establishment and maintenance of an adequate organisational structure and desirable working relationship among staff.</li>
                            <li>Securing integration of the individual and informal groups with the organisation and thereby ensuring their commitment, involvement and loyalty.</li>
                            <li>Recognition and satisfaction of individual needs and group goals.</li>
                            <li>Provision of maximum opportunities for individual development and advancement.</li>
                            <li>Maintenance of high morals in organisations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Bearing in mind the objectives covered previously, you will now look at the main aspects of human resource management. These include:</p>
                        
                        <h4>Forecasting Future Manpower Requirements</h4>
                        <p>This involves estimating the institution's demand for labour and matching this with what is available.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Formulating and Proposing Policies</h4>
                        <p>Formulation of human resource policies is done by the human resource management department. The policies have to be agreed upon by top management. The key areas of personnel policy include recruitment and selection, terms and conditions of employment, training and development as well as labour union issues, for example, laid down procedures on how to handle strikes and disputes. These personnel policies are guidelines for behaviour and state how the organisation will respond in relation to employee affairs.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Recruitment of Staff</h4>
                        <p>This involves preparing job descriptions and specifications, drafting job advertisements, interviewing candidates and assessing appropriate salary levels for new employees. A job description states the principal duties, responsibilities and the scope of authority. A job specification also spells out the vital qualities required in an employee for them to be able to perform a job adequately, for example, specific knowledge, skills, ability and behaviour. These must be prepared before advertising for any job.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Staff Training and Development</h4>
                        <p>Once the employees join the organisation, they require training. This involves induction of new employees as well as training and development. This was covered in more detail in section two. Human resources are the most dynamic of all the organisation's resources. Training and development is important in order to maintain the key skills within the organisation and motivate the staff. This is to enable them to realise their full potential. The human resources department has the responsibility of assessing the training needs, designing training methodology and evaluating training activities to determine their effectiveness.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Staff Retention</h4>
                        <p>It is essential to retain employees within an organisation. Promoting staff is one way of retaining employees. This allows them to advance from one given grade to a higher one. Promotions are based on whether an individual meets the requirements as specified in the job description. The career structure or recognised promotional path should provide an opportunity for all workers to get promoted.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Health and Safety</h4>
                        <p>The employees should be informed about their rights and duties, occupational hazards should be identified and accident prevention measures put in place. First aid facilities should also be at hand.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Welfare</h4>
                        <p>Welfare services are provided for matters concerning employees which are not immediately connected with their jobs although they may be connected generally with their place of work. These include counselling, problems of health or sickness, social and sporting activities, restaurants, child care facilities and special services for retired employees.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Consultation and Negotiation</h4>
                        <p>Opportunities should exist for collective bargaining and liasing with trade unions. Trade unions should be utilised by management as an avenue for consultation and joint planning with employees. Trade unions should not be viewed as antagonists but a partner in planning and decision making. If employees through their trade unions felt appreciated, they would be motivated to perform better and improve the image of the organisation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Labour Management Relations</h4>
                        <p>Labour management relations has been defined as 'the effort to develop harmonious working relations between employees and management in order for a firm to increase productivity, improve quality of work life and remain competitive'.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Objectives of Labour Management Relations</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To enhance a healthy relationship between employers and employees, that is, a sound, harmonious and mutually beneficial relationship.</li>
                            <li>To safeguard the interests of employees and management by securing mutual understanding and goodwill between them.</li>
                            <li>To avoid industrial and workplace conflict that could affect production and productivity.</li>
                            <li>To preventing or reduce labour turnover and frequent absenteeism.</li>
                            <li>To nurture and sustain workplace democracy in order to enhance employee participation in decision making and problem solving.</li>
                            <li>To eliminate strikes, lockouts and go slows.</li>
                            <li>To allow the government some control over private means of production, distribution and service provision in the public interest.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The management should never be caught up in a surprise strike if they have been in good relations and communication with the employees. Those in Management positions should not be members of trade unions.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In the previous section, you covered the management of human resources. In this part, you are going to examine financial resource management. Managing finances is one of the most important roles of a nurse manager. Arguments have been put forward that this function should be left to accountants who are specialised in this area. However, if nurses do not have the basic skills to enable them manage finances, they will not succeed in providing nursing services. Most of the resources you will be managing are acquired with money. Financial planning requires that the manager identifies objectives, policies and procedures. The budget is one of the main tools of financial management.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Budgeting</h3>
                        <p>In simple terms, budgeting involves managing money and how it is used to maintain other resources. A budget is a means of control, which reflects the plan against which actual performance is measured. It can also be defined as a means of checking the progress made in keeping the expenses and costs in compliance with an organisation's financial plans. Budgeting is the process of planning and controlling future operations by comparing actual results with planned budgetary expectations. The following are some of the purposes of a budget:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To avoid spending more than an organisation can afford</li>
                            <li>To aid in planning and controlling</li>
                            <li>To assist in assessing the financial requirements of the institution</li>
                            <li>To indicate the areas in which money raised or received will be spent</li>
                            <li>To facilitate comparison of actual performance with budgeted targets</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In order to draw up a meaningful budget, the hospital should have a clearly defined organisational structure with responsibilities defined and assigned. Personnel at all levels of management should participate in budget development. The personnel involved should have an understanding of the ideas and financial goals of the hospital. There must be an adequate system, which provides reliable financial and statistical information to the responsible people. The budget should allow enough freedom to accomplish departmental objectives and must be flexible enough to allow for unpredictable expenditures. There are two main types of budgets, which the nurse may be involved in preparing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Operational or Annual Budget</li>
                            <li>Capital Budget</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Operational or Annual Budget</h4>
                        <p>This is the organisation's statement of expected revenue or income and expenses for the coming year. It coincides with the fiscal year. The fiscal year is a specified twelve month period during which the operational and financial performance of the organisation is measured. It usually coincides with the calendar year, that is, it runs from January to December or may follow another time frame, for example, the government calendar, which runs from July to June. The operational budget includes the accumulated estimates of operating revenues and expenses. In nursing management, the revenue is derived from patient fees. Actual payment is generated by a given service or procedure. The expenses consist of salary and non salary items, for example, personnel emoluments and education, including in service training, on the job training, educational leave and travel scholarships. They may also include personnel uniforms, books, periodical subscriptions, laundry, medical equipment and maintenance, drugs and pharmaceuticals, non pharmaceutical supplies, legal and professional fees and stationery. The expenses should be comprehensive and thorough. Budgets are prepared by the heads of each ward or department in consultation with staff. Thereafter, the matron, chief nurse or director of nursing services compiles the nursing division budget. In some cases, the director of nursing services prepares a budget for the whole of the nursing division.</p>

                        <p>As you can see from the figure, the income and expenditure parts of the budget have the same totals, that is, they balance. A budget that has a higher income than expenditure is said to show a surplus while the one with a higher expenditure shows a deficit. If there is a deficit in the budget, it means you have spent more money than you have. This may require you to borrow money or be indebted to your suppliers.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Capital Budget</h4>
                        <p>This is the second type of budget. It outlines the need for major equipment or physical changes in the organisation requiring large sums of money, for example, physical renovations, new construction and new or replacement equipment. Organisations define capital items based on certain criteria, for instance, the item must have an expected performance of a minimum of one year or more and exceed a certain shilling value, for example, fifty thousand. The criteria vary from one hospital to another. Requests for capital items are usually made on a special form or letter, accompanied by a written justification for the item. If there are a large number of items requested, a priority list should be set. Where possible, the period within which items are needed should be specified. Capital costs should consider long term goals and must complement the organisational objectives. All nurse managers are involved in the budgeting process. Preparation begins several months before the end of the fiscal year to allow time for careful preparation. In a decentralised system, budget preparation has several steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Review of policies, standards and objectives.</li>
                            <li>Top level management projections for the future and preparation of guidelines.</li>
                            <li>Middle level nurse managers prepare the annual budget.</li>
                            <li>The administrator of nursing services, finance director or manager reviews the budget.</li>
                            <li>Budget is accepted or modified.</li>
                            <li>Budget is implemented and regularly evaluated.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>So far you have managed human resources and money. The other resource that a manager is concerned with in the organisation is the materials. Materials refer to drugs, supplies and equipment needed by the nurses and other health personnel to deliver services. For quality and efficient services, the materials must be provided at the right place, at the right time and in the right quantity. Materials are essential if the health care institution is to achieve its objectives. The nurse manager should know the policies and procedures that relate to materials management. You should be familiar with the following activities:</p>
                        
                        <h4>Demand Estimation</h4>
                        <p>Since a large quantity of materials is used in hospitals, you need to identify your requirements or needs beforehand.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Procurement</h4>
                        <p>Having developed your list of requirements, the next step is procurement or ordering. Some institutions have laid out specific rules and regulations regarding procurement. This is aimed at reducing wastage and maximising the value of money.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Receipt and Inspection</h4>
                        <p>The materials received should be subjected to either physical or chemical inspection. This ensures that you received the right quality and quantity of materials as requested by the organisation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Inventory Control</h4>
                        <p>Adequate quantities of materials should be available whenever required. Close supervision of movement of materials or consumption rate is a good tool for proper control.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Storage</h4>
                        <p>The materials should be placed in a store within or near the institution. The store should be of adequate size to accommodate all the different materials required, for example, fridges, shelves and cupboards. The materials should also be stored in appropriate conditions, for example, temperature, light as specified by the manufacturer. It is, therefore, important that the nurse manager adopts the proper procedures for materials management.</p>

                        <p>Time is an important resource although in many cases, it is not thought of as such. It is sometimes referred to as one of the M's of management and stands for moments. The other M's being money, manpower and materials. For example, you may recall times when you have wished that a day had more than twenty four hours or that a week had more than seven days so that you can accomplish the tasks you had set out to do. This often happens when you are not managing time well. The demands on time as a manager and a health care provider fall into three categories (Nduba 1999):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tasks that have to be performed. These relate to key responsibilities, for example, clinical or administrative duties.</li>
                            <li>Tasks that other people pressurise you into doing. Some of these are important and must be done while others you do because you do not want to say no.</li>
                            <li>Tasks that you perform because you want to.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are usually out of choice and include tasks that someone else could do just as well, for example, attending a nurses' association meeting.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Time Waster</h3>
                        <p>This is something that prevents a person from accomplishing a job or achieving a goal. Some of the common time wasters include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Interruptions such as telephone calls and drop in visitors.</li>
                            <li>Lack of clear cut goals, objectives and priorities.</li>
                            <li>Meetings both scheduled and unscheduled.</li>
                            <li>Lack of daily or weekly plans.</li>
                            <li>Lack of self discipline.</li>
                            <li>Failure to delegate.</li>
                            <li>Ineffective communication.</li>
                            <li>Inability to say no.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Principles of Time Management</h3>
                        <p>The following are techniques that you can use to deal with time management constraints.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Goal Setting</h4>
                        <p>The nurse manager sets both organisational and personal goals. The goals are either short or long term and provide direction and vision for actions as well as time frames in which activities will be accomplished.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Time Analysis</h4>
                        <p>The manager should conduct a survey of how they spend a day. Reviewing the daily schedule and keeping it accurate may demonstrate how time is used.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Priority Setting</h4>
                        <p>The nurse manager identifies time frames for achievement of goals. The 'to do' list should be prioritised by classifying activities as 'one' for urgent, 'two' for not urgent but important and 'three' for less important.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Delegation</h4>
                        <p>The nurse manager can delegate those activities that can be effectively handled by juniors.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Controlling Interruptions</h4>
                        <p>The nurse manager should identify causes of interruption and plan to reduce them. One way of doing this is incorporating some of these interruptions into planned and scheduled activities.</p>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Nurse managers must use time wisely to accomplish everything that is expected of them. This takes a lot of planning.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Managing Change</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>By now you should be able to manage resources within the organisation. However, in the current health care system, there are a lot of changes including social, technological and educational, which a nurse manager should be able to respond to and manage. According to the theory of evolution, plants and animals have survived countless changes in the earth's environment. For example, the cockroach has been around for three hundred million years and the shark two hundred million years. This is because they have learnt how to adapt to their environment. They have learnt how to survive. The strong survive and the weak die, it is survival for the fittest. Change has always been, and will always be, a part of us. During your lifetime you must have experienced change in one form or the other, such as moving from one workstation to another, acquisition of new skills or introduction of new methods of nursing care delivery. Change is the process of making something different from what it was. Change is inevitable and nurse managers should understand and anticipate the reactions to change.</p>
                        <blockquote>"It is no longer enough to be a 'change agent.' You must be a change insurgent provoking, prodding, warning everyone in sight that complacency is death." - Bob Reich</blockquote>
                        <p>There are two basic approaches to the management of change (Bennett, 1997). These are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To predict all environmental changes relevant to the organisation that might occur and then anticipate how the organisation will be affected by them</li>
                            <li>To list all the organisation's major functions and follow this by an analysis of environmental factors that might affect the functions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once the organisation identifies the need for change, it should assess the possible implications of this change. This may require:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Definition of alterations in operational methods, staffing levels and the employee's attitudes and perspectives necessary to implement alterations.</li>
                            <li>New equipment and systems.</li>
                            <li>Redesigning of jobs.</li>
                            <li>Restructuring of jobs.</li>
                            <li>Restructuring the organisation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Resistance to Change</h3>
                        <p>Employees may fear change because of its potential for the disruption of the existing status quo in the organisation. The following are some of the reasons why people resist change:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Insecurity, fear of unforeseen consequences and threats to individual status.</li>
                            <li>Skills and experience acquired may have no further value.</li>
                            <li>Possible collapse of work groups and interpersonal relationships.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To reduce or avoid resistance to change, we can help the employees go through a change process. Kurt Lewin suggested three steps to overcome resistance:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Unfreeze</strong>, that is, getting rid of existing practices and ideas that stand in the way of change. This requires a high level of communication with employees to convince them that change is necessary.</li>
                            <li><strong>Change</strong>, that is, teaching employees to think and perform differently.</li>
                            <li><strong>Refreeze</strong>, that is, establishing new norms and standard practices.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To implement the change process the following approaches will be necessary.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Education and Communication</h4>
                        <p>This is to make employees fully aware of all aspects of the situation and convince them that change is essential.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Participation and Involvement</h4>
                        <p>The employees should actively participate and get involved from the beginning so as to stimulate commitment.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Patience and Tolerance</h4>
                        <p>Management should give support and assistance needed. A nurse manager has an important role in initiating and managing change. They should recognise the obstacles to change and assist employees to go through the change process.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The use of computers in health care is a rapidly growing area. As nursing care becomes more computerised and geared towards telehealth, nurses must be well prepared to be at the cutting edge of information technology (IT). The health care system in Kenya is rapidly changing for the better and the nurse in Kenya needs to be well prepared in meeting the information technology challenges. One of the nurses' new roles will be agents of change in health care revolution (Ball 2005). Studies have shown that nurses spend as little as 15% of their time on direct patient care. As much as half their time goes into documentation. Clinical documentation is an area where IT has had a major influence. As they help coordinate all the multifaceted activities related to patients, nurses must ensure that every aspect of diagnosis and care is carefully documented. Documentation poses a tremendous, often unmanageable, challenge and has become the root cause of many patients' safety and related legal problems (Ball 2005). The key to embracing IT is computer literacy among the nurse care providers.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Information Technology</h3>
                        <p>This is the acquisition, processing and dissemination of information using computers. Whereas in the past and even today in some institutions, information handling involved dependence on paper, the emphasis is now shifting to creation, storage and transmission of information through tiny electrical impulses. Paper no doubt will continue to be important as a tangible product of the interchange of information. Nevertheless, computers are likely to dominate the scene. Most healthcare institutions collect comprehensive information about their patients. They also have information on administrative matters related to staff, equipment, supplies and so on. All this information is kept in records, which are either in written documents, tapes or computers. Records are an important tool in controlling and assessing the workplace. Records should be accurate, accessible and useful. To achieve goals and maintain efficiency and effectiveness, the organisation uses a variety of tools to collect information, analyse data and make predictions about outcomes. The facts used to produce information, for example, admissions, invoices, receipts, stock issues are termed as 'data' while the process that transforms raw data into information, useful items or summaries of data, is called data processing. The raw data is input into the system whereas information is output, that is, processed data. The process that converts input into output involves sorting, storing, amending, calculating, deleting or retrieving data. Information must be relevant, easily understood, up to date and easily available to the users. This can only be achieved if nurses are computer literate.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Computer Literacy</h3>
                        <p>Computer literacy is 'the minimum knowledge, know how, familiarity, capabilities and abilities in regard to computers' (Burk 1985, 33). According to the western Illinois university senate's committee on computer literacy, the basic competencies considered for academic success are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use of word processing programs effectively</li>
                            <li>Use of library databases and catalogues to locate print materials</li>
                            <li>Ability to find information on the Internet and evaluate its reliability and usefulness</li>
                            <li>Ability to write email effectively and appreciate the ethical issues of computing Information literacy is a fundamental skill. It is, in fact, the first component on the continuum of critical thinking skills. It includes the ability to identify a lack of information, and decide what information is needed as well as the ability to evaluate and organise the available information (Brevet 1991).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Nursing Informatics</h3>
                        <p>Nursing Informatics is a specialty that integrates nursing science, computer science, and information science to manage and communicate data, information, and knowledge in nursing practice. Nursing informatics facilitates the integration of data, information and knowledge to support patients, nurses and other providers in their decision making in all roles and settings. This support is accomplished through the use of information structures, information processes, and information technology (ANA 2001, vii). Ball and Hannah (1988), provide a comprehensive description of nursing informatics as the use of any information technology by nurses in relation to the care of patients, the administration of health care facilities, or the educational preparation of individuals to practice the discipline of nursing. They suggest that nursing informatics includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The use of artificial intelligence or decision making systems to support the nursing process.</li>
                            <li>The use of a computer based scheduling package to allocate staff in a hospital or health care organisation.</li>
                            <li>The use of computers for patient education.</li>
                            <li>The use of computer assisted learning in nursing education.</li>
                            <li>The use of hospital information systems.</li>
                            <li>The use of data and information generated from research to form a basis for evidence based practice.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Advantages of Computers to Nurses and Nursing Services</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Time saving is often the most sought after benefit since nurses are keener on doing than on recording (Strachen, 1994). Speedier recording is possible using core care plans, and with the use of technology such as bar coders, light pens, or voice recognition. All that is required is a structured language or terminology that can be coded.</li>
                            <li>Computers can process information far quicker than the human brain. The vast amount of data nurses collect and record is put to very little use because it takes too long to analyse. All the nurse needs to do is to decide what information they need, what data to collect, how it should be analysed and the computer will do the rest.</li>
                            <li>Printed care plans are easier to read than manual records with numerous changes by unknown nurses. The computer can automatically track any changes made to a care plan.</li>
                            <li>Computers improve accuracy. A person repeating the same complex calculation one hundred times is likely to get a dozen different answers. A rigorously tested computer repeating the same calculation one hundred times will get the same answer each time.</li>
                            <li>Computer software can be designed to undertake validity checks on data, rules can be added, comparisons made and reminders given. These help reduce human error and improve the accuracy of nursing records.</li>
                            <li>Improved communication can offer patients considerable benefits.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If a network is in place, a computer terminal can be used to access nursing records, day or night, by those who have been granted access to the system through use of passwords. The possibility of better access increases the risk of unauthorised entry into the system. These concerns must be compared with the present reality, for example, how secure are the current records and does the computer offer better security. All that is required is good design, user education and a well managed computer system.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Computers can offer easier retrieval of information simply through the touch of a button. Nurses can ask questions and get answers from their own data, for example, how many patients developed pressure sores or how many patients with a sore had a high risk on the Norton scale.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Other benefits include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preventing the duplication of collection and recording of demographic details.</li>
                            <li>Linking treatments and procedures with orders to suppliers, pharmacy or catering services.</li>
                            <li>Linking nursing cases to research references, producing discharge plans for patients or summaries of care and treatment for other health care professionals and so on.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A Health information system is an integrated system used in health care settings to manage patient information. It is primarily a centralised patient record of demographics, health and financial information (Yoderwise 1999). The information is entered, stored, retrieved, displayed and communicated. A major function is to communicate and integrate patient care data and information, and provide management support. Health data is entered into the system from computer stations located in the various departments in the organisation and stored in a central computer to be accessed by all patient care services. The systems contain a central database that is written to and accessed by all departments, for example, nursing, laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, physiotherapy and so on. The programs that link the individual departments must be able to 'talk' to one another in order to exchange patient data. For example, the wards need access to laboratory results or the pharmacy may need access to the ward for information like patient height, weight or allergies as entered by the nurse in the patient's clinical chart. The nurse managers and staff must understand the patient care process from a data information knowledge perspective. They must be aware of the data collected, reasons why it is collected and decisions made based on the data. The type of information that can be tracked in this system includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Appointments, admissions, discharges and transfers.</li>
                            <li>Medication profiles, for instance, prescriptions and allergy reports.</li>
                            <li>Care planning.</li>
                            <li>Patient acuities.</li>
                            <li>Human resources, including staff pay roll, performance, incident reports and staff scheduling.</li>
                            <li>Plans, for example, budgeting information.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An information system must provide the following (Yoder-Wise, 1999):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Information confidentiality and security</li>
                            <li>Uniform data definitions</li>
                            <li>Standard format for transmitting data</li>
                            <li>Sharing of information between departments</li>
                            <li>Linking of clinical and financial information</li>
                            <li>Patient specific data</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An effective health information system is important in order to get the health information required for appropriate planning and decision making. It also assists in monitoring and evaluating the various activities within the organisation.</p>
