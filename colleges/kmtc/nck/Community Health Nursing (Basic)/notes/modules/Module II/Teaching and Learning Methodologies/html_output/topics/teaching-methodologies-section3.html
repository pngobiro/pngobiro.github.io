                        </aside>
                        <p>You looked at a few teaching and learning methods when you covered the lesson plan. This section presents some of the teaching methods commonly used, indicating some of their advantages and disadvantages to guide you in the choices you make.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Learning can be great fun, but only if the right method is applied at the right time to the right type of learner.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Varying methods of teaching can make learning fun because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Individuals are different and one method may be effective for one learner but not for another.</li>
                            <li>Every task involves a number of subtasks, which are carried out differently. One teaching method may not be appropriate for all subtasks.</li>
                            <li>A variation of teaching methods results in a variety of stimuli. This helps to sustain the attention and interest of the learner.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In this section, you will review the most commonly used teaching methods, both traditional and innovative. The amount of information given is limited to a brief overview, advantages and disadvantages.</p>
                        <p>Amri et al (1993) in 'A Guide for Training Teachers of Health Workers' provides more information.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Traditional methods include among others lectures, demonstrations, practicals, role-plays, fieldwork, clinicals, projects and small group discussions. You will look at the innovative methods later in greater detail. For now, you will start with the traditional methods.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Practicals</h3>
                        <p>A practical lesson is where students perform tasks. These practicals could also be performed in their future working areas. Practicals have many advantages and a few disadvantages.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>

                            <li>It requires special accommodation arrangements for students, that is, closer to the area where the practical will take place.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Lecture Method</h3>
                        <p>A lecture is a lesson given orally by a teacher.</p>

                        </aside>

                        <h3>Field Visit</h3>
                        <p>Learners are taken to the actual area where activities are taking place, for example, a factory, school, water treatment plant so that they are able to see and relate to what they have learnt on the specific topic. The field visit may include some practicals.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Students are just passive observers as it may not provide for activity on the part of the students.</li>
                            <li>It may not provide the necessary repetition depending on the individual's pace of learning.</li>
                            <li>It has little regard for students' individual differences.</li>
                            <li>There is no immediate feedback to the instructor on what has been learnt.</li>

                            <li>No teamwork and interpersonal relationships between students.</li>
                            <li>It takes time to prepare materials for individual learning.</li>
                            <li>It has no regard for the students' individual differences.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Seminar or Workshop</h3>
                        <p>A seminar is a session headed by a teacher, a trained senior student or an enthusiastic student from the class, where an assigned subject is discussed. The subject has to be prepared beforehand and presented by the student. The other students will then discuss, criticise and comment on the material presented. The teacher should be available to be consulted by the group. This is important as the students may need to confirm factual information with the teacher.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It promotes interpersonal relationships between students.</li>
                            <li>Students can learn a lot from each other.</li>
                            <li>It allows for teamwork and personal flexibility.</li>
                            <li>Teachers can encourage full participation by all students.</li>
                            <li>It provides creativity and independent thought on the part of students.</li>
                            <li>It provides immediate feedback of knowledge gained.</li>
                            <li>It facilitates exchange of ideas.</li>
                            <li>It trains students to work independently in preparing papers for presentation.</li>
                            <li>It provides greater control of communication between students and teachers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is not an economical way of using manpower unless senior students act as supervisors and teachers are only called in as consultants.</li>
                            <li>It is too slow to cover more than a limited amount of subject matter.</li>
                            <li>It may suffer from interruptions.</li>
                            <li>It cannot provide the repetition necessary for individual needs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Tutorial</h3>
                        <p>A tutorial is a discussion session between a teacher and a small number of students. The smaller the number of students, the more effective the tutorial is. The number of students in a tutorial should not be more than eight. However, the best teacher to student ratio is 1:1. A tutorial must not be a mini-lecture given by the teacher. The teacher should talk as little as possible and encourage the students to think and learn independently.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Communication of knowledge is two-way between teacher and students.</li>
                            <li>It provides personal contact between students and teachers and provides activity for the student.</li>
                            <li>Teachers can give full attention to individual differences between students.</li>
                            <li>It provides an opportunity for detailed discussion of students' work.</li>
                            <li>It provides immediate feedback for both teacher and student.</li>
                            <li>It encourages the creativity of the learner, including the application of the knowledge and problem solving.</li>
                            <li>The learner tends to regard knowledge as an open system. It is relatively effective in changing attitudes.</li>
                            <li>It provides a better understanding of the lectures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is not an economical way of using manpower</li>
                            <li>It moves too slowly and covers only limited subject matter</li>
                            <li>Students need to do some work on the subject beforehand</li>
                            <li>It cannot provide the repetion necessary depending on the individual</li>
                            <li>The instructor or an active student may dominate it</li>
                            <li>It is liable to interruptions</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Project</h3>
                        <p>A project is an assignment given to an individual learner, a pair of learners or a group of learners in which they carry out a piece of independent work on a particular topic. The learners have to organise the assignment and prepare a written report to submit to the teacher. A project may be relatively simple, for example, to be carried out within a week, or it may be more complex, for example, to be carried out over a period of several months or even a year.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It provides activities and calls for creativity on the part of the student.</li>
                            <li>It encourages initiative in the student.</li>
                            <li>It encourages learners to be independent.</li>
                            <li>Learners can work at their own pace.</li>
                            <li>It may provide opportunities for interpersonal relationships between learners and people from other departments.</li>
                            <li>The results of a project provide feedback of students' progress to the teacher.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It takes time to carry out a project.</li>
                            <li>Learners may find that the project adds too much to their workload.</li>
                            <li>It creates administrative problems in arranging programmes.</li>
                            <li>Unless sufficient time is allowed, the learners may produce a superficial report.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Small Group Discussion</h3>
                        <p>Small group discussion is an appropriate technique for encouraging learners to analyse, synthesise and evaluate the knowledge that they acquire (higher order cognitive skills). For example, they may choose to look into the causes of a disease or a custom practised within a community. A group discussion can be instructor-centred or learner-centred (Refer to the unit on Community Diagnosis for Focus Group Discussion).</p>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allows sharing of resources within the group, that is, there is shared commitment to learning. Learners help each other with difficult points.</li>
                            <li>Provides learners with opportunities to interact with the instructor and fellow learners.</li>
                            <li>Learners learn to evaluate the logic of and the evidence for their own and other's positions, that is, learning is through self expression and intercommunication.</li>
                            <li>Allows learners to become active participants in the learning process rather than passive recipients of information from one source. The work motivates students to learn more.</li>
                            <li>Provides an opportunity for the synthesis of varied experiences and data derived from lectures, laboratories, clinics and readings. The student grasps the idea of self learning without fear of failure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dominance of vocal and aggressive members over others in a group may hinder equal growth of all members in the learning process.</li>
                            <li>A group discussion does not guarantee that an objective will be accomplished within a fixed time.</li>
                            <li>The members of the group must bring to the discussion a body of information that is sufficiently broad and deep.</li>
                            <li>Lack of planning by the group leader or the group itself concerning the agenda and specific learning objectives.</li>
                            <li>As the size of the group increases, the efficiency and effectiveness of the method will decrease.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Simulation</h3>
                        <p>This instruction method is used to enable learners to develop skills in dealing with 'real life' situations and 'problems' in a classroom setting. The use of a skills lab such as the one at the Kenya Medical Training College and the practical rooms in other centres are examples. You will have gone through objective-structured practical examination during your training and will agree that it is better to make mistakes in these practical simulations than in the real setting with real patients. There are two methods of simulation - the simulation game and simulators.</p>
                        <h4>Simulation Game</h4>
                        <p>a) Take a written case history. Set multiple choice questions for the learner to answer after reading or listening to the case history.</p>
                        <p>b) Present a recording of chest sounds for the learner to listen to. Ask the learner to report on what they heard. Compare this with the official report.</p>
                        <h4>Simulators</h4>
                        <p>Simulators are operational models such as the obstetrical phantom or model for first aid teaching. They present real life situations and allow the learner to interact by practising skills relevant to the situation.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simulation can create the link between the training situation and the real life situation. The more similar the stimuli in the situations, the more positive transfer there is from one to the other.</li>
                            <li>Simulations provide a responsive environment. There is always some immediate feedback.</li>
                            <li>Simulation is a relatively cheap method and often provides experience in a low cost model for a high cost environment.</li>
                            <li>Simulation can minimise time. Problems of real life can be programmed in advance and dealt with over a variable length of time. The opportunity to confront real problems in hypothetical settings means subsequent problems cause less alarm, greater confidence, and less harm to all involved.</li>
                            <li>Simulation allows learners to make their first serious mistakes in a simulated situation rather than in a real one.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simulation techniques cannot simulate all dimensions of a real life situation.</li>
                            <li>The planning and development time required for a simulation technique may prove to be costly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>The usefulness of simulation depends on its accuracy or true reflection of reality.</p>

                        <h3>Guideposts to Choosing an Appropriate Method</h3>
                        <p>There are few guideposts to choosing an appropriate method. Usually, the choice is primarily based on the lesson objectives. The objective is what you want your learner to be able to do at the end of the session.</p>
                        <p>For example, you may want the learner to be able to:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>List the steps in taking a patient's blood pressure.</li>
                            <li>Take a blood pressure reading</li>
                            <li>Share a health message with a patient, for example, explain to a pregnant woman her dietary requirements.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The skills involved in the three examples are all different.</p>
                        <p>The next step in choosing a teaching and learning method is to consider its practicality.</p>
                        <p>How much time does it require?<br>
                        Where will the teaching take place?<br>
                        How many learners are involved?<br>
                        At what level are the learners?</p>
                        <p>Finally, you should gather the resources required to deliver the lesson. Whatever method you choose, keep in mind that effective learning should always be fun. By gathering resources in advance, you will be sure that your simulators are functioning well and can be manipulated to suit the learning environment.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are different types of teaching skills. Cognitive skills refer to knowledge application, while thinking skills, refer to the ability to make decisions, choose appropriate alternatives and exercise caution. Finally, psychomotor skills relate to the use of the hands, the ability to do things or perform procedures.</p>
                        <p>There are several methods used for teaching skills. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describing the skill.</li>
                            <li>Explaining the reason and stages in performing it.</li>
                            <li>Demonstrating the skill.</li>
                            <li>Performing the skill correctly with an explanation of what you, as the expert, are doing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <blockquote>

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Encourage the learner to practise the skill through projects, simulations, job experience, fieldwork, workshops, laboratory case studies, ward rotation and apprenticeship.</p>

                        </aside>
                        <p>All of the methods discussed in the previous section fall in the category of what are referred to as traditional teaching methods. Some of these methods, however, have been improved in implementation to be referred to as modern or innovative methods. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Problem Based Learning (PBL).</li>
                            <li>Self Directed Learning (SDL).</li>
                            <li>Small Group Tutorial (SGT).</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Of all the innovative methods mentioned, the best known is probably PBL. In this method, instead of hours of lectures and demonstrations by the teacher, a problem is used to guide student learning using the innovative teaching and learning process (steps 3, 7, 10, 15) previously outlined. All that is needed to guide learning is a tutorial problem. Students then follow the steps as guided by their tutor and achieve the intended learning outcomes.</p>

                             <p><strong>What does a 'problem' in PBL mean?</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>A problem may mean any of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A problem that is clinical, theoretical, research based or related to real life.</li>
                            <li>An idea.</li>
                            <li>A situation.</li>
                            <li>An event.</li>
                            <li>An outbreak of disease or disaster.</li>

                        <p>Innovative methods are often used in combination with other methods to facilitate student learning. The SPICES method, which is also a curriculum development strategy, has several characteristics that distinguish it from traditional teaching and learning methods as illustrated in the following table.</p>

                        <p>The main advantage of the innovative methods is that the responsibility for learning is placed on the learner's shoulders. In the process of learning, the learner develops many skills, which gradually transform them into an independent learner. The learning skills they develop include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Problem solving skills</li>

                            <p><strong>Can attitudes be taught?</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Attitudes are rather vague things and are hard to define or explain. They are influenced by one's values and feelings. Despite these problems, you have to try to teach your learners how to acquire the right attitudes to enable them to assist and care for patients.</p>
                        <p>An attitude is a tendency to behave or think in a certain way, for example, having respect for ideas that other people have. Certain attitudes are formed or changed during training. Attitudes can be taught by providing information to shape ideas through lectures, films, stories, providing live examples and so on. In the latter, the teacher acts as a model by letting the learner take part in a role-play.</p>

                            </ul>
                        </aside>
                        <p>There are several ways in which you can provide experiences for learners to develop the right attitudes. For example, seeing a patient suffering from a particular disease touches the feelings of the learner, who may feel sorry for the patient, and may later internalise the situation by imagining themselves in a similar situation. The learner makes a resolution to avoid such a situation and learns how to advise and react towards such patients with empathy.</p>
                        <p>You can also organise small group discussions with seven to twelve participants with specific objectives. You can also provide role-play exercises where learners act the part of different people or patients to reveal some of the feelings involved.</p>
                        <p>In summary, you can best teach attitudes by providing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Information to shape attitudes, for example, facts about AIDS.</li>
                            <li>Examples or models to shape attitudes (advertising goal).</li>
                            <li>Experience to shape attitudes, for example, opportunities to work in a hospital.</li>
                            <li>Discussion to shape attitude, for instance, by sharing your own opinions.</li>
                            <li>Role plays, for example, playing the role of doctor, nurse or patient.</li>

                            <p><strong>How would you describe clinical teaching?</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Clinical teaching is teaching in the clinical or practical setting, similar to the environment within which the learner will practice in future.</p>
                        <h4>What is nursing?</h4>
                        <p>The answer to this question has been provided elsewhere in this module. Earlier on, you identified that your learner is going to be a nurse. Since you have already covered the methods of teaching, you will now highlight the issues that affect the quality of work (nursing) in this section.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Virginia Henderson (1958) states that 'the unique function of the nurse is to assist the individual (sick or well), in the performance of those activities contributing to health, to recovery (or to a peaceful death) that they would perform unaided if they had the necessary strength, will or knowledge.'</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Essentially, nursing is nurturing people back to optimal health. It involves specific tasks or skills each of which can be split up into specific activities to complete a task. The task or skill has content, information or knowledge that explains its purpose, that is, what it is for? and how it should be done?</p>
                        <p>In clinical teaching, you want your learner to put that knowledge into action. You want your student to get involved with the patient. Involvement brings in emotions and feelings. Nursing is 'caring'. It is here that you must teach the learner to empathise. They can nurture and care without getting carried away by the effects of the illness or situation through empathising. Empathising helps the learner to get involved and yet stand apart enough to carry out the necessary professional activities.</p>
                        <p>No learning can take place until certain basic needs have been met. You need to ensure that the physical needs of the learner have been met for them to concentrate. For example, if the learner is wearing uncomfortable shoes on duty, you need to advise them of the importance of wearing comfortable shoes.</p>
                        <p>You may offer alternative solutions or refer the student to somebody who can help them directly. You may not be in a position to do much but the fact that you showed concern will move your learner. The learner also needs to feel that they belong, which is a good way to boost self-esteem. The learner needs to feel welcome. It is important that you establish a good working relationship. A warm smile and a few encouraging words will go a long way to make your student feel settled.</p>
                        <p>When the basic needs mentioned previously get fulfilled, your learner will want to learn at a higher level and exercise mastery of the skills. At this point, you should find out the relevant learning situations available in the clinical setting. Give the students the necessary support to remain successful and encourage them to look for other learning situations on their own.</p>
                        <p>While nursing, the nurse shares the triumphs, sense of achievement, and sadness of the bereaved who have lost a loved one, or the amputee, or the young with a terminal disease. Nursing is giving hope and support toward recovery or relief from discomfort, or toward a peaceful, dignified death.</p>
                        <p>Hope and support will help the patient regain confidence and self reliance.</p>
                        <p>Throughout this process, confidentiality must be maintained to enhance the trust of the patient.</p>
                        <p>As the learner carries out procedures, they need to learn how to contain personal negative feelings, for example, contempt, revulsion of unpleasant sights or aversion. Above all, the learner must learn how to maintain their integrity and the professional code of ethics and etiquette (see module one of this programme for more information). This is necessary because the student will be learning how to protect their patient from malpractice and negligence.</p>
                        <h4>How do you ensure that you are providing quality nursing care?</h4>
                        <p>Mastery of the theory is important because it gives you the foundation. Scientific knowledge adds appropriate technical skills and encourages you to develop the right attitudes. The result is the development of sound clinical judgment, which is the sign of an experienced nurse.</p>

                        <h3>Role of a Clinical Teacher</h3>
                        <p>As you plan to teach in a clinical setting, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the learner performing safely, kindly and with confidence?</li>
                            <li>Is the learner aware of the reason for each procedure?</li>
                            <li>Is the patient the focus of the procedure?</li>
                            <li>Is the demonstration enabling the learner to link with the theory covered earlier?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a clinical teacher, you therefore should be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A skilled, experienced nurse concerned with the maintenance and improvement of standards of patient care.</li>
                            <li>Concerned to help your learner to develop their potential as a nurse.</li>
