                            <p><strong>What is evaluation of student performance?</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Performance assessment is a measure of assessment based on authentic tasks such as activities, exercises or problems that require students to show what they can do. The results of the assessment can then be used for comparison with those of other students. This is called evaluation and it can be measured.</p>
                        <p>Evaluation involves placing a value on the learner's performance in order to make a decision about the learner and the subject that was taught. It includes examining and assessing of the learner.</p>
                        <p>Assessment refers to the process of finding to what extent the learner has achieved the set objectives. This is done through examinations which are the tool or process used to determine the learners degree of learning.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why should you evaluate the learner?</h3>
                        <p>You should evaluate the learner in order to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Help the learner to understand themselves.</li>
                            <li>Help in the retention and transfer of learning.</li>
                            <li>Motivate the learner.</li>
                            <li>Predict the level of the learner's future performance.</li>
                            <li>Judge the learner's achievements.</li>
                            <li>Monitor the learner's progress for the purpose of providing feedback.</li>
                            <li>Determine teaching effectiveness.</li>
                            <li>License the practice of a profession.</li>
                            <li>Identify the weak and strong areas of a course.</li>
                            <li>Grade and rank students.</li>
                            <li>Gauge the reputation of school performance.</li>
                            <li>Protect society, that is, inform the community of the extent to which graduates constitute a potential danger.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are two types of evaluations. You shall now look at each of these in detail.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Formative Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>When you were a student and had to learn how to perform a certain task, you were allowed to do it in small sessions. The ward in-charge would check to see whether you were on the right track and probably comment and show you the next step to take. This is similar to formative evaluation.</p>
                        <p>Formative evaluation is progressive, that is, the learner and learning are evaluated on a continuous basis. It provides feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the learner. It is performed frequently, that is, after small units of learning.</p>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note">
                             <p><strong>Why do you think formative evaluation is useful?</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>It gives an early diagnosis of the learner's problems during the learning process, which enables corrective measures to be taken.</p>
                        <p>There are several examples of formative evaluation. These include placement testing or pre-testing, which are conducted for the purpose of gauging to what extent the learner possesses the skills and abilities needed to begin instruction. This also helps to determine whether the student has already mastered some of the material that is set to be taught. This way, you can alter the content of the lesson.</p>
                        <p>You should place the learner at the appropriate level of the programme. At the end of a module, identify the learner's successes or failures and make the appropriate adjustments in instruction and learning. Use the placement test as a diagnostic test to identify severe learning problems.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Summative or Terminal Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>Summative or terminal evaluation is usually carried out at the end of a term, course or programme for several reasons. It enables you to award grades, certificates or licenses to the student for practice and/or select learners for a further educational programme.</p>
                        <p>A good evaluation system should include both formative and summative evaluation. Formative evaluation gives diagnostic feedback to both the teacher and the learner, while summative evaluation reveals the student's ability to integrate and apply learning.</p>
                        <p>The content evaluated is selected from the entire course work covered in the term or year with samples of all learning tasks. It should include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Knowledge</li>
                            <li>Skills</li>
                            <li>Attitudes</li>
                        </ul>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Knowledge can be assessed through use of essays, short answer tests, multiple choice questions (MCQs), true or false questions, matching tasks, fill in the blanks and oral questions.</p>
                        <p>Essays are easy to set. It is important to remember to make them valid, reliable and objective. They should ask the leaner to describe and analyse issues. Be very specific and describe exactly what the student should do. You should also prepare a marking scheme.</p>
                        <p>One of the main objectives of scoring is to award the correct marks for a given test, exam or evaluation. Two types of scoring are important for you to consider.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Analytical Scoring</h4>
                        <p>Analyse the correct response by making out a list of crucial points, which must appear in the answer in advance.</p>
                        <p>You should then compare the student's answer to these points and award marks for them. You should also consider integration, coordination and organisation when awarding marks.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Impression Scoring</h4>
                        <p>In impression scoring, you should first analyse the correct responses as is the case in analytical scoring, then read the script to get an impression for adequacy. You should then transfer the impression into a grade. The papers (scripts) may be sorted out by quality, that is, 25% low, 50% middle, 25% high to form the normal educational curve.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Rules to be Observed When Marking Essays</h4>
                        <p>Since you may have many scripts to mark, you need to organise yourself in order to be able to mark them fairly. The following points can help you achieve this:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Arrange for independent marking of papers or at least a sample of them if the class is too large.</li>
                            <li>Conceal the name of the student, that is, use numbers or letters.</li>
                            <li>Grade answers question by question and not student by student.</li>
                            <li>Discuss the answers with students to ensure learning, that is, provide feedback.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)</h3>
                        <p>These are questions where four or five answers are given and the student has to choose the correct or best answer. A typical MCQ question has three parts, namely:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The question itself or the stem</li>
                            <li>The correct answer</li>
                            <li>Distracters or incorrect answers</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>How do you choose good questions?</h4>
                        <p>There are several factors to take into consideration when choosing questions. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Questions should be simple, straightforward and should relate to what was taught.</li>
                            <li>The question should emphasise the aspects you want to teach.</li>
                            <li>Choose good distracters.</li>
                            <li>Do not make incorrect answers ridiculous.</li>
                            <li>Choose distracters from among the type of mistakes the students commonly make.</li>
                            <li>Do not make the correct answers obvious.</li>
                            <li>See the question below for an example of a wrong and a right answer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>To improve the health of the children in your area which of the following would be the most useful in your dispensary?</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Skills can be assessed through the use of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Objective structured clinical examination (OSCE)</li>
                            <li>Objective structured practical examination (OSPE)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For both methods, candidates pass through a number of examination stations to answers or solve various problems. Questions vary from practical skills, knowledge, application and testing of attitude. All candidates get the same experience.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Objective Structured Practical Examination (OSPE)</h3>
                        <p>Practical skills are very important components of training in all professions. Failure in practical tests is equivalent to failure in the whole examination. You should not allow excellence in theory to compensate for a failure in practicals.</p>
                        <p>OSPE examinations must be objective, valid and reliable. They should define the competencies a worker needs to develop in order for them to successfully perform the job. This ensures that all examiners have similar expectations.</p>
                        <p>Look for a correct diagram in a clinical case. Assess the student's skills using rating scales or a checklist. You should set short answers to practical problem solving skills questions to ensure objective assessment. In order to improve the validity of the test, you should increase the sample thus increasing the range of competencies to be tested. Draw up in advance a table of specifications to be tested on.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE)</h3>
                        <p>This is a comprehensive examination of a patient. The student spends 15 to 60 minutes with a patient and then discusses that patient with a panel of examiners (long case). The exam should be set up in the following manner:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Brief examination of a patient followed by oral questions (known as viva voce).</li>
                            <li>Assessment of the learner's actual work during practice using rating scales.</li>
                            <li>Assessment of log and procedure books.</li>
                            <li>Case record and case reports.</li>
                            <li>Models or phantoms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following are stages of setting an OSPE:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identify topics/competencies to be tested on.</li>
                            <li>Decide the number of stations and timing.</li>
                            <li>Allocate topics and competencies to be tested.</li>
                            <li>Set up instructions for examiners rating scales/check list for each station.</li>
                            <li>List resources required for each station. These include examiners, markers and observers, patients, normal persons and simulation and room furniture, that is, beds, clocks, bells and so on.</li>
                            <li>Allocate marks for each station.</li>
                            <li>Allocate marks within the station, that is, for each item of the question.</li>
                            <li>Prepare standard/model answers for the questions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The main advantages of OSPE include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>OSPE separates the assessment of process and product by ensuring that the student performs the procedure as they are being observed.</li>
                            <li>Allows adequate sampling of skills.</li>
                            <li>Allows analytic and objective observation of skills because the observed skill is quite specific.</li>
                            <li>Can be used as quick feedback for students and teachers, especially before certification, as a revision tool.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, OSPE also has several disadvantages.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The process can appear impersonal</li>
                            <li>It takes time to organise</li>
                            <li>It can interfere with the provision of other services</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>The student's attitude is an important ingredient in delivering a good service. By assessing this skill, a student will learn the importance of having a good attitude and will understand what is expected of them.</li>
                            <li>Attitudes can be assessed indirectly, that is, as the candidate performs a skill. This will have to be over a long period so that your assessment is based on repetition of the same attitude over time.

                        </aside>

                        <h3>Types of Tools</h3>
                        <p>You can use a rating scale based on a table analysis (TA). There are two types of scales:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Scale of 5-1. This should remind you of the XY forms you had to have filled in by your ward in charge. A simple satisfactory to unsatisfactory scale is another example.</li>
                            <li>Semantic differential, that is, a scale on opposite characteristics. This can be used on attitudes alone. One example is given below.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4>Example:</h4>
                            <p>Please tick where the student exhibits this behavioural characteristic.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Keen and willing - does minimum work.</li>
                                <li>Accepts instructions - ignores instructions.</li>
                                <li>Polite to patients - Rude.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Set up instructions for examiners' rating scales/check list for each station. List resources required for each station including examiners, markers and observers. Allocate marks for each station and within each station, that is, for each item of the question. Prepare standard or model answers for the questions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Developing Assessment Tools</h3>
                        <p>You can develop an assessment tool by following these basic steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>List the objectives you wish to evaluate.</li>
                            <li>Identify the expected learner outcomes (knowledge, attitude and skills).</li>
                            <li>Specify the tools of assessment such as essays, MCQs, OSPE, and so on.</li>
                            <li>Allocate marks for each objective and develop a marking scheme.</li>
                            <li>Construct questions for the whole test.</li>
                            <li>Arrange questions from the first to the last.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Grading</h3>
                        <p>This refers to the awarding of marks, score or a value to the assignment performed. Some examples of grading include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Percentage of 0-100%.</li>
                            <li>Pass or fail, good, average, excellent.</li>
                            <li>Percentiles.</li>
                            <li>Letter grades, that is, A, B, C, D, E or F.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Valuation of student performance is important. This is mainly because it gauges the extent to which educational objectives have been achieved and guides the teacher in deciding what steps need to be planned next to facilitate learning for the students.</p>
