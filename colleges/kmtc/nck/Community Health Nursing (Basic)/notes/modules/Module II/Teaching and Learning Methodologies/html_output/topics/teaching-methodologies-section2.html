                        <p>Based on what you have learnt about the learners, the learning environment and the factors that motivate people to learn, you should be able to prepare the content of what you want your learner to know, plus the accompanying skills and attitudes. Before you begin to teach, you will have to identify the topic and content. This topic may be identified in relation to a problem or a need you may have noted in the community following a community diagnosis. All this information is contained in the curriculum.</p>
                        <p>A curriculum is developed from the broad objectives of a syllabus.</p>
                        <p>In this section, you will be introduced to the process that will enable you to select a learning experience, and to properly prepare and deliver it to your learners.</p>
                        <p>In order for you to be able to go to a classroom, a laboratory, a clinical setting or a field practical site to teach, it is necessary for you to first of all identify the exact area to be taught in a curriculum. You should define the subject matter or the topic you will teach and the specific objectives and contents to be covered. Depending on the allotted time, you have to make a lesson plan and implement it. This is the process that an effective teacher follows.</p>

                        <p>After you identify your content and accompanying skills and attitudes, you will develop a teaching plan. This plan is also referred to as a lesson plan.</p>
                        <p>A lesson plan is a written description used in a teaching and learning situation to guide the teacher to systematically present the subject matter in a logical, interrelated and integrated way such that learning is reinforced and enhanced.

                            <li>What shall you teach?</li>
                            <li>What are your objectives for teaching this topic?</li>
                            <li>Which teaching methods shall you choose?</li>
                            <li>How best shall you motivate the learners in their own learning?</li>

                            <li>How shall you monitor the progress of your teaching?</li>

                        <p>Effective implementation of a good lesson plan in traditional teaching processes requires the teacher to apply special skills known as micro teaching skills.</p>
                        <p>This is done by developing specific teaching skills within a small group of students as the audience in a simulated situation, instead of suddenly being faced with a large number of students, which can be threatening.</p>
                        <p>Micro teaching involves self assessment and recognition of one's weaknesses and strengths. When used with peers, they act as both learners and evaluators of the teacher's performance.</p>
                        <p>In all institutions of higher learning, there are six teaching skills commonly taught. They are referred to as micro teaching skills.</p>
                        <p>Write down what you think are the six skills on a piece of paper and click the link below to compare your answer.</p>
                        <p>Micro teaching skills consist of:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Set induction, which is the skill of appropriately introducing a topic or starting a lesson and capturing the learner's attention.</li>
                            <li>Stimulus variation, that is, the skill of varying focus movements speech and content delivery to retain the learner's attention.</li>
                            <li>Reinforcement, which is the technique of rewarding students to promote good behaviour and attention.</li>
                            <li>Questioning, that is, the technique of using questions to promote interaction with learners to hold their attention.</li>
                            <li>Use of examples and explanations that promote learning.</li>
                            <li>Closure, that is, helping learners achieve 'mental' closure of a learning session in ways that help them to remember what they learn, for example, by encouraging students to summarize what they have learnt.</li>

                        <p>In traditional teaching and learning processes, the emphasis is on the teacher and how they facilitate learning for the students. In the innovative educational processes, the burden of learning shifts to the learner. The teacher is transformed into a facilitator.</p>

                            <p><strong>What is innovative education and how do innovative processes differ from traditional teaching and learning approaches?</strong></p>

                        <p>In the innovative teaching and learning process, the teacher, like in the traditional process, must identify the area to be taught, define the subject and topic as well as the objectives and content to be learnt from a curriculum. These aspects of the teaching and learning process are inescapable for all teachers.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Problem Based Learning</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Problem-based learning (PBL) is a curriculum development and delivery system that recognises the need to develop problem solving skills as well as the necessity of helping students to acquire necessary knowledge and skills (Stephen et al 1993). For innovative teaching learning methods such as Problem Based Learning (PBL), the teacher must, therefore, develop tutorial problems which will be used to guide the achievement of the objectives as stated in the curriculum. The teacher will also produce a booklet, which contains those problems, as they will be used in teaching the course. In addition, the teacher will also develop a tutor guide to be used by the facilitator of the course, which must contain the solutions and useful tips for guiding the learner.</p>
                        <p>Innovative learning processes are best described after the tutorial booklet and tutor guides have been developed. After these have been developed, a tutor can then provide a copy of the booklet to each student and have a copy of the booklet and tutor guide for themselves.</p>
                        <p>Innovative processes are, therefore, more difficult during preparation but easier during tutorials and actual course delivery. Once in the tutorial room, the tutor can follow any one of the following processes to conduct the tutorial with the students.</p>

                        <h3>The Three Step PBL Tutorial (ABC) Process</h3>
                        <p>In the three step PBL tutorial process, students have to go through the following three steps with the guidance of a tutor.</p>
                        <h4>Tutorial 1</h4>
                        <p>Read through the problem, define terms, clarify concept, analyse problem and set learning objectives. Solve any problem (if possible at this point), for example, on a Monday. Students identify their own learning objectives (SOLO).</p>
                        <h4>Self-Directed Learning (SDL)</h4>
                        <p>Self-Directed Learning (SDL) means that the students study and look for information on their own. They may do this on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in preparation for the tutorial session on Friday.</p>
                        <h4>Tutorial 2</h4>
                        <p>This is the second tutorial during which students do the presentation of gathered information, solution of problems and synthesis. This might, for example, take place on a Friday.</p>

                        <h3>The Seven Step PBL Tutorial Process</h3>
                        <p>In the seven steps PBL tutorial process, students follow these steps.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Step One: Clarify terms and concepts not readily comprehensible</li>
                            <li>Step Two: Define the problem</li>
                            <li>Step Three: Analyse the problem</li>
                            <li>Step Four: Draw a systematic inventory of the explanations inferred in step three</li>
                            <li>Step Five: Formulate learning objectives</li>
                            <li>Step Six: Collect additional information outside the group (SDL)</li>
                            <li>Step Seven: Synthesise and test the newly acquired information</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>The Ten Step PBL Tutorial Process</h3>
                        <p>There is also a ten step PBL process.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, it is not possible to conclude a tutorial in the three or the seven steps. In such cases, students may have to follow the ten step PBL tutorial process, which consists of the following steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Step One: Clarify terms and concepts not readily comprehensible</li>
                            <li>Step Two: Define the problem</li>
                            <li>Step Three: Analyse the problem</li>
                            <li>Step Four: Draw a systematic inventory of the explanations inferred in step three</li>
                            <li>Step Five: Formulate learning objectives</li>
                            <li>Step Six: Collect additional information outside the group (SDL)</li>
                            <li>Step Seven: Synthesise and test the newly acquired information</li>
                            <li>Step Eight: Draw inventory of unresolved issues in groups</li>
                            <li>Step Nine: Second self directed learning (SDL)</li>
                            <li>Step Ten: Meet again and synthesise the newly acquired information</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>The Fifteen Step PBL Process</h3>
                        <p>The fifteen step PBL process was developed and used at the Moi University, faculty of health sciences. It is organised in the following manner:</p>
                        <h4>First Tutorial</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Step 1 Group organisation : Introductions. : Selection of chairman. : Selection of scribe.</li>
                            <li>Step 2 Reading through the problem (aloud).</li>
                            <li>Step 3 Identifying the problem.</li>
                            <li>Step 4 Defining the problem.</li>
                            <li>Step 5 Raising learning issues.</li>
                            <li>Step 6 Resolving issues based on prior knowledge.</li>
                            <li>Step 7 Organisation of the unresolved issues.</li>
                            <li>Step 8 Developing learning objectives from the organised, unresolved issues.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>First Self Directed Learning (SDL)</h4>
                        <ol start="9">
                            <li>Step 9 Information gathering from all available resources.</li>
                            <li>Step 10 Students meeting alone, under their chairman, to collate information and identify the objectives based on information that is so far not available.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Second Tutorial</h4>
                        <ol start="11">
                            <li>Step 11 Discussion of available information to check for correctness and completeness.</li>
                            <li>Step 12 Identification of objectives so far not addressed, with a view to identifying the resources from which to obtain information.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Second SDL Period</h4>
                        <ol start="13">
                            <li>Step 13 Information gathering on difficult objectives.</li>
                            <li>Step 14 Final collation of information and solving of the problem (students meeting alone under their chairman).</li>
                            <li>Step 15 Identifying areas that are difficult to understand and seeking help, for example, overview (if necessary) or seminar.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Of all these various processes, the major steps are encompassed in the three step process. This simply presents a problem to the learner, gives them time to do self directed study and enables them to discover and present their solutions. All of this is done with the help of the tutor.</p>

                        <p>Do you remember the six micro teaching skills covered earlier in relation to traditional teaching? You will now cover modern innovative teaching and learning skills. They are commonly referred to as super skills and are most appropriate for adult learners. Super skills, which bear the acronym FAGIPW, emphasise that a tutor ought to:</p>
                        <p>Thus, the tutor should not simply stand up and lecture their students for hours. They should enable the students to study and, during tutorials, should freely participate in the students' learning under their tutorship.</p>
                        <p>The traditional and innovative teaching and learning processes thus call for the use of different skills. An effective teacher should be aware of them.</p>
