                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>STIs are commonly transmitted from one person to another primarily through sexual contact. Therefore, individuals with STIs require prompt and comprehensive management in order to stop them from spreading the infections from one sexual partner to another. HIV infection is also sexually transmitted and people who are suffering from an STI are at a greater risk of contracting HIV. For this reason, you need to not only manage these individuals promptly but also, educate and counsel them on the need to change their sexual behaviour or practise safer sex. Remember, that although STIs and HIV/AIDS are transmitted primarily through sexual contact, this is not the only route of transmission.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The common STIs will be grouped according to their signs and symptoms. This is in keeping with the current management approach known as Syndromic Management of STIs. You have already heard about it or seen the STI management flow charts in many health facilities. Kenya has adopted the syndromic approach, which diagnoses conventional STIs on the basis of syndromes rather than by the causative organisms. A syndrome simply means a group of signs and symptoms. Although many different organisms cause conventional STIs, these organisms give rise to a limited number of syndromes.</p>
                        <p>The STIs are divided into five main syndromes as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vaginal discharge (Pruritus) in women</li>
                            <li>Urethral discharge in men</li>
                            <li>Lower abdominal pain in women</li>
                            <li>Genital ulcer disease in both men and women</li>

                        <p>You also need to note that for the syndromic management of STIs to succeed, the four C's need to be emphasised at every stage you come across the patient.</p>

                        <p>This requires that you discuss the condition with the patient with an aim of finding a solution or ways of preventing STIs re-infection and spread. (Revise counselling skills).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This section will focus on HIV/AIDS. There are numerous frequently asked questions about HIVIAIDS, these include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is HIV and AIDS?</li>
                            <li>What causes HIV/AIDS?</li>
                            <li>How is HIV/AIDS transmitted?</li>
                            <li>What are the signs and symptoms of HIVIAIDS?</li>
                            <li>What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?</li>
                            <li>What is the connection between HIV infection and other STIs?</li>
                            <li>What is meant by the term 'full blown' AIDS?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Good information is still the best cure for HIVIAIDS. You therefore, need to equip yourself with up to date information to enable us to answer these questions correctly, and provide quality care to your patients, and offer support to their families as well as to the community. HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death in subSaharan Africa. The pandemic is causing great suffering, not only to the infected individual, but also to the family members (affected) and to some extent the wider community.</p>
                        <p>The pandemic was declared a national disaster in Kenya in 1999. The immediate past five year reproductive health (RH) program (1999 to 2003) contributed to high level advocacy of overall efforts to highlight the disaster the HIVIAIDS has become. The ongoing five year RH program (2004 to 2008) continues with this high level advocacy. Some of the most pressing issues discussed in relation to HIV/AIDS include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The issue of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS.</li>
                            <li>Support for pilot prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) projects with an emphasis on community mobilisation for continued breastfeeding, voluntary counselling for testing (VCT) and provision of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs).</li>
                            <li>Revision of AIDS education materials to include a life skills program with emphasis on the HIV/AIDS education strategy.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV stands for Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus. This is the virus that destroys the human immune system, leaving the body defenceless hence vulnerable to other infections. It is of interest to note that HIV is a member of a group of viruses called retroviruses, which cause immune deficiency in both animals and humans. Those that affect humans, are HIV1 and HIV2, the commonest being HIV2. When the virus enters the body and gets into the blood stream, it binds itself to specific defence cells known as CD4 lymphocytes and as it enters these cells, it destroys them. When the retrovirus enters the CD4 cell, an enzyme from the virus called reverse transcriptase takes over the cell's genetic equipment to produce more retroviruses which are released outside the infected cell and go on to infect other CD4 cells. This process goes on over a period of years during which the number of CD4 lymphocytes gradually decreases. Please note; that although the body of an infected person struggles to form antibodies against the HIV, these antibodies cannot destroy all the viruses because they keep on multiplying and the body's defence system is being depleted, therefore, it becomes unable to produce enough antibodies to match the viruses.</p>

It shows the virus binding to the cell, injecting its RNA, using reverse transcriptase to create DNA, integrating into the host cell's nucleus, and then producing new viruses that bud off to infect other cells." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Having discussed HIV, now move on to look at what AIDS means.</p>
                        <h4>AIDS is an abbreviation for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.</h4>
                        <p>Immune deficiency has previously been mentioned in the process of explaining what HIV means. Now, the questions you may ask yourself are: Why is it acquired and why is it a syndrome? First of all, it is acquired and not inherited, the HIV virus is spread from one person to another. Secondly, the disease presents with a collection of signs and symptoms resulting from lowered immunity due to HIV and that is why it is referred to as a syndrome (a syndrome is a group of signs and symptoms denoting a disease).</p>
                        <p>As the HIV virus multiplies, more immune cells (CD4) are destroyed, interfering with the individual's immune system. Once the immune system cannot function properly, then the person may be infected by many bacteria, viruses and parasites, which the person's immune system is no longer able to fight. These infections are referred to as opportunistic because they take advantage of the opportunity offered by the lowered immunity.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_17_8870e4d890e2e1a5253eg-294-2.jpg" alt="A graph showing the relationship between HIV levels and CD4 cell counts over time after infection. Initially, HIV levels spike and CD4 counts drop. Then, the immune system partially controls the virus, leading to a latent period where CD4 counts gradually decline. Eventually, HIV levels rise again as the immune system fails, leading to AIDS." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Therefore, a collection of signs and symptoms caused by infections and other complications arising from HIV infection is referred to as AIDS. AIDS occurs when the human immune system becomes severely weakened, a process, which might take three to ten years, and this leads to life threatening conditions. Positive test result confirms the HIV infection except in children below 18 months old because the baby might have acquired the antibodies from the infected mother and not the virus. From what you have seen in the course of your duty or read from the newspapers, you will agree that the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has become an extremely serious problem in Kenya and the world over. AIDS is causing devastating health, socio-economic and development problems. You will now move on to find out how this disease is acquired and how it spreads.</p>

This section will take you through the important aspect of home care. So far, you have learned to diagnose, treat and educate people who are infected with almost all STIs that are common in Kenya. However, you have not adequately considered the management of HIVIAIDS, the subject of this section. Since there is no cure, management of HIVIAIDS may be thought of as care aimed at relieving and containing physical symptoms, conserving and maintaining the body strength and providing emotional, social and spiritual support. The increasing number of people developing AIDS is alarming and it is creating a heavy burden on formal health sector, which has led to the home based care concept.</p>
