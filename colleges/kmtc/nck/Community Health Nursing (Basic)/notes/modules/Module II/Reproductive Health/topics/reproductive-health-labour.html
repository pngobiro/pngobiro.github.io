In the previous units, you learnt about obstetric anatomy, normal pregnancy, antenatal care, obstetric pharmacology and breastfeeding. As you learned, a well-managed pregnancy is likely to have a very happy ending. This unit will take you through labour, puerperium and the neonate. The unit is divided into two parts. Part One deals with normal labour, the neonate and puerperium. In Part Two, we will discuss abnormal pregnancy and abnormal labour. This unit is composed of two sections:</p>

                        <p>Your role as a midwife demands clinical expertise in supervising, caring for and supporting the pregnant mother during prepregnancy, pregnancy, labour and puerperium. You should be able to conduct deliveries on your own, and be ready to intervene when complications arise. It is also your responsibility to recognise and act promptly should you be presented with an abnormal condition, for example: mal-presentation, obstructed labour, or obstetric and neonatal emergencies.</p>
                        <p>In order to recognise and deal with complications of pregnancy, delivery, and the puerperium, you as a health worker must first be thoroughly familiar with the characteristics of normal pregnancy, delivery and puerperium. As you may remember, you have already discussed normal pregnancy in the previous Unit. In this Unit, you will review the features of normal and abnormal labour and consider how each stage of labour is managed. You will also examine the normal puerperium and review methods of monitoring a mother for post-delivery complications.</p>
                        <p>Do you know that a mother, who is psychologically well prepared during pre-natal care, will go through labour and delivery with ease? Research has shown that if a woman in labour has confidence in her caregiver she will experience a considerably lower level of labour pains. Professionalism, calmness and a 'matter-of-fact' manner on the part of the caregiver is a greater tranquilliser to the mother who is in pain than medicine (Leeder: 1994). It goes without saying, therefore, that a midwife's behaviour and attitude towards a mother in labour makes the difference between painful and less-painful labour. A relaxed mother will usually have a shorter period of labour than a tense mother. Before we proceed, let us look at the objectives of this section.</p>

                        <p>The word labour is commonly used by both medical and non-medical people, but what does this term mean to you as a midwife? Labour is described as the process whereby the foetus, placenta and membranes are expelled through the birth canal after 28 weeks of gestation. Labour, can be either normal or abnormal. Normal labour has several important characteristics, which you should always remember. These are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Duration - completed within 18 hours</li>
                            <li>Occurs at term between 38 and 40 weeks</li>
                            <li>Is spontaneous</li>

                        <p>You are now going to look at abnormal purperium. First you need to reflect on the meaning of the puerperium or postpartum period. The puerperium or postpartum period starts about one hour after delivery and continues for the next six weeks. During the postpartum period, the mother goes through physical and psychological transition caused by what she has gone through her pregnancy with all the adjustments of hormones, not to mention the stress and fatigue of labour. Her body is vulnerable to many complications due to blood loss, laceration and injury of the birth canal. Complications during this period are associated with trauma sustained during childbirth, disorders of the circulatory system or psychological disorders. Postpartum nursing starts from early pregnancy. At that time it is important to prevent the occurrence of complications by treating all infections and controlling chronic diseases from getting worse. Give health education to maintain cleanliness and physical status by encouraging balanced diet to prevent anaemia. During labour, aseptic techniques and vigilant observation should be used to enable early detections of complications that are likely to arise. This will allow you to take appropriate action in good time. During the postpartum period, provide appropriate care and counselling to prevent anxiety, and ensure that the new mother has enough rest and sleep. Try keeping the stressed mother calm. Observe her closely to detect any early signs of complications and treat them promptly.</p>
