                        <p>As you learnt in the introduction to reproductive health unit, the Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI) is designed to reduce the high numbers of deaths (maternal mortality) and illnesses (maternal morbidity) resulting from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. It is, therefore, important to study and understand the whole process of reproduction, that is, the anatomy and physiology of the human reproductive system. A lot of the information you will find in this unit is not new to you as you studied it during your previous nursing training. However, it is important to go through everything once again as you will build on this knowledge in the subsequent sections of this unit.</p>

                        <p>The female reproductive system consists of two parts: the external genitalia and the internal genitalia. You will study each part separately starting with the external genitalia.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 id="external-genitalia-heading">The External Genitalia (Vulva)</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The external genitalia is also known as the vulva. It is made up of all the external organs as shown in the illustration opposite. It extends from the mons veneris anteriorly, to the perineal body posteriorly.</p>

                            <figcaption>The External Genitalia (Vulva)</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The following are parts of the external genitalia</p>
                        <h5>The Mons Veneris</h5>
                        <p>This is a pad of fat lying over the body of the pubic bone and is covered by skin on which hair grows from the time of puberty.</p>
                        <h5>The Labia Majora</h5>
                        <p>These are two thick folds of fatty and areola tissue covered by skin externally. They start in the Mons Veneris and merge into the Perineum posteriorly.</p>
                        <h5>The Labia Minora</h5>
                        <p>The labia minor are two small thin folds of skin lying between, and almost covered by the labia majora. They fuse posteriorly thus forming the fourchette.</p>
                        <h5>The Clitoris</h5>
                        <p>This is a highly sensitive erectile structure situated at the anterior junction of the Labia minora. It is the female equivalent of the male penis.</p>
                        <h5>The Urethral Meatus</h5>
                        <p>This is a small opening about 2.5 centimetres below the clitoris.</p>
                        <h5>The Vaginal Orifice</h5>
                        <p>This is also known as the introitus of the vagina. It lies between the labia minora and posteriorly to the urethra. It is partially occluded by the hymen in girls who have not been sexually active.</p>
                        <h5>The Hymen</h5>
                        <p>This is a thin membrane which partially shuts the introitus in the vagina.</p>
                        <h5>The Bartholin's Glands</h5>
                        <p>These are two small glands, one on either side of, and slightly posterior to the vagina, beneath the labia majora. Their ducts open into the vaginal orifice. They secrete mucus, which lubricates the vaginal orifice. The vulva receives its blood supply from the internal and external pudendal arteries and which is then returned through the pudendal veins. The lymphatic drainage is via the inguinal glands, while the nerve supply is derived from the pudendal nerve These parts make up the external genitalia. Now move on to look at the internal genitalia.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 id="internal-genitalia-heading">The Internal Genitalia</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The internal genitalia comprises of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The vagina</li>
                            <li>The uterus</li>
                            <li>The uterine tubes (also called the fallopian tubes)</li>
                            <li>The ovaries</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These will now be covered separately.</p>
                        <p>The vagina is a fibro-muscular canal joining the external genitalia and the uterus. The posterior wall of the vagina is longer than the anterior wall. This is because the cervix projects at right angle into the upper part of the anterior wall. Its walls are arranged in folds known as rugae, which allow the vagina to stretch during sexual intercourse and childbirth. The vault is the upper end of the vagina, which forms four arches known as fornices. The posterior fornix is the largest. The vagina has four layers, these are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The inner layer or lining made of squamous epithelium</li>
                            <li>The vascular connective tissue beneath it</li>
                            <li>The muscle layer that is divided into a weak inner fibre and a stronger outer coat of longitudinal fibres</li>
                            <li>A layer of connective tissue, which surrounds the vagina</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Blood Supply - The blood supply comes from branches of the internal iliac artery, the vaginal artery and a branch of the uterine artery. The blood drains through the vaginal vein and a branch of the uterine artery. Lymphatic drainage is via the inguinal, the internal iliac and the sacral glands. Nerve supply is via the Lee Frankenhauser plexus. In front of the vagina lies the bladder and the urethra, which are closely connected to the anterior wall. Behind the vagina are the pouch of Douglas, the rectum and the perineal body. Each of these occupies about one third of the posterior vaginal wall. The uterus lies above the vagina.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The non-pregnant uterus is a hollow pearshaped muscular organ situated in the pelvic cavity. It is 7.5 centimetres long, 5 centimetres wide, 2.5 centimetres deep and 1.25 centimetres thick. It lies behind the bladder and in front of the rectum. It leans forward over the bladder, which is known as anteversion and bends forward the cervix at the level of the internal os, which is known as anteflexion. When a woman stands, the position becomes almost horizontal with the fundus, resting on the bladder. The uterus performs the following functions among others:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Receives the fertilised ovum</li>
                            <li>Provides shelter for the foetus during pregnancy</li>
                            <li>Expels the uterine contents during childbirth</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Anterior to the uterus lie the utero-vesical pouch and the bladder, while posteriorly lie the recto-uterine pouch of Douglas and the rectum. Laterally, on either side, are the broad ligaments, the uterine tubes and the ovaries.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_17_8870e4d890e2e1a5253eg-036-1.jpg" alt="Sagittal view of the female pelvis showing the position of the uterus in relation to the bladder, rectum, and symphysis pubis.

                        </figure>
                        <p>The uterus is kept in its normal position in the pelvis by the following supports:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ligaments</li>
                            <li>The muscles of the pelvic floor which is mainly the levator ani</li>
                            <li>The pubovesico-cervical support consisting mainly of fascia</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The ligaments are the most important support structures and help to maintain the uterus in its position. They consist of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The transverse cervical ligaments</li>

                            <li>The round ligaments</li>
                            <li>The ovarian ligaments</li>

                        <p>The transverse cervical (also called cardinal ligaments) are the most important uterine support. They fan out from the sides of the cervix to the sidewalls of the pelvis to give lateral stability to the cervix. The utero-sacral ligaments pass backwards from the cervix to the sacrum. They maintain the body of the uterus in anteversion position. The round ligaments arise at the cornua of the uterus and descend through the broad ligaments and inguinal canal to the labia majora. They hold the fundus forward in anteversion, especially when forces such as distension of the bladder tend to push the uterus back. The broad ligaments are folds of peritoneum over the fallopian tubes and do not support the uterus.</p>

                            <li>The cervix protrudes into the vagina with the upper half above the vagina.</li>
                            <li>The internal os is a narrow opening between the isthmus and the cervix, the external os is a small round opening at the lower end of the cervix.</li>

                    <h4 id="uterus-layers-heading">The Layers of the Uterus</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The uterus has three layers: the endometrium, the myometrium and the perimetrium.</p>
                        <h5>The Endometrium</h5>
                        <p>This is the inner lining of the uterus composed of ciliated epithelium (mucous membrane) on a connective tissue base and it changes in thickness during the menstrual cycle. The basal layer does not change. This will be discussed further under the menstrual cycle.</p>
                        <h5>The Myometrium (or Muscle Coat)</h5>
                        <p>This is the middle layer of the uterus. It is the thickest layer and is made up of three layers of muscle fibre. The fibres run in all directions and intermingle to surround the blood vessels and lymphatics.</p>
                        <h5>The Perimetrium</h5>
                        <p>This is a double serous membrane and extension of the peritoneum, which is draped over the uterus and uterine tubes.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 id="fallopian-tubes-heading">The Uterine Tubes (Fallopian Tubes)</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The fallopian tubes are passages that link the ovaries to the uterus. Each tube is between 10 12 centimetres long and is divided into four main parts, namely:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The interstitial portion, which is the medial part that opens into the uterus. Its whole length lies within the walls of the uterus. It is the shortest and narrowest part of the tube with a length of 1.25 centimetres and its lumen is 1 millimetre wide.</li>
                            <li>The isthmus, which is the narrow portion immediately adjoining the uterus.</li>
                            <li>The ampulla, which is the widest and longest ( 5 centimetres long) part of the fallopian tube and it is here that fertilisation occurs.</li>
                            <li>The infundibulum, which is the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube. It is in close proximity to the ovary and its finger-like projections are known as fimbriae. One of the fimbriae, being longer than the others, is in contact with the ovary and picks up the ovum from the surface of the ovary at ovulation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The uterine tube has three coats or layers. These are the serous, the muscular, and the mucous layers. The inner epithelium is lined with a mucous membrane of ciliated cubical epithelium, which is arranged in folds. These folds slow the ovum down on its way to the uterus. In the lining are cells that produce a secretion containing glycogen to nourish the ovum. Beneath the lining is a layer of vascular connective tissue. The middle layer of thin muscle coat consists of two layers, a longitudinal outer layer and a circular inner layer, both of smooth muscle. The tube is covered with peritoneum. The blood supply comes from the uterine and ovarian arteries and returns through the corresponding veins. The lymphatic drainage is carried out through the lumbar glands and the nerve supply is from the ovarian plexus.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 id="ovaries-heading">The Ovaries</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>These are two glandular structures lying on the posterior surface of the broad ligament, supported by the ovarian and the infundibulopelvic ligaments. They are oval shaped and are composed of a medulla and a cortex, which is covered with germinal epithelium. The medulla is made up of fibrous tissue, throughout which the ovarian blood vessels and the lymphatics and nerves travel. The cortex is the functional part of the ovary. It contains the Graafian follicles that are in different stages of development, surrounded by the stroma. From puberty some of the Graafian follicles enlarge under the influence of the folliclestimulating hormone. One Graafian follicle matures each month and ruptures to release an ovum. The ovaries produce ova and the hormones oestrogen and progesterone.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Blood supply to the ovaries is provided by the ovarian arteries and drained by the ovarian veins. The lumbar glands maintain lymphatic drainage while nerve supply is from the ovarian plexus.</p>
                        <p>So far, you have learned about the different structures that make up the female reproductive system. You now know that the vagina acts as a receptacle of the semen during sexual intercourse, as a passage for menstrual blood and for the foetus during delivery. It was also mentioned that the uterus is the site where the foetus grows from implantation to maturity, the fallopian tubes are passages through which the ova passes to be propelled to the uterine cavity, and that the functions of the ovaries include production of ova and hormones. You have now completed the external and internal genitalia of the female reproductive system.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Hormones</span>
                    </h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>From puberty to menopause, the female reproductive system goes through regular cycles, governed by various hormones. You will now look at these hormones and what they do. The most important hormones in relation to reproduction in the female are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)</li>
                            <li>The Luteinizing Hormone (LH)</li>
                            <li>Oestrogen</li>
                            <li>Progesterone</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>What are the functions of FSH and LH?</h4>
                        <p>The hypothalamus controls and governs the anterior pituitary gland. The hypothalamus produces Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) which acts on the anterior pituitary gland to secrete two gonadotrophins: the Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH).</p>
                        <h5>Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)</h5>
                        <p>The FSH causes the Graafian follicle in the ovarian cortex to develop, mature and rupture to release the ovum into the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube. This is known as ovulation.</p>
                        <h5>Luteinizing Hormone (LH)</h5>
                        <p>It influences development of the corpus luteum to produce oestrogen and progesterone. LH is produced for only fourteen days after which the FSH reappears.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 id="ovarian-hormones-heading">Ovarian Hormones</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As mentioned while discussing the structure of the ovaries, the ovaries produce two hormones: oestrogen and progesterone.</p>
                        <h5>Oestrogen</h5>
                        <p>This is produced under the influence of FSH. It is produced by three different parts, which are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The granulosa and theca cells of the Graafian follicle during the first 14 days of the twenty eight day cycle.</li>
                            <li>The corpus luteum and the adrenal cortex in small quantities after ovulation.</li>
                            <li>The placenta during pregnancy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Oestrogen is comprised of oestriol, oestriadiol and oestrone compounds. The following are some of the effects of oestrogen:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Oestrogen stimulates the growth of the secondary sex characteristics.</li>
                            <li>It causes proliferation of the uterine endometrium during the menstrual cycle.</li>
                            <li>During pregnancy it promotes growth of the uterine muscles.</li>
                            <li>It promotes proliferation of the uterine endometrium.</li>
                            <li>It suppresses ovulation.</li>
                            <li>It inhibits lactation.</li>
                            <li>It assists water and electrolyte retention in the body.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Progesterone</h5>
                        <p>Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum under the influence of the Lutenizing Hormone (LH) and by the placenta during pregnancy. Progesterone only acts on tissues, which have previously been acted on by oestrogens, and its effect is mainly evident during the second phase of the menstrual cycle when it causes the endometrium to increase in size. It also increases secretions and blood supply in readiness for possible arrival of a fertilised ovum.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 id="menstrual-cycle-heading">The Menstrual Cycle</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The average menstrual cycle is taken to be 28 days, although it may vary in length from 22 to 35 days. The hormones you have just looked at control the menstrual cycle. A normal menstrual cycle is divided into three phases, which will now be covered individually.</p>
                        <h5>Phase 1: The Menstrual Phase</h5>
                        <p>This is the phase during which vaginal bleeding occurs. It lasts three to five days. The endometrium is shed down to the basal layer and discharged together with blood from the capillaries and the unfertilised ovum.</p>
                        <h5>Phase 2: The Proliferative/Follicular Phase</h5>
                        <p>This phase follows the menstrual phase and lasts until ovulation, approximately 14 days from the first day of menstruation in a 28-day cycle. It is the phase of regrowth and thickening under the influence of oestrogen.</p>
                        <h5>Phase 3: The Secretory/Luteal Phase</h5>
                        <p>This phase follows immediately after ovulation under the influence of progesterone and oestrogen from the corpus luteum. The endometrium thickens and becomes spongy, and there is an increase in secretions from the endometrial glands. If the fertilisation does not occur, the ovum dies and degenerates 36 to 48 hours after its release. The corpus luteum also degenerates about 10 days later. Menstruation then takes place 14 days after ovulation. If, on the other hand, fertilisation occurs, the corpus luteum continues to grow and produces hormones that support the pregnancy. The fertilised ovum gets implanted on the endometrium. The illustration below shows the phases of the menstrual cycle.</p>

                        <p>In a normal vaginal delivery, the foetus must pass through the bony canal formed by the pelvic bones. The foetal skull is the most rigid structure that has to pass through this canal. You should therefore know the limits of a normal female pelvis so that you can detect deviations from the normal. By so doing, you will be able to identify women at risk and refer them to a hospital, where a caesarean section can be performed. While learning obstetric anatomy, you will also look at parts of the female pelvis and the foetal skull.</p>

                        <p>The shape of a normal female pelvis is cylindrical and has a slight anterior curve near the outlet. The curve results from the fact that the posterior body of the pelvis sacrum and coccyx is longer than the anterior border which is the symphysis pubis. In order for the foetal head to pass through the maternal pelvis, the diameter of the pelvis at the inlet, outlet and mid-cavity levels must be adequate.</p>

                        <p>You will start by looking at the diagnosis of pregnancy and defining some of the terms commonly associated with pregnancy.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Trimester</strong> refers to a three month calendar period.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gravidity</strong> is the number of times a woman has been pregnant regardless of the outcome of the pregnancies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parity</strong> refers to the delivery of a child that grew beyond 28 weeks (the age of viability) irrespective of whether the baby was born alive or dead.</li>
                            <li>A <strong>Primigravida</strong> is a woman who is pregnant for the first time.</li>
                            <li>A <strong>Primipara</strong> is a woman who has had only one delivery.</li>
                            <li>A <strong>Multigravida</strong> is a woman who has had two or more pregnancies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multipara</strong> refers to a woman who has had two or more deliveries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nullipara</strong> is a term that refers to a woman who has never delivered.</li>
                            <li>A <strong>Grand multipara</strong> is a woman who has had six or more deliveries.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"> </span>Remembe</h4>
                            <p>If a woman keeps on aborting before the 28th week, she becomes a multigravida but will remain nullipara.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The average duration of pregnancy is 266 days. This is counting from the time the pregnancy started, which is after ovulation and approximately two weeks after the first day of the Last Normal Menstrual Period (LNMP). If the counting is made from the first day of the LNMP, then the duration is 280 days or forty weeks. The duration of pregnancy can also be expressed in months. These can be calendar months or lunar months. A lunar month is the time from one new moon to the next. It is equal to four weeks or exactly 28 days. A calendar month is longer, usually 30 or 31 days. Therefore, on average, pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, that is, ten lunar months or approximately nine calendar months. The diagnosis of pregnancy is made on the basis of symptoms, signs and investigations of pregnancy. These can be conveniently divided into those of the first, second and third trimester.</p>
