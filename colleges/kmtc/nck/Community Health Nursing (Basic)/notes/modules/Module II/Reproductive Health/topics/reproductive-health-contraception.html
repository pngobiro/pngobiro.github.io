                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>What is Family Planning?</h4>
                        <p>Family planning is the process of child spacing so that the couple has the number of children they want at the time desired, that is, when wanted, expected and welcomed.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 id="fp-benefits-heading">Benefits of Family Planning</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Family planning enables couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children, as well as on the most appropriate time of having them. Family planning helps everyone. The health benefits of FP play a major role in protecting and promoting the quality of lives, not only of the infants but of their siblings and the family as a whole.</p>
                        <h5>Medical Benefits</h5>
                        <p>Medical benefits differ depending on the target population. Some of the benefits of family planning for women are shown below.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Their health is better as they are protected against unwanted pregnancy, hence death related to high risk pregnancy and abortion is reduced.</li>
                            <li>Some methods, such as the hormonal method, have additional (noncontraceptive) benefits, including the reduction of anaemia and cancer of the genital tract.</li>
                            <li>Barrier methods minimise the transmission of STIs and HIV/AIDS if used properly.</li>
                            <li>Mothers become healthier as they avoid the extremes of maternal age and carry their pregnancies within the optimal child bearing age bracket of 19 to 35 years, before and after which the mothers are at high risk of developing complications related to pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>There is a decrease in the risks of abortion as the baby is welcome and the mother well prepared physically and psychologically for the pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>There are reduced fertility and mortality rates.</li>
                            <li>There are improved health facilities and death related to pregnancy and childbirth is reduced.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are also medical advantages to the children.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Children are healthier, since the optimum spacing between births is 27 to 38 months, giving the mother the time to nurse and care for the infant.</li>
                            <li>The death related to infections and malnutrition to the under fives is reduced.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Social Benefits</h5>
                        <p>The social benefits related to family planning are numerous.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is an improved relationship with the spouse and family due to less stress and better social life.</li>
                            <li>Socially healthy families are productive and economically more stable as they participate in community development and nation building.</li>
                            <li>Women learn to make informed choices.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>National Benefits</h5>
                        <p>There are several benefits associated with family planning on a national level.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The country is able to budget for its citizens as the birth rate will be controlled.</li>
                            <li>Nationally reduced fertility and mortality rates lessen the burden to the nation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should note that countries with high fertility rates have poor health conditions in general, and inadequate health facilities substantially increase the risk of pregnancy related deaths. (Hatcher: July1997)</p>

                    <h4 id="fp-scope-heading">Scope of Family Planning</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>You will now cover the steps that help the health provider in the provision of FP.</p>
                        <h5>Counselling</h5>
                        <p>Family planning service providers should be competent in counselling on topics related to all FP methods.</p>
                        <h5>Provision of Contraceptives</h5>
                        <p>You should provide contraceptives to patients in accordance with the suitable method chosen by the patient.</p>
                        <h5>Follow Up and Referral System</h5>
                        <p>All patients who choose a method of FP should be informed of the appropriate follow up requirements and encouraged to return to the clinic in case of any concerns. Providers should use the established referral system for appropriate management of identified conditions that need further attention.</p>
                        <h5>Record Keeping</h5>
                        <p>The service provider should keep proper records of each patient. Keep up to date records on contraceptive distribution as well. All service delivery points (SDPs), NGOs and other stakeholders should follow the Ministry of Health Guidelines on Service Provision and Record Keeping. This helps in compiling statistical data for health care planning.</p>
                        <h5>Supervision</h5>
                        <p>Supervision is an essential component of program evaluation. It ensures that the guidelines are being followed and patient needs are being met. It helps in the assessment of the quality of care given and whether the patient's rights are being observed. Furthermore, it motivates service providers as they can express and discuss views with their superiors. Continued supervision will enable you to pinpoint areas for improvement.</p>
                        <h5>Logistics</h5>
                        <p>The main objective of logistics management is to deliver the right product in the right quantity, in the right condition, to the right place, at the right time for the right cost. Proper maintenance of a logistics system helps the providers to avoid both understocking and overstocking in order to maintain quality. The service provider must ensure proper storage and handling of contraceptive commodities for the stipulated shelf life. The contraceptives are removed from the shelf systematically (that is, first in first out) thereby ensuring those nearing expiry are used first.</p>

                    <h3 id="fp-counselling-heading">Counselling in Family Planning</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Counselling is the act of working with a patient to help them clarify personal goals and find ways of overcoming their problems with the aim of assisting the individual to change behaviours that are interfering with attainment of basic needs. For the purpose of FP, counselling is viewed as the art whereby the service provider guides/assists a patient to make an informed choice in matters regarding their RH needs, taking into account all the surrounding circumstances and the patient's personal needs at the time.</p>
                        <p>Counselling is a vital part of RH care. It helps patients to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Arrive at an informed choice of RH options</li>
                            <li>Select a contraceptive method with which they are satisfied</li>
                            <li>Use the chosen method safely and effectively</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Counselling in family planning is an important tool when serving patients. It is important to remember that they have:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The right to decide whether or not to practise FP</li>
                            <li>The freedom to choose which method to use</li>
                            <li>The right of privacy and confidentiality</li>
                            <li>The right to refuse any type of examination</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>While many contraceptive methods are highly effective, method failure can occur. In case of method failure, the patient should be counselled, informed about available options and referred for appropriate services.</p>

                    <h4 id="counselling-process-heading">The Counselling Process</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As a service provider, you need to review all available contraceptive methods that your patient may choose from. As a counsellor, you should be aware of a number of factors about each patient that may be important, depending on the method to be used. These are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The reproductive goal of the woman or couple (spacing or timing of births)</li>
                            <li>Personal factors including the time, travel costs, pain or discomfort likely to be experienced</li>
                            <li>Accessibility and availability of other products that are necessary to use the method</li>
                            <li>The need for protection against STIs and HIV/AIDS</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are three phases of counselling.</p>
                        <h5>Initial Counselling</h5>
                        <p>Initial counselling is carried out at reception, where you have to describe all the methods available and help the patient to choose the method appropriate for themselves.</p>
                        <h5>Method Specific Counselling</h5>
                        <p>Method specific counselling is carried out prior to and immediately following service provision. Here, you need to give instructions to the patient on how to use the method chosen. You should also discuss possible common side effects specific to the method and explain what should be done if that happens.</p>
                        <h5>Follow up counseling</h5>
                        <p>Follow up counselling occurs during the return visit. Ask the patient about method use, satisfaction and any problems that may have occurred. All the staff should be knowledgeable about all available contraceptive methods so as to be in a position to give information and counsel effectively. (MOH: March 2005).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The patient assessment will help you to give an appropriate method of contraception to an individual patient. In many ways counselling forms a part of patient assessment since both go together as you assist the patient to make an informed choice about the most appropriate method. The main objective of carrying out a patient assessment is to determine:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>That the patient is not pregnant</li>
                            <li>Whether any conditions requiring additional care for a particular method exist</li>
                            <li>Whether there are any special problems that require further assessment, treatment or regular follow up or referral</li>
                            <li>Whether there are need for HIVIAIDs services and, if so, to provide the services or arrange the appropriate referral</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To achieve the above objective, you have to be careful with the questions you ask and remain attentive to the patient's concerns. Furthermore, you need to clarify any points that you feel the patient does not understand clearly. How can you be reasonably sure that a female patient is not pregnant? You can only be reasonably sure a patient is not pregnant when she has no signs and symptoms of pregnancy and exhibits the following characteristics:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Has had no intercourse since her last menses</li>
                            <li>Is within seven days after the start of her menses (days one to seven)</li>
                            <li>Is within four weeks postpartum (for non-breast feeding women)</li>
                            <li>Is within seven days post abortion</li>
                            <li>Is fully breast feeding less than six months post partum and has had no menstrual bleeding</li>
                            <li>Has been correctly and consistently using another reliable contraceptive method</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pelvic examination is seldom necessary except to rule out pregnancy of more than six weeks, measured from the Last Menstrual Period (LMP). A pregnancy test is not essential, except in cases where:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is difficult to confirm pregnancy (that is, six weeks or less after the LMP)</li>
                            <li>The results of pelvic examination are unequivocal (for example, with an overweight patient sizing the uterus may be difficult)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If pregnancy testing is not available, counsel the patient to use a barrier method or abstain from intercourse until her menses occur or pregnancy is confirmed.</p>

                        <p>Most contraceptive methods can be provided after asking a few key questions. However, Intra Uterine Contraceptive Devices (IUCDs) and Voluntary Surgical Contraceptives (VSCs) do require a physical and pelvic examination to be performed before use. This brings us to the examinations that you may have to perform routinely and annually on your patients. Below are the special procedures a patient may go through to enhance her good reproductive health. These include:</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h5>Why should you perform a breast examination?</h5>
                        <p>The main reason for performing a breast examination is to enable you to detect abnormalities (such as cancer of the breast) and take appropriate action.</p>
                        <h5>When should a breast examination be performed?</h5>
                        <p>From the age of 20 years all females should do Self Breast Examination (SBE) immediately after their menstrual period. If the patient is on the pill, she should perform her SBE on the day she starts a new packet. Those in menopause should do a SBE on the first day of each calendar month.</p>
                        <h5>How do you perform a breast examination?</h5>
                        <p>This is the method whereby the patient inspects, palpates and expresses both breasts. The axilla is also palpated for any nodules.</p>
                        <h5>Inspection</h5>
                        <p>Ask the patient to undress and sit or stand relaxed in front of a mirror with good lighting. With hands at the sides, on the waist and on the head respectively, check on the size, shape, discoloration and retraction (dimpling) of the nipple. Turn from side to side and look underneath, push the hands inward and outwards until the chest muscles tighten. Check again at the breasts while pressing and note any puckering of the skin or retraction of the nipple.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h5>Palpation</h5>
                        <p>Ask the patient to lie down in a dorsal position on a firm surface with her head on a pillow. Tell her to put her left hand on top of the head folded and then use the right hand to examine the left breast. She should then reverse this to examine the right breast. Emphasise that she should examine one breast at a time using the flat of her fingers but not the fingertips. The fingers should be kept flat and close together. Instruct her how to divide the breast into quadrants (four areas), and starting with the upper scale near the collarbone, to press gently but firmly towards the body and going round the whole breast clockwise to check for any lumps. Show her how to examine the tail of the breast by going right up into the hollow of the armpit. Then she should repeat the whole process for the other breast.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h5>Expression</h5>
                        <p>Finally, hold the nipples in between your fingers and express to check on unusual secretion, such as blood or pus. The following are some warning signs to be noted upon examination:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unusual difference in size or shape of the breast</li>
                            <li>Alteration in the position of either nipple</li>
                            <li>Turning of colour of either nipple</li>
                            <li>Dimpling of the surface</li>
                            <li>Unusual rash on the breast or nipple</li>
                            <li>Unusual prominence of the veins over either breast or a discharge from the nipple</li>
                            <li>Unusual discrete lump or nodule on any part of either breast</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Should you find anything strange, report it to the doctor for further examination, investigation and management.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Natural family planning is an approach to the understanding and respecting of human sexuality with its inherent procreative capacity and its consequent responsibility. Any teaching of the natural methods of family planning is, therefore, within the context of strengthening the family bonds and promoting responsible parenthood and its pro-life. The natural methods are based on simple observance of nature in regard to human fertility. The methods do not interfere with the body functions in any way. The natural family planning methods require the cooperation of both the husband and wife and the study and discussion of their combined fertility brings them closer together. The sacrifice and control they demand generate respect of love and life. Because this is a natural method it overcomes all barriers, such as religious, social or ethnic. NFP goes hand in hand with LAM. As the mother breastfeeds, ovulation is delayed for as long as two years thus reinforcing the relationship and baby care.</p>

                    <h3 id="nfp-methods-heading">Natural Family Planning (Fertility Awareness Based Method)</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Natural Family Planning (NFP) is the oldest method of contraception. In our societies most tribes practiced some form of FP, such as when a mother was breast feeding it was a taboo to have sex as it was believed the baby would become sick and even die. The woman would abstain from sex for two to four years after childbirth. On some occasions she would even go back to her family home. Many communities also sanctioned polygamy, which allowed the man to have his sexual desires fulfilled while the mother was breast feeding. As communities started changing, monogamy was embraced and the couple stayed in one house. As a result, new methods of FP came into existence to complement the NFP method. Natural family planning refers to a way of life whereby a couple, if properly instructed, can choose to avoid or achieve pregnancy by applying the appropriate sexual behaviour during the fertile and infertile phases of the menstrual cycle without the use of chemicals or mechanical devices. NFP is also referred to as periodic abstinence, rhythm or fertility awareness method. The NFP method seems to work best when couples are clear about whether they want to have a child or not. The method appeals to couples who feel that fertility control is a joint responsibility and that neither partner should be required to bear the brunt of the health burden. NFP educates couples on their reproductive processes and human sexuality as they work in harmony to control or regulate their fertility. There are several methods of NFP.</p>
                        <h4>Basal Body Temperature (BBT) Method</h4>
                        <p>This is a natural method of family planning and it involves the woman taking and recording her body temperature every morning before rising to know when ovulation occurs. In a healthy woman the body temperature remains relatively constant during the first phase of her menstrual cycle. Shortly before ovulation the temperature rises by about $0.2^{\circ}\text{C}$ to $0.5^{\circ}\text{C}$ and stays elevated until the next menstrual period. The couple should avoid sexual intercourse during the period when BBT is high. They can have sex after the third day of consecutive high temperature until the beginning of next menstrual bleeding. Note the following points when taking basal body temperature:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It should be taken first thing in the morning before rising</li>
                            <li>Temperature should be recorded within same hour</li>
                            <li>Note temperatures taken outside the hour</li>
                            <li>Note all disturbances, for example, all medications</li>
                            <li>Use the same thermometer for the entire cycle</li>
                            <li>Note the use of a new thermometer</li>
                            <li>If the reading stops between two numbers ignore the high one and record the lower one</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In some circumstances the natural family planning method may fail due to individual physiological variations. To be more successful, a woman may have to use a combination of methods, referred to as 'sympto thermal' whereby the woman checks on the mucus as well as the temperature.</p>
                        <h4>The Sympto Thermal Method (which combines the Billings and Basal Body Temperature Methods)</h4>
                        <p>The sympto thermal method combines the recording of Basal Body Temperature (BBT) with observing the cervical mucus and other physical signs of ovulation. These physical signs include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Breast tenderness</li>
                            <li>Mid cycle pain</li>
                            <li>Spotting or bleeding</li>
                            <li>Abnormal heaviness</li>
                            <li>Cervical changes on position, degree of opening and texture, slippery and stretchy mucus</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The couple should abstain from sexual intercourse from the first appearance of the sensation of cervical mucus until after ovulation has been confirmed by three days of elevated temperature or four days of post ovulation mucus.</p>

                        <p>There is also the Lippers loop, which is non-medicated and spiral shaped, with an indefinite life span. However, this is currently not in circulation. The medicated IUCD has a copper wire around the shaft that discharges copper ions which increases the efficiency. The main contraceptive advantages of IUCDs are that they are highly and immediately effective, offer long term protection before deciding on a permanent method and they enable an immediate return to fertility upon termination of use. IUCDs also have some non-contraceptive advantages, which include that there is no interference with intercourse. They can comfortably be used by breast feeding women.</p>
