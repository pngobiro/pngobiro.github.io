                        <p>Just like any other aspect of medicine, gynaecology and obstetrics require some investigative work. As a health worker, you must find clues in the patient's history and physical examination to help you make the right diagnosis. The more thorough the history and physical examination, the better the chances of making an accurate diagnosis. You may also need to carry out certain tests and investigations in order to come to the correct conclusion. However, in order to take a complete history and conduct a thorough investigation, you need to know what in particular you are looking for.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>History taking should place an emphasis on the gynaecological history of the patient. This does not mean that other histories should be ignored. For the sake of minimising repetition, you will not go through the whole process. When taking a gynaecological history, you should enquire into the following:</p>
                        <h4>Menstruation</h4>
                        <p>Menstruation, including the age at which she had her first menstrual period, that is, menarche equivalent to ' K ', the length of the menstrual cycle, duration of the periods and the amount of blood loss and regularity as well as the date of the Last Normal Menstrual Period (LNMP).</p>
                        <p>Always record this information as 'K 13 5/28 regular'. This means that the periods began at the age of 13, last for five days and occur every 28 days.</p>
                        <h4>Gynaecological Operations</h4>
                        <p>Take the history of any gynaecological operations, including the dates of operations. Possible gynaecological operations include dilatation and curettage, evacuation, laparotomy and hysterectomy and post-operative outcomes.</p>
                        <h4>Contraceptive History</h4>
                        <p>Take the patient's contraceptive history, especially on surgical contraceptions, including the type of contraceptive, duration of use, side effects and when she stopped using it.</p>
                        <h4>Sexual Behaviour</h4>
                        <p>Ask about the patient's sexual behaviour, noting that questions should be non-judgemental and you should not embarrass the patient. You should find out whether she is sexually active, whether the relationship is satisfactory and, if not, why. For example, find out if she has painful or difficult sex referred to as dyspareunia. In case of infertility find out also whether intercourse is normal, frequent and what time in the cycle. You need to ask if there is any postcoital bleeding or not. This information may well help you to detect any sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
                        <h4>Lifestyle Habits</h4>
                        <p>Ask if she smokes or takes alcohol.</p>
                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                        <p>You should make a summary of the history you have taken by picking out the important positive and negative information obtained. This will guide you when performing a physical examination.</p>

                        <p>In this section you will look at bleeding disorders in pregnancy. These conditions are usually on the borderline between obstetrics and gynaecology, in the sense that they involve women whose pregnancy comes to a premature end. You will find that these patients are always treated in a gynaecological ward rather than in the maternity ward. For the purposes of this unit, bleeding in pregnancy refers to any bleeding per vagina. This bleeding, however slight, should be taken seriously. It is sometimes the first sign of some of the most life-threatening emergencies in obstetrics such as ruptured ectopic, and incomplete abortion. You will look at the possible causes of bleeding per vagina during pregnancy, how each case presents, and how it should be managed. The procedure known as Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) as part of post-abortal care will also be covered. It is important for you to note that bleeding per vagina during pregnancy is a cause for concern to most mothers. This is particularly so in a mother who has had a previous experience of vaginal bleeding which resulted in foetal loss. You must, therefore, be aware of the mother's emotional situation when caring for her during the antepartum period.</p>
