                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>During a Kenyan population census conducted in the late 1950's, the fertility and growth rates of Kenyans were found to be high. In response, the government adopted Family Planning (FP) as an important component of socioeconomic development in the 1960's. As early as 1965, when fertility control was a primary focus, the Government of Kenya (GoK) recognised population planning and family planning as part of the National Planning Strategies of Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1965. In 1967, the Family Planning Programme was established (Gok/MoH, 1998). Since then, the fertility rate, which was $7.9 \%$ in 1979, has decreased to $5.45 \%$ in 1993, and the population growth rate has reduced from $3.8 \%$ in 1979 to $3.4 \%$ in 1993 (CBS, 1995). You may argue that this is still high. The population of Kenya was 15.3 million in 1979. By 1998, it has doubled to approximately 30 million (NCPD, 1998). Meanwhile, the growth of the economy has not kept pace with the growth of the population.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>If the population growth rate is higher than the economic growth rate, it creates a burden on available land, health facilities, educational resources and the job market. These factors often impact more on mothers and children, whose mortality and morbidity rates are high, mainly due to complications associated with pregnancy and childbirth and HIVIAIDS prevalence.</p>
                        <p>In 1974, further evaluation of reproductive health services established that the child health services were running parallel to those of family planning and antenatal care. This arrangement was viewed as inefficient. As a result, these services were integrated to offer a more consolidated package. Following this, the Maternal/Child Health Care and Family Planning (MCH/FP) Programme was established. In 1987, the Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI) was launched at the Conference on Better Health for Women and Children, held in Nairobi, Kenya. The Government of Kenya endorsed the Plan of Action to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rate, which was developed at that conference. Despite this policy shift, many reproductive health programmes continued to run as vertical entities at all levels of the health service delivery system. The vertical approach to service provision proved somewhat wasteful and inefficient in terms of utilising resources including health manpower. It also proved ineffective in reaching critical target groups in need of information and services, especially adolescents and the youth. Reproductive health issues have caused great concern not only in Kenya but also the world over. As a result, governments and other stakeholders came together in Cairo in 1994 to address these concerns and to look for solutions to problems being experienced worldwide. At the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), 179 countries endorsed a Reproductive Health Agenda. The ICPD Programme endorsed a shift in development strategies, urging member countries to review and revise health policies to focus on meeting the needs of an individual, and on the provision of basic as well as comprehensive and quality RH services. The comprehensive concept of RH is based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of RH, which recognises the fact that RH is closely interrelated with policies to empower women, strengthen families, stabilise population growth, and eradicate poverty. In response to ICPD recommendations, the concept of integrated RH services was developed and launched to meet the revised policy on RH care. Integrated RH creates demand for, and ensures provision of RH services, defined for each level of the health care system, everyday, during the same visit, under one roof, and where possible by the same provider 'the supermarket approach'. Kenya is signatory to the Cairo Declaration of 1994, which marked a turning point in the field of population and health development, not only for Kenya but the whole world. As a response to the 1994 ICPD in Cairo, the Kenya government developed and launched the Health Policy Framework Paper of 1994. This policy document provides the blueprint for strategies for the development and management of health services in this country. A notable policy document is the National Reproductive Health Strategic Plan of 1996, covering the period 1997-2010. This document guides the implementation of a comprehensive and integrated RH programme in Kenya for the next decade. In order to operationalise the 1997 - 2010 Strategic Plan, the Ministry of Health (MoH), in collaboration with various stakeholders, designed and launched a series of policy documents to spearhead the long term reform process. The MoH and its development partners have since used this policy document to review, revise and develop a series of guidelines related to reproductive health services.</p>

                        <p>A policy is an official statement issued by the government, a company or a non-governmental organisation (NGO) to guide the workers on what to do. It is a statement on the 'course of action decided on by the government.' Policy guidelines are written instructions that give directives with regard to the practices that should be followed in the provision of services to the consumer. For our purposes, the services in question are reproductive health services and the consumer is the patient who makes use of the services.</p>

                            <li>Create awareness among leaders, communities and programme implementers of the need to promote high quality reproductive health services, in order to improve the well being of the people</li>

                        <p>As mentioned earlier, the Gok responded to the 1994 Cairo ICPD Agenda and approved the Kenya Health Policy Framework (KHPF) as the blueprint for the development and management of health services in this country. To operationalise the document, the MoH developed the National Health Policy Framework (NHPF) Implementation and Action Plan, and facilitated the establishment of a Health Sector Reform Secretariat in 1996. The Secretariat has since provided an enabling environment for the implementation of various activities to meet the objectives of the RH implementation plan.</p>

                        <p>The development of this national implementation plan represents Kenya's determination not only to operationalise the reproductive health strategy but also to address the immediate causes and underlying factors that affect the health status of the population. This policy document provides a list of RH plan components in order of priority. The MoH , in collaboration with provinces and districts, set out to operationalise the RH policy document by identifying and prioritising various RH plan components with an emphasis on women and children, adolescents and youths and other groups, who experience difficulties in accessing health care. Among other priorities, all stakeholders expressed the need to train health care providers at all levels in reproductive health issues. This led to the development of The National Reproductive Health Training Plan of 2000.</p>

                        <p>This document provides policy guidelines for provision of quality care and training. Documented in this strategy paper are key results and lessons learned from the ongoing five year National Strategic Plan covering the period 1999-2003. So far, the five year programme has failed to raise other resources for safe motherhood activities. There has, therefore, been a minimal impact on the reduction of maternal mortality rate. However, some important achievements have been made, especially on the promotion of the concept of essential obstetric care and the introduction of life saving skills. It is necessary to note the shift in RH policies within the five year programme, which targets:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Advocacy for policy change in the provision of reproductive health services</li>
                            <li>Encouraging and strengthening the implementation of existing policies</li>
                            <li>Capacity building through community participation and resource mobilisation, rather than on service delivery</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Thus, during the first half of the implementation plan, strategies that rely more on advocacy, networking and knowledge generation were adopted. In recognition of the seriousness of the HIVIAIDS pandemic and in line with UNICEF regional policy, over the next five years (2004 2008) a strategy aimed at ensuring that HIV/AIDS is mainstreamed as a priority to spearhead all health and health related programs will be adopted.</p>

                        <p>It is clear that before the ICPD, most programmes equated reproductive health with Family Planning (FP). This resulted in the masking of reproductive health issues, for example, the Safe Motherhood and Child Survival Initiative, which would currently be considered priority reproductive health components. It is also obvious, as has previously been mentioned, that many of the RH programs in Kenya were administered as vertical (individual) entities at all levels of the health care system. The 1994 ICPD called for a shift in development strategy away from vertical programmes to the provision of comprehensive and integrated reproductive health services. The vertical approach to service provision proved somewhat wasteful and inefficient in terms of use of resources including health care providers. The shift in the development strategies, and in health policies specifically has shown the way forward towards integration of reproductive health services. Similarly, training of service providers has been redirected to focus on assisting them to develop the actual and potential capabilities in the provision of quality reproductive health services at all levels of the service delivery system. Integrated reproductive health implies that all patients have access to reproductive health services and information as specified in the National Reproductive Health Strategic Plan. The benefits of integrated reproductive health services are enormous.</p>

                        <p>In addition to the integration of reproductive health services, the 1994 ICPD Programme of Action emphasises the provision of comprehensive and quality care in order to meet individual health needs. It also identifies reproductive health needs and targets critical groups in need of information and services, especially the adolescents and the youth. The Ministry of Health and stakeholders, including the government, NGOs, and the private sector offer these services as outlined by the National Population Policy for Sustainable Development and the Kenya Health Policy Framework (KHPF) of 1994. To this end, the Implementation Plan for National Reproductive Health Strategy spells out reproductive health plan components listed in order of priority. components of the reproductive health plan.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Owing to biological reasons, women are more vulnerable to STIs than men. The burden of disease from STIs (excluding HIV/AIDS) is more than three times higher in women than men. Anatomical differences make reproductive tract infections more easily transmitted to women than in men, and when symptoms do occur in women, they are more advanced and serious. Because of their low social status and economic dependence on men, many women are unable to negotiate the use of condoms as a STI prevention measure. This is significant, especially given that HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death in this country. The AIDS pandemic is causing untold suffering in individuals, families and societies and has been declared a national disaster. Reproductive health programmes can reduce levels of STIs, including HIV/AIDS, by providing information and counselling on critical issues such as sexuality, gender roles, power imbalances between women and men, gender based violence and its link to HIV transmission. Service provision includes distributing female and male condoms, preventing, diagnosing and treating STIs, developing strategies for contacttracing and referring people infected with HIV for further services. This topic will be discussed at length in unit five of this module.</p>

                        <p>Reproductive health of adolescents/youth is an area that has not been addressed effectively in the past. Many times young people feel that their needs are neglected. Young people, especially between the ages of 10-24 years, have special RH needs. In order to cater for their requirements you should be able to provide services that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recognise the importance of health education and give services to meet the needs of adolescents both in and out of school.

                        <p>Gender refers to the socially constructed roles of men and women in a society. Reproductive health does not affect women alone. It is a family health and social issue as well. Unequal power relations between men and women often limit women's control over sexual activity and their ability to protect themselves against unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS. In this regard, adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable. For reproductive health services to be successful, they must address the dynamics of knowledge, power and decision making in sexual relationships in the community. As a health worker, you need to understand that reproductive health is a right. The community needs information and education to enable them to end all forms of gender inequality and discrimination that contribute to the perpetuation of harmful practices.

                        <p>Cancers of the cervix and breast are the leading malignant diseases among women in Kenya while cancers of the prostate and testis are the most common in men. Early detection is important for reduction of mortality and morbidity associated with these cancers. In Kenya access to cancer screening remains very limited, especially for the rural and urban poor. Integration of cancer prevention in reproductive health programmes should be key strategy towards making such services more accessible to women and men. Health care workers especially nurses and midwives should be adequately trained on techniques of aided or unaided visual inspection of the cervix as these can lead to early detection of suspicious cases. The main goal is to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the common cancers of the reproductive organs in men and women. The objectives to achieve this goal include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduce morbidity and mortality from cancers of reproductive health organs through early detection and early treatment</li>

                        <p>Infertility is a serious public health concern in Kenya. Although it afflicts many couples and individuals the problem has been inadequately addressed both at policy and at service levels. Infertility is defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as follows:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Primary infertility: the woman has never conceived despite unprotected intercourse for at least 12 months.</li>
                            <li>Secondary infertility: the woman has previously conceived but is subsequently unable to conceive within 12 months despite unprotected intercourse.</li>
                            <li>Pregnancy wastage: the woman is able to conceive but unable to produce a live birth.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Infertility has gender implications and regardless of the cause the woman bears the major brunt of blame and social discrimination. The main goal in prevention and management of infertility is to reduce the incidence of infertility and facilitate proper investigation and management of infertile individuals and couples. The main objectives have been set as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Advocate for recognition of infertility as a public health issue and its management an integral component of reproductive health services</li>
                            <li>Reduce prevalence of secondary infertility</li>
                            <li>Reduce the prevalence of curable STIs</li>
                            <li>Effectively manage at least $80 \%$ of curable cases of STI presenting in health facilities (WHO/AFRO)</li>
                            <li>Increase access to effective postpartum and post-abortion care services</li>
                            <li>Increase access to improved investigation and management of infertility</li>
                            <li>Increase access to training in improving management of infertility</li>

                        <p>In order to address the aforementioned components, the Ministry of Health (MoH) felt that the reproductive health approach should focus on the following:</p>

                            <li>Reorientation of the entire health care provision system through enhanced training</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>It is important to pay attention to cross cutting issues (holistic approach), which are critical in not only reducing the burden of disease imposed by reproductive health related conditions but also in increasing the coverage and quality of service improvement and provision.

                        <p>The Government of Kenya through the Ministry of Health aims at improving health services by making them affordable and accessible to the community. This is made possible in several ways including, through the decentralisation of services and the use of mobile clinics where available.</p>
                        <h4>Community Level</h4>
                        <p>This is the first level of service provision and it involves people from the grass roots. The Community Health Nurse works closely with service providers in the community in the following areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mobilising the community and participating in the provision of reproductive health services (preventive and proactive including safe motherhood, family planning, STIs/HIV/AIDS) and reporting at health centres.</li>
                            <li>Identifying community owned resource persons (CORPs) such as teachers, clergymen, Community Based Distributors (CBDs) and government field workers to provide IEC. All these people can reach their own communities easily and disseminate reproductive health issues identified by the people.</li>
                            <li>Supervising the provision of antenatal care, delivery of services and family planning by CBDs, the treatment of minor ailments by community health workers (CHWs) and the counselling of adolescents.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Local Dispensaries (Primary Level)</h4>
                        <p>This is the second level where the Community Health Nurse manages the services. It includes the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provision and supervision of IEC materials on various reproductive health issues given by a trained health professional at the facility.</li>
                            <li>Provision of reproductive health services such as counselling, clinical services including antenatal care, postnatal care, family planning, syndromic diagnosis and treatment of STI's, identification of symptoms and signs of infertility, cervical and breast cancer and referral of cases.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Health Centre (Primary Level)</h4>
                        <p>Here the Clinical Officer is in charge but works hand in hand with the Community Health Nurse. The activities include all of those described at the above two levels as well as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Management of mothers during pregnancy, labour and delivery, postnatal care STIs/HIV/AIDS and related opportunistic infections.</li>
                            <li>The use of simple laboratory facilities for screening, diagnosis and management of STIs, opportunistic infections, malaria, anaemia and intestinal worms.</li>
                            <li>The identification of infertility cases and referral to secondary level for appropriate management.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>District Level (Secondary Level)</h4>
                        <p>The District Medical Officer of Health is in charge of both private and public health services. The District Public Health Nurse (DPHN) supervises service delivery at health centre and dispensary and assists them in all duties.

                        <p>Although adolescents and the youth form the majority of our population, their issues have, for a long time, been ignored. Yet young people have special needs and requirements. At the fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, it was concluded that adolescents are a particularly vulnerable group due to the fact that they are known to have:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inadequate level of knowledge about human sexuality</li>
                            <li>Inadequate or poor information on quality reproductive health services</li>
                            <li>High risk sexual behaviours</li>
                            <li>Discriminatory social practices</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In response to these insights, the Gok decided to address adolescent and youth issues by developing new strategic approaches to communication programmes to enhance positive behaviour development and adoption by young people. In this section the biological, social and psychological characteristics of adolescents and youth are first presented. This is followed by a description of their needs and suggested methods of meeting these needs including provision of youth friendly services. This section will assist you to acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to enable you to provide quality adolescent and youth friendly services.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Adolescence is defined as the transition period between childhood and adulthood. It is a period of rapid growth and maturation as the person reaches puberty. The most colourful years of life are the teenage years. This is a period when the youth want to be appreciated for who they are and seek affection and attention. The onset of adolescence varies from one individual to the other, and between the two sexes. In girls, it may begin as early as 9 years while in boys it may begin at 12 years. The two sexes share an approximate range marking adolescence from 13-1 8 years. The youth age extends up to 21 years. However, according to the laws of Kenya, a person is considered to be an adult and answerable for their own actions from the age of 18.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Adolescence is marked by the development of secondary characteristics under the influence of the gonadotrophic hormone from the anterior pituitary gland.</p>
                        <h4>Girls</h4>
                        <p>In girls, under the influence of oestrogen some secondary characteristics develop between the ages of 12-14 years, although they have also been reported in younger ages of 8 to 9 years. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Breasts increase in size and are spherical in shape due to enlarged glandular tissue</li>
                            <li>Typical female shape and contour of the body develop, that is broad hips and narrow chest and shoulders</li>
                            <li>Hair develops in the armpits and pubic region</li>
                            <li>Internal organs of reproduction, that is, vagina, uterus, ovaries mature and menstruation (menarche) begins</li>
                            <li>Face may become smooth or facial pimples (acne) may develop</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Boys</h4>
                        <p>In boys, under the influence of androgens, secondary characteristics appear from age 12-14 years. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enlarged testis and penis</li>

                        <p>Welcome to section three of unit one of the Reproductive Health module. In the previous section you discussed adolescence and youth reproductive health. You should now be well equipped to give youth friendly services in your health facility. In this section you will cover gender first. This will be followed by a description of the influence of gender inequalities and discrimination in reproductive health. You will then address the measures that should be taken to minimise negative effects in order to improve reproductive health for women. These measures include male involvement. It has been established that human sexuality, reproduction and gender issues are closely inter-related and together affect the ability of men and women to achieve and maintain sexual health and manage their reproductive life. You will also cover how gender issues affect access to and enjoyment of good reproductive health in our communities and what you can do to improve reproductive health rights.</p>

                    <h3 id="definition-terms-heading">Definition of Terms</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>You start this section by exploring the terms 'gender' and 'reproductive health rights'.</p>
                        <h4>Gender</h4>
                        <p>What is meant by 'gender', does it simply mean male or female or does it describe more than just biological characteristics? As a term, it has been misinterpreted to mean male or female only. Biologically, people are born either male or female but learn to be a man or a woman. However, when you talk about gender, this refers to the economic, social or cultural attributes associated with being a female or a male.</p>
                        <p>An example of a 'gender stereotype' is when, culturally or socially, women are assumed to be weak and timid and, therefore, unable to perform certain tasks or contribute to the same extent as men. In most communities, it is believed that men can be better leaders to the extent that some jobs are reserved specifically for men and are male dominated, for example, politics, administration or medicine. However, in spite of their professed dominance, it is not uncommon to see men fail miserably in some of these positions. Thus gender stereotypes can result in certain role expectations. In most societies, being a man or a woman is not simply a matter of different biological and physical characteristics. Men and women face different expectations about how they should dress, behave or work. Relations between men and women, whether in the family, the workplace or the public sphere, are divided according to the understandings of the talents, characteristics and behaviour appropriate to men and women in that society. The most obvious illustration of this is the split between the public world of employment, work and politics, which is seen as 'naturally' male and the private arena of the family and the household which is seen as 'naturally' female. Women in most societies are expected to take the major responsibility for domestic tasks and for the care of children, the elderly and the sick. Men, on the other hand, are allocated the primary responsibility for supporting the family.</p>
                        <h4>Reproductive Health Rights</h4>
                        <p>The reproductive health rights are drawn from international human rights declarations and treaties such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), the Beijing Platform of Action of the 1995 World Conference on Women, and more recently by the Safe Motherhood Action Agenda (1997) for the next decade.</p>
                        <p>The 1994, Cairo Program of Action of ICPD conference defined reproductive health rights as:</p>
                        <blockquote>' ...the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes their right to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence as expressed in human rights documents.'</blockquote>
                        <p>The 1997 Colombo (Sri Lanka) Safe Motherhood Technical Consultation Committee designed strategic reproductive health interventions, which rest on a foundation of greater equity for women. Member countries are encouraged to design other non-health activities, which could improve the socio-economic status of women. Such activities include: provision of formal education for girls, giving women equal employment and business opportunities as well as empowerment of women to make decisions in their households. Reproductive health rights and gender issues are closely interrelated and together affect the ability of men and women to achieve and maintain sexual health and manage their reproductive life. Poor reproductive health is directly related to gender based inequality in the distribution of social power and resources. In our male dominated Kenyan society, women are denied equal access to political affairs, education, economic participation and legal powers, in spite of the fact that the legal system in Kenya in theory does not discriminate against women.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 id="gender-inequalities-heading">Gender Inequalities and Discrimination</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Gender inequality and discrimination refers to unequal access to power, resources and opportunities in society. Gender inequality and discrimination harms the health of young girls and women, directly and indirectly, throughout their life cycle. The neglect of their health needs through, for example, overworking and poor eating habits, makes them vulnerable to chronic ill health, which prevents many women from fully taking part in society. Unequal power relations between men and women often limit women's control over sexual activity and their ability to protect themselves against unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. The subordinate status of women goes far back. The place of women in society has never been equal to that of men. In the Christian Bible, it is said that the Jewish community in which Jesus was born and later ministered had very little regard for women compared to their male counterparts. A woman could be divorced at her husband's request without objections. In African society, sociocultural factors tied with traditional beliefs and practices play a great role in determining the place of women in almost all spheres of their lives. This influence begins with the socialisation of young children both within and outside the home. At childhood, both boys and girls are introduced to societal beliefs, practices and values as they apply to each gender. Boys are supposed to become heads and protectors of the family. The girls become wives and mothers, dependent on their husbands. These gender inequalities between sexes lead to women's subordinate positions within the family. Before you continue, reflect briefly on the type of gender inequalities you have observed in your community.</p>
                        <h4>Examples of Gender Inequalities</h4>
                        <p>You may have observed the following inequalities:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inequalities in education</li>
                            <li>Inequalities in the labour force</li>
                            <li>Access to medical care</li>
                            <li>Law of succession</li>
                            <li>Cultural practices (such as female genital mutilation, polygamy and wife inheritance)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You will now look at different manifestations of gender inequality in detail.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 id="gender-violence-heading">Gender Violence</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Did you know that around the world, at least one in every three women has been beaten, coerced into sex, or abused in some other way, most often by someone she knows like a husband or male relative? This is what is called gender violence. Gender based violence is recognised today as a major issue on the international human rights agenda. As you well know, in some communities, the right of a husband to beat or physically intimidate his wife is a deeply held conviction. Indeed, there are women who often view a degree of physical abuse is justified under certain conditions. Justification for violence comes from gender norms, which give a distorted view about the roles and responsibilities of men and women in relationships. For instance, men who engage in domestic violence are motivated by the desire to demonstrate their masculinity or enforce their male power and control over the women. That is why experts have adopted the term gender based violence to describe this type of violence. Although violence against men does also occur, it is extremely rare. However, violence against women and girls is very common and on the rise. According to the World Bank, violence against girls and women throughout the world causes more death and disability among women in the 15-44 age group than cancer, malaria, traffic accidents, and even war.</p>
                        <p>The dictionary definition of violence is: 'using or tending to use aggressive force'. Another important word for you to know is 'abuse'.</p>
                        <p>Abuse may be defined as: 'a systematic pattern of behaviour in a relationship that is used to gain and/or maintain control and power over another'.</p>
                        <p>Abuse ranges from emotional abuse such as hurting another person's feelings; psychological violence such as threats to do bodily harm, physical abuse such as hitting to cause pain or injury, and sexual abuse which includes rape, defilement and incest. For the purposes of this section the terms 'violence' and 'abuse' will be used interchangeably.</p>
                        <h4>Violence Against Women</h4>
                        <p>Violence against women includes a wide range of abuse and harassment and may take place throughout a woman's lifetime as shown in the table below.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Safe motherhood is neither a simple nor a single concept, and what is encompassed by the term has evolved considerably since 1987. While the focus on maternal mortality has remained, three other outcomes have now been incorporated.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maternal morbidity</li>
                            <li>Health of the newborn</li>
                            <li>Positive health of the mother</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Thus, the meaning of safe motherhood has broadened, particularly in the early 1990s as has the range of factors regarded as determinants of poor maternal health, with women's low socioeconomic status seen as one of the root causes. The Safe Motherhood mandate for the reproductive health programme is assumed to span across the continuum of pre-conception care, antenatal care, labour and delivery, postpartum and postnatal care and neonatal care (first month of life). The RH policy recognises that in at least $15 \%$ of pregnant women serious obstetric complications can occur that usually can not be predicted or prevented in advance, and therefore emphasises the need for all pregnant women to have access to skilled care, throughout pregnancy, delivery, postpartum and postnatal periods. The most critical time for both the mother and her baby is during childbirth and in the first few hours afterwards (reproductive health policy draft outline.2005. pg 18).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Safe motherhood is a woman's ability to have a safe and healthy pregnancy and delivery. Making motherhood safe requires action on three fronts simultaneously:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduce the number of high risk and unwanted pregnancies</li>
                            <li>Reduce the number of obstetric complications</li>
                            <li>Reduce the cases of high fertility rate in women with complications</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>The Key Components of Safe Motherhood</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Focused antenatal care which research suggests lowers the rate of maternal morbidity and mortality</li>
                            <li>Safe and clean delivery so that all women deliver under some type of supervised care, where referral systems are established to provide emergency treatment for life threatening complications of delivery</li>
                            <li>Postnatal care that contributes to a woman's ability to enjoy sexual relations without pain and have safe pregnancy and delivery in future</li>
                            <li>Safe, humane and cost-effective postabortion care</li>

                    <h3 id="smi-initiative-heading">Safe Motherhood Initiative</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI) is a supportive effort, which was launched in 1987, in Nairobi, by WHO and its partners to focus the world's attention on problems related to pregnancy and childbirth. Lack of commitment to women's health problems by the government was seen as the major underlying cause of many maternal deaths. To address this problem, delegates to the Nairobi Conference in 1987 recommended the introduction of a Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI) to be implemented by all countries.</p>
                        <h4>Objectives of the Safe Motherhood Initiative</h4>
                        <p>The conference described the Safe Motherhood Initiative as a global strategy aimed at reducing maternal mortality by half by the year 2000 by creating circumstances within which a woman is enabled to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Choose whether she will become pregnant</li>
                            <li>Receive care for the prevention and treatment of pregnancy complications</li>
                            <li>Have access to trained birth attendants</li>
                            <li>Have access to emergency obstetric complications if necessary</li>
                            <li>Have care after birth</li>
                            <li>Avoid death or disability from complications of pregnancy and childbirth (Feuerestein, 1993)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In response, the Kenya government endorsed this plan of action to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. The scope of the Safe Motherhood Initiative has advanced tremendously to encompass many action areas and now includes safe motherhood through human rights for women (Fathalla, 1997 and 2000; WHO 2001). The SMI differs from other health initiatives in that it focuses on the well being of women as an end to itself. Thaddeus and Maine (1994) argued that, prevention of a death of a pregnant woman is considered to be the key objective, not because the death adversely affects children and other family members but because women are intrinsically valuable.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In order to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality, efforts should be focused on the eight pillars of safe motherhood as illustrated in the diagram below.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_17_8870e4d890e2e1a5253eg-028-1.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating the eight pillars of Safe Motherhood. The pillars are Family Planning, Focused Antenatal Care, Clean and Safe Delivery, and Essential Obstetric Care. Additional components listed are Post Abortion Care, PMTCT, Targeted Postpartum Care, and Neonatal Care. These pillars rest on a foundation of 'Equity for Women / Reproductive Rights' and are delivered through Primary Health Care." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <h4>Family Planning</h4>
                        <p>Good family planning ensures that individuals and couples have the information and services to plan the timing, number and spacing of pregnancies. For further reading, see unit four of this module.</p>
                        <h4>Focused Antenatal Care</h4>
                        <p>This serves to prevent complications where possible and ensures that complications of pregnancy are detected early and treated appropriately. Four focused antenatal visits are recommended, which emphasise:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Taking two doses of sulphapyremethane (SP) during pregnancy for malaria endemic areas</li>
                            <li>Recognising signs and symptoms of malaria</li>
                            <li>Recognising danger signs in pregnancy and where to go for help</li>
                            <li>Drawing up an individual birth plan, which should include a mother/baby package, transport plans and funds/money. For further reading, see unit two of this module</li>
