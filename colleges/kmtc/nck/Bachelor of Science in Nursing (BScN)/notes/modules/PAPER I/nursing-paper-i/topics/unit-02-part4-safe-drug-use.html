                <section id="pharmacology" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="pharmacology-heading">
                    <h2 id="pharmacology-heading" class="section-heading">Pharmacology</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>You were taught pharmacology for nurses during your KECHN training. Since then you have been administering drugs to patients.</p>
                        <h3>The Definition of Pharmacology</h3>
                        <p>You may have come up with various definitions. Admittedly, there are many definitions of pharmacology. The most widely accepted one states, 'Pharmacology is the science of drugs, which includes their preparation, use and effects'.</p>
                        <p>In this definition the core word is 'drugs'. Most people, when defining drugs, think of only medicinal drugs that are prescribed by a doctor to treat illness. What about substances like caffeine, alcohol, nicotine and tobacco? What about the illegal drugs that are often abused or the environmental substances that have physiological effects when they come into contact with the body?</p>
                        <p>In view of this, the broader definition of pharmacology is 'the study of the effects of chemical substances on living tissues'. You are aware that every culture has studied plants and has developed a system of medicine founded on the use of plants. The common term used for this kind of treatment is herbal medicine. The government is in the process of regulating what is commonly known as alternative medicine.</p>
                        <p>You must be asking yourself a few questions about the significance of pharmacology in nursing. You have a responsibility in the administration of drugs. You are expected to exercise judgment in the management of drug therapy. You require an understanding of drug action and the ability to detect both therapeutic and adverse reactions in the patient. You are also expected to counsel patients on the management of their drug regimens for optimal effect.</p>
                        <p>In your nursing practice at times you diagnose and treat minor illnesses and are involved in the prescribing of medications. As a registered community health nurse you will be expected to promote health and prevent drug related diseases. You will, therefore, be concerned with the health impact of environment pollutants and health aspects of social, medicinal and illegal drug use. You will be teaching the community on how to avoid drug hazards and prevent chemically induced disease.</p>
                        <p>Whether practising community health nursing or occupational health nursing, you will be involved in the early detection of drug related problems through case finding and referral. In addition, you will work with patients to improve self-care practices in home-based care. When administering drugs you must detect early signs and symptoms of toxicity, adverse reactions and drug interactions as well as therapeutic responses.</p>
                        <p>You have now seen why it is important for you to learn pharmacology. Your overall role is to promote responsible use of chemicals to enhance health, at the same time minimising the detrimental effects of such use. You are, therefore, required to utilise your knowledge of the human anatomy and physiology, legal aspects of nursing, that is, ethics and law pertaining to nursing practice. Remember that you covered the laws relating to nursing practice in unit one.</p>

                            <p>When administering drug therapy, you must be skilled in practical technical procedures required to handle, control and administer drugs safely.</p>

                    <h2 id="drug-laws-heading" class="section-heading">Laws Relating to the Control of Drugs</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>You may be asking yourself whether it is necessary for you to have a wide knowledge of the legislation governing the administration and supply of drugs and to some extent you do. As a nurse of the twenty first century, you must have this knowledge because of the expanding roles of the nurse, especially the community health nurse.</p>
                        <p>As discussed earlier, an understanding of pharmacology and the reasons for storing drugs, in particular is essential. This knowledge will enable you to have confidence so as to ensure your safety and the safety of the patient when dealing with substances, which could be harmful. The regulations governing the administration of drugs may be divided into two: those that are statutory, relating to various Acts of Parliament and those that are institutional policies.</p>
                        <p>The aim of this legislation is proper management of drugs so as to prevent error, illegal usage and addiction. The persons chiefly affected by the statutes are doctors, pharmacists, nurses and clinical officers. In Kenya, just like any other country in the world, there are elaborate legislative controls governing drug use. These laws restrict the production, distribution, prescription and administration of drugs.</p>
                        <p>You must:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be familiar with the regulations affecting drug use in your area of practice</li>
                            <li>Continually update yourself on the changes drug regulations</li>
                            <li>Know the policies of the institution you are working in.</li>
                            <li>Abide by the drug control laws within your professional practice</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As you are advising patients on the use of drugs, you must not recommend the use of illegal substances or provide drugs for patients' use without proper prescription. You must maintain the security of drugs at all times to prevent diversion to unauthorised persons. For example, medication should be stored in locked cupboards. Some drugs must be kept under double locks. During drug administration all unlocked drugs must be kept under direct observation and control. Maintain careful records of the disposition of each dose of certain drugs such as DDA (narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances).</p>
                        <p>The patient has the final control on drug use. Normally, the patient gives or withholds consent to treatment and also determines compliance. You are, therefore, to ascertain the patient's drug attitudes and practices during the assessment. Explain carefully the need to change old habits. Give clear explanations and descriptions of drug regimens. You must respect the client's refusal for treatment and drug therapy.</p>

                        <h3>The Pharmacy and Poisons Act: Chapter 244 of the Laws of Kenya, 1989</h3>
                        <p>This law requires the registration of all sellers of poisons. The act deals with the registration of pharmacists, defining statutory poisons, and drawing up the poisons list, which is divided into two parts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Part I:</strong> Consists of those poisons which are not to be sold except by authorised sellers of poisons and by licensed wholesale dealers and dealers in mining, agricultural or horticultural accessories;</li>
                            <li><strong>Part II:</strong> Consists of those poisons which are not to be sold except by persons entitled to sell Part I poisons and by persons licensed under section 32.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Poisons Act, 1989 sets out various schedules which deal with the sale, labelling and colour of certain poisons. The schedules relevant to nursing are Schedule 1(5.1) and Schedule 4(5.4).</p>
                        <h4>Schedule 1(5.1)</h4>
                        <p>Poisons contained in the first schedule must be stored in a locked cupboard and must be adequately labelled. In hospital, they may be supplied only on a prescription signed by a registered medical practitioners or on a written order from the nurse in charge of the ward or the deputy.</p>
                        <h4>Schedule 4 (5.4)</h4>
                        <p>Poisons contained in the fourth schedule are divided into two parts.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>S. 4 A.</strong> This group is used in medicine and must be ordered on a prescription by a registered doctor or dentist and bears the:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Name and address of doctor and patient</li>
                                    <li>Name of the drug</li>
                                    <li>Quantity to be supplied</li>
                                    <li>Dose to be taken and if the prescription may be repeated</li>
                                    <li>Signature of the doctor and the date</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>S. 4 B.</strong> These drugs must be ordered on prescription but it requires only the date and doctor's signature.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>All schedule 4.A poisons are automatically included in the first schedule and are, therefore, kept in a locked cupboard. The pharmacist is required to keep schedule 4.A. prescriptions for two years.</p>

                        <h3>The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act, 1994</h3>
                        <p>This is an Act of Parliament to make provision with respect to the control of the possession of, and trafficking in, narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and cultivation of certain plants, to provide for forfeiture of property derived from, or used in, illicit traffic narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and for connected purposes. The Act sets up an Advisory Council to review any drugs likely to be misused and determine if it could constitute a social problem. The Advisory Council also advises the minister on particular measures to be taken to prevent misuse of drugs or to deal with problems created by their use by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Restricting the availability of such drugs</li>

                        <p>Local regulations are devised by individual hospitals and are meant to protect their staff, particularly the nurse during training:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Any dangerous drugs should be checked by a registered/enrolled nurse</li>

                    <h2 id="drug-standards-heading" class="section-heading">Drug Standards</h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Standards are the yardsticks by which drug preparations are judged. As you have seen earlier, the standards for drug quality are established and enforced by the government. Medicines vary in their purity, strength, bioavailability, efficacy and safety or toxicity.</p>
                        <p>Standards of these or other properties must provide a method for measuring the attribute to be evaluated as well as an acceptable level or range for those measurements.</p>
                        <h3>Purity</h3>
                        <p>A pure drug contains only a specific chemical agent with no contaminating ingredients. Drugs are not 100% pure because of the impurities from raw materials used for manufacturing them. Other ingredients are added to the chemical to manipulate the absorption process. These additives include solvents, fillers, disintegrators, buffers, waxes, dyes, inks and plastics.</p>
                        <p>Contaminants from the environment of the production plant may find their way into a batch of drugs. Standards of purity, therefore, rarely require that the substance in question be 100% drug chemical. They do, however, specify the type and concentration of extraneous substances allowed to be present in the drug product.</p>
                        <h5>Potency</h5>
                        <p>The potency or the strength of a drug is measured by assay techniques. Chemical analysis is used to determine the ingredients present in a preparation and their relative amounts.</p>
                        <h5>Bioavailability</h5>
                        <p>Bioavailability is the degree to which a drug can be absorbed and transported by the body to its site of action. This may be influenced by particle size, crystalline structure, solubility and polarity of the drug compound.</p>
                        <p>Bioavailability is commonly measured by blood or tissue concentration of the drug at a specified time following administration of a dose.</p>
                        <h5>Efficacy</h5>
                        <p>Efficacy is the effectiveness of a drug in treatment.</p>
                        <h5>Safety or Toxicity</h5>
                        <p>Safety or toxicity is measured by the incidence and severity of reported adverse reactions following the use of a drug.</p>
                        <p>To be able to interpret drug data intelligently, you must:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be familiar with the signature of each property and the limitations of the testing procedures used to measure it</li>
                            <li>Evaluate therapeutic responses in patients receiving medication</li>
                            <li>Monitor adverse or toxic effects because if adverse reactions are diagnosed earlier it becomes easier to treat them</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Should you be involved in clinical trials of experimental drugs on human subjects, you will need to assess the patients appropriately so as to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Protect patients from serious harm stemming from their exposure to unproven drugs</li>
                            <li>Generate valid data for evaluation of the experimental drugs</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Name of Drug</h4>
                        <p>A drug may be prescribed using various names, such as the trade name, generic name, and/or chemical name. You should be aware of the various names of drugs. You should also be aware of the different drug families.</p>
                        <h5>Chemical Name</h5>
                        <p>The chemical name of a drug indicates its atomic and molecular structure. These names are commonly used by the chemist and/or the research pharmacist. The names are unsuitable for general use since they are long.</p>
                        <p>Examples of chemical names include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acetylsalicylic acid (C6H4OHCOOC1H5)</li>
                            <li>7-Chloro-10 (3-dimiethlyamino-npropy)</li>
                            <li>phenothiazine hydrochloride</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h5>Generic Name</h5>
                        <p>A generic name (some call it approved name) is a simpler, shorter name for each drug substance. The name is often proposed by the company that first develops the drug. Examples of generic names include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>acetylsalicylic acid commonly known as aspirin</li>
                            <li>7 chloro-z methyl-amino-sphenyl-3h-1, benco diazepine, 4oxide commonly known as chlordiazepoxide</li>
                            <li>2-chloro-10(3-dimiethlyamino-n-npropyl) pherothiazine hydrochloride commonly known as chlorpromazine</li>
                            <li>4 hydroxyacetanilide P -acetamido phenol commonly known as paracetamol</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Trade Name</h5>
                        <p>Trademarks, trade names, brand names and proprietary names are interchangeable terms used to identify drugs manufactured by various drug companies. A specific generic drug may have various trade names.</p>
                        <p>The symbol ® after the trade name indicates that the trade name is registered and its use is restricted to the manufacturer who owns it. Trade names may be selected to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Denote the drug's chemical structure</li>
                            <li>Identify the company responsible for manufacturing the drug</li>
                            <li>Represent some property of the drug</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Examples of trade names include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chlordiazepoxide, referred to as Librium®</li>
                            <li>Chlorpromazine, referred to as Largactil®</li>
                            <li>Paracetamol, referred to as Calpol®, Cetal®, PMC®, Panadol®, Panleve®, Panok®, Labalgin® and so on</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>No other firms or company can employ the same trade name. A trade name is usually selected to be short, catchy and easy to pronounce.</p>

                        <h4>Drug Family</h4>
                        <p>Drugs may be classified in many ways. One substance may belong to more than one family depending on the classification used. A drug may be designated by its chemical derivation, for example, heavy metals, xanthines, steroids, phenothiazines and so on.</p>
                        <p>Drugs may also be grouped according to the mechanism of action, for example, central nervous system depressant, anti-cholinergic, anti-inflammatory and others. In other words, drugs with similar characteristics are often grouped together in families.</p>
                        <p>The family name may denote its:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chemical structure, for example, barbiturate</li>
                            <li>Mode of action, for example, antacid</li>
                            <li>Physiologic action, for example, diuretic</li>
                            <li>Therapeutic effect, for example, anticonvulsant, analgesic</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A drug may also be listed under more than one classification, for instance, aspirin, which is an analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory drug.</p>

                    <h3 id="drug-effects-heading" class="section-heading">Drug Effects</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Desired Therapeutic Effects</h4>
                        <p>The desired therapeutic effects should indicate the mechanism of action of the drug. For example, an analgesic is for pain relief, accomplished by central nervous system depression inhibition of inflammation, neutralisation of acid in the stomach, vasodilation in angina or muscle relaxation. You must therefore understand how medication affects body function in order to make sound judgements about which medication to use.</p>
                        <h4>Side Effects</h4>
                        <p>Side effects of a drug are physiological effects exerted by the chemical that are not related to the desired therapeutic effect. You must, therefore, be familiar with serious side effects and commonly occurring side effects.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> All drugs have side effects. The number and range of side effects may indicate the relative toxicity of a given medication.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Adverse reactions include any undesirable effect apparent in the recipient. They may be opposite to the desired effect, allergic or extraneous. Unusual effects seen in some patients due to individual differences are known as idiosyncratic, which refers to the tendency within the individual to react unfavourably to certain substances.</p>
                        <p>When you know that a patient has an idiosyncrasy, or where a group of drugs is known to precipitate such reactions, extra care must be exercised. For example, lodine and lodides will precipitate coryza. Aspirin may cause urticaria and asthma. Barbiturates may cause a measles like rash.</p>
                        <h4>Toxic Effects</h4>
                        <p>Toxic effects are those that involve an excessive drug effect. They tend to be exaggerations of therapeutic or side effects. For example, toxicity from a central nervous system depressant used for sedation may induce a coma. If the depressant is an opiate, which acts as a miotic, the pupils are reduced to pinpoint size. The margin of safety between therapeutic and toxic doses varies greatly.</p>
                        <p>What you should know is that any substance that is physiologically potent enough to produce therapeutic effects is potentially harmful to the body at certain circumstances. Toxic symptoms could appear in clients receiving appropriate dosages. This is because drug response, metabolism and excretion vary from person to person.</p>
                        <h4>Contraindications</h4>
                        <p>Contraindications are conditions or symptoms that alert you to the potential dangers of the drug. You must always decline to administer any drug that you believe will cause harm to the client. In such cases, let the physician administer the drug personally. In such a situation, there are legal implications and this is the reason for the decision not to administer the drug.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Dosage Range</h4>
                        <p>The usual dosage must be included for each method of administration. Dosages require adjustment according to certain factors for example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Body mass</li>
                            <li>Nutritional status</li>
                            <li>Pathologic condition</li>
                            <li>Patients' ability to metabolise and excrete the drug</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When you notice any unusual dosages, you should verify and clarify with the doctor. You should refuse to carry out an order that, in your judgment, will result in harm to the patient. Errors in dosage are not uncommon especially in the case of verbal orders. It is your responsibility to alert the doctor to the possibility of error.</p>
                        <h4>Elimination</h4>
                        <p>You must be aware of the physiological mechanisms by which a drug is inactivated and eliminated from the body. The efficiency of elimination affects the efficacy and potential for toxicity of a given medication. Many drugs are deactivated by microsomal enzymes in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. You must always adhere to procedures that promote accurate identification of drugs before administering them to patients.</p>
                        <p>Drugs are derived from plants, animals or mineral resources. Others are produced synthetically in the laboratory. These drugs may be in various forms. You have been administering various preparations of drugs.</p>

                        <h4>The Route of Administration</h4>
                        <p>The route of administration is dependent on the time at which the effect is required. It is also dependent upon the method most suitable to the drug prescribed. Where possible, oral administration is preferred. Drugs can be administered orally, sublingually, rectally or by injection.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Orally, where drugs are administered orally in liquid, powder or tablet form.</li>
                            <li>Sublingually, where tablets or lamellae may be allowed to dissolve under the tongue.</li>
                            <li>Rectally, which involves the use of suppositories or enemata.</li>
                            <li>Inhalation, where drugs are inhaled as vapour or sprays.</li>
                            <li>Locally or topically, where drugs are used locally on the skin or in the eye, ear or vagina.</li>
                            <li>Injection, which can be done in several ways including intradermally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intravenously and intrathecally.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You must bear in mind that when prescribing a drug, the dosage may vary with certain factors.</p>
                        <h5>The Factors to Bear in Mind When Prescribing a Drug</h5>
                        <h6>Age</h6>
                        <p>The extremes of age that is, children and adults over 60 years require smaller doses than the normal adult dose. You must, therefore, calculate their drug dosage as per kilo of body weight. The drug dosages are normally indicated at the label of the drug container or the literature accompanying the drug. In common practice, there is an assumed dosage for children over thirteen years and adults. You should note that calculation of drug dosages will also depend on the age. For children and adults over 65 years it is advisable to calculate the dosages per kilo of body weight. Follow the physician's or manufacturers instructions when you are calculating the drugs dosages.</p>
                        <h6>Route</h6>
                        <p>The route by which the drug may be given varies and the drug dosage may also vary according to the route of administration.</p>
                        <h6>Assimilation</h6>
                        <p>The assimilation of drugs given orally is fairly slow, thus the oral dose is large, whereas any drug injected into the blood stream acts immediately and dosage is proportionately smaller. Therefore, you must take the greatest care to check the target cells. Organise concentration so that you administer drugs by the correct route. As you prepare to administer drugs, you have to be conversant with the knowledge of weights and measures.</p>

                            <p><strong>Note the following examples of weights and measures carefully!</strong></p>
                            <p>1000 micrograms (mcg) = 1 milligram (mg)</p>
                            <p>1000 milligrams (mg) = 1 gramme (g)</p>
                            <p>1000 grammes (g) = 1 kilogram (kg)</p>
                            <p>1000 millilitres (ml) = 1 litre (L)</p>
                            <p>Also remember, that while you are in the community you may be forced to convert the measurements into domestic equivalents.</p>
                            <p>A teaspoonful is nearly 5 ml</p>
                            <p>A tablespoonful is nearly 10 ml</p>
                            <p>A teacupful is nearly 150 ml</p>
                            <p>A tumblerful is about 250 ml</p>
