                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>You might have noted from the introduction that the first four objectives of this unit are on effective communication and the next four are on counselling. Therefore, this section will begin by focusing on communication, and later on counselling.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Communication</h4>
                        <p>Communication is the exchange of information between two or more persons who are interacting with each other in such a way that the information is understood. It can, therefore, be concluded that communication is the transfer of meaningful information and the establishment of commonality with the audience.</p>
                        <h4>Types of Communication</h4>
                        <p>Communication can be formal, informal or unconscious.</p>
                        <h5>Formal Communication</h5>
                        <p>Formal communication is any official method of communicating with people (employees) in an organisation. The communication may be passed orally or in written form. The message flows from top to bottom, for example, from the top management to staff at the lower levels, following the hierarchy or chain of command in the particular organisation.</p>
                        <p>Formal communication mainly involves giving instructions to be followed and clarifying the roles of staff in the organisations. It also emphasises the use of available resources to achieve the desired goals. Formal communication flows in three directions, namely:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Downward communication</li>
                            <li>Upward communication</li>
                            <li>Horizontal communication</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Downward Communication</h6>
                        <p>This is where the communication flow comes from top management to the lowest level. The communication channels used include oral messages, telephone calls, written communication in the form of circular letters, memoranda, pamphlets or posters. The main advantage of downward communication is that it is received immediately and is not distorted. For example, the district public health nurse may request the nurse working in a health centre to submit a written report on a monthly basis to their office.</p>
                        <p>The main disadvantage of downward communication is that it is unidirectional, that is, there is no return path for communication, this delays feedback. For example, a nurse in charge of a unit may decide to keep a recommendation report for promotion in the file and delay sending it to the Public Service Commission for approval. Downward communication within the Ministry of Health is illustrated in the diagram.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-387-1.jpg" alt="A flowchart showing downward communication flow in the Ministry of Health, from the Permanent Secretary at the top, down through various directors and officers to the staff at the local level." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Upward Communication</h6>
                        <p>This type of communication flows from staff at lower and middle levels to the top management. This provides feedback regarding organisational progress, a consultative forum to improve the quality of service and a means for staff to request clarification of goals and/or additional resources. Practically, however, this very rarely happens and it is important to encourage staff at lower levels to participate.</p>
                        <p>The main advantage of this type of communication is that it helps to maintain the discipline of staff at lower levels. It also protects the seniority of staff at the middle levels.</p>
                        <p>The main disadvantage is that the middle level staff management may refuse to forward the grievances coming from the lower level staff. For example, a sister in charge of a ward may refuse to pass information from junior nurses to the matron in charge of the hospital.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-387-2.jpg" alt="A flowchart showing upward communication flow, from local level staff up through various officers and directors to the Permanent Secretary at the top." class="content-image">

                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Horizontal Communication</h6>
                        <p>In horizontal communication the communication flow occurs between heads of departments or supervisors who are at the same level. The nurses in-charge of medical and surgical departments/wards consult one another. The supervisors at the same level exchange ideas on common goals in order to improve the quality of patient care. The supervisors may discuss the common problems affecting their departments with a view of getting solutions to recommend to the top management for approval.</p>
                        <p>Horizontal communication also occurs at the health centre and dispensary levels when the staff consult one another. The main advantages of this type of communication are that it encourages free communication by all staff in the departments all the time and ensures that staff do not fear each other, thus improving interpersonal relationships.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Informal Communication</h5>
                        <p>Informal communication is an unofficial form of communication between groups of people in the organisation. The messages are discussed casually and are not recognised by the management. Informal communication is also known as the 'grapevine'.</p>
                        <p>The grapevine is a form of information containing some half-truths and may emanate from the staff at the lower or middle levels in the organisation. The grapevine is common in organisations where a certain cadre of staff feels that their needs are not being addressed or where top management fails to clarify issues or communicate effectively with the middle and lower level staff. The grapevine should not be ignored because it gives a warning of impending issues of concern to the employees. The top management should provide current information to minimise grapevine rumours. Grapevine communication also gives a chance to the colleagues to express their views.</p>
                        <h5>Unconscious Communication</h5>
                        <p>Unconscious communication is where a wrong meaning has been transferred because of the way the communication has been conveyed unconsciously to the receiver. Usually the sender of the message is unaware that their behaviour is sending the wrong signals. For example, if you appear quite casual when giving important information, the recipient will misinterpret the importance of the information because of the manner in which you speak. Therefore, it is important for health workers to be aware of unconscious communication.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>The Communication Process</h4>
                        <p>The communication process can easily be defined as the passing of information from the sender to the receiver. The components of the communication process can be remembered using the acronym "MSCREFS" which stands for: Message, Source, Channel, Receiver, Effects, Feedback, Social settings.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Despite your best attempts to communicate with your patients or colleagues, you may fail because of certain barriers or factors that hinder effective communication. It is, therefore, important for you to know some of these barriers and how you can overcome them.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain what is meant by a barrier to effective communication</li>
                            <li>Describe barriers that may affect the six elements of the communication process</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Barriers to Communication</h4>
                        <p>Barriers are the factors that prevent effective communication. After being placed in a channel, the message may be interfered with by some disturbance which increases the difficulty in perception or prevents some elements of the message from reaching the receiver.</p>
                        <p>Barriers to effective communication may be due to any breakdown in the six elements of the communication process: source, message, channel, receiver, effects and social setting. In this section, you will look at all the six elements and see how each can contribute to a breakdown in communication.</p>
                        <h5>Barriers Resulting from the Source</h5>
                        <p>The source of the message should have qualities that facilitate effective communication. Firstly, the source should have a sound understanding of their audience and a good knowledge of their subject. The audience determines the level of language and vocabulary to be used. When addressing illiterate peasants, one has to put oneself in their situation to be able to appreciate their culture, values, perceptions, worries and hopes. Failure to recognise the importance of these socio-cultural and psychological factors can lead to a breakdown in communication.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the semantic barriers, there are also physical barriers. These may be attributed to the climate, for example, very cold or very hot weather, wind, noise and so on.</p>
                        <p>System overload may occur where an individual sends or receives too much information at the same time. For example, a nurse may be taking over an evening shift and all of a sudden she is urgently called to attend to a telephone call from the matron. This will deflect her attention which will lead to communication breakdown.</p>
                        <p>The privacy and confidentiality of the patient when taking their history is important. Where privacy and confidentiality are not observed, the readiness of the patient to talk freely is severely restricted which can lead to a communication breakdown. The sender should use appropriate language according to the level and age of the receiver.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>
                <!-- END: section-2-barriers -->
                                 
                <!-- START: barriers-continued -->
                <section id="barriers-continued" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="barriers-continued-heading">
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5 id="barriers-continued-heading">Barriers Affecting the Message</h5>
                        <p>The other component of the communication process is the message. The message is what the sender wishes to convey to the audience. In order for the message to be well-received and effective, the sender must plan it well with the needs of the audience in mind. In other words:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What does the sender want the receiver to know?</li>
                            <li>How do they expect the receiver to feel?</li>
                            <li>Do they want to change the behaviour of the receiver?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Unless the sender plans their message with these factors in mind, the message is unlikely to have the desired effect on the audience.</p>
                        <h6>Techniques for Creating Effective Messages</h6>
                        <p>In order to avoid failure in communication, you must address the following factors:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The message must be expressed in simple language. It must be short and to the point. The delivery of the message should involve proper communication, pauses and stressing of key words.</li>
                            <li>The message must be problem-centred. It must address a health concern or issue affecting the individual or the community.</li>
                            <li>The message should be culturally relevant and not offensive to the values and beliefs of the community or individuals. Religious beliefs are particularly important.</li>
                            <li>The message must fall within the socioeconomic abilities of the audience. Do not propose solutions that are beyond the reach of your audience.</li>
                            <li>The message must demonstrate that it is much more important and beneficial to do what is proposed in the message than what the message opposes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Barriers Resulting from the Receiver</h5>
                        <p>The next component of the communication process that can bring about communication breakdown is inadequate knowledge or understanding of the socio-economic and cultural factors surrounding the audience. Understanding the audience is key to successful communication. The receiver is a very important element in the communication process.</p>
                        <h6>Factors in a Communication Breakdown at the Receiver</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the receiver of the message is inadequately prepared physically, socially and psychologically about the venue and time of giving a health message, they may arrive late.</li>
                            <li>If the receiver does not know the benefits to gain from the message, they may have little interest to listen to the message.</li>
                            <li>If the receiver of the message does not understand the language because it is expressed in complicated jargon. The sender must speak in a language that is familiar to the audience.</li>
                            <li>If the sender stammers and speaks inaudibly there will be communication breakdown because of poor delivery of message.</li>
                            <li>If the message is received in a noisy environment, then the receiver will not hear it well.</li>
                            <li>If the message is transmitted to the receiver when they are emotionally disturbed, there will be a communication breakdown because of lack of concentration.</li>
                            <li>If the message transmitted is against the religious beliefs of the community, the communication process will be ineffective. For example, sharing health messages with Catholics on artificial methods of family planning, especially condom use when they believe in natural family planning methods. There will be a conflict of interests leading to communication breakdown.</li>
                            <li>There will be a likely communication breakdown if the sender of the message does not know the socio-economic status of the community. This is because the sender and receiver will not be able to relate and share the meaning of the message in the same way.</li>
                            <li>If the message contains too much information, the receiver may not be able to cope with the information. They will be overwhelmed and confused.</li>
                            <li>If the the message takes a long time to reach the receiver, the audience will change their priorities.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Barriers Resulting from the Social Setting</h5>
                        <p>You have seen that the social setting is the environment in which the message is transmitted. The social setting creates 'noise' which interferes with the message. This 'noise' can be anything that interferes with the message signal, or distracts the source or recipient, it is not limited to actual noises, it can be visual, olfactory, tactile, electronic, cultural, racial or age related.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The selected venue for receiving the message has different posters, which are not relevant to the health message given. The posters act as detractors thus decreasing the level of concentration.</li>
                            <li>The sender does not consider the social status of the audience. For example, when you are organising a health meeting, include respected persons in the society like chiefs, councillors and members of parliament. These are individuals that the community has accepted as their leaders.</li>
                            <li>The sender of the message must consider the age and marital status of the audience when planning the venue. This is because married people may not feel free to discuss certain issues in the presence of single people. Intergenerational communication is not easy so, in planning the message, the age differences must be borne in mind.</li>
                            <li>The sender does not consider cultural beliefs of the audience. For example, if you are giving a health message to some communities, where men and women do not mix easily, make an effort to address each group separately.</li>
                            <li>The message is not action-oriented. The message must tell individuals and community members what they should do in order to improve their health status.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Barriers Affecting the Communication Channel</h5>
                        <p>Communication channels are the means by which a message travels from the source to the receiver.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In verbal communication the sender may speak in such a low voice that the receiver cannot hear well. A good example is when one talks to a large crowd in a low voice without an amplifier. The crowd may not be able to follow the message.</li>
                            <li>When the channel selected to transmit the message is through the mass media like the radio, television, or the print media such as newspapers, films, and magazines without considering the socio-economic status of the receiver. Many in the audience may not have the means to access the media used.</li>
                            <li>If you select a verbal communication channel without considering the age of the receiver, the message content, language and delivery might lead to breakdown with youth or older persons if their special needs are not addressed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Effective communication is often facilitated by using more than one channel. In other words, you might need to use two or more channels to achieve effective communication. For example a nurse might use a poster to show the various family planning methods and their spoken voice to explain how each method works, and for whom it is best suited. The nurse may even have a video of satisfied family planning users talking about their experiences. You can see that, used in this way, more than one channel can ensure that the message is successfully delivered.</p>

                        <h5>Barriers Affecting the Impact/Effects of Communication</h5>
                        <p>Effects are the outcomes resulting from the communication of a message. These outcomes could be new knowledge, change in attitudes, or change in behaviour. Getting the desired effects depends upon the successful communication of the message. A communication breakdown can occur as a result of problems in managing any or all of the components of the communication process. This is particularly important for a nurse in practice because a breakdown in communication can lead to serious consequences including loss of life.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the sender of the message fails to use the appropriate language and to prepare the audience on the importance of the message for the improvement of their health status.</li>
                            <li>The receiver of the message may be emotionally disturbed and, therefore, does not understand the message as intended. Failure to acquire knowledge will not influence the audience to change their attitudes and behaviours.</li>
                            <li>The sender of the message may fail to involve the receiver (audience) in the planning phase and, therefore, disregards the cultural beliefs of the community. For example, a male midwife sharing a health message with a group of women who believe only female midwives should conduct deliveries according to their customs. The message may not produce the intended effects because the wrong communication channel was used leading to a breakdown in communication.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Barriers Affecting Feedback</h5>
                        <p>Feedback is another component of the communication process which can cause a breakdown in communication. Feedback is used to determine if the intended message is understood by the receiver (or audience). A breakdown in communication occurs when the sender receives a negative response indicating that the message is not understood.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>The Importance of Effective Communication</h4>
                        <p>The importance of effective communication in a health facility cannot be overstated. Doctors and nurses collaborate with each other to ensure the patients get the care they deserve. No single medical personnel can provide effective quality care without involving the others. Nurses communicate with other medical personnel such as physiotherapists, laboratory technologists, pharmacists, nutritionists and so on every day during the course of their work. All cadres of medical personnel play different roles but share the same goal of providing quality care to their patients. In your practice you will have consulted with your colleagues before making important decisions concerning the care of your patients. Effective communication in a health facility is important because it highlights the role each professional is playing towards the care of the patients. It is through communication that the managers are able to harmonise the care of the patients.</p>
                        <h5>Forms of Communication</h5>
                        <p>Communication in a health facility may occur in four forms, namely:</p>
                        <h6>Intrapersonal Communication</h6>
                        <p>Intrapersonal communication occurs when you communicate to yourself without verbalising. It is an imaginary conversation reflecting the individual's thoughts and feelings. Intrapersonal communication helps you to think critically about important issues before solving a problem. For example, when planning patient care, you think about the problems and the correct action to alleviate the problem. Intrapersonal communication is important before planning a health message to share with a group of people/patients. It is, therefore, an important part of planning the message. Its importance, however, lies in how successfully it is translated into action.</p>
                        <h6>Interpersonal Communication</h6>
                        <p>Interpersonal communication is face-to-face communication between two or more persons. This kind of communication may occur between nurses and their patients or other medical professionals. Interpersonal communication is very effective and you should be able to share health messages with the community/patients in order to change their attitudes and behaviours. For example, you can use this type of communication to persuade the patients to abandon a harmful cultural practice such as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).</p>
                        <p>The advantage of interpersonal communication is that the audience can ask questions on unclear issues for clarification. They can also give their own views on the matter under discussion.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Components in Interpersonal Communication</h6>
                        <p>There are three primary sources of the message in any interpersonal communication. One study in communication determined the percentage that each component contributed to the message being conveyed.</p>
                        <div class="table-container">
                            <table class="content-table">
                                <thead>
                                    <tr>

                                <tbody>
                                    <tr>

                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Voice tone and inflection</td>
                                        <td>55%</td>
                                    </tr>
                                </tbody>
                            </table>
                        </div>
                        <p>From this breakdown you can see just how important it is to be aware of your body language and the tone of your voice when communicating. Only 7% of the message is conveyed by the words you are using, 93% is conveyed by things most people are not conscious of.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Mass Communication</h6>
                        <p>Mass communication is a form of communication that is used to reach many people at the same time through the media of mass circulation or coverage, for example, television, radio and newspapers. The mass media's contact with medical staff tends to coincide with major events such as vaccination campaigns, natural disasters or disease outbreaks. There have been times when health personnel have been recalled to duty using the mass media because of an emergency. Emergencies warranting communication through the mass media include times of war, disaster or disease outbreaks.</p>
                        <h6>Organisational Communication</h6>
                        <p>Organisational communication occurs between the management and the employees. This form of communication is necessary in order to achieve the desired goals of the organisation. It may occur between the managers, supervisors and all employees. The communication may occur vertically from the top management to all employees in the organisation or vertically when supervisors consult one another. Organisational communication also occurs between organisations with common interest. Organisational communication is important because it explains the behaviours or conduct expected of the employees, for example, through circulars and documents. Organisational communication harmonises all activities performed by different technical and nontechnical personnel in the institution. It also regularises the activities of the public and private institutions sharing common interests in the same locality for example public hospitals and non-governmental organisations.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Written Communication</h5>
                        <p>You have now learnt the forms of communication which occur in a health facility. You shall now explore in detail two forms of written communications that are used in the health profession, namely, reports, and letters. First you will look at how to write a report in a health facility.</p>
                        <h6>Presentation of Reports</h6>
                        <p>Writing reports is nothing new to you, you have probably written several reports during your career to date. As a nurse in practice you may have presented a report to your colleagues or superiors. If you are working in a health centre or a dispensary you might have presented a report to the District Public Health Nurse or to the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) in charge of the district.</p>
                        <p>Nursing reports are written in the cardex and they cover a shift of 24 hours. Reports are presented to all nurses reporting in each shift. The number of shifts differ from hospital to hospital but three main shifts are the most common. The three shifts cover morning, afternoon and night duty. In each of these shifts, nurses write a report about the condition of the patients and any special investigation done. The report is important for continuation of care. The afternoon shift nurses write another report detailing the very sick patients in the ward and forward them to the matron on night duty. If you are working in a health centre/dispensary, you write a report on monthly basis for presentation to the District Public Health Nurse.</p>
                        <p>The aim of writing a report is to inform the authorities or other members of staff about what is happening in a unit or institution. A day shift report is given to inform the nurse taking over the shift of all the important activities or events which occurred in their absence. The report is required for effective continuity of patient care. A health centre or dispensary writes monthly and quarterly reports to inform the MOH and District Public Health Nurse of what has happened in the health facility over the last quarter or month.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Principles of Writing a Good Report</h6>
                        <p>When writing a report, always keep in mind the following standards:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Know the reason why you are writing a report</li>
                            <li>Know the subject matter you are writing about. The content should be factual</li>
                            <li>Omit your opinions from sections concerned with facts</li>
                            <li>Keep the report accurate, relevant and concise</li>
                            <li>Organise your points in a logical manner. All the related ideas should follow each other</li>
                            <li>The main ideas or key points in the report should be highlighted</li>
                            <li>When writing a report always start with the most pressing problem which needs immediate action</li>
                            <li>Use a language suitable to the reader. Write in a simple and clear language that the reader will understand</li>
                            <li>Use clear headings for each section of the report. A new paragraph should be started for unrelated ideas</li>
                            <li>Use your judgement and experience when suggesting actions or making recommendations to the reader/authority</li>
                            <li>The report should always emphasise ideas or facts which provide solutions to the problems</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 id="report-writing-heading">Report Styles</h5>
                        <p>The hospital authorities or the Ministry of Health should give you guidelines on the format to be followed when writing a report. The style of writing the report should be logical and acceptable to the reader. The following information will help you to write a good report:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Give information related to the main activities/events which have taken place since last year's report.</li>
                            <li>Indicate the problems you have experienced and how you dealt with them.</li>
                            <li>Give recommendations or suggestions on what the authority should do.</li>
                            <li>Indicate the decisions you want the authority/MOH to rectify and emphasise ideas which help the reader to come up with solutions to the problems.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A Health Centre Report consists of four main sections.</p>

                        <h6>Writing a Negative Incidence/Accident Report</h6>
                        <p>A Negative Incidence Report is a formal statement on any unusual event occurring in a nursing unit/ward with a risk of possible legal action. A legal action may be taken against the hospital by the patient or relatives for negligence or malpractice. The patient may claim a colossal amount of money in damages for injuries sustained, including developing bedsores. The purpose of a Negative Incidence Report is to inform the employer of the unusual incident which has occurred. The report is important as it will serve as evidence in case a law suit is launched by the patient.</p>
                        <p><strong>Incidents Requiring a Negative Incidence/Accident Report:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A patient committing suicide in the ward</li>
                            <li>A child absconding from the ward</li>
                            <li>A patient falling from the bed and sustaining injuries</li>
                            <li>A patient sustaining burns in the ward</li>
                            <li>A patient being given wrong medication</li>
                            <li>A nurse fighting with a mentally ill patient</li>
                            <li>Wrong identification of a patient leading to wrong treatment or surgical intervention</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Principles for Writing a Negative Incident Statement:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The hospital accident reporting form should be completed in triplicate. One copy goes to the hospital authorities, the second copy is retained in the ward and the third copy is kept in the patient's file.</li>
                            <li>The statement should be concise, brief, clear, unambiguous and non-emotional.</li>
                            <li>It is a factual report. Write only the facts without exaggeration.</li>
                            <li>Write the events that occurred at the time of the accident.</li>
                            <li>Quantify the observable damage. For example, if it is a burn, indicate the extent in centimetres.</li>
                            <li>The writing should be legible, avoiding use of medical terms and abbreviations.</li>
                            <li>State only the truth of exactly what you saw with your own eyes.</li>
                            <li>Write down the names of all the witnesses who saw the accident happening including staff on duty.</li>
                            <li>Give an accurate date and time when the accident occurred.</li>
                            <li>Describe the immediate action which you took after the accident occurred.</li>
                            <li>The statement should include the name of the patient in full, diagnosis, inpatient number and the bed number.</li>
                            <li>When you have completed writing the statement, write your name in full, designation, and signature.</li>

                        <h6>Writing Appraisal Reports</h6>
                        <p>The staff appraisal reports are written by the immediate supervisors in a ward or unit. Appraisal reports are written annually for each employee. The report gives a summary of an employee's performance and abilities for that period based on their job description.</p>
                        <p>The supervisor writing an appraisal report should be very objective and accurate. The information written on the report should reflect the actual behaviour of the employees without any bias. The report should be written in a balanced manner, giving the strengths and weaknesses of the appraised.</p>
                        <p><strong>Contents of an Appraisal Report:</strong></p>
                        <ul>

                        <h5 id="letter-writing-heading">Writing an Official Letter</h5>
                        <p>Writing official letters is a rare activity for many employees in an organisation, letters are sometimes written when it is necessary to inform the employer about important occurrences. Letters are also written to request transfers to another station, to apply for study leave, or to request promotion. Whatever the reason for writing a letter, the structure of an official letter is the same.</p>
                        <p><strong>Our Reference / Your Reference:</strong> 'Our Reference' is always followed by a number. It links the letter to another communication in organisation and sometimes to a file number. 'Your Reference' is usually the reference quoted in the letter to which you are replying.</p>
                        <p><strong>Date:</strong> All letters should have a date. The month should be written in full without abbreviations, for example, 4th December 2001.</p>
                        <p><strong>Receiver's Name and Address:</strong> 'Mr' is the title commonly used for men. 'Ms' is used for women instead of 'Miss/Mrs'. 'Miss' or 'Mrs' should be used only if you know the marital status of the individual. The address should be written in full.</p>
                        <p><strong>FAO:</strong> Short for 'For the Attention Of'. The attention indicator refers to the officer/person taking action on the letter.</p>
                        <p><strong>Salutation:</strong> This is the opening greeting of a letter. 'Dear Sir:' is used when writing a letter to an organisation. 'Dear Sir or Madam:' is appropriate if you know the sex of the person. 'Dear Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms' are used to begin letters to people whom you have met or written before.</p>
                        <p><strong>Body of the letter:</strong> The body of a letter consists of a subject heading, an introduction, a second part which gives information and states the facts, and a final paragraph suggesting the action the reader should take.</p>
                        <p><strong>Subscription or Complementary Close:</strong> This is the formal conclusion. Letters beginning 'Dear Sir' or 'Dear Madam' should end with 'Yours faithfully'. Letters beginning 'Dear Mr/Mrs/Ms' should end with 'Yours sincerely'.</p>
                        <p><strong>Writer's Name and Signature:</strong> When a letter is typed, a space is left after the close of the letter for the writer to sign their name. The writer's name should appear in full, below the signature.</p>
                        <p><strong>Enclosures:</strong> Abbreviated as 'Enc.' is typed beneath the signature at the foot of the page.</p>
                        <p><strong>PS:</strong> This stands for 'Post Scriptum'. This is used when adding something which has been left out from the body of the letter.</p>
                        <h6>Layout of the Letter</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The sender's address appears at the right hand side of the page.</li>
                            <li>Each paragraph should be indented and begin about 1.5 cm from the left hand margin. If paragraphs are not indented, then double spacing should be left between paragraphs.</li>
                            <li>The complementary close and the name typed beneath it should be at the centre at the foot of the page.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Principles of Letter Writing</h6>
                        <p>There are three basic principles: courtesy, clarity and conciseness.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Courtesy:</strong> Write in a friendly manner avoiding words that may sound harsh or rude.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Always use simple language and explain in full any complex ideas you wish to convey.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conciseness:</strong> A short message is easily understood by the reader.</li>

                        <p>In this section you will explore aspects of psychology that will be useful in counselling.</p>
                        <p><strong>Psychology may be defined as:</strong> "The scientific study of behaviour and mental processes."</p>
                        <p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines psychology as: "The study of the mind and how it functions."</p>

                        <h4>Human Growth and Development</h4>
                        <p><strong>Growth</strong> is the progressive development of a living thing, especially the process by which the body reaches the complete physical development. It is also the process by which humans increase in size and develop their mature form and function.</p>
                        <p><strong>Development</strong> is the process of growth and differentiation.</p>
                        <p>Studying human growth and development provides practical guidance for you as a healthcare provider and others who deal with people so as to support healthy growth. This knowledge will help you understand and better assist individuals with special needs, such as those with emotional difficulties.</p>
                        <p>There are several theories that attempt to explain human growth and development, the four primary theories being: Psychoanalytic theory, Learning, Cognitive, and Social cultural.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Psychoanalytic Theory</h4>
                        <p>At the end of the 19th century, Austrian physician Sigmund Freud developed the theory and techniques of psychoanalysis. Most psychoanalytic theories portray development as a series of stages through which all children proceed. According to Freud, child development consists of five psychosexual stages in which a particular body region is the focus of sensual satisfactions; the focus of pleasure shifts as children progress through the stages.</p>

                        <p>An American psychoanalyst, Erik Erikson, proposed a related series of psychosocial stages of personality growth that more strongly emphasise social influences within the family. Erikson's eight stages span the entire life course, and each involves a conflict in the social world with two possible outcomes. In infancy, for example, the conflict is 'trust versus mistrust'. In adolescence, 'identity versus role confusion' defines the teenager's search for self-understanding.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Freud further developed a structure of personality he described three components of personality. Personality usually refers to that which is unique about a person, the characteristics that distinguish them from other people. these are Id, Ego, and Super Ego.</p>
                        <h5>The Id</h5>
                        <p>In psychoanalytic theory, Id is one of the three basic elements of personality; it can be equated with the unconscious of common usage, which is the reservoir of the instinctual drives of the individual, including biological urges, wishes, and affective motives. The Id is dominated by the pleasure principle, through which the individual is pressed for immediate gratification of his or her desires.</p>
                        <h5>The Ego</h5>
                        <p>Ego in psychoanalysis is a term denoting the central part of the personality structure that deals with reality and is influenced by social forces. The Ego learns to modify behaviour by controlling those impulses that are socially unacceptable. Its role is that of mediator between unconscious impulses and acquired social and personal standards.</p>
                        <h5>The Super Ego</h5>
                        <p>The Super Ego designates the element of the mind that automatically modifies and inhibits those instinctual impulses or drives of the Id that tend to produce antisocial actions and thoughts. According to psychoanalytic theory, the Super Ego develops as the child gradually and unconsciously adopts the values and standards, first of his or her parents, and later of the social environment.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>States of Mind</h4>
                        <p>During your nursing practice there are several states of mind that will require your intervention, the most common are: Anxiety, Defence mechanisms, and Stress.</p>
                        <h5>Anxiety</h5>
                        <p>Anxiety is a state of tension that motivates a person to do something, it is an emotional state in which people feel uneasy, apprehensive, or fearful. People usually experience anxiety about events they cannot control or predict, or about events that seem threatening or dangerous.</p>
                        <p><strong>Anxiety Symptoms:</strong> Symptoms of anxiety may include: Fidgeting, Muscle tension, Sleeping problem, Headaches. Higher levels of anxiety may produce such symptoms as: Rapid heartbeat, Sweating, Increased blood pressure, Nausea, and dizziness.</p>
                        <p>All people experience anxiety to some degree. However, too little anxiety or too much anxiety can cause problems. Individuals who experience an abnormally high amount of anxiety often feel overwhelmed, immobilised, and unable to accomplish the task at hand.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Ego Defence Mechanisms</h5>
                        <p>To defend itself against unacceptable impulses, the ego develops specific psychic means, known as defence mechanisms.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Repression:</strong> The exclusion of impulses from conscious awareness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Projection:</strong> The process of ascribing to others one's own unacknowledged desires.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reaction Formation:</strong> The establishment of a pattern of behaviour directly opposed to a strong unconscious need.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> The process of masking weaknesses or developing certain positive traits to make up for limitations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sublimation:</strong> This involves diverting sexual energy to some other socially acceptable and sometimes admiral activities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These and other defence mechanisms are put into operation whenever anxiety signals a danger that the original unacceptable impulses may re-emerge.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Stress</h5>
                        <p>Stress is an unpleasant state of emotional and physiological arousal that people experience in situations that they perceive as dangerous or threatening to their well-being. However, most psychologists regard stress as a process involving a person's interpretation and response to a threatening event.</p>
                        <p>Stress can have both positive and negative effects. Stress is a normal, adaptive reaction to threat. It signals danger and prepares us to take defensive action. If not managed appropriately, stress can lead to serious problems. Exposure to chronic stress can contribute to both physical illnesses, such as heart disease, and mental illnesses, such as anxiety disorders.</p>
                        <h6>Sources of Stress</h6>
                        <p>The circumstances that cause stress are called stressors. Stressors can be classified into three general categories: catastrophic events, major life changes, and daily hassles.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Catastrophes:</strong> A catastrophe is a sudden, often life-threatening calamity or disaster that pushes people to the outer limits of their coping capability. Catastrophes include natural disasters as well as wars, torture, automobile accidents, and violent physical attacks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Major Life Changes:</strong> The most stressful events for adults involve major life changes, such as death of a spouse or family member, divorce, imprisonment, losing one's job, and major personal disability or illness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Daily Hassles:</strong> Having to deal with daily hassles in our jobs, personal relationships, and everyday living circumstances cause considerable stress. Examples include living in a noisy neighbourhood, commuting in heavy traffic, and worrying about money.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>The Stress Response</h6>
                        <p>When experiencing stress, the body undergoes a number of changes that heighten physiological and emotional arousal. First, the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is activated. This prepares the body for action by directing the adrenal glands to secrete the hormones epinephrine (adrenaline) and nor epinephrine (nor adrenaline). In response, the heart begins to beat more rapidly, muscle tension increases, blood pressure rises, and blood flow is diverted from the internal organs and skin to the brain and muscles. This reaction is sometimes called the fight-or-flight response.</p>
                        <p>Another part of the stress response involves the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. During stress, the hypothalamus directs the pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone. This stimulates the cortex of the adrenal glands to release glucocorticoids, primarily the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol helps the body access fats and carbohydrates to fuel the fight-or-flight response.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Coping With Stress</h6>
                        <p>Coping with stress means using thoughts and actions to deal with stressful situations and lower our stress levels. Many people have a characteristic way of coping with stress based on their personality.</p>
                        <p><strong>Coping Strategies:</strong> Psychologists distinguish two broad types of coping strategies: problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping. In problem-focused coping, people try to take some action to modify, avoid, or minimise the threatening situation. In emotion-focused coping, people try to directly moderate or eliminate unpleasant emotions through methods like rethinking the situation, relaxation, or denial.</p>
                        <p><strong>Social Support:</strong> Support from friends, family members, and others who care for us goes a long way in helping us to get by in times of trouble. Social support systems provide us with emotional sustenance, tangible resources, aid, and information when we are in need. A large body of research has linked social support to good health and a superior ability to cope with stress.</p>
                        <p><strong>Relaxation:</strong> Two major methods of relaxation are progressive muscular relaxation and meditation. Both methods reliably reduce stress-related arousal and have been used successfully to treat a range of stress-related disorders.</p>
                        <p><strong>Progressive Muscular Relaxation:</strong> This involves systematically tensing and then relaxing different groups of skeletal (voluntary) muscles, while directing one's attention toward the contrasting sensations produced.</p>
                        <p><strong>Meditation:</strong> One of the most common forms of meditation, Transcendental Meditation, involves focusing attention on and repeating a mantra, which is a word, sound, or phrase thought to have particularly calming properties.</p>
                        <p><strong>Aerobic Exercise:</strong> Aerobic exercise - such as running, walking, biking, and skiing - can help keep stress levels down. Because aerobic exercise increases the endurance of the heart and lungs, an aerobically fit individual will have a lower heart rate at rest and lower blood pressure, less reactivity to stressors, and quicker recovery from stressors.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Counselling is one of the most important tasks of a nurse. In fact, you are always counselling without necessarily being aware of the process. You counsel your patients, children, relatives, and even colleagues. By the time you complete this section, you should be a better counsellor who will offer help, information, support and hope to your patients as you deal with them.</p>
                        <p>Counselling is the act of working with a patient to help them clarify personal goals and find ways of overcoming their problems with the aim of assisting the individual change behaviours that are interfering with attainment of basic needs.</p>

                        <h4>Types of Counselling</h4>
                        <p>Different patients come for counselling with various problems. The type of counselling is, therefore, determined by the nature of problems presented by the patients.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Individual Counselling:</strong> Occurs when a counsellor is working with only one person at any given time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Group Counselling:</strong> This occurs when a counsellor is working with more than one person at any given session. Recommended for people facing the same problem, for example, alcoholics.</li>
                            <li><strong>Marital Counselling:</strong> This occurs when the counsellor is working with married couples.</li>
                            <li><strong>Family Counselling:</strong> This occurs when a counsellor is working with more than two members of a family at any given session.</li>
                            <li><strong>Special Group Counselling:</strong> The special group is composed of any group of people who require counselling to enable them to adjust better in their life, for example: Drug abusers, Rape victims, HIV/AIDS patients, Terminally ill people, etc.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Honesty:</strong> Honesty refers to the act of telling the truth to the patient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Empathy is the ability to imagine oneself in the position of another person, and thus, share and understand that person`s feelings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Observance:</strong> A good counsellor must be very observant. Observe their facial expressions and try to interpret the meaning of any nonverbal communication.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accepting:</strong> Being accepting means the patient is accepted the way they are. The counsellor recognises the basic rights of the patient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Avoiding Embarrassment:</strong> You can avoid embarassing your patient by holding the counselling session in a private room and understanding their cultural background.</li>
                            <li><strong>Relevant Discussion:</strong> Relevant discussion means that the counselling session is confined to the topic.</li>
                            <li><strong>Respect Opinion:</strong> This means the counsellor accepts the patient as a human being with their own rights to make decisions.</li>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>This section covers barriers to effective counselling, the rights of a patient, and some of the ethical issues encountered in counselling. Many of the factors that cause breakdown in everyday communication also present barriers to counselling. These can include physical barriers, differences in socio-cultural backgrounds, nonverbal communications, language barriers and the relationship between patient and counsellor.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of the section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe different types of barriers to effective counselling</li>

                        <h4>Types of Barriers</h4>
                        <p>Barriers to effective counselling interfere with the counselling process by making the patient unable to make informed decisions or disclose their feelings and concerns fully.</p>
                        <h5>Physical Barriers</h5>
                        <p><strong>Interview Room:</strong> The interview should be conducted in a quiet, private room. The room should be spacious, clean, well-ventilated, and free from distractions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> If you do not look presentable and pleasant, the patient may have a problem listening to you and taking you seriously.</p>
                        <p><strong>Age and Sex:</strong> A difference in age between the counsellor and the patient may affect the outcome. Similarly, it is advisable for counsellors to be the same gender as the patient, especially in youth counselling.</p>
                        <h5>Differences in Social and Cultural Backgrounds</h5>
                        <p>When a patient comes from a different nationality, race or ethnic group, it may be difficult for you to understand the patient's beliefs, taboos and cultural practices. The patient may not be able to take your advice because perhaps the information you give them does not tally with their beliefs.</p>
                        <h5>Non-Verbal Communication</h5>
                        <p>This involves all the little things you do while you talk to a patient. The gestures you make could make the counselling session a success or failure. Some gestures that could make you fail include: Frowning, Showing signs of boredom or amusement, Showing signs of disgust, Displaying signs of disapproval towards the patient.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Barriers Caused by the Patient and Counsellor</h5>
                        <p>Barriers caused by the patient can include lack of interest and the patient's emotions. If you feel that the patient is so emotionally disturbed that they will not benefit from the session, you can postpone it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Counsellor and Patient related Communication Barriers:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Failure to listen:</strong> Occurs when the counsellor feels that they are not receiving the intended message.</li>
                            <li><strong>Failure to probe:</strong> Occurs when the counsellor does not get adequate responses from the patient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Being judgemental:</strong> The counsellor may approve or disapprove the statements from the patient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rejection:</strong> Occurs when the counsellor refuses to discuss some topics with the patients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Defending:</strong> An attempt to protect something or someone from negative feedback.</li>
                            <li><strong>Giving advice:</strong> The counsellor telling the patient what he thinks should be done.</li>
                            <li><strong>Privacy disruption:</strong> Occurs if counselling sessions are held in a room where privacy is not observed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Changing topics:</strong> The counsellor directing the interaction into areas of self-interest rather than following the lead of the patient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Failure to understand the culture:</strong> May lead to the patient feeling that the counsellor has no respect.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Rights of a Patient</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Respect and Freedom from Prejudice:</strong> The patient is a human being with their own rights to be respected.</li>
                            <li><strong>Privacy and Confidentiality:</strong> Counselling sessions should be conducted in a private room. The patient trusts that any information discussed is confidential.</li>
                            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> The patient should give consent on all decisions made during the sessions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Right of Refusal:</strong> The patient has the right to refuse any counselling services offered by an incompetent counsellor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Involvement:</strong> The patient should be informed about plans of action to be carried out for their own benefit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Informed:</strong> The patient should be informed about their own health status.</li>
                            <li><strong>Right of Referral:</strong> The counsellor should refer the patient if not able to meet their needs.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Ethical Issues in Counselling</h5>
                        <p>The primary role of a counsellor is to serve their patient's interests at all times. The counsellor has a responsibility to the patient in areas of confidentiality, competence, maintenance of ethical standards and possibly referrals when the need arises.</p>
                        <h6>Code of Practice</h6>
                        <p>The counsellor should observe the code of ethics at all times. The counsellor has a responsibility to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the patient does not suffer any physical or psychological harm. The counsellor's approach should make the patient feel accepted. The counsellor is responsible for setting and monitoring the boundaries between counselling and any other relationships with the patient. The counsellor should not exploit their patients financially, sexually, emotionally, or in any other way.</p>
                        <h6>Terms of Counselling</h6>
                        <p>Counsellors are responsible for communicating the terms on which counselling is offered. The terms should be explained in the initial contact and include: availability, fees, number of sessions, and the patient's choice to participate. Records should be kept, and the patient made aware.</p>
                        <h6>Counsellor Competence</h6>
                        <p>Competence is an essential element in counselling. The counsellor should work within their known limits and refer any patient they are unable to help. The counsellor should be honest and tell the truth. Counsellors remain accountable for relationships with former patients.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>In this section you will explore four common theoretical approaches to counselling.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>

                        <h4>Freud's Psychoanalytic Approach to Counselling</h4>
                        <p>The psychoanalytic theory in counselling is based on Freud's theory of the human mind. In this theory, Freud divided the human mind to three components: the unconscious (Id), the preconscious (Ego or Self) and the conscious (Super Ego). The Id component always seeks gratification. The Ego component mediates between the Id and the Super Ego. The Super Ego represents the reality of the external world.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-415-1.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating Freud's model of the mind, showing the relationship between the Id (unconscious), Ego (preconscious), and Super Ego (conscious)." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Howard (1996) made some assumptions derived from Freud's psychoanalytic theory which he identified as useful basic insights the counsellor may consider:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Human beings are not always conscious of what they are doing.</li>
                            <li>Even if we do notice what we are doing, we do not always know why.</li>
                            <li>Awareness and self-awareness may be painful and uncomfortable.</li>
                            <li>If our avoidance is successful, we have to evade our evasiveness.</li>
                            <li>In so far as we find it painful to come to terms with ourselves, we remain defensive, vulnerable and liable to manipulation.</li>
                            <li>Our guilt and shame keep facets of our personality buried.</li>
                            <li>We all carry unfinished business from the past.</li>
                            <li>That which we repress is liable to threaten and haunt us.</li>
                            <li>Much that we avoid should be manageable if we have the courage and faith to face it.</li>
                            <li>Our ability to change and be free from the past is nonetheless limited.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>The Person-centred Approach</h4>
                        <p>The Person-centred theory is based on Maslow's theory of self-actualisation. The counsellor using this approach assumes that 'self-actualisation' motivates human beings to exploit their capabilities or potentialities. It is assumed that people have the capability to guide, regulate and control themselves provided that certain definable conditions exist.</p>
                        <h5>Assumptions of Self-Concept</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A person's self-concept is the way an individual perceives the self.</li>
                            <li>Self-perceptions enable the individual to understand how psychological maladjustment is maintained.</li>
                            <li>Self-concept is viewed as a structure made of a variety of self-conceptions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Congruence/Incongruence:</strong> Many self-conceptions may match the reality of what people experience (congruence), or may differ (incongruence).</li>
                            <li><strong>Condition of worth or incongruence:</strong> A self-conception is based on a condition of worth rather than the individual's own valuing process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Real-ideal:</strong> Real self-conceptions represent perceptions of how I am, ideal-self conceptions represent how I would most like to be.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The role of the counsellor is to provide the necessary conducive climate (environment) characterised by the core conditions to enable the patients solve their own problem. There are three core conditions, namely: Unconditional positive regard, Respect, and Empathy.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Behavioural Theory</h4>
                        <p>The Behavioural theory of counselling is also known as 'Behaviour Therapy'. This theory is based on the principles of learning to assess the behaviour of the patients. In the behaviouristic view you are born as 'blank slate' and so everything you are as an individual you have learned from other people or from your life experiences. Learning does not change you completely, so behaviour learned can be unlearned. This theory deals with behaviour in the here and now.</p>
                        <h5>Objectives of Behavioural Therapy</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Alter the maladaptive behaviour</li>
                            <li>Optimising the decision making process</li>
                            <li>Preventing problems from occurring</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Counsellors using the behavioural approach should set realistic goals, such as overcoming deficits in behaviour, strengthening or weakening maladaptive behaviour, and encouraging self-control and social skills.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>The Eclectic Approach</h4>
                        <p>Arnold Lazarous, a clinical psychologist developed this approach. The eclectic approach (or multimodal approach) is based on the belief that there is no single psychological theory, which can effectively be used in counselling all patients. The Multimodal approach borrows concepts and techniques from different schools of thought depending on the individual patient's unique psychological problems and circumstances. The eclectic theory describes human personality as consisting of seven modalities remembered by the acronym 'BASIC ID'.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Behaviour:</strong> Action-oriented, 'doers'.</li>
                            <li><strong>Affect:</strong> Emotional, may or may not express it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sensation:</strong> Value sensory experiences like sex, food, music.</li>
                            <li><strong>Imagery:</strong> Thinking in pictures, visualising.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cognition:</strong> Analytical, like to plan and reason.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interpersonal:</strong> Self-rating as a social person.</li>
                            <li><strong>Drugs/biology:</strong> Conscious of personal health and habits.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The counselling relationship using the multimodal approach focuses on working closely with the patient and providing the therapeutic support required to correct or alleviate the maladaptive behaviour. The counsellor modifies their approach depending on information obtained using the modalities of BASIC I.D.</p>

                        <h4>Counselling HIV/AIDS Patients</h4>
                        <p>When you counsel HIV/AIDS patients, you go through all three stages of counselling, trying to adapt to the individual needs of the patient. The counselling process uses the acronym GATHER:</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-419-1.jpg" alt="The GATHER acronym for the counselling process: Greet, Ask, Tell, Help, Explain, Return." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Reasons Why Pre HIV/AIDS Test Counselling is Necessary:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To provide accurate information about HIV/AIDS</li>
                            <li>To assist the patient to understand the implications of a positive or negative result</li>
                            <li>To assess the patient's ability to cope with a positive result</li>
                            <li>To make the patient have an informed decision</li>
                            <li>To help the patient manage fear and anxiety</li>
                            <li>To help the patient to consider positive changes in behaviour</li>
                            <li>To establish a relationship of trust for post-test counselling</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Information an HIV/AIDS Patient should Know before Testing:</strong> Inform the patient that a person may be infected but asymptomatic, how the virus is spread, that it affects the immune system, and that it is fatal. Explain the testing process.</p>
                        <p><strong>Information an HIV/AIDS Patient Should Know After Testing Positive:</strong> Discuss sexual behaviour necessary to prevent spread (abstinence, fidelity, condoms). Inform about complications and opportunistic infections. Help the patient accept their status and discuss family support. Explain management with antiretroviral drugs, diet, and hygiene. Encourage joining support groups. Discuss follow-up visits.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Preparing HIV/AIDS Patients for Death</h4>
                        <p>The terminally ill HIV/AIDS patients finally realise death is imminent. Sharing thoughts of death and dying with a counsellor may help the patient to accept and face death courageously in a dignified manner. The individual should be made to understand that death is a normal process.</p>
                        <p><strong>Useful areas for discussion with terminally ill patients:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What the patient feels about dying</li>

                        <h4>Counselling a Rape Victim</h4>
                        <p><strong>Initial Stage:</strong> Rape victims are usually bitter, frightened, worried, and emotional. You will need to apply all your counselling skills with care. Listen attentively and encourage them to express their feelings to relieve anger and anxiety.</p>
                        <p><strong>Emotional Reactions Arising From Rape:</strong> Shame, pain, fear of pregnancy or STIs/HIV, self-hatred, and fear of parents' reaction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Emotional Behaviours Displayed by Rape Victims:</strong> Physical restlessness, rubbing head/thighs, wiping tears, and expressions of anger, despair, or sadness.</p>
                        <p>Once calm, ask the patient what help they need. Discuss reporting to the police and consulting a doctor for medical examination. A medical examination report is necessary as evidence. The examination includes checking for injuries, collecting evidence (blood, seminal fluid), and testing for STIs. The patient should be referred to VCT for HIV status and prophylactic ARV if negative. A therapeutic D&C may be an option. Reassure the patient about the treatability of STIs and the safety of procedures.</p>

                        <h4>Counselling a Patient with Disabilities/Chronic Illness</h4>
                        <p>A disability is a handicap which prevents an individual to use their body or mind optimally. A chronic illness is a disease of long duration involving slow changes.</p>
                        <h5>Principles of Counselling People with Disabilities/Chronic Illnesses</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Treat the patient as a human being.</strong> Your language should not display any form of blame or create feelings of guilt.</li>
                            <li><strong>Consider the Social Impact of the disability.</strong> A disability affects the whole family. Family counselling is important.</li>
                            <li><strong>Consider the Practical and Emotional impact.</strong> The meaning of disability is as important as the disability itself. The aim of counselling is to examine and try to change the meaning of the condition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Confront the Reality of the Condition.</strong> Getting patients to confront the reality of their condition is an essential part of counselling.</li>
