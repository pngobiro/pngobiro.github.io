                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>As you prepare to study these conditions in depth, you should bear in mind that the management of sick children extends beyond the hospital ward boundaries into the home, community and school. Nursing of children should not be carried out in isolation. Their care must be related to their environment. Therefore, you must try to work in liaison with the child's parents, community members and other relevant professionals concerned in child care to achieve set objectives.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>

                        <h4>Acute Bronchitis (Tracheobronchitis)</h4>
                        <p>This is an acute inflammation of one or more bronchi in children, which affects those below the age of four years. The infection is more prevalent in the younger children than the older ones because the former group have low resistance. Although referred to as bronchitis, the trachea, which is anatomically and physiologically related to the bronchi cannot escape infection when the latter is involved.</p>
                        <p>The disease is always associated with the upper respiratory tract infections, caused by various types of micro-organisms such as the influenza virus, streptococci, and pneumococci. In some cases, it is associated with certain communicable or infectious diseases such as whooping cough, measles and typhoid fever, just to name a few.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-280-1.jpg" alt="Anatomical illustration of the respiratory tract, highlighting inflamed bronchi, characteristic of bronchitis." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Acute bronchitis may present itself as a mild or severe manifestation. It frequently attacks malnourished and debilitated children from overcrowded homes. Environmental air pollution, allergic conditions and climatic changes, especially cold months and housing may precipitate the condition. Some young children with congenital heart defects or fibrocystic disease of the pancreas also tend to develop acute bronchitis due to their low immunity.</p>
                        <h5>Clinical Features</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Generally weak and unwell</li>
                            <li>Their cheeks and skin may be flushed and their mouth may be dry</li>
                            <li>Have dyspnoea leading to restlessness and irritability</li>
                            <li>On checking the vital signs, the child will be pyrexial with temperature running between 39 and 40 degrees Celsius, in some cases even above these figures</li>
                            <li>The respiration, though increased, is usually shallow due to pleural pain</li>
                            <li>Older children normally complain of anterior chest pain, which may increase with frequent coughing at first</li>
                            <li>Later on, the cough may become productive and the patient will be exhausted as a result of the above symptoms</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>Unless the condition is severe, hospitalisation may not be necessary. The child can be treated and managed as an outpatient under the care of the parents. Should hospitalisation be required, the child should be admitted in a cubicle and barrier nursed. The environment should be kept warm, humidified and well ventilated until the medical personnel are sure the patient does not have any communicable disease. Bed rest should be maintained until their temperature returns to normal. Their vital signs of temperature, pulse and respiration are taken and recorded one to two hourly.</p>
                        <p>Mechanical methods of lowering the body temperature should be employed as found fit. These include electric fanning or reduction of extra bed clothing. The child can adopt any comfortable position they like. Oxygen administration is given when necessary via a ventimask for older children and a tent for younger ones. Oxygen should be humidified.</p>
                        <p>The use of a steam tent may be considered for some patients according to their needs. The patient's position in bed should be changed four hourly, paying particular attention to their pressure areas. General bodily care will be necessary to make them feel more comfortable. Bowel activities should also be monitored.</p>
                        <p>The child requires plenty of oral fluids or intravenous infusion to liquefy the respiratory secretion making it easier to expectorate. Suction may be used where the patient is unable to cough up the secretions. For oral drinks, warm milk or warm lemon and honey are enjoyable and very effective. A light but nourishing diet should be given to older children while the young may benefit from dilute milk feeds. A fluid balance chart should always be maintained until the child is able to feed normally, pyrexia settles and general condition much improved.</p>
                        <p>Antibiotics such as crystalline penicillin may be given every four to six hours in the first two to three days. This is often changed to other types such as ampicillin, cloxacillin or amoxycillin syrup, which should be given together with vitamin B to prevent thrush and/or diarrhoea, which tend to occur when these drugs are used. Antipyretics such as paracetamol are also prescribed and given to help lower the temperature. They can also control chest pain, which the patient may complain of.</p>
                        <h5>Complications</h5>
                        <p>These may develop if the child was brought to the hospital too late. Similarly, inadequate use of antibiotics may lead to complications occurring. The most common ones are chronic bronchitis and broncho pneumonia.</p>

                        <h4 id="ltb-pneumonia-heading">Laryngo Tracheo Bronchitis (LTB)</h4>
                        <p>This is a combined inflammatory disease process, which affects the larynx, trachea and bronchi simultaneously. Infections of the respiratory tract are generally not limited to one anatomical area in small children, but affect other areas as well because of their close proximity.</p>
                        <p>Acute infections of the larynx and trachea are more frequent in toddlers than in older children and are considered more serious because young children have relatively smaller airways, which become easily obstructed when the inflammation occurs. The inflammation of the larynx and trachea are collectively called croup syndrome, which involves acute epiglottitis, acute laryngitis, and acute laryngo-tracheo bronchitis.</p>
                        <h5>Pathophysiology</h5>
                        <p>In acute laryngo tracheo bronchitis, the onset is gradual. It occurs more frequently in the course of a viral upper respiratory tract illness. When it occurs, it may increase in severity within a 24 hour period. Maximum airway obstruction occurs below the vocal cords. As mentioned previously, young children have a smaller and shorter airway. Also, worth noting is that the smooth muscle in the lower respiratory tract still lacks cartilaginous support because this does not develop until adolescence. It follows, therefore, that when infected, there is constriction of the lower airway prompting an increased volume of respiratory secretions. These are the sources of obstruction, which eventually interfere with exchange of gases.</p>
                        <h5>Clinical Features</h5>
                        <p>The child may present with the following symptoms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A harsh voice, barking or brassy cough.</li>
                            <li>Inspiratory rate gradually increases but expiratory rate may sometimes increase as an alternative. This is referred to as stridor.</li>
                            <li>Pyrexial with a temperature of 39-40°C</li>
                            <li>Tachycardia is present as the infection spreads downwards to the bronchi and bronchioles moderate. There is persistent airway obstruction (rarely complete) with dyspnoea where the patient uses accessory muscles of respiration.</li>
                            <li>Cyanosis, restlessness and anxiety are always present.</li>
                            <li>The patient gradually looks pale.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Nursing Care</h5>
                        <p>The child with laryngo tracheo bronchitis should be hospitalised and placed in intensive nursing care in a separate room or cubicle. They should be barrier nursed and on bed rest until their condition improves.</p>
                        <p>The main objectives of care should be to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Promote rest during the acute stage</li>
                            <li>Maintain adequate airway for exchange of gases</li>
                            <li>Provide high humidity and oxygen in the environment where the patient is being nursed</li>
                            <li>Ensure adequate and appropriate fluids and nutrition</li>
                            <li>Provide support and health education to parents</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once the child has been admitted, care must be taken to ensure the cubicle or room is well ventilated, quiet and clean. Only a few visitors or carers should be allowed in the room. They should use all the facilities available for barrier nursing.</p>
                        <p>You, as the nurse, should constantly be vigilant of the patient's condition by taking and recording their vital signs with particular emphasis being laid on their respiratory pattern. This is necessary because, should the condition worsen, they may be unable to breathe properly and mechanical methods to sustain life will have to be used. These may either be tracheostomy or endotracheal intubation.</p>
                        <p>You should therefore, urgently report any complications to the doctor as soon as they occur. These complications may include actual or suspected epiglottitis, respiratory distress characterised by progressive stridor, restlessness, rapid pulse rate, hypoxia, cyanosis or pallor or hyperpyrexia in a child who appears toxic.</p>
                        <p>While the child remains ill, a naso-gastric tube is passed for feeding purposes while intravenous infusion remains in progress. The fluid balance chart should be maintained, paying special attention to urinary output. The child's vital signs of temperature, pulse and respiration are recorded two to four hourly. Humidified oxygen therapy is given, while respiratory suction is carried out as necessary.</p>
                        <p>The position is changed two hourly but try to allow the child to assume the position they are most comfortable with, provided the airway is clear. Treat pressure areas four hourly. General hygiene, including frequent oral toileting, should be maintained on a daily basis. As the condition improves, most gadgets are removed and patients are mobilised first in bed then gradually out of bed.</p>
                        <p>The child may be prescribed antibiotics, which may have to be administered by injection initially. These may include ampicillin or chloramphenicol. Other broad spectrum antibiotics may also be considered singly or in combination. Other drugs used are corticosteroids. The use of corticosteroids is beneficial because their anti inflammatory effects decrease subglottic oedema. The patient with this condition is distressed and to reduce this the family should be allowed and in fact encouraged to remain with the child as much as possible, especially if this reduces the distress.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Pneumonia</h4>
                        <p>This is an inflammation of the lung tissue. Although this commonly occurs in infants and young children, it may be diagnosed at any age. The infection can occur as a primary disease, a complication of other medical problems, or as a foreign substance entering the lungs. Causative organisms are commonly bacteria, for example, pneumococci, streptococci, taphylococci, and/or viral, for example, haemophilus influenzae. Whatever, the causative micro-organisms, the clinical features seem to be identical. Pneumonia can be further sub classified into two categories: broncho pneumonia and lobar pneumonia.</p>
                        <h5>Broncho Pneumonia</h5>
                        <p>This tends to affect babies and very weak young children. It is more severe than lobar pneumonia. It is also known to be one of the common complications of many diseases such as fibrocystic disease of the pancreas, whooping cough, measles and severe burns. The disease may present in several ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The mother gives a history of a harmless cold about two to three days previously. Alternatively, the onset may be acute.</li>
                            <li>Pyrexia and cough soon develop.</li>
                            <li>Respiration is rapid and distressed with accessory muscles brought into action.</li>
                            <li>The child becomes very restless and throws the arms towards the head in an attempt to facilitate air entry into the lungs.</li>
                            <li>The child becomes increasingly cyanosed with dull eye appearance.</li>
                            <li>The pulse rate becomes rapid, corresponding to the temperature and respiratory rate, which are all elevated above normal.</li>
                            <li>If an x-ray is taken, the film will show small widely scattered areas of consolidation over both lungs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Nursing Care and Medical Treatment</h6>
                        <p>Acutely ill patients will require long periods of undisturbed bed rest. Care should therefore be planned in order to provide for this eventuality. In the event of an oxygen tent being used, only a light covering should be permitted. The child should always be kept warm and well covered, ensuring fresh air in the surrounding environment. Tube feeds are recommended and only a small amount should be given at a time. In all cases of respiratory disease, warm lemon and honey are very soothing to the cough.</p>
                        <p>Antibiotics are prescribed and given as ordered, for example, ampicillin, X-pen, amoxyl or sulphonamides. Cough mixture and paracetamol syrup may be incorporated into the treatment.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> One or more complications may occur if the treatment has been delayed or inadequately administered. These may include pleurisy, heart failure, brochiectasis, lung collapse, convulsions, diarrhoea and vomiting.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Ensure that the family understands that the child should not return to school immediately after leaving the hospital because they need to have more rest. The parents should be encouraged to make attempts to improve the child's general health by providing a high protein diet, which will thereby increase their weight. Medications prescribed should be taken and completed as instructed and the child returned to hospital should their condition deteriorate.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Lobar Pneumonia</h5>
                        <p>Lobar pneumonia is an infection of the lungs involving not only the bronchi but also the alveoli. Pneumonia is very common among children between six months and three years, those that are malnourished, have measles or whooping cough, or whose immunity has been compromised because of HIV infection.</p>
                        <p>Pneumonia is most often caused by pneumococci, but in children unlike in adults. It is also caused by haemophilus influenza or staphylococci though it may also be caused by a virus. The distinction between lobar and broncho pneumonia has no practical value as far as children are concerned. Medical treatment and nursing care are the same for both.</p>

                        <h4 id="throat-infections-heading">Streptococcal Sore Throat</h4>
                        <p>This condition is caused by a strain of beta haemolytic streptococci. It is classified as a communicable disease of the respiratory tract. The infection can spread from one child to another either by droplets or by direct or indirect contact. It has an incubation period of between two to five days. After the beta haemolytic streptococci have invaded the throat, their toxins from the site of infection are absorbed into the bloodstream. Unless treatment is effectively administered early enough, the said toxins cause complications, which may affect other body organs and structures.</p>
                        <p>The disease presents itself in quite different forms. Below are some of those seen in everyday medical practice:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The child presents with fever, rapid pulse rate and cough, following throat infection</li>
                            <li>There is cellulitis of the throat, which may include the pharynx</li>
                            <li>The older child may verbally complain of headache and dysphagia (painful swallowing)</li>
                            <li>Vomiting and thirst may follow this</li>
                            <li>The tongue is a reddish strawberry colour and has a white coating on the surface</li>
                            <li>The cervical lymphatic nodes are swollen and painful (lymphadenitis)</li>
                            <li>The patient gradually becomes delirious and restless, refusing to feed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Nursing Care and Medical Treatment</h5>
                        <p>As soon as the child is admitted into the ward, they should be isolated in a cubicle or a room, which is warm but well ventilated, with plenty of fresh air. They should be nursed while on bed rest in any position they are comfortable in. The room should be humidified if the facilities for humidification are available. Humidified oxygen therapy is given.</p>
                        <p>Plenty of oral fluids should be encouraged, but should there be oedema of the throat, which makes swallowing rather difficult, an intravenous infusion of 5% dextrose or normal saline, should be administered. A fluid balance chart is maintained. Depending on the child's condition, they should be given unrestricted diet, which is light and well balanced.</p>
                        <p>The vital signs should be monitored and recorded two hourly. Vomiting should be similarly observed and recorded. Cold or heat application to the painful cervical lymph nodes is recommended. The patient's personal hygiene, including mouth care, should be taken care of.</p>

                        <h4>Tonsillitis</h4>
                        <p>Tonsillitis is normally classified as either acute or chronic.</p>
                        <h5>Acute Tonsillitis</h5>
                        <p>Inflammation of the tonsils is usually an acute infection, which is very common in children, occurring as a result of pharyngitis. It is most frequently caused by haemolytic streptococcus. Although it is a bacterial infection, the bacteria can also cause enlarged tonsils, which may meet in the midline and obstruct the food and air passages. If the adenoids are also involved, they block the posterior nares resulting in mouth breathing. In addition to this, the eustachian tubes may be blocked resulting in otitis media.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sudden onset with pyrexia of 39-40°C</li>
                            <li>The child complains of sore throat and dysphagia (painful swallowing)</li>
                            <li>On examination, the throat is inflamed and the tonsils are covered with yellow spots</li>
                            <li>The tongue is furred and dry</li>
                            <li>Halitosis (bad breath) is noticed</li>
                            <li>The cervical glands are swollen and tender</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Nursing Care</h6>
                        <p>The patient should be barrier nursed on bed rest in any comfortable position they choose for the first 24 to 48 hours. A throat swab should be taken to the laboratory to confirm the causative organism before drugs are prescribed. During the febrile stage, their vital signs should be monitored and recorded two hourly. Bed clothing and personal wear should be reduced and a cradle used to keep the weight off the patient. An electric fan and tepid sponge may be used to lower the fever.</p>
                        <p>Oral care should be carried out four hourly using appropriate approved lotions, such as glycothymoline in saline. Oral fluid intake is encouraged and should be given slowly in small amounts at a time. Meals should be warm and in liquid form, so that the patient can swallow without discomfort as all attempts should be made to prevent convulsions. Parents should continually be reassured.</p>
                        <p>Crystalline penicillin is given intramuscularly in the early stage and then changed to other oral antibiotics. Soluble aspirin syrup is given three times a day. The dose of medication should be calculated in relation to the weight of the child.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Chronic Tonsillitis</h5>
                        <p>As one becomes older, the rate of tonsillitis recurrence decreases. Repeated tonsillitis treated medically may require surgical removal due to the fear that peritonsillar abscesses may form (Boat et al, 1983).</p>
                        <h4>Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy</h4>
                        <p>It is a common practice that when a decision to remove tonsils has been taken, adenoids must also be removed at the same time. The operation is rarely performed on children under the age of three years unless they have developed airway obstruction.</p>
                        <h6>Preoperative Care</h6>
                        <p>The child and a parent are admitted a day before surgery so that they may get used to the ward environment and to the nurses and so that the child may be fully examined. The operation should be clearly explained to the parents. The baseline observations of temperature, pulse and respiration are recorded four hourly. Any abnormalities noted should be reported to the attending physician. A consent form should then be signed by the parents/guardians. A routine urinalysis should be carried out. Mouthwashes should continue to be given up until the morning of the operation.</p>
                        <h6>Postoperative Care</h6>
                        <p>The child should be placed in a semi prone position, with the head slightly low to facilitate drainage of respiratory secretions until fully conscious. You should observe and report any bleeding from the tonsillar bed, which may be suspected should you see the child repeatedly swallowing. Any vomiting must also be reported to the surgeon.</p>
                        <p>Vital signs should be recorded one hourly initially, but later every two to four hours, as the patient's condition improves. You should pay attention to the patient's breathing. Oral fluids should be given as soon as they are able to swallow, but this should only be in small amounts at a time. Fluids may consist of cold drinks such as fruit juice. Ice cream is also recommended for its soothing and cooling properties. A mild analgesic, such as aspirin or paracetamol for pain relief, may be given, especially before feeds. Antibiotics are also prescribed. The child may get out of bed the following day, and return home on the second day after operation.</p>

                    <h4 id="asthma-heading">Bronchial Asthma</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is a very common respiratory disease, which affects the tracheo bronchial tree due to hyper reactivity to various stimuli. It is reversible, episodic and results in obstruction of the airway. Although it affects all age groups, it is known to cause chronic respiratory disability in childhood. The onset of childhood asthma normally occurs during the first five years of life. It is more common in boys than girls, but later on, in adolescence, the ratio of boys to girls becomes almost equal.</p>
                        <p>The exact cause of bronchial asthma is unknown but many factors are suspected which can be grouped as intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors. One or more of these factors may trigger the onset of asthmatic attack in any individual.</p>
                        <h5>Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors</h5>
                        <h6>Intrinsic Factors</h6>
                        <p>These refer to some clinical manifestations within the patient, especially those of the airway obstruction. The onset of a bronchial asthmatic attack is triggered by non specific factors. There is no allergic response although a family history of asthma may be present. The triggers to broncho spasm and wheezing may include one or more of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Viral respiratory infections</li>
                            <li>Emotional stress or excitement</li>
                            <li>Exercise</li>
                            <li>Drugs such as aspirin</li>
                            <li>Inhalation of irritating substances such as cigarette smoke, strong perfumes or air pollutants</li>

                        </figure>
                        <h6>Extrinsic Factors</h6>
                        <p>The patient may be allergic to certain substances found within the environment. These include inhalation of specific allergens, like house dust, feathers, animal hairs and pollen amongst others. Extrinsic allergies can be detected by performing skin tests using various reagents, which can help to identify the offending substance. A good personal history account may also enable the clinician to associate family allergy to the child's disease.</p>

                        <p>There are many problems that can affect young children. These may either be deliberately or accidentally inflicted by self or others. Whatever the case, you have to be conversant with their management.</p>
                        <h4>Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)</h4>
                        <p>If you find a child that has just collapsed, start resuscitation immediately using the 'ABC' approach.</p>
                        <h5>Sequence of Actions</h5>
                        <p>Before starting this procedure ensure both your safety and the child's. If a child is unresponsive, call for help.</p>
                        <p><strong>A - Airway</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Position the child with head back and hold jaw forward to open the airway. If neck injury is suspected use the jaw thrust method of opening the airway</li>
                            <li>Clear the airway of mucus or vomit with gloved fingers or suction machine if available</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>B - Breathing</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keeping the airway open, look, listen and feel for breathing, putting your face close to the child's face and looking at the chest of the child</li>
                            <li>If a child is not breathing provide positive pressure ventilation with a bag valve mask with 100% oxygen</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>C - Circulation</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After five ventilations, if no central pulse is felt, start cardiac massage (compression) in infants, use both hands to encircle the chest, thumbs compress the sternum towards backbone about 100 times a minute</li>
                            <li>In older children, use the heel of one hand to press the lower half of the sternum toward the backbone about 100 times a minute with child lying on a firm surface.</li>
                            <li>Combine lung inflation and chest compression at a ratio of 1:5</li>
                            <li>The force of compression should depress the chest by one third of the anterior posterior diameter</li>
                            <li>Continue resuscitation until child shows signs of life or help arrives</li>
                            <li>When more staff arrive to help, the most experienced should lead the team, and the less experienced assist</li>
                            <li>Try to define the cause and treat as appropriate</li>

                        <h4>Acute Convulsions</h4>
                        <p>A convulsion is a spasmodic contraction of muscles. It is a very common problem among children, mostly seen in clinics and outpatient departments.</p>
                        <h5>The Most Common Causes</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Infections such as meningitis</li>
                            <li>Brain abscess</li>
                            <li>Malaria and other febrile conditions, which lead to infections, unrelated to the central nervous system (about 10% of children in the tropics who are seen in hospitals suffer from febrile convulsions)</li>
                            <li>Encephalitis</li>
                            <li>Otitis media</li>
                            <li>Congenital malformation of the central nervous system, especially hydrocephalus as well as encephalopathy post immunisation or acute infectious diseases</li>
                            <li>Metabolic problems such as hypocalcaemia or hypoglycaemia</li>
                            <li>Hypomagnesaemia</li>
                            <li>Water and electrolyte imbalance</li>
                            <li>Toxins which lead to tetanus</li>
                            <li>Inherited metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria</li>
                            <li>Space occupying lesions like brain abscess, sub-dural haemorrhage/haematoma and brain tumour</li>
                            <li>Post traumatic convulsions which occur several weeks, months or even years following brain injuries</li>
                            <li>Systemic infections like renal diseases</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Diagnostic Investigations</h5>
                        <p>History taking from the mother will ascertain when the convulsion started, the duration of fits and whether it is generalised or localised. A lumbar puncture should be taken to obtain CSF to find out the causative micro-organisms, if any. Blood chemistry tests should be performed to check the electrolyte levels and blood glucose level. Take a brain scan to check for any cerebral lesions. Skull x-rays should also be taken to check for any previous head injury, especially with older children. Blood should be tested for malarial parasites and other micro-organisms in case of septicaemia. Electroencephalography may be ordered in some cases, especially in the case of uncontrollable convulsions. Blood and urine examinations should be conducted to determine ammonia level.</p>
                        <h5>Nursing Management</h5>
                        <p>The child is admitted into a cubicle or side ward in a quiet environment and placed on the bed in a semi-prone position to facilitate the drainage of respiratory secretion and vomiting. Ensure that the airway is clear and the patient is breathing properly. The suction machine should be used whenever necessary. When the respiration becomes irregular, blood gases should be measured and monitored from time to time. The child should be given oxygen whenever they are cyanosed. Should the blood gases persistently be unsatisfactory, the doctor may decide to intubate and connect the patient to intermittent positive pressure ventilator. This is a mechanical method of helping the patient to breathe.</p>
                        <p>Any child with acute convulsions should be regularly observed with the vital signs recorded two hourly initially and gradually phased to four hourly as the condition improves. Due to pyrexia and the resultant sweating, they should be given a nourishing liquid diet and plenty of fluids at regular intervals.</p>
                        <p>A fluid balance chart should be maintained, paying specific attention to the urinary output. Where the patient is unable to take fluids orally, a naso-gastric tube may be inserted and used for feeding. To this end, mouth care is attended to every four hours. In order to prevent pressure sores, you should make every effort to carry out a two hourly change of position in bed. In general, daily skin care is carried out.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Keep a regular record of convulsions, as a means of determining the nature, frequency and duration of attacks. This is a good way of assessing whether the patient's condition is improving or not.</p>

                        <h4>Burns</h4>
                        <p>Small children are quite likely to get burned or scalded, as they often play close to fires and cooking pots and have not learned through experience or are yet to have the wisdom that one should not play with fire.
                        If the burn is widespread, it not only may cause a local problem but systemic complications can occur as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Large amounts of fluids are lost from the burned surface</li>
                            <li>Pain can also contribute to a state of shock</li>
                            <li>Anaemia is caused by blood loss and other causes, and secondary infection can occur</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Clinical Features and Diagnostic Approach</h5>

                            <li>Record the date and time when the incident happened</li>
                            <li>Is the child epileptic?</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Are they shocked?</li>
                            <li>Check the skin on their nose and fingers. If in shock, they will feel cold and will have a weak, thready pulse</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>An Examination of the Burn</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How widespread is the burn? This is done using the diagram showing the different body parts and the percentage given to a burn in a specific area.</li>
                            <li>How deep is the burn? A blister is usually a sign of a superficial burn. Black, charred skin means a deep burn that will need grafting; so does hard skin that feels like leather. Then you must examine for signs of infection (temperature, obvious pus around the burn area).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <h6>First Aid in the Home</h6>
                        <p>If anyone gets a scald from a hot liquid or a burn from a hot object in the home the resulting damage can be minimised if the skin is cooled immediately by dipping in clean, cold water. If this is done a few seconds after the accident, it may be possible to prevent a deep burn developing. But after 10 minutes or more, it is too late. The only thing that can be done is to cover the area with a clean cloth and take the child to the nearest health centre.</p>
                        <h6>Pain Relief</h6>
                        <p>All patients in pain need pain relief quickly. Give IM pethidine 1 mg/kg p.r.n. or morphine 0.25 mg/kg p.r.n 6-hourly. Paracetamol may be sufficient in mild burns.</p>
                        <h6>Restoration of Fluid Loss</h6>
                        <p>All patients need extra fluid because fluid is lost from the burnt area. Just as in diarrhoeal disease, you may have to give an extra amount on top of the daily fluid requirements. The fluid may be given by mouth or by intravenous drip. For children below 10 kg, calculate using 150 ml/kg body weight with a maximum of 1,000 ml. For a child between 11 and 20kg: 1,000ml  (50 ml/kg for every kg above 10 kg). For a child above 20kg: 1,500ml plus 20 ml/kg for every kg above 20kg.</p>
                        <p>20 ml/kg has to be added for every 10% of body surface or part burned.</p>

                        <h6>Local Treatment</h6>
                        <p>While the pethidine or morphine is working, gently wash the burned area with warm soapy water, remove any dirt or dead skin and gently dry. For burns of the body, limbs, genitals, face and neck, use exposure treatment. For burns of the hands and feet, closed treatment is better. This means that after washing, you put on white petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or Vaseline gauze, then bandage the limb in a functional position and elevate it.</p>
                        <h6>Antibacterial Treatment</h6>
                        <p>Prevent streptococcal infection by giving penicillin. Tetanus prophylaxis is indicated.</p>
                        <h6>Treatment of Anaemia</h6>
                        <p>Keep a check once weekly on the haemoglobin. Give a blood transfusion if it falls below 7 g/dl in the first week. Give a course of ferrous sulphate for less severe anaemia.</p>
                        <h6>Transfer to Hospital</h6>
                        <p>Transfer all severe burns to centres with experienced staff and special facilities. Severe burns include extensive burns (>25%), deep burns, flame burns to face, and contractures.</p>

                        <h4>Poisoning</h4>
                        <p>There are different types of poisoning. Ingested poisoning includes alcohol, organophosphates, kerosene and common drugs. Inhaled poisoning may include carbon monoxide, ethanol and organophosphates.</p>
                        <p>Identification of poisoning includes taking a detailed history, examining drug containers, and analysing any vomitus or urine saved. Poisons create different effects on the body, from symptomatic to metabolic changes, including vomiting, convulsions, organ failure, and coma.</p>
                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>This will depend on the type of poison, time, and route. Some poisons have antidotes. General actions include removal of poisons from the body by provoking vomiting (emesis) for non-corrosive poisons. Ipecacuanha syrup or gastric lavage may be used. Blood should be tested for the poison. IV fluids may be given to correct hypoglycaemia. Oxygen therapy can be administered. Oral alkaline fluids can neutralise acid and vice versa. Urinary catheterisation is indicated if renal failure is suspected.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Kerosene (Paraffin) Poisoning</h5>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <p>The main danger lies in aspiration into the lungs, causing bronchopneumonia. Vomiting is dangerous and should never be induced. Kerosene can also cause acute pulmonary oedema or coma.</p>
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not induce vomiting and do not wash out the stomach.</li>
                            <li>Give 5 ml of milk of magnesia as a laxative instead.</li>
                            <li>Pneumonia is a common complication, so start pneumonia treatment immediately.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Insecticide Poisoning (Parathion, Malathion)</h5>
                        <p>Contact with these poisons causes: Tremors, sweating, copious saliva, and pinpoint pupils. Later stages cause convulsions, coma, and/or paralysis.</p>
                        <p>The treatment consists of washing the child with soap and water, then giving large doses of atropine intramuscularly (0.5 mg for under-fives, 1 mg for older children) every 15-30 minutes, until the pupils become wide.</p>
                        <aside class="callout warning"><p>Note that these dangerously high doses of atropine are indicated only in a serious case of confirmed insecticide poisoning.</p></aside>
                        <h5>Preventive Measures</h5>
                        <p>Children five years and below should always be protected from accidental poisoning. Adults should not experiment with substances in the presence of children. All petroleum products and drugs should be securely locked away. Parents should be given health education on preventive measures and first aid.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Child Abuse/Neglect</h4>
                        <p>Health care workers must be on the lookout for signs of child abuse or neglect. The United Nations has a list of basic children's rights which should be observed.</p>
                        <h5>Types of Child Abuse and Neglect</h5>
                        <p>There are different types, including physical abuse, neglect and abandonment, sexual abuse, and emotional/psychological abuse.</p>
                        <h6>Physical Abuse (battered baby syndrome)</h6>
                        <p>This is the most common form. The child displays non-accidental injuries. Victims are often infants or pre-school children. Various types of injuries may be observed, including burns, cuts, bruises, fractures, and bites. Once child abuse is detected, the child should be removed to a safer environment. The child needs to be hospitalised for a thorough assessment and treatment. Parents or guardians will require counselling. The offenders may be referred to psychiatrists.</p>
                        <h6>Child Neglect and Abandonment</h6>
                        <p>This problem has been brought about by social changes. Children who are abandoned are usually malnourished and may have other diseases. A great number of factors have contributed, including poverty and single parenthood.</p>
                        <h6>Management of Neglected and Abandoned Children</h6>
                        <p>A child needs love, accommodation and food. You should make an effort to provide these in the health care facility while arrangements are being made to provide a suitable home for the child. Medical treatment is provided as appropriate.</p>

                        <h4>Foreign Bodies in Orifices</h4>
                        <p>Children tend to insert foreign bodies into their orifices during play. Unaware of the consequences, they become victims of injuries or diseases.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-277-1.jpg" alt="Illustration showing common foreign bodies that can be lodged in the respiratory tract, such as small toys, food items, or coins." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Infants and toddlers are the most common victims. The clinical manifestation may be immediate or delayed. Should the object be large, the child could become asphyxiated. Clinical features include visible foreign body, discomfort, sneezing, nasal obstruction, purulent discharge, cough, hoarseness, and wheezing.</p>
                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>This is an emergency. A laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy may be performed to remove visible objects. First aid techniques like holding the child upside down and thumping the back can dislodge objects. If the object is too deep, a thoracotomy may be performed. Antibiotics are prescribed for possible complications.</p>
                        <h5>Foreign Bodies in the Ear</h5>
                        <p>Children may push a foreign body into the ear canal. If visible, it may be removed with forceps or a wire loop. The ear may be irrigated with warm water if the eardrum is intact. Otomicroscopy under general anaesthesia may be performed.</p>
                        <h5>Foreign Bodies in the Eye</h5>
                        <p>Foreign bodies in children's eyes usually include soil, sand, insects, and chemicals. The patient presents with pain, lacrimation, and photophobia. Management involves first aid, such as irrigating the eye with warm water or saline. An eye pad may be applied, and the patient referred to an eye clinic.</p>
                        <h5>Prevention</h5>
                        <p>Parents require sympathy and education. Advise parents to supervise children and remove dangerous objects from play areas. Emphasise taking children to the hospital urgently after such incidents.</p>
