                        <p>In section two, you studied some basic nursing procedures. In this section you will cover how to diagnose and treat minor illnesses. You will also briefly look at a new concept. In addition to the Integrated Management of Adolescents and Adult Illness (IMAI), you may have already heard of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). This will be covered in unit four of module one on paediatric nursing.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Obtain a comprehensive history from a patient</li>

                <section id="health-history" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="health-history-heading">
                    <h3 id="health-history-heading" class="section-heading">The Health History</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The scope of nursing practice has expanded to include some activities that were once strictly for the doctor or other members of the health care team. The nurse now employs skills in developing the patient's database by performing physical examination as a step in the nursing process. In certain situations, you will be expected to diagnose and treat minor illness. While conducting a nursing history you will look at the patient's psychological and cultural patterns, the interpersonal and physical environments, as well as the patient's life style and activities of daily living. You will be responsible for developing a database through: a detailed history of the patient's present illness; past medical history; family history and review of body systems. It will be beneficial to include: individual and family relationships; life style patterns; health practices and coping strategies.</p>
                        <p>What you should take note of during history taking is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ethical considerations in data collection</li>
                            <li>Communication skills and interviewing techniques</li>
                            <li>Content of the health history</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now move on to look at these components one by one.</p>
                        <h4>Ethical Considerations in Data Collection</h4>
                        <p>In unit one of this module you looked at legal aspects in nursing and the nursing process, and you covered the patients' rights.</p>
                        <p>Ethical considerations in data collection emphasise that the patient has the right to know why information is being collected and how it will be used. You are therefore expected to identify yourself and your role, provide a detailed explanation of what a health history is, how the information will be elicited and how it will be used.</p>
                        <p>You are also expected to inform the patient on all aspects of the data collection process and of their freedom to participate in/abstain from the process. Try and provide a private setting for the interview. This will promote an atmosphere of trust between the patient and yourself. It will also encourage open and honest communication.</p>
                        <p>Remember to only selectively record data that is pertinent to the patient's health status. Highly sensitive information should not be entered on the record but can be discussed with persons with authority at the health facility. Always remember to secure written records from the public or those health professionals not directly involved in the care of the patient. Confidentiality and maintaining a high standard of nursing care and professional conduct is paramount. In obtaining a personal history from the patient you will be required to utilise basic interviewing skills. The details of this will be covered in unit five of module one.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Communication Skills and Interviewing Techniques</h4>
                        <p>It is important to make patients feel at ease by making them comfortable and giving them respect. Reassure the patients that all the information shared is confidential. Only health professionals directly involved in the care will get access to it. Ensure a private setting for the interview.</p>
                        <p>Allow for the self expression of the patient so as to obtain facts that will influence spontaneous information flow. Promote the patient's full expression through non verbal communication. For example, you could encourage the patient to elaborate or continue by a nod of the head or by repeating the last few words if the patient is hesitant.</p>
                        <p>A puzzled look will encourage the patient to clarify inconsistencies in the history. Pose open ended questions such as "Tell me about it", "How did it feel?", "How can we help you?" and so on.</p>
                        <p>Be careful! At times the patient may provide you with what they thinks you want to hear. You should vary the style of questioning by including a few direct questions such as "Does the pain come before the meal, during the meal or after the meal?" You should use direct questioning when the patient has developed a sense of trust and confidence in you.</p>
                        <p>You should use a health history form to guide the interview but adjust the sequence of questions to coincide with the flow of the conservation. Listen to the patient as they answer the questions. Take brief notes during the interview and maintain eye contact with the patient.</p>
                        <p>You should demonstrate an understanding of the nature and intensity of the patient's problem. The manner in which you respond non verbally to the patient and your ability to listen should convey a genuine willingness to understand the meaning of the patient's concern. The patient should be reassured so that the interview is no longer viewed as an enquiry but feels therapeutic.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Do not interrupt the patient's silent or tearful episodes. Resist verbal reassurances during these moments.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Encourage the patient to elaborate on their feelings by making open ended statements such as "You look sad" or "You seem to be frightened". Convey an understanding of, and respect for, the patient's beliefs and attitudes. Adopt a non judgemental attitude when dealing with issues related to sexuality, drug and alcohol use or cultural patterns.</p>
                        <p>Take into account the patient's cultural background. Remember, cultural attitudes about family relationships and the role of a woman are accepted at face value, just as attitudes toward pain, illness and hospitalisation are accepted. "These beliefs and attitudes are derived from personal experiences which vary according to the person's cultural background." (Brunner & Suddarth, 1988).</p>
                        <p>You should also be aware of your own feelings and attitudes. You should always try not to convey irritation, boredom or disbelief towards a patient's behaviour even though it may be offensive or morally unacceptable to you.</p>
                        <p>Interpret non verbal communication appropriately, for example, gestures that convey defensiveness, hostility, confidence or impatience. Also, learn to respond to body language.</p>
                        <p>You should make an effort to communicate in a manner that is consistent with the individual's level of understanding. You should take into consideration the patient's educational background. Use as few technical terms as possible. Take into consideration the patient's cultural attitudes towards health.</p>
                        <p>Terminate an interview in an appropriate manner that summarises the information obtained and ensures that the patient has understood the major points discussed.</p>
                        <p>Always inquire whether the patient has any questions. Search for areas of misunderstandings by briefly summarising the patient's responses. This allows the patient to correct areas of misinformation. They may also add facts they had forgotten to mention earlier.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Having looked at the basic guidelines for interviewing, move on to look at the content of the interview. The content will include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Biographical data</li>
                            <li>Informant data</li>
                            <li>Chief complaint</li>
                            <li>Past medical history</li>
                            <li>History of present illness</li>
                            <li>Review of systems</li>
                            <li>Family history</li>
                            <li>Patient profile</li>
                            <li>Physical examination</li>
                            <li>Radiological and laboratory information</li>
                            <li>Problem formulation</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Biographical Data</h4>
                        <p>This information helps to put the history of the patient into context. The information includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Name</li>
                            <li>Address</li>
                            <li>Age</li>
                            <li>Sex</li>
                            <li>Marital Status</li>
                            <li>Occupation</li>
                            <li>Ethnicity</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Informant Data</h4>
                        <p>The patient may not be the informant if they fall into one or more of these categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A child</li>
                            <li>An elderly person</li>
                            <li>An unconscious patient</li>
                            <li>A patient suffering from a severe psychiatric disturbance</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should assess the reliability of the informant and the usefulness of the information provided. For example, a hysterical or depressed patient may not provide reliable information whereas patients who abuse drugs and alcohol may use denial as part of their operating mechanism.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Chief Complaint</h4>
                        <p>The chief complaint is the issue that brings the patient to seek medical help. Ask questions such as "What brings you to the clinic today?" There could be variations in getting a chief complaint. The patient may have come for just a check up or may have more than one main problem. List the problems in order of priority. Then expose them and separate them as separate entities.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Past Medical History</h4>
                        <p>A comprehensive summary of the patient's previous medical history is very important. This is because the past could have triggered the present, or the present is a continuation or a complication in the past. Ask the patient about: immunisation status; any known allergies to drugs or other substances; last physical examination; chest X-ray; eye examination; hearing examination; dental check up or papanicolaou smear (if female). For previous illnesses, record any negative or positive responses. Elicit a history of the following areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Childhood illnesses: rubella, polio, whooping cough, mumps, chicken pox, rheumatic fever, sore throat</li>
                            <li>Adult illnesses</li>
                            <li>Psychiatric illness</li>
                            <li>Injuries: burns, fractures, head injuries</li>
                            <li>Hospitalisation</li>
                            <li>Operations</li>
                            <li>Current medications, including prescriptions, over-the-counter and/or home remedies</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the hospitalisation or major medical intervention is related to the present illness, indicate "see history of present illness" on the data sheet.</p>
                        
                        <h4>History of Present Illness</h4>
                        <p>You will need to reflect on your knowledge of the patho-physiology and natural history of disease when exploring the facts related to a present illness. This will enable you to arrive at a diagnosis. The physical examination will reveal manifestations unfolded in the history laboratory and radiological information may be helpful. However their selection will be based on the history obtained.</p>
                        <p>You should compile the history of present illness as a complete story indicating:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The date and manner of the onset of the problem, that is, whether sudden or gradual</li>
                            <li>The setting in which the problem developed, that is, whether at home, at work or after an argument; manifestations of the problem</li>
                            <li>Course of illness or problem</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The course of illness includes self-treatment, medical interventions, progress and effects of treatment and the patient's perception of the cause or meaning of the problem. You should delineate in detail specific symptoms such as pain, headache, fever and change in bowel habits. For example, if pain is identified, make a critical analysis about its location and radiation, quality, severity and duration. You should pursue the persistence or intermittence of the symptom, factors that aggravate or alleviate it and any associated manifestations that the patient may be aware of. The associated manifestations are symptoms that occur simultaneously with the chief complaint.</p>
                        <p>The absence or presence of associated symptoms may point to the origin or extent of the patient's problem, as well as on the diagnosis. These symptoms are referred to as significant positive or negative findings, derived from a review of systems directly related to the chief complaint.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>If a patient complains of a vague symptom such as fatigue or weight loss, you should review all body systems and include the information in the history of the present illness. If the patient's chief complaint is chest pain, both gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems may be included in the history of present illness. In either situation, record both positive and negative findings.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h4>Family History</h4>
                        <p>Take the history of the health status or the age and cause of death of parents, siblings, spouse, children and grandparents, cousins and so on, to identify diseases that may be hereditary, communicable or environmental. You should specifically inquire about such conditions like cancer, hypertension, kidney disease, arthritis, allergies, asthma, alcoholism and obesity.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Review of Systems</h4>
                        <p>The review of systems includes a complete inventory of major body organ systems in terms of presence or absence of symptoms, past or present. It serves as a check and balance so as to prevent you from overlooking any relevant data. You should record negative and positive responses. Taking into account the history of present illness, analyse the symptom the patient has responded positively to. You should get an overview of general health as well as symptoms related to each body system.</p>
                        <p>You could use a checklist as part of the health history to review the systems. The advantage of a checklist is that it can be easily audited and is less subject to error. In the checklist circle any positive responses and underline the negative responses to indicate the presence or absence of the symptom.</p>

                    <h3 id="physical-exam-heading" class="section-heading">Physical Examination</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As previously mentioned, the physical examination is usually performed following the health history. You should perform assessments in a well-lit, warm area. Undress and drape the patient appropriately. You should only expose the area you are to examine. At all times consider the patient's physical and psychological comfort. Explain the procedures and their rationale to the patient.</p>
                        <p>You should always wash your hands before and after examination. You already covered this in section one when you were looking at infection prevention and control. The health history you took will provide you with a complete health profile that guides all aspects of the physical examination. It will help you to focus on body organs and systems that are of particular concern to the patient. You will perform a systematic head to toe examination as follows: skin; head and neck; thorax and lungs; breast; cardiovascular system; abdomen; rectum; genitalia; neurological system and musculoskeletal system.</p>
                        <p>In your nursing practice you must have realised that you have been assessing all relevant organs during physical examination but not necessarily in the order stated above. This may be attributed to the fact that while examining a body organ you may have combined body systems, for example, musculoskeletal and neurological examination when examining the face. This is beneficial to the patient because they are spared from sitting up, lying down and again sitting up from time to time, which can be exhausting.</p>
                        <p>As covered earlier, the four fundamental processes which you will employ during physical examination of a patient, are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inspection</li>
                            <li>Palpation</li>
                            <li>Percussion</li>
                            <li>Auscultation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You have already gone through the process of physical examination in order to arrive at a nursing diagnosis. Now you will look at how to make a clinical diagnosis. Before performing a general physical examination, there are certain vital observations that you should take first, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Taking vital signs such as temperature, pulse, respirations and blood pressure, palpating, counting and describing the pulse</li>
                            <li>Measuring height, weight, fluid intake and output</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As you are performing the physical examination, you will also be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Auscultating for body sounds of the lungs, the abdomen and other organs. You will require a stethoscope</li>
                            <li>Palpating soft areas of the body to check for solid masses, abdominal rigidity or tenderness</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can perform a physical examination anytime you are in a contact with the patient in any set-up, for example, while bathing a patient. Here you can obtain further information about the skin and the patient's response to activities. Move on to see how to perform a systematic examination, beginning with the skin.</p>

                        <p>You have gone through a comprehensive head to toe physical examination and have seen the abnormalities that may be detected. Now you will briefly see how you can arrive at a clinical diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>You started with history taking such as personal/social, medical, past and present. You also looked at the presenting complaints and found that there will be a chief or major presenting complaint and, possibly, accompanying complaints or signs and symptoms.</p>

                    <h3 id="imai-heading" class="section-heading">Integrated Management of Adolescent and Adult Illness [IMAI]</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>IMAI is a health care strategy that addresses the overall health care of the patient. It focuses on the main clinical conditions that account for most of the deaths among adolescents and adults. It integrates the prevention of illnesses and care into a single health care package. If you use this approach, you will find it more rewarding and it will make your work easier. Move on to take a look at the rationale for using IMAI.</p>
                        <h4>Rationale and Benefits of IMAI</h4>
                        <p>Each year many adults and adolescents die prematurely of simple and preventable illnesses. When people seek treatment, they may get treated for single illnesses. However, health workers are reflecting upon a more integrated approach. This is because in many cases it may not be easy to make a single diagnosis with the limited resources. In any case, when patients present to you, they may have multiple complaints that do not point to just one diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>IMAI extends the benefits of Integrated Management of Diseases to Adolescents and Adults who are a neglected group. Furthermore, the strategy combines preventive strategies even for the management of chronic illnesses. There are several benefits to the use of an integrated management approach for adolescent and adult illnesses. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It addresses the major adolescent and adult problems</li>
                            <li>It responds to demand</li>
                            <li>It also focuses on chronic diseases and their treatment, for example, HIV/AIDS</li>
                            <li>It balances prevention and care</li>
                            <li>It addresses special needs of the special groups</li>
                            <li>It invests care in the community</li>
                            <li>It promotes cost savings</li>
                            <li>It improves equity</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>IMAI interventions</h4>
                        <p>The IMAI has simplified guidelines, which give several possible combinations of a large number of interventions. The interventions are based on key clinical symptoms. Every country must develop and adopt core interventions that are related to prevalent diseases in their communities.</p>
                        <p>The interventions are centred on: acute care; chronic care; HIV care; palliative care; tuberculosis and emergency treatment. When our country finally adopts and develops these guidelines, they will be very useful. This approach to care is based on the experience with IMCl . The preventive interventions within IMAI include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provision of key information on HIV</li>
                            <li>Voluntary HIV testing and counselling</li>
                            <li>Counselling on sexually transmitted infections, for example, syphilis</li>
                            <li>Counselling on safer sex</li>
                            <li>Sharing health messages on harmful alcohol use, smoking, inactivity, poor diet and so on</li>
                            <li>Special adolescent preventive interventions, for example, insecticide treated nets, tetanus vaccinations and blood screening</li>
                            <li>Adult's preventive intervention</li>
                            <li>Interventions to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV, through family planning and early antenatal care</li>
                        </ul>
