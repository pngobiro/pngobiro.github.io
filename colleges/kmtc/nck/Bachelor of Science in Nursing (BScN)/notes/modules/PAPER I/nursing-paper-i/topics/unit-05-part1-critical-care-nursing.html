                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>In your practice, you might have experienced a situation where the life of a patient was lost but could have been saved had the situation been handled with a different approach. It is, therefore, important for you to learn the approaches that would increase patient survival rates by improving the care you give to support a failing biological system.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Definition of Critical Care Nursing</h4>
                        <p>The Oxford Pocket Dictionary defines the word critical as 'at a crisis'. The word 'crisis' is defined in the Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary as: 'The turning point of a disease for better or worse, especially a sudden change'. It follows, therefore, that critical care nursing can be defined as the nursing care given to a patient whose health is in danger or in a crisis, so as to save their life or prevent complications.</p>
                        <p>The main purpose of critical care nursing is to maintain accurate continuous observations of the patient's vital functions and to treat or support a failing or failed biological system. It focuses on the whole body system so as to maintain health.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Types of Critically Ill Patients</h4>
                        <p>A critically ill patient is one whose physical condition, physiological and psychological state poses an immediate threat to their life.</p>
                        <p>By now you must have realised that critically ill patients need total and specialised nursing care. This care is usually provided in special facilities. However, one fact that you as a health worker must bear in mind, is that their survival rate will highly depend on your quick and accurate intervention.</p>
                        <p>This should be prioritised on the ABC principles of first aid care, which state that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airway must be established and maintained</li>
                            <li>Breathing established</li>
                            <li>Circulation must be promoted and maintained</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Critical Care Facilities</h4>
                        <h5>Acute Room</h5>
                        <p>The location must allow easy access to continuous monitoring of patients by the health team. Patients who are nursed here require life support equipment and continuous monitoring or observation. Hence this room must be located closer to the nursing station than others. These patients do not only need close observation but also full time communication with the nursing team. This ensures continuity of care.</p>
                        <p>The following equipment should be available and in good working condition in the acute room:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Suction equipment, should include suction machines and a tray containing sterile suction catheters. These are necessary to help clear the patient's airways.</li>
                            <li>Oxygen administration equipment fully assembled, ready for use. This includes full oxygen cylinder, gauge and mask.</li>
                            <li>Intravenous administration apparatus, which includes drip stands, intravenous administration sets and a stock of intravenous fluids.</li>
                            <li>Adequate stocks of linen as patients nursed in this room often require frequent changing of bed linen.</li>
                            <li>Other requirements include observation equipment that is, thermometers, stethoscope, blood pressure machine, a torch, diagnostic sets, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is recommended that a nurse should always be in the acute room, preferably at a ratio of one nurse to two patients at any given time. An acute room can, therefore, be set up in a ward where one cubicle/corner can be identified and set aside for patients needing critical care in hospitals without established intensive care units. These include post-operative patients during the first 48 hours, unconscious patients, patients under special procedures, for example, under water seal drainage, patients with severe respiratory distress, etc.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Intensive Care Unit (ICU)</h5>
                        <p>This can be defined as a room/unit in which a critically ill patient is being actively treated as well as monitored. The purpose of intensive care is to maintain life until the precipitating causes of body failure can be identified and successfully treated to allow the system to regain self-control. Intensive care units are more advanced than acute rooms. Generally, there is no universally ideal plan for an intensive care unit and each unit varies according to the needs of the patients it will take care of.</p>
                        <p>The ratio of nurse to patient should be 1:1 at any given time. Ideally, no new hospital should be built without an intensive care unit. The size of the unit depends on the size of the hospital; one bed for every 50 beds in the hospital is the most ideal.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-346-1.jpg" alt="A modern Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a patient bed surrounded by various monitoring and life-support equipment." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>The minimum number of beds to establish an ICU should be four. This is to merit the staffing and equipping of the unit. Where possible the unit should be easily accessible to the casualty area, the labour ward and the operating theatre, as a delay in the transfer of a critically ill patient from these areas can be critical.</p>
                        <p>The unit should provide adequate space for storage of equipment. It should have space for a preparation room, offices and a day room for nurses and doctors. The space allocated to one bed should not be less than two bed spaces in a general ward. This will allow enough space for quick movement and spacious allocation of patient care machine/electronics like bedside monitors, ventilators, drug pumps etc.</p>
                        <p>In general, cubicles are preferred for surgically clean cases, as there is evidence that they prevent cross infection. One large area can be divided into cubicles of intensive care so as to serve several purposes, for example, isolation room, thoracic surgery room, neuro-surgical room, etc.</p>
                        <p>Infection prevention measures should include changing of clothing before entering the unit, control of visitors, high standard of ward cleaning, frequent nasal swabs from unit staff, frequent decontamination of unit sinks, drains, sink floors, walls, beds and other equipment with disinfectant.</p>
                        <p>The unit requires ventilation and heating systems, piped gases (oxygen and nitrous oxide) and piped vacuum for suction with low and high-pressure outlets at every bed space. Adequate lighting with emergency connection to a standby generator is also necessary.</p>
                        <p>A 24 hour laboratory service is essential for an intensive care unit. Blood gas analysis should be available at all times. Technical assistance for maintenance and operation of electronic equipment should similarly be available on 24 hour basis. Ideally, each bed should have monitoring oscilloscopes. A resuscitation trolley, which is fully equipped and checked daily, must always be available in the unit. A defibrillator and pacemaker must also be available at all times. The beds should be portable and adjustable to the patient's needs and comfort. Ripple mattresses are preferred.</p>

                        <h6>Types of Intensive Care Units</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>General Intensive Care Unit:</strong> This is where one unit admits all types of patients. This is the most common in Kenya. It admits: adults, neonates, paediatrics, cardiac care patients and burns patients, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coronary Care Unit:</strong> This admits only those suffering from coronary and heart related emergencies. Examples are myocardial infarction and heart surgeries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Paediatric Intensive Care Unit:</strong> These admit general paediatric emergencies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Neonatal Intensive Care Unit:</strong> Neonates requiring critical care are admitted and managed here.</li>
                            <li><strong>High Dependant Unit:</strong> These function as a step down to ICU. Patients are nursed in these units after discharge from ICU before getting to the general wards.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Burns Unit</h5>
                        <p>Special burns centres are ideal for the care of the patients with burns, however, in the Kenyan health facilities, most burns patients receive care in the general ward of a hospital (due to lack of space or financial capacity). The burns unit is basically designed to reduce the risk of infection. Infection in burns occurs as a result of the loss of the mechanical barrier provided by the skin cover. It must, therefore, be maintained at a very high level of cleanliness.</p>
                        <p>Infection control measures such as management of visitors and changing of garments and shoes before entering the unit must be adhered to. The unit must be well ventilated. Medical staff should avoid working in the unit when they have upper respiratory tract infections. In an ideal situation, a burns unit is supposed to meet all the requirements of an intensive care unit.</p>
                        <h5>Renal Dialysis Unit</h5>
                        <p>This room is designed to ensure maintenance and sustenance of the life of patients during the dialysis procedure. The unit is piped with a specially treated water system to ensure an acceptable electrolytes concentration.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the dialysis equipment, the room must be equipped with resuscitation and monitoring equipment just like an intensive care unit. This care can be given in a general intensive care unit as long as there is a dialysis machine.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>This section will focus on the assessment, admission and ethical/legal issues in critical care. The emphasis will be on the application of the nursing process in critical care and the need to consider the legal implications of admitting the patient to a critical care unit.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe the assessment of a critically ill patient and determine their critical pathway</li>
                            <li>Describe the criteria for admission to a critical care unit</li>
                            <li>State four ethical/legal issues in critical care nursing</li>
                            <li>Describe the admittance procedure of a patient in a critical care unit</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Assessment of the Critically Ill Patient</h4>
                        <p>It is important to remember the need to assess the patient using a holistic approach. In 1973, Margaret Ann Berry visualised what the future of the nursing care could be like. In her fantasy she presented a situation where patients had been fragmented according to their biological, physiological and sociological needs. There was, however, a puzzling condition still left inside the capsule holding these needs. In her conclusion, she said that it is clear that a patient is more than the sum total of their biological, physiological and sociological needs (Hudak et al 1982).</p>
                        <p>Use the nursing process to identify the critically ill patient. In step one of the nursing process, the main objective is to assess and interpret presenting clinical signs and assign remedial and nursing interventions. For example, if a patient has respiratory distress, the remedial action could include the administration of oxygen by mask, clearing the airways by suction, propping up patients to ease breathing and putting the patient in a recovery position to facilitate drainage of secretion if the patient is unconscious. A combination of these interventions could be used to achieve the same objective of enabling access to adequate oxygen in the body.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>History Taking</h5>
                        <p>While taking medical history you should consider both the present and past medical history of the patient. For the medical history, attention should be focused on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The onset of the problem, that is, when it started and how it started</li>
                            <li>Main presenting signs, including what makes them worse, for example, headaches, dizziness and vomiting which becomes worse while standing up</li>
                            <li>Any current medication being used</li>
                            <li>Previous episode relevant and similar to the current problem the patient faces</li>
                            <li>Previous medical/surgical treatments the patient may have obtained</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Physical Examination</h5>
                        <p>Quick appraisal of the patient's general condition is important to help you to decide where there is need for immediate life saving intervention. If there is no such need, you should proceed to carry out a comprehensive examination. Each body system should be checked for impaired function. Attention should be paid to the respiratory, digestive, circulatory, neural, urinary, endocrine, muscular and skeletal systems. The objectives in physical examinations are to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Obtain further evidence to collaborate the history.</li>
                            <li>Identify other bio-physiological needs of the patient that might have been left out in the history.</li>
                            <li>Determine life saving and life sustaining interventions, such as medical or surgical, and the nursing care subsequently required.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Physical examination is done as a continuous process to serve as a tool for evaluating the patient response to treatment. The findings are documented in the nursing notes and are used to plan the patient's care.</p>

                        <p>Investigations are best viewed as part of patient management, this will be covered later in relation to particular conditions. The purpose of history taking includes looking for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Actual evidence to collaborate history and examination findings</li>
                            <li>Signs or evidence of improvement of the patient's condition during or after particular therapy</li>
                            <li>Evidence of the lack of response to the therapy being provided to the patient and, therefore, providing the basis of changing the therapy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Important signs of a critically ill patient:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Low blood pressure</li>
                            <li>Weak peripheral pulse</li>
                            <li>Cold extremities and peripheral cyanosis. Poor cardiac output produces constriction of arterioles and stimulation of sweat glands, resulting in characteristically cold, pale and clammy skin.</li>
                            <li>Coma is an obvious sign of severe illness. Drastic changes in mental status may indicate serious haemodynamic or metabolic abnormalities.</li>
                            <li>Reduced urinary output</li>
                            <li>Dyspnoea</li>
                            <li>High temperature</li>
                            <li>Unexplained fatigue</li>
                            <li>Chest pain</li>
                            <li>Tachycardia or palpitation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a rule, all critical signs should be considered as very important, while determining the clinical pathway. Once the critically ill patient is identified they must be categorised into the appropriate pathophysiological state and admitted to a critical pathway, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Trauma</li>
                            <li>Sepsis</li>
                            <li>Coma</li>
                            <li>Cardiac abnormalities</li>
                            <li>Over-dosage (poisoning)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These critical pathways attempt to establish the diagnosis and the management required. They help to determine the needs of the patient that require to be addressed immediately in order to sustain and save life. Each critical pathway has protocols and guidelines for the care of individuals.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Admission Procedure for the Critically Ill Patient</h4>
                        <p>In critical care nursing, life-saving techniques should be administered first. Other admission protocols follow. The first step in the admission procedure is determined by the individual patient's condition. That is why it is very important for you to be able to evaluate the patient's condition immediately to identify those who deserve admission.</p>
                        <p>Once a decision for admission is established, the patient's data is collected and entered into the admission records. Relatives, or those who escorted the patient to the hospital, should give the patient's personal details, such as name, address, residence and contact telephone number.</p>
                        <p>The relatives' involvement during admission is crucial and they should be fully informed of the proceedings and what is expected of them, what role are they expected to play, whether they are expected to provide financial support, when they can visit, how they are expected to conduct themselves during the visit, etc.</p>
                        <p>Though the patient may be unconscious they should always be referred to by their name during the admission procedure and during the care. This builds both the patient's and relatives' confidence in the critical care team and promotes two-way communication (nurse-patient relationship).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Criteria for Admission</h5>
                        <p>Intensive care is a service for patients with potentially recoverable diseases who can benefit from a more detailed observation and treatment than is generally available in a general ward. The decision to allow an admission to ICU lies on the doctor empowered with the right of admission by the specific institution. However the patient has to meet any of the following categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Admission for continuous monitoring and observations. A patient who looks stable may have a likelihood of recognisable life threatening complication, for example post myocardial infarction, after pace maker insertion, post cardiac catheterisation, etc.</li>
                            <li>Patients who need extensive and specialised nursing care for example, patients for strict fluid input administration like DKA and burns.</li>
                            <li>Patients requiring constant physician care where doctors and nurses remain at the bedside to attend to any changes and institute therapy, for example after cardiac (open heart) surgery.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In view of these findings, the admission criterion to intensive care units is selective to avoid stretching the limited resources, while at the same time saving the lives of all those at risk.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Ethical/Legal Issues in Critical Care</h4>
                        <p>Since the 1980's, society has established the primacy of informed consent to medical treatment. You are all familiar with the term 'informed consent', especially in the area of surgical operation and family planning.</p>
                        <p>Informed consent basically means the right of a patient or a relative to make a choice based on clear understanding of the risks and benefits of the different alternatives available.</p>
                        <p>In this unit, a broader definition of informed consent which does not only imply the patient's right to chose between alternative treatment, but also their right to refuse to have any treatment at all will be taken. Of course, decisions to refuse treatment are most weighty when the medical interventions being refused are life saving or life prolonging.</p>
                        <p>It is agreed and well known that sometimes, adult patients may refuse any and all lifesustaining intervention. When a patient takes the choice of refusing treatment, the morally acceptable alternative decision on the part of the clinician is either to transfer care to another clinician, or to follow the patient's wish. That is why a patient who refuses to comply with a physician's advice is requested to sign a declaration to that effect. A good example is the discharge of a patient against medical advice.</p>
                        <p>Now look at the other side of the issue whereby it has been established that additional or continued life-sustaining measures are futile. You will agree that often there are difficulties in precisely delineating futility. Ordinarily, physicians feel responsible for their patients and always try to endorse the right treatment to save lives. When they are faced with a decision to terminate further treatment, they are faced with a big dilemma.</p>
                        <p>There are many times when patients and families demand futile treatment because clinicians focus on specific treatment rather than on the goals they may or may not achieve.</p>
                        <p>Occasionally, people demand futile treatment when they do not understand the facts. Studies that have been carried out indicate that there was a high increase in the number of relatives and patients who consented to termination of cardiac pulmonary resuscitation after being candidly informed of their condition and prognosis.</p>
                        <p>Another problem area is when health workers give contradicting and inconsistent information to the patient and their relatives. This often leads to a continuation in demand for futile treatment.</p>
                        <p>Socio-cultural and economic factors will continue to influence perceptions and attitudes of people and hence their health care. This view is supported by Engelhardt et al (1986) who suggested the use of the ICU treatment entitlement index.</p>
                        <p>The ICU treatment entitlement index (ICU E.I.) multiplies: (P) - Potential benefit of treatment, (Q) - The quality of life expected, and (L) - Remaining length of life, and divides them with the cost (C).</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$ \text{ICU E.I.} = \frac{P \times Q \times L}{C} $$
                        </div>
                        <p>What this formula does is to guide a person when they have to make a choice between providing intensive care to two equally demanding patients. Engelhardt argues that the use of such a formula would be a better way of endorsing implementible policy regarding the use of scarce resources in general and ICU in particular.</p>
                        <p>Under both the Hypocritical Oath and the Nurses' Pledge, no patient should be denied medical/nursing care. At the same time, news media occasionally highlight cases where patients were either denied treatment or detained in hospital for inability to meet the cost of treatment. Indeed, hospital institutions and individual clinicians have been sued for liability after denying medical care to patients. Insurance companies offering medical cover are also at times accused of refusing to give medical cover to certain categories of people, for example, those suffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In general, courts look at these cases as a contract dispute between parties.</p>
                        <p>The discussion of terminating life-sustaining therapy in hopelessly ill patients is always an emotional one. This is because many believe that doing so makes one an agent of death. Thus, there are those who prefer to withhold support right from the beginning rather than withdrawing this support later. You can see that the two are ethically equivalent since they both lead to unimpeded progression of the disease, thus leading to the same end-result. Therefore, neither can be said to be wholly ethically acceptable.</p>

                        <h4>Needs of the Critically Ill</h4>
                        <p>While considering the management of the critically ill patient, you need to remember the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A physical need in an individual leads to psychological needs and finally to socioeconomic needs.</li>
                            <li>Individual needs create family needs and family needs lead to community needs, thus an individual is an integral part of a family and the community.</li>
                            <li>The health care system is part of that community and, therefore, the care provided must be within the accepted cultural and legal framework of that society.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Although variations may exist in the care given, depending on the type of institution it is being provided in, generally the principles that you will follow remain the same.</p>

                        <h4 id="patient-management-heading">Care of the Unconscious Patient</h4>
                        <p>The needs of the unconscious patient are highly related to the cause of the unconsciousness. These needs can be grouped as those related to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Interference of oxygen intake and hence require basic life support in their management.</li>
                            <li>Nutrition, for example, those that require artificial feeding such as nasal gastric tube feeding.</li>
                            <li>Fluid and electrolyte balance, for example, dehydration.</li>
                            <li>Skin integrity, for example, risk of developing bedsores.</li>
                            <li>Mobility, for example, lack of movement of joints and muscles.</li>
                            <li>The affective domain, for example, feelings, lack of verbal communication.</li>
                            <li>Social or cultural issues, for example, family and relatives' anxiety.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The management pathway is divided as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Basic ventilatory support/airway care</strong> - that is, airway control through positioning. The recovery position is best as it encourages drainage of secretions from the oral cavity. Suction of the airways to remove secretion and administration of oxygen, intubation of the trachea and artificial ventilation may be required.</li>
                            <li><strong>Monitoring of respiration</strong> - to detect any changes that may indicate complication, for example, increase in respiration rate, abnormal respiration sounds, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ensuring adequate circulation</strong> - this is achieved through maintaining adequate blood volume by administering enough fluids through the intravenous route to supplement the nasal gastric tube feeding. A meticulous input/output chart must be maintained. The use of physiotherapy to exercise the joints and muscles also helps to improve circulation. Monitoring of circulation functions by taking and recording blood pressure and pulse rates, ECG, and oxygen saturation are important.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nutritional management</strong> - can be achieved through insertion of a nasal gastric tube and using it for feeding. The intravenous route is also used to give parenteral feeds if the patient is not digesting, and to maintain fluid and electrolyte balances.</li>
                            <li><strong>Skin integrity</strong> - is maintained through proper skin hygiene, which includes daily bathing, two-hourly turning of the patient and keeping the patient's bed linen clean and dry.</li>
                            <li><strong>Elimination</strong> - adequate fluid intake ensures that kidney function is maintained. Some patients may require catheterisation to keep them dry and for proper monitoring of urine production. Adequate fluids and feeding help to maintain bowel motion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Psychosocial needs</strong> - which includes addressing the patient by their name at all times, while providing care. It is important to assume that the patient can hear and, therefore, you should inform the patient of any intended action that you intend to perform on them. Relatives should be informed of patient's progress and encouraged to provide the social support necessary.</li>
                            <li><strong>General monitoring of the vital signs</strong> - this must be done to evaluate the patient's progress and identify early any impending complication.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Management of Burns</h4>
                        <p>Accurate evaluation of the burns victim must include an assessment of severity factors, which include: Age, Burn extent and depth, Presence of inhalation injury, Influence of associated illness, Elapsed time to treatment.</p>
                        <p>There is usually a clear history of the burn injury, including the cause, which may be any one of the following: Dry heat, Scalds, Chemicals, Tar and Bitumen, Molten metal, Electricity, Friction, Lightning, radiation (rare).</p>
                        <h5>Assessment</h5>
                        <p>The chances of a patient dying from a burn depends on the area of the burn, the patient's age, and the depth of the burn. The burned patient often looks deceptively well on arrival. The effects of fluid loss take several hours to appear. Priority action must be taken. This means that you should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When there are burns on the face or neck, ensure a secure airway.</li>
                            <li>Wash off any chemical or corrosive from the skin with generous amounts of cold water.</li>
                            <li>Remove clothing except where adherent to burnt area.</li>
                            <li>Cover burn with wet sterile pads.</li>
                            <li>Administer IV fluids for burns of over 10% in children or 15% in adults. In major burns (over 30%) two IV infusions may be required.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The process of assessment involves checking the airway, noting the time and cause of the burn, checking vital signs, noting special areas involved, checking for inhalation injury, examining for other injuries, estimating the area and depth of the burn, noting the patient's age, and asking for or estimating their weight.</p>
                        <p>A quick guide on how to estimate the extent of a burn is to follow the 'Wallace's Rule of Nines'.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-354-1.jpg" alt="The Wallace Rule of Nines chart for estimating the percentage of body surface area burned in an adult." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>For full thickness burns blood is required to replace destroyed red cells. The fluid volumes given and the rate of infusion are calculated from the area burned, the length of time since the burn and the patient's weight. Fluid loss is the main early cause of death in patients with major burns. In burns of over 10% blood is taken for: Haematocrit, Haemoglobin, Urea and electrolytes, Grouping and cross-match.</p>
                        <p>Pain relief can be achieved through small frequent doses of intravenous (IV) morphine for severe burns, and intramuscular (IM) pethidine for less extensive burns. An anti-emetic to control nausea is also recommended. A nasogastric tube may be used if the face or the neck is burned.</p>
                        <p>You should also check their tetanus immunity. You should also take swabs from the burned area and adjacent skin, nose, throat and perineum. A urinary catheter should be used in major burns. Aspirate large blisters under sterile conditions and elevate burned limbs to reduce swelling. You should also carefully clean and dress burns.</p>

                        <p>When transferring a patient from A&E the following guidelines are recommended: Once the patient is ready to be discharged you should provide the following advice:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Elevate limb burns to reduce swelling</li>
                            <li>Drink plenty of fluids</li>
                            <li>Take adequate pain-killing tablets</li>
                            <li>Do not get dressing wet or dirty</li>
                            <li>Return to A&E (or GP) when instructed for dressings to be checked</li>
                            <li>Take full course of antibiotics if prescribed</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Management of Burns for the First 48 Hours</h5>
                        <p>During this phase, the resuscitative measures aim at combating shock due to pain and fluid loss through leaking capillaries and bleeding into the extra cellular space. Larger burns tend to produce oedema involving the whole body including uninjured areas.</p>
                        <h6>Fluid Replacement</h6>
                        <p>The first important resuscitation measure during this period includes fluid replacement. The most extensively used guideline for fluid replacement is the Parkland formula, which prescribes 4 ml of lactated ringers solution per percentage burn per kilogram body weight in 24 hours. For example, if the patient has 30% burns and weighs 60 kg they require: 4 x 30 x 60 = 7200 mls in 24 hours. The goal of fluid therapy is to raise blood pressure and increase renal perfusion.</p>
                        <h6>Pain Control and Warmth Provision</h6>
                        <p>Pain in burns patients is both physical and psychological. Strong analgesics and opioids are recommended. Morphine is usually the drug of choice. At the same time, there is poor body insulation due to the destroyed cover (skin). Electrical body warmers may be used.</p>
                        <h6>Prevention of Infection</h6>
                        <p>The second important line of management is prevention of infection. This is achieved through environmental control. The room where burns victims are managed must be kept at a high level of cleanliness. Barrier nursing should be practised and visitors controlled. Antibacterial topical agents, such as silver sulphurdiazine cream, provide protection from bacterial invasion of burns, while penicillin provides early protection from streptococcal infections.</p>
                        <h6>Providing Nutrition</h6>
                        <p>Providing nutrition is another important measure. Wherever possible, the gastrointestinal tract should be the primary route of nutrients. Enteral feeding techniques (oral and nasal gastric tube feeding) allow for a more variable diet to be administered than parenteral (IV) feeding.</p>
                        <h6>Rehabilitation and Counselling</h6>
                        <p>Rehabilitation and counselling should be given in order to restore the burned individual to functional status. This requires dedicated expertise to coax and retrain often reluctant burn victims back to a meaningful life. Physical, occupational and speech therapy may be required. The patient will also need to be weaned from life support machines, for example, ventilators.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>In this section you will look at special investigations carried out in critical care patients to include blood analysis, urinalysis and radiological examination. The procedures relating to dialysis, central venous pressure and tracheotomy will also be covered.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <h4>Rationale for Blood and Urine Analysis</h4>
                        <p>Blood analysis in a critically ill patient is performed for the following reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To establish the cause of coma/unconsciousness that could not otherwise be explained.</li>
                            <li>To establish the values of various constituents in blood so as to compare with the normal values.</li>
                            <li>To monitor patient improvement following therapy.</li>
                            <li>To compare the various constituent values with normal values in the process of reaching a differential diagnosis.</li>
                            <li>To establish alkalosis or acidosis and take corrective measures before complication sets in.</li>
                            <li>To establish facts that will be used to determine the management of the patient so as to bring the values back to normal.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When analysing urine, the main aim is to detect abnormalities like protenuria and glucosuria, which may indicate endocrine failure and other metabolic problems in the patient.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Blood Analysis</h4>
                        <p>There are several types of blood analysis.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Blood for urea and electrolytes:</strong> Potassium 3.4 - 5.0 mmol/L, Calcium 2.12 - 2.6 mmol/L, Magnesium 0.7 - 1.0 mmol/L, Sodium 135 - 143 mmol/L, Chloride 97 - 106 mmol/L, Urea (BUN) 2.4-6.4 mmol/L.</li>
                            <li><strong>Haemoglobin levels:</strong> Male 13 - 18 g/dl, Female 11.5 - 16.5 g/dl.</li>
                            <li><strong>Erythrocyte count:</strong> Male 4.5 - 6.5 millions/mm3, Female 4.5-5 millions/mm3.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Blood Gas Analysis</h5>
                        <p>This gives information about carbon dioxide excretion, oxygenation and acid base balance of the body. The normal values are: paO2 = 11-13kpa, paCO2 = 4.8-6.0kpa, Blood pH 7.36-7.44, Haemoglobin oxygen saturation ≥ 95%, Bicarbonate levels 22 - 26 mmol/L, Base excess -3 to 3.</p>
                        <h5>Urine Analysis</h5>
                        <p>The main investigations here include total urinalysis, culture and sensitivity.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-369-1.jpg" alt="Chart showing the normal constituent values of urine, including pH, specific gravity, and levels of urea, creatinine, etc." class="content-image">

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Radiological Examinations</h4>
                        <p>This is an x-ray examination of a body part or organ. It can be a plain x-ray or special, which requires the introduction of a contrast media. Plain x-rays are useful in suspected fractures of bones and in chest diseases/conditions. Special x-rays such as bronchography, pulmonary angiography etc, outline the cavities so that their structures can be seen clearly in the x-ray.</p>
                        <p>Others such as tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography, will illustrate tissues in order of their differences in mass (density), so that it is possible to distinguish tumours from normal organs. Your role is to take into consideration the psychological and physical care of the patient before, during and after the x-rays. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is contraindicated for patients with pacemakers or implanted metallic devices due to the effect of magnetic energy on the metals.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Dialysis</h4>
                        <p>Dialysis is the process of removing excess fluids, urea and other wastes from the body artificially. Dialysis is indicated in those patients with: Rising creatinine levels, Creatinine clearance of below 0.1-0.15 mls/min/body kilogram weight, Hyperkalaemia greater than 7 mmol/L, Symptoms of uraemia, Acute poisoning.</p>
                        <p>There are two methods of dialysis; peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis.</p>
                        <h5>Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)</h5>
                        <p>This involves the introduction of sterile dialysing fluid (dialysate) through a catheter into the abdominal peritoneal cavity. Through the process of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, excess fluid and solutes move from intravascular (blood) vessels, through the semi-permeable peritorial membrane, into the dialysing fluid. The fluid is then drained from the abdominal cavity by gravity. This process is repeated over a number of cycles.</p>

                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-370-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing a patient undergoing two-way peritoneal dialysis, with dialysate being infused into and drained from the peritoneal cavity." class="content-image" style="width: 48%; display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; margin-right: 2%;">

                        </figure>
                        <h5>Haemodialysis</h5>
                        <p>Haemodialysis has been defined as a technique of separating/removing particles/fluids from the blood by differences in their ability to pass through a semi-permeable membrane. Blood is circulated outside the body through synthetic tubing to a dialyser.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-370-3.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the process of haemodialysis, where blood is drawn from an artery, passed through a dialyzer (artificial kidney), and returned to a vein." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>As blood flows through the haemodialysis, the dialysis, by the process of ultra filtration osmosis and diffusion, removes excess fluid, electrolytes and toxins from the blood. Your role as a nurse during haemodialysis is to: Prevent infection, Observe vital signs, Monitor for changes in arterial or venous pressure, Ensure the patient lies in comfortable position, Ensure adherence to aseptic technique, Provide comfort and reassurance, Teach/counsel on renal diet and alternative therapy like transplant.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Central Venous Pressure (CVP) Measurement</h4>
                        <p>CVP implies the force being exerted by the circulating blood volume in a large central vein, for example, the jugular, sub-clavian and femoral veins. CVP monitoring is indicated in a critically ill patient who has significant alterations in fluid volume. It is used as a guide in the effectiveness of fluid replacement therapy in hypovolaemic states. It is also used to monitor the effectiveness of diuresis in a patient suffering from fluid overload.</p>
                        <p>The CVP is measured by inserting a catheter into the internal angular veins, subclavian, vena cava or right atrium. You should connect a saline manometer between the cannula and drip set. The pressure should always be measured with the patient lying flat. The normal CVP is 3-8 cm of water or 2-5mm of mercury. A low CVP usually occurs in the hypovolemic patient. An elevated CVP above normal occurs in cases of fluid overload.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Tracheotomy</h4>
                        <p>A tracheotomy is an artificial opening in the trachea that provides access to the airway below the larynx. Tracheotomy is mainly indicated for an obstruction of the upper airways as may occur in patients with bulbar palsy, prolonged retention of bronchial secretions or carcinoma of the larynx.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-372-1.jpg" alt="Illustration showing the surgical procedure of a tracheotomy, creating an opening into the trachea." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <h5>Management of a Patient with a Tracheotomy Tube</h5>
                        <p>Since the tracheotomy tube bypasses the humidification process of the air, you should artificially humidify the air passing through the tube by a condenser humidifier or place a moist gauze swab over the tracheotomy. You should ensure regular suction of the tube to remove secretion. The patient requires chest physiotherapy. You should always have a tracheotomy tray containing curved artery forceps to be used in an emergency. The tracheotomy tube can be changed if it becomes blocked. If the tracheotomy was temporary, it is usually left in use for five to seven days. Before removing, check that the patient can breathe normally by occluding the tube.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Rehabilitation and Counselling</h4>
                        <p>You may agree that if a patient is either unconscious, on ventilation or dialysis machine, relatives experience some concern. The patient is also likely to have problems coping and adjusting after gaining full recovery. At the same time, the patient may need to be weaned from the machines. All this calls for rehabilitation and counselling of both the relatives and the patient. To achieve this, you should be able to:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Have an open, honest discussion of the expected outcome of each patient with the patient and relatives.</li>
                            <li>Advise each patient and relative on alternatives available in their situation.</li>
                            <li>Inform them of others who have coped in similar situation.</li>
                            <li>Refer the patient to relevant rehabilitation and counselling services available.</li>
                            <li>Continue giving support through the established health care system during the post-therapy period.</li>
                        </ol>
