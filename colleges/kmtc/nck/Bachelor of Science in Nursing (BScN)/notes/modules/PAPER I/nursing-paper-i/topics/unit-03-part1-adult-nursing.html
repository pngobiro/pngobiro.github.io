                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Unit three part one of the general nursing module, describes the conditions and diseases of the adult that affect a number of the bodies systems. Nursing of the adult requires an in depth knowledge of each condition. This units' role is to assist you in understanding and describing each condition of the systems, following the format of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anatomy and physiology</li>
                            <li>Definition</li>
                            <li>Causes (where applicable)</li>
                            <li>Pathophysiology</li>
                            <li>Clinical features</li>
                            <li>Diagnosis and investigations</li>
                            <li>Management (using the nursing process)</li>
                            <li>Complications</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This unit will describe common conditions affecting the following systems:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Musculoskeletal</li>
                            <li>Neurological</li>
                            <li>Ophthalmic</li>
                            <li>Otolaryngeal</li>
                            <li>Endocrine</li>
                            <li>Gastrointestinal</li>
                        </ul>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Although there is no single book covering all materials in this unit, consider reading Anatomy and Physiology in Health by Wilson Kathleen and Anne Waugh.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Adult nursing is the care of those aged above 12 years and suffering from general medical and surgical conditions. In order to function better as an adult nurse, you need to understand how the human body works. You will start this unit by learning about the organisation of the internal environment of the body and disorders affecting it.</p>
                        <p>Later you will learn about the different functions of various parts of the human body. These include support and locomotion, communication and coordination, digestion, respiration, internal circulation and elimination.</p>
                        <p>You will then conclude the unit by learning about palliative care. This will make it easier for you to understand specific diseases and their management.</p>
                        <p>There is a very important concept, which is recommended for you to apply to the management of your patients. This is the Integrated Management of Adolescent and Adult Illness (IMAI) which was introduced in unit two of this module but was not covered in detail.</p>
                        <p>IMAI is a health care strategy that addresses the overall health care of the patient. It focuses on the main clinical conditions that account for most deaths among adolescents and adults. It integrates the prevention of illnesses and the care into a single health care package. If you use this approach, you will find it more rewarding and it will make your work easier. Now take a look at the rationale for using IMAI.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Rationale of the IMAI Approach</h4>
                        <p>Each year many adults and adolescents die prematurely of simple and preventable illnesses. When people seek treatment, they may get treated for a single illness. However, health workers are beginning to realise the need for a more integrated approach. This is because, in many cases, it may not be easy to make a single diagnosis with limited resources. In any case, when patients present to you, they may have multiple complaints that do not point to just one diagnosis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Benefits of the IMAI Approach</h4>
                        <p>IMAI extends the benefits of the integrated management of diseases to adolescents and adults who are a neglected group. Furthermore, the strategy combines preventive strategies even for the management of chronic illnesses. Benefits of the IMAI approach include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Addressing the major adolescent and adult problems</li>
                            <li>Responding to demand</li>
                            <li>Focusing on chronic diseases and their treatment, for example HIV and AIDS</li>
                            <li>Balancing prevention and care</li>
                            <li>Addressing special needs of the special groups</li>
                            <li>Investing in care in the community</li>
                            <li>Promoting savings and saving on costs</li>
                            <li>Improving equity</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Interventions of the IMAI Strategy</h4>
                        <p>The IMAI has simplified guidelines in a flowing manner, which gives several possibilities and a large number of interventions. The interventions are based on key clinical symptoms. Every country must develop and adopt core interventions that are related to prevalent diseases in their communities. The interventions are centred on acute care, chronic care, HIV care, palliative care, tuberculosis and emergency treatment.</p>
                        <p>The main objective of outlining this concept in this introduction is to encourage you to think in an integrated manner in spite of the fact that we will be dealing with one disease at a time.</p>
                        <p>You will begin by learning about the organisation of the internal environment, diseases that may disrupt this organisation and their management.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Unit Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this unit you will be able to:</p>

                        <h5>The Cell Structure and its Functions</h5>
                        <p>The human body is made up of cells, which form the basic units of tissues, organs and systems. Similar cells grouped together form tissues. Different tissues grouped together to perform a related function form organs. Several different organs grouped together to perform a related function make up a system.</p>
                        <p>All living things are made up of cells. All cells in the body have a cell membrane, which forms the boundary of the cell. The cell is made of protoplasm, which can be divided into two. The cytoplasm is a gel-like substance in which many processes take place. The nucleus is responsible for cell coordination and cell division. It is made up of protein granules, and is surrounded by a membrane, which separates it from the cytoplasm.</p>
                        <p>The cell has two different nucleic acids:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The ribonucleic acid (RNA) is found in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm.</li>
                            <li>The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is found exclusively in the chromosomes (in strands of chromatin) in the nucleus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Chromosomes are the units that are involved in the transfer of the genetic material during the process of reproduction.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Mitochondria</h5>
                        <p>These are rod-shaped structures that are the factories for production of energy.</p>
                        <h5>Golgibody</h5>
                        <p>These are folded tubes involved in protein and carbohydrate processing and transfer.</p>
                        <h5>Endoplasmic Reticulum</h5>
                        <p>This is a network of tubes, which is responsible for the manufacture of enzymes.</p>
                        <h5>Lysosomes</h5>
                        <p>These are the structures that form the digestive system of the cell.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-102-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a human cell showing its main components: Nucleus, Mitochondria, Golgi body, Endoplasmic Reticulum, Lysosomes, and Cytoplasm, all enclosed by a cell membrane." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Most cells will eventually wear out and die, one by one. The only cells that do not get replaced are those of the nervous system. Dead cells are replaced by other similar cells through multiplication. The processes of mitosis and meiosis are involved in cell division. Mitosis is the division of one cell into two similar diploid daughter cells, which are identical to the mother cell. Meiosis is the division of a cell to produce four haploid daughter cells with different characteristics, and are not identical to the mother cell. This occurs during the production of spermatozoa and ova. The normal transfer of a substance from cell to cell occurs across the cell membrane.</p>
                        <p><strong>Diffusion:</strong> The process in which dissolved substances move across cells following a concentration gradient so that they balance on both sides of that gradient.</p>
                        <p><strong>Osmosis:</strong> The process which involves the movement of solute materials from a region of higher concentration to that of lower concentration via a semi-permeable membrane.</p>
                        <p><strong>Active Transport:</strong> Active transport is a process where energy is utilised to move substances in any direction.</p>
                        <p>It has already been mentioned that cells make up tissues. You shall now proceed to learn about the tissues in a human body.</p>

                        <p>You are now ready to continue with section two. In this section you will learn the structures involved in enabling support and locomotion of the body. These include the muscles, bones, ligaments, and joints. Before you start, here are the objectives to achieve by the end of this section.</p>

                        <h4>Bones and their Functions</h4>
                        <p>You have already learnt that bone is a type of connective tissue. It is made up of water, living cells, calcium and phosphorus as its main components. The cells making up the bone are osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The latter are involved in the shaping of the bone through bone re-absorption.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-114-1.jpg" alt="Macroscopic structure of a long bone, showing the epiphysis, diaphysis, articular cartilage, spongy bone, and compact bone." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <h5>Bones</h5>
                        <p>The bone is the hardest tissue in the body and when fully developed comprises of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Water 20 %</li>
                            <li>Organic material 30% to 40%</li>
                            <li>Inorganic materials 40% to 50%</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Inorganic material mainly constitutes of mineral salts especially calcium and phosphates. Organic materials comprise of bone cells. There are two types of bone tissue - compact and cancellous. Bones are almost completely covered by periosteum which is a vascular fibrous membrane. Periosteum gives attachment to muscles.</p>
                        <h5>Types of Bones</h5>
                        <p>Bones are classified as long, short, irregular, flat or sesamoid, long bones eg. femur, humerus.</p>
                        <h5>Development of Bone</h5>
                        <p>This is the process of bone formation that begins before birth and is not completed until age 25 years. Long, short and irregular bones develop from cartilage models. A primary centre of ossification results from deposits of both organic and inorganic bone elements. This further develops allowing for a clear demarcation of the diaphysis. A two degree centre of ossification develops from the epiphysis. An epiphyseal cartilage demarcates the diaphysis from the epiphysis.</p>
                        <p>Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are involved in bone development. Osteoblasts are present at the centres of ossification of immature bone, at ends of diaphysis and epiphyseal cartilage. They are involved in bone building. Osteoclasts are responsible for bone resorption. They maintain and shape the bone.</p>
                        <p>It is advised that you do some further reading later, on the development of bone and various bone cells. You will now learn about the bony skeleton.</p>

                        <p>The human skeleton is divided into two main parts: the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton refers to the central, while appendicular refers to the attachments.</p>
                        <p>The axial skeleton is made up of the skull, the vertebral column, the ribs and the sternum. The appendicular skeleton consists of the shoulder girdle, upper limbs, pelvic girdle and lower limbs. The total number of bones in the human body is at least 206.</p>

                        <p>The bones perform several functions. They:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide the basic framework of the body</li>
                            <li>Provide points of attachments to muscles and tendons</li>
                            <li>Form a reservoir for calcium</li>
                            <li>Permit movement of the body as a whole by forming joints</li>
                            <li>Form boundaries of many cavities, which provides protection to organs within</li>
                            <li>Contain red bone marrow, which is involved in the production of blood cells</li>

                        <h4>Joints</h4>
                        <p>There are points in the body at which bones attach to each other. These are called joints. They form the points at which many movements can be made and positions changed.</p>
                        <p>Generally, there are three main types of joints:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Fibrous joints</strong>, which are fixed and immovable joints. Examples include the joints between various skull bones (or sutures).</li>
                            <li><strong>Cartilaginous joints</strong>, which are slightly movable and enable you to bend. They have cartilage between two bones. Good examples are joints between the vertebral bones.</li>
                            <li><strong>Synovial (diarthrosis) joints</strong>, which are freely movable. They are further subdivided into ball and socket joints, hinge joints, gliding joints, pivot and saddle joints.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Movements of Joints</h5>
                        <p>The various movements made at the joints include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Flexion:</strong> bending forward and backward. The knee joint is a good example of this.</li>
                            <li><strong>Extension:</strong> straightening or bending backwards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Abduction:</strong> movement away from the midline. The best example of this is moving your arm or leg away from your body laterally.</li>
                            <li><strong>Eversion:</strong> turning the sole of the foot outwards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inversion:</strong> turning the sole of foot inwards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Supination:</strong> turning the palm up.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pronation:</strong> turning the palm downwards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> movement around the long axis. You may use either the lower limb or the upper limb.</li>
                            <li><strong>Circumduction:</strong> a combination of adduction, flexion and extension.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adduction:</strong> movement towards the middle of body.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Muscles and Ligaments</h4>
                        <p>You previously learnt that muscle tissues belong to either of three groups. These are visceral, cardiac and skeletal.</p>
                        <p>Cardiac muscle is exclusively found in the heart. Skeletal muscle is what makes up most of the structures in your body. It is called striated or voluntary because its contraction can be controlled at will. Visceral muscle makes up the intestines and the hollow organs. It is not striated and is involuntary.</p>
                        <p>Muscles can contract and are extensible and elastic. They are also irritable, which explains why nerve impulses can excite them. These properties enable them to stretch and return to normal, become thicker and respond to a stimulus. Individual muscles have various names.</p>
                        <h5>Functions of Muscles</h5>
                        <p>Muscles are influenced by nerve impulse, hormones and, for cardiac muscle, impulses generated in the heart muscle. Muscle contraction causes movement of various parts in the body. Energy for contraction is obtained from metabolism. This energy is in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP).</p>
                        <p>The nerves and special messengers, that is, the hormones, do an important job. The functions of the muscles can, therefore, be listed as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contracting, hence, performing work</li>
                            <li>Protecting internal structures</li>
                            <li>Producing movement in conjunction with muscles, bones and joints</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3 id="bone-disorders-heading" class="section-heading">Disorders of Bones and their Management</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Disorders of the bones range from those that occur as a result of altered growth and development, to those due to disordered metabolism, neoplasm, injuries and their complications.</p>
                        <p>The disorders occurring during growth and development include femoral ante-version where there is internal torsion or rotation of the femur and toeing-out of the foot with the foot flat and toes spread out. Many of the conditions resolve by themselves while a few may need surgery. However, these are generally rare conditions.</p>
                        <h5>Scoliosis</h5>
                        <p>Scoliosis, which is lateral deviation of the spinal column. This condition can occur without any cause or may be caused by certain diseases. For instance, disturbances in vertebral development and neuromuscular disorders such as poliomyelitis can lead to scoliosis. The manifestations of scoliosis include uneven shoulders and a prominent scapula, asymmetry of the flanks and asymmetry of the thoracic cage. The patient may also have rip humps.</p>
                        <h5>Kyphosis</h5>
                        <p>Kyphosis is an exaggeration in the curvature of the thoracic spine. This may lead to a change in the volume of the thoracic space. It will, therefore, affect the functional lung capacities.</p>
                        <h5>Poliomyelitis</h5>
                        <p>Poliomyelitis is another debilitating disease which, though a disease of the nervous system, may affect the muscular-skeletal system.</p>
                        <h5>Lumbar Lordosis</h5>
                        <p>Lumbar lordosis is an exaggeration in the curvature of the lumbar spine. This normally occurs during growth and development.</p>
                        <p>You will now learn about some of the disorders of bone metabolism, which include osteoporosis, osteomalacia and rickets.</p>
                        <h5>Osteoporosis</h5>
                        <p>This is a disorder in which the rate of bone reshaping (resorption) is greater than the rate of formation. This results in a loss of organic matrix and mineral content. The bone then becomes brittle, fragile and fractures easily. This is a condition that is common among the elderly. It can also be seen in post-menopausal women, people with Cushing's syndrome and those who are on steroid treatment. The manifestations of osteoporosis are pain and spontaneous fractures. In some cases, wedging and collapse of vertebrae causes loss of height. It may also lead to kyphosis.</p>
                        <h5>Osteomalacia and Rickets</h5>
                        <p>These terms refer to the same process occurring at different ages. In both cases, there is a deficiency of vitamin D. If the deficiency occurs before fusion of the epiphyseal plates then the bones get deformed, but if fusion has already occurred, then the bones will bend easily. Rickets therefore occurs in children and osteomalacia in adults.</p>
                        <p>Both conditions are caused by mal-absorption syndromes, lack of exposure to sunlight and excess secretion of vitamin D. You can now reflect upon the effects of poor nutrition to bones.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Care of the Adult with Osteoporosis, Osteomalacia and Rickets</h4>
                        <p>The prevention of osteoporosis focuses on adequate calcium intake and calcium supplementation. Some foods high in calcium content are whole and skim milk, spinach, cheese, dark green vegetables, and sardines. You may remember that we mentioned some of these earlier.</p>
                        <p>Oestrogen replacement therapy after menopause is used to prevent osteoporosis among post-menopausal women. Another useful management technique is calcitonin treatment, which acts by blocking the effects of the parathyroid hormone on bone resorption. The drug etidionate disodium also inhibits bone resorption. It is important to tell patients that weight bearing exercises are also useful in prevention of osteoporosis. Although loss of bone cannot be reversed totally, the use of oestrogen, exercise and calcium can prevent further loss.</p>
                        <p>You should strive to keep patients with osteoporosis ambulated to prevent further loss of bone substance as a result of immobility.</p>
                        <p>You should also ensure that we institute measures to avoid pathological fractures in patients with osteoporosis. Always include health education on the prevention of home accidents in your management. Those at risk should avoid walking on slippery floors, and should wear shoes with a firm sole.</p>
                        <p>The management of osteomalacia is directed towards correcting the underlying cause. Remember you learnt that this disorder is associated with vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D should be supplemented and the patient will generally improve. Calcium and phosphorous intake may also be supplemented after proper investigation.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Bone Tumours</h4>
                        <p>Bone tumours constitute about 1% of all malignancies in the adult population. Sometimes tumours in the bones metastasise and cause complications in other organs. Bone tumours include osteomas, chondromas, fibromas, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and multiple myeloma. The conditions associated with bone tumours are infections, pathological fractures and anaemia among others.</p>
                        <p>Generally the manifestations of bone cancer include bone pain that lasts over a week and unexplained swelling over a particular bone. Other manifestations include warm skin over the affected bones and prominent veins. Perhaps you have seen clients with bone cancer.</p>
                        <p>Bone tumours are rare in adults but if present, they rapidly metastasize and cause bone destruction. In addition, they lead to organ involvement. An example is multiple myeloma. This will involve the bone marrow and lead to anaemia. Chemotherapy is, therefore, used to suppress plasma cell growth in the bone marrow. Steroids are also given to these patients. However, both these management methods increase the patient's susceptibility to infection. Therefore, you need to practise good infection prevention and control. In osteoclastoma and sarcoma, chemotherapy, surgery and radiation may improve survival rates.</p>
                        <p>After assessment of a cancer patient, focus on achieving the following goals.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensuring satisfactory pain relief</li>
                            <li>Enabling the patient to maintain preferred activities</li>
                            <li>Encouraging the patient to accept body image changes resulting from chemotherapy radiation and surgery</li>
                            <li>Decreasing the possibility of injury</li>
                            <li>Educating the patient on disease progression and prognosis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should also pay attention to pathological fractures, spinal cord compression and limb amputation. Pain relief is achieved by the use of strong analgesics. Counselling and patient education will enable the patient to choose the kind of activities to engage in. It will also assist patients to avoid injury.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Bone Infections</h4>
                        <p>Infections also affect the bones. Some infections are brought about by surgery to the bone, while others are spread through fractures, abscesses and blood borne microorganisms. One of these bone infections is called osteomyelitis.</p>
                        <p>In osteomyelitis, certain micro-organisms, mainly staphylococci, affect bone tissue. The infection can be either by direct or indirect invasion. The infection leads to pain on the affected area, abscess formation, fever and necrosis of the bone tissue. In your practice you may have seen that orthopaedic patients can complicate with osteomyelitis.</p>
                        <p>Vigorous antibiotic therapy is the treatment of choice for acute osteomyelitis. Some immobilisation of the affected part is necessary. The development of sepsis is common if metastasis of bacteria moves to other sites. Pathologic fractures may also occur due to weakened bone. Deformities of the affected extremities should not be overlooked. In such cases, preventive measures such as proper alignment and immobilisation are necessary.</p>
                        <p>Osteomyelitis can be chronic or acute. Treatment of chronic osteomyelitis includes surgical removal of the poorly vascularised tissue and dead bone. It also involves irrigating the area with antibiotics.</p>
                        <p>Generally the goals that we must strive to achieve in the management are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pain and fever control</li>
                            <li>Preventing the transmission of the infection to other areas of the body</li>
                            <li>Decreased complications of bone fractures and deformities</li>
                            <li>Maintenance of a positive outlook and cooperation with the treatment plan</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Specific nursing activities include close monitoring of the patient, promotion of drainage, use of fluids, immobilisation, good nutrition to the patient, use of antibiotics, use of assistive devices such as crutches, minimising infection and patient education.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A fracture is any break in the continuity of bone.</p>
                        <h4>Classification of Fractures</h4>
                        <p>They are classified according to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Location</li>
                            <li>Type</li>
                            <li>Direction or pattern of fracture line</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Location</h5>
                        <p>Long bones can be described as having 3 parts; proximal, midshaft and distal. A fracture of the long bone is described in relation to its position in the bone.</p>
                        <h5>Types of Fracture</h5>
                        <p>This is in relation to its communication to the environment, degree of break in continuity of the bone, character of fracture. For example an open fracture communicates with the environment because it penetrates the skin, while a closed fracture does not penetrate the skin. We also talk of the degree of break, e.g. green stick, partial or complete and character of fracture which is described as comminuted, impacted, segmental, etc The pattern of fracture line can be described as transverse, spiral, oblique, etc.</p>

                        <h4>Bone Healing Process</h4>
                        <p>After a fracture, bone healing follows a number of stages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A haematoma forms between surrounding soft tissues.</li>
                            <li>Inflammatory process sets in with accumulation of macrophages. This takes about five days. The macrophages, phagocytose the haematoma. Growth of granulation tissue begins.</li>
                            <li>The osteoblasts secrete non-lamellar osteoid. Calcium is also absorbed which aids in hardening of bone to form callus.</li>
                            <li>Osteoclasts become active removing excess callus and opening up a medullary canal in callus. This may take up to one month.</li>

                        <h4>Principle Management of Fractures</h4>
                        <p>The emergency management of a fracture involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assessing the airway, breathing and circulation</li>
                            <li>Assessing any bleeding sites and controlling bleeding</li>
                            <li>Treatment of any life threatening injury</li>
                            <li>Immobilisation by use of splints</li>
                            <li>Applying cold compresses</li>
                            <li>Elevating the extremity</li>
                            <li>Minimising mobility</li>
                            <li>Monitoring the patient closely</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The principle management of fractures falls along 3 lines:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Fracture reduction</li>
                            <li>Immobilisation</li>
                            <li>Rehabilitation (restoration of function)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>a) Reduction</h5>
                        <p>The aim is to replace the bone fragments to as near as normal anatomical position as possible. Methods used are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Open reduction.</strong> This is a surgical method of bringing the fractured parts together.</li>
                            <li><strong>Closed reduction.</strong> Here manipulation is used without viewing the fractures. An x-ray must be taken immediately after.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>b) Immobilisation</h5>
                        <p>The aim is to prevent movement of injured parts already reduced by the above methods. It is accomplished through the use of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>External devices e.g. splints, plaster casts, external fixation devices or traction.</li>
                            <li>Internal devices inserted during open reduction e.g. screws, nails, plates.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Traction</h4>
                        <p>Traction involves a steady pull on a body part. This is a method of reduction and immobilisation used to maintain fractures apart but allowing sufficient contact for healing. Traction may be either skin or skeletal. In skin traction the pull is transmitted to the skin on the fractured bone. In skeletal traction, the force is directly applied to the bone by use of pulls. In both, weights are used to maintain traction and the traction force must be maintained throughout the initial healing stage.</p>
                        <h5>Indications:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To reduce a fracture</li>
                            <li>Maintain alignment</li>
                            <li>Overcome muscle spasm</li>
                            <li>Correct deformities</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Specific Care for Patient on Traction</h5>
                        <p>The care is similar to that of a patient on a cast and internal fixation. In addition, you should maintain continuous traction and avoid adding weight to the traction.</p>
                        <h6>Skin Care</h6>
                        <p>Nurse the patient on sheepskin to avoid pressure sore formation and gluteus. Keep the skin clean around pin sites in skeletal traction to avoid infections.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Plaster Casts</h4>
                        <p>This is a common external fixation device which is applied over skin. The skin should be intact, clean and well padded before a cast is applied to avoid risks of infection. Casts are molded over the affected body part after closed reduction has been done.</p>
                        <h5>Specific Care for a Person in a Cast</h5>
                        <h6>1) Patient Education</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before the application explain the procedure to the patient and the extent of the immobilisation.</li>
                            <li>After cast application explain the care of cast to the patient and when it will be removed.</li>
                            <li>Instruct patient not to insert sharp objects in to the cast to avoid injury in the skin.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>2) Skin Care</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inspect skin around the cast edges for redness or irritation.</li>
                            <li>After cast removal, skin should be washed thoroughly and oiled.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>3) Mobilisation</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Weight bearing is at the discretion of the physician. The patient can ambulate on crutches.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>4) Positioning</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After cast application, position limb elevated on a pillow to decrease oedema.</li>
                            <li>Observe limb for colour changes and sensation. If the patient experiences tingling sensations, the cast is too tight and should be removed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Internal fixation</h4>
                        <p>It has the advantage of allowing direct visualisation of fracture of the surrounding tissues. Its main disadvantage is that anaesthesia is required and there is the risk of infection if strict surgical asepsis is not maintained. Devices used for internal fixation include:</p>

                        <h4>Arthritis</h4>
                        <p>Arthritis is a descriptive term applied to more than 100 rheumatic diseases.</p>
                        <h5>Rheumatoid Arthritis</h5>
                        <p>Rheumatoid Arthritis is a systemic inflammatory diseases affecting synovial joints.</p>
                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>The disease begins in the synovial membrane within the joint. This leads to an inflammatory process. The inflammatory process is triggered by an unknown event that damages or irritates the joint tissues. Continued inflammation leads to thickening of the synovium especially where it joins the articular cartilage. At this point, fibrin develops into a granulation tissue known as pannus. This leads to adhesions between joint surfaces and fibrous or bony ankylosis. Pain occurs as a result of cartilage degeneration due to erosion.</p>

                        <h5>Degenerative Joint Disease (Osteoarthritis)</h5>
                        <p>A condition affecting one or more joints characterised by degeneration of joint tissue or a non-inflammatory condition of the joint characterised by degeneration of joint tissue.</p>
                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>The onset is slow with erosion of articular cartilage, thickening of subchondral bone and formation of osteophytes or bone spurs. Normal articular cartilage is white, transluscent and smooth in osteoarthmitis. The area of the cartilage becomes soft and the surface becomes rough and cracks. Eventually the cartilage is destroyed and the underlying bone goes through a remodeling process. Osteophytes or bone spurs appear at the joint margin at the sites of attachment. These may break off and appear in the joints as joint mice.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Proper positioning of the patient in bed to avoid hip dislocation.</strong> A wedge pillow maybe used between the limbs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vital signs observation</strong> which should be done four hourly to assess the patient's progress. Oxygen may be administered for the first six hours to improve perfusion. Other observations are of the incision site for bleeding and drainage if drain is in situ. If the drainage is minimal the drains should be removed 48 to 72 hours post operatively.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pain management control</strong> should be maintained throughout the recovery period e.g. pethidine 75 mgIV eight hourly and as needed followed by oral diclofenac 100 mg bd for 14-21 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ambulation.</strong> The patient starts on passive exercises as soon as the pain is controlled. They should ambulate as soon as is possible to avoid complications e.g deep various thrombosis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nutrition.</strong> Depending on the type of anaesthesia used and patients condition they may be allowed to take oral sips six hours after surgery. If they had intravenous infusions running, these should be allowed to go through and the input and output chart should be maintained to monitor fluids. The patient should be allowed to feed on a well balanced diet soon after they can tolerate fluids.</li>

                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>In the normal bone forming process, bone remodelling occurs at the same pace as bone resorption. In osteoporosis, there is rapid bone loss. This leads to thinning of the lamellar with deformity and later collapse. The bone may easily fracture.</p>

                        <h4>Care of the Adult with Joint Disorders</h4>
                        <p>Patients with osteoarthritis have degeneration of articular cartilage in the joints. Management involves relief of discomfort and protection of the joints from undue strain. The relief of pain can be achieved by resting the involved joints, advising the patient to avoid activities that precipitate pain, use of heat, analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, for example, steroids. The use of correct body mechanics, assistive devises and the avoidance of heavy weight bearing is also helpful. The joints should be restored to their maximal extent through the use of progressive range of motion exercises, avoiding flexion deformities and the utilisation of corrective and graded exercises.</p>

                        <p>The amputation is performed at the point furthest from the torso that will heal well. The ankles, slightly below knee, and slightly above knee are some of the common points of amputation. Pre-operatively, you assist the patient to undergo investigations and support them psychologically. Always give good nutrition, correct Hb, teach the patient how to use assistive devices such as crutches and involve them in exercise programmes.</p>
                        <p>Post-operatively, the patient requires good wound drainage as well as proper wound dressing and antibiotics to decrease sepsis. Immediately after surgery, the patient should also be closely monitored for haemorrhages, vital signs fluctuations and wound drainage. Physiotherapy is utilised to prevent the development of contractures. Pain management is an important aspect. Phantom pain often occurs as a result of the missing limb and psychotherapy is recommended.</p>
                        <p>We talk of phantom pain when a patient reports pain in an area distal to a point of amputation. For example, a patient may report pain on missing toes.</p>
                        <p>Care of the skin at the stump area, muscle strengthening and balancing exercise, in addition to education on use of prostheses are all important aspects in the care of the patient with amputation. Always remember that rehabilitation of the patient with amputation is an important consideration of nursing.</p>

                        <h4>Gout</h4>
                        <p>When there is accumulation of products of purine metabolism, especially uric acid in the body, they may crystallise in the joints causing joint inflammation and destruction. The first symptoms of gout are typically joint pain that starts with distal joints and swelling. The disease is aggravated by infections, cold weather and consumption of meals rich in purines.</p>
                        <p>The management of gout is mainly preventive. Once an individual starts presenting with symptoms, they need to be advised on how to avoid acute gout attacks. Anti-gout medication comes in two forms. The first is pain-controlling medication such as indocid, diclofenac and aspirin at a high dose. The second is medication that acts to decrease the production of uric acid e.g. allopurinol. The patient must be advised to avoid over indulgence on roast meat, organ meat (such as liver), baked chicken and sardines, as these are high in purines. They should also drink lots of fluids to facilitate the secretion of uric acid through the kidneys.</p>

                    <h3 id="muscle-disorders-heading" class="section-heading">Disorders of the Skeletal Muscles and their Management</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Skeletal muscles make up about half of the mean body weight of individuals. They have various characteristics as you have studied earlier. They undertake the function of causing movement of various body parts. If muscles are not put to use for reasons such as pain, lack of exercise or disease, they may atrophy. Atrophy is a decrease in the number and size of muscle fibres. This is one of the reasons that physical therapists continually work with bedridden patients, in an effort to prevent disuse atrophy.</p>
                        <p>Muscles can get inflamed. This is called myositis. When bone forms within the muscle due to infiltration of bone cells, the condition is referred to as ossifying myositis. This is normally due to repeated injury accompanied by a haemorrhage into a muscle compartment.</p>
                        <p>Inflammation of muscles can be brought about by parasites and infections, for example, the larvae of the Trichinella spiralis, commonly found in muscles that are rich in a substance called cytochrome. These are muscles that work hard to produce energy. Autoimmune responses can also result in muscle inflammation. The manifestations of inflammation of muscle include pain, swelling, easy fatigability and sometimes paralysis.</p>

                        <h4>Neoplasms of Muscles</h4>
                        <p>There are over 500 muscles in the human body. Conditions affecting the muscles are rare. Primary tumours of muscles can either be malignant or benign. These are mainly rhabdomyomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. Secondary tumours are a result of metastases from other organs of the body. These are very rare. The manifestations of secondary muscle tumours are pressure symptoms, decreased blood supply to the affected area, pain and infection. Keep in mind that there are general symptoms of neoplasms for almost all tumours and they include anaemia, nausea and anorexia.</p>
                        <p>Before concluding on the disorders of bones and skeletal muscles we should not forget to mention that muscles can be over-stimulated and go into spasms, which are often extremely painful and may render the use of the involved limb difficult. This could be a result of neurological disease and can lead to lower back pain, and muscle pull.</p>
                        <h4>Care of Adults with Muscle and Ligament Disorders</h4>
                        <p>You have learnt about several soft tissue injuries, including sprains, strains, dislocations and subluxation. These are abnormalities affecting the articular points. The main goals of management of sprains and strains are to return the limb to normal function and to ensure satisfactory pain relief and comfort.</p>
                        <p>You must, therefore, undertake the following actions while managing patients with these problems:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess for neurological and circulatory status</li>
                            <li>Elevate the involved limb</li>
                            <li>Apply a compression bandage, except in cases of dislocation</li>
                            <li>Immobilise the affected limb</li>
                            <li>Eliminate weight bearing on the affected extremity</li>
                            <li>Administer analgesics to control the pain</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Specialised techniques may also be employed by physiotherapists to assist the patient in achieving the two goals that have just been listed. Focusing on pain relief, realignment of articular surfaces and promoting joint function will treat dislocation and sub-luxation. Anti-inflammatory drugs, immobilization, and regulated rehabilitation are also utilised in the management of sub-luxation and dislocation. Muscle spasms are managed by a combination of drugs, physical therapy or both. One example is Valium, which has some muscle relaxant activity and is commonly employed in our setup. Tumours involving muscles can be treated with radiation, chemotherapy, surgery or a combination of these. These are treatment methods that are generally employed in the management of all cancers.</p>

                        <h4>Low Back Pain</h4>
                        <p>Low back pain is a major musculoskeletal disorder that is commonly encountered. It is caused by several factors.</p>
                        <h5>Causes of Lower Back Pain</h5>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <p>You should take down a good personal history and perform a thorough physical examination.</p>
                        <h5>Treatment of Lower Back Pain</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rest the patient on a firm mattress, in the modified supine position with slight flexion as to relieve the pain</li>
                            <li>Heat and appropriate medication for pain relief are important for the patient with back pain</li>
                            <li>To promote additional lumbar flexion, pelvic traction may be prescribed</li>
                            <li>Drug therapy</li>
                            <li>Exercise programmes</li>
                            <li>Encourage proper body mechanics and posture especially during strenuous exercise</li>
                            <li>Initiate physical therapy sessions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Drugs are used for muscle relaxation, whereas electrical nerve stimulation and use of wide leather belts promote comfort.</p>

                        <h4>The Nervous System - The Structure</h4>
                        <p>The nervous system is divided into two parts: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord while the peripheral nervous system consists of the cranial nerves, spinal nerves and autonomic nervous system.</p>
                        <h5>Neurons</h5>
                        <p>The neurons are the functional cells of the nervous system. A neuron consists of a nerve cell/body, an axon and a dendrite. When they are grouped together outside the central nervous system, they are called a ganglion. Neurons are specialised cells, which enable the transmission of information in the form of nerve impulses.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-129-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a neuron, showing the cell body, dendrites, axon, and myelin sheath." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>Neurons can be divided into two groups. The first group takes messages from receptor end organs into the Central Nervous System (CNS). These are sensory or afferent nerves. The second group takes messages away from the CNS to the effector organs. These are known as motor or efferent nerves. More than one neuron may be involved in the process of relaying information. In such cases, the multiple neurons connect with each other, at point of connection called a synapse. At the synapse there are chemical transmitters, or neurotransmitters, which are involved in the transmission of messages. Two examples of neuro-transmitters which you may have heard of, are Acetylcholine and Noradrenaline.</p>

                        <h4>The Brain, Spinal Cord and Nerves</h4>
                        <p>You will have heard of the central nervous system. This term refers to the brain and the spinal cord. Membranes called meninges cover the brain and spinal cord. Within the cranium, the meninges are found between the skull and brain. In the vertebral column they are found between the vetebrae and the spinal cord. The dura mater and the arachnoid mater are separated by a potential space - the subdural space.</p>
                        <p>The three membranes, starting from the outermost are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dura Mater</li>
                            <li>Arachnoid Mater</li>
                            <li>Pia Mater</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>

                        <p>There are two spaces between the three membranes. The space between the arachnoid and pia mater is the sub-arachnoid space and it contains cerebrospinal fluid. In your practice, you have seen patients having cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removed for laboratory study.</p>

                        <h5>The Brain</h5>
                        <p>The brain consists of the following parts:</p>
                        <p>The cerebellum undertakes coordination of voluntary muscle movement. Posture and balance are also controlled by the same part of the brain. Finally, the reticular formation found in the core of the brainstem performs the functions of coordination of skeletal muscle and maintaining balance. It also coordinates activity of the autonomic nervous system and performs the function of selective awareness. When you want to continue reading, while the radio is playing, the process that enables this dual activity is referred to as selective awareness.</p>
                        <p>The medulla oblongata comprises certain vital centres. These are the respiratory, cardiac, vasomotor and reflex centres of vomiting, coughing, sneezing and swallowing. As these vital centres suggest by their names, they control the functions mentioned. Temperature regulation is done by the hypothalamus.</p>
                        <p>The pons forms a bridge between the two cerebral hemispheres and other parts of the brain. The other part of the brain is the midbrain. It is involved in relaying ascending and descending nerve fibres.</p>
                        <p>The cerebrum is the largest area and its cortex has many furrows. One of the big furrows divides the cerebrum into right and left hemispheres. These are further divided into lobes, which are named according to the bones of the cranium under which they lie.</p>
                        <p>The lobes of the brain named after the cranial bones are the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. The cerebrum is associated with mental activity, for example, memory and intelligence, sensory, initiation and control of voluntary movement. This part of the brain (cerebrum) can further be subdivided into sections according to their specific function.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>The Spinal Cord</h5>
                        <p>The spinal cord is part of the central nervous system, which we have already discussed. It is the link between the brain and the rest of the body. The spinal cord is divided into two parts: the anterior median fissure and the posterior median septum.</p>
                        <p>The spinal cord is composed of grey matter at the centre and white matter on the outside. The grey matter has cells of the sensory nerves, the connector nerves and of the lower motor neurons.</p>
                        <p>White matter is arranged in tracts that may be sensory or motor. In the spinal cord, neurons transmit impulses to and from the peripheral. In the grey matter of the spinal cord, between the cells of the anterior and posterior horns, are small connector neurons which transmit an impulse straight from the skin to muscles. For example, when you touch a hot bowl of soup, a message is relayed to the spinal cord for you to withdraw your hand quickly. This is referred to as the reflex action.</p>

                        <p>The autonomic nervous system supplies the involuntary muscle tissue of the body. It controls the movements of the internal organs and the secretion of glands. The autonomic nerve cells are situated in the brain stem and spinal cord.</p>
                        <p>The parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system have opposing effects on the body. They both send weak impulses to the organs and glands maintaining normal activity. In stressful situations the sympathetic impulses become stronger and the organs and glands react to the situation. The parasympathetic nervous system will take over when the stressful situation has passed and the functions of the organs return to normal. Some of the activities controlled by this system include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The rate and force of the heart beat</li>

                        <h4>Increased Intracranial Pressure</h4>
                        <p>One of the most common consequences of traumatic and non-traumatic lesions in the brain is increased intracranial pressure. The brain is protected within a rigid bony structure, the cranium. The cranium encloses:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The brain</li>
                            <li>Cerebral blood vessels and blood</li>
                            <li>Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An increase in any of these three lead to an increase to the intracranial pressure. Increased ICP is a life threatening situation. When pressure increases, arterial supply is affected and the resultant hypoxia causes cerebral oedema which aggravates the problem.</p>
                        <p>Causes of increased intracranial pressure include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cerebral oedema</li>
                            <li>Hydrocephalus or obstruction of the flow of the CSF</li>
                            <li>Space occupying lesions e.g. haematoma, tumours, abscesses</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Increased intracranial pressure manifests with severe headaches, projectile vomiting and pupil oedema. The brainstem may be compressed, leading to loss of consciousness, respiratory arrest and even death. Raised intracranial pressure, by reflex, slows the heart rate because it also affects the cardiac centre. The heart rate and blood pressure should, therefore, be closely monitored.</p>

                        <p>The goal of management of a patient with increased intracranial pressure is to identify and treat the underlying cause and support brain function. Caring for the patient with increased intracranial pressure involves patient assessment through the use of the Glasgow Coma Scale as well as general treatment.</p>

                        <p>Assess for verbal response, pupilary response, reflexes, motor and sensory input. General management involves maintaining a neurological observation chart and administering osmotic diuretics such as IV mannitol.</p>
                        <p>You may use an indwelling catheter and maintain a strict input and output chart. Control of temperature and observation of vital signs are very important as well as preparation for surgery if the patient's condition deteriorates. Changes in vital signs are caused by increasing pressure on the thalamus, hypothalamus, pons and medulla. Other clinical manifestations include decrease in motor function and changes in the dilatation and reaction of the pupil of the eye.</p>

                        <h4>Traumatic Lesions of the Central Nervous System</h4>
                        <p>Injuries can affect the functioning of the central nervous system. Minor injuries can cause a little haemorrhage and inflammatory oedema. Major injuries can cause tears in the meninges and even death. Occasionally, bleeding can occur and form a subdural haematoma. This may manifest with the same signs and symptoms as raised intracranial pressure.</p>
                        <p>An extradural haemorrhage may occur if one of the main arteries in the brain is ruptured. This process may be accompanied by a fracture of the skull bones. The patient loses consciousness and as time passes, there is increased intracranial pressure, which may eventually result in a coma.</p>

                        <h4>Head Injuries</h4>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A head injury is any trauma to the scalp, skull or brain.</p>
                        <h5>Types of Head Injuries</h5>
                        <p>These include scalp lacerations, skull fractures and brain injuries. Brain injuries are categorised as being minor or major. Concussion is considered a minor brain injury. The patient may not lose total consciousness with this injury. Major brain injuries include contusions and lacerations.</p>
                        <p>Clinical features will depend on the type of injury present. Diagnostic procedures include x-rays, CT scan, MRI.</p>
                        <p>The patient who has a head injury requires immediate management at the casualty department and ongoing review and care afterwards. Immediately after receiving the patient, you must maintain an open airway, and ensure they have adequate breathing and circulation. This is because, as you have already learnt, cerebral hypoxia can lead to brain oedema and further damage the brain.</p>
                        <p>You must determine the baseline condition of the patient by assessing responsiveness, presence of headache, vomiting or double vision. You should also evaluate pupil size, blood pressure, pulse and respiration.</p>
                        <p>It is important to assess motion and strength of extremities and consider injuries to other organs. An accurate personal history and physical assessment are always paramount. You may start to administer anti-seizure medication and fluids depending on the assessment.</p>
                        <p>Later on, support of the airway, close observation, fluid and electrolyte balance correction and control of temperature are instituted. Medication to decrease cerebral oedema such as osmotic diuretics, for example, IV mannitol, anti-seizure medication, for instance, epanuitin should be administered. Patient support and restraint will also contribute to improvement of the patient.</p>
                        <p>Always remember that preventing complications is part of the care of your patients.</p>

                        <h4>The Unconscious Patient</h4>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Uconsciousness is an abnormal state in which the patient is unaware of self or environment. Unconsciousness is a manifestation of a large number of pathophysiologic processes including trauma, metabolic disturbances, mass lesions and infections.</p>
                        <p>The unconscious patient should be nursed in the semi-prone position. The airway should be opened by the use of an oral airway device or the insertion of an endo-tracheal tube. Oxygen should be administered and secretions minimised through suction. Assess the patient's level of consciousness and make a record of the same. Evaluate vital signs half hourly and maintain fluid and electrolyte balances strictly. You should manage restlessness and keep the patient clean, dry and free of pressure sores.</p>
                        <p>The extremities should be put through a range of motion exercises. This promotes blood supply to various parts. Catheterisation and regular turning are also part of care for the unconscious patient. You should catheterise the patient to avoid wetting, which predisposes them to pressure ulcers. It will also enable you to closely monitor the intake and output. Protection from seizures, complications (for example infection), aspiration, obstruction of the airway, and corneal irritation should all be part of the care plan.</p>

                        <h5>Stroke (Cerebrovascular Accident)</h5>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> This is a condition in which neurologic deficits occur as a result of decreased blood flow to a focal (localised) area of brain tissue.</p>
                        <h6>Causes</h6>
                        <p>Cerebrovascular accidents result when there is inadequate supply of blood to the brain (cerebral ischeamia) or cerebral hemorrhage within the brain.</p>
                        <h6>Types of stroke (CVA)</h6>
                        <p>There are three types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thrombotic</li>
                            <li>Embolic</li>
                            <li>Haemorrhagic</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The most common types of ischemic stroke are thrombotic and embolic. Haemorrhagic strokes are generally the result of spontaneous bleeding into the brain tissue itself or the subarachnoid space or ventricles.</p>
                        <p>The most common cause of haemorrhagic stroke is a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. This is a saccular outpouching of a cerebral artery that occurs at the site of weakness in the vessel wall. The weakness may be the result of atherosclerosis, a congenital defect, trauma to the head, aging or hypertension.</p>
                        <p>When cerebral haemorrhage occurs, patients loose consciousness, progressing to coma and even death. This condition is common in people aged over 50 years of age.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Manifestations</h6>
                        <p>The warning signs of stroke include temporary blindness in one eye, hemiplegia and defects in speech and confusion.</p>
                        <p>In haemorrhage, thrombosis and embolism within the brain, the manifestations depend on the area of the brain affected.</p>
                        <p>Normally, in the case of a severe stroke, consciousness is lost but is eventually regained. Speech may also be affected but later recovers. Loss of voluntary movement on the side of the body opposite to the side of the brain affected results in a condition referred to as hemiplegia.</p>

                        <h5>Management of Non-Traumatic Lesion and Cerebro-Vascular Accident</h5>
                        <p>Disorders affecting blood supply to the brain may lead to quick loss of brain function. You will now look at the care of patients who have cerebro-vascular accidents, including strokes, transient ischemic attacks and emboli.</p>
                        <p>In the acute phase of stroke, you must carry out an assessment, ensure adequate cerebral perfusion pressure and reorient the patient when they regain consciousness. The principles of nursing care for an unconscious patient will apply.</p>
                        <p>In the rehabilitative phase, the goals are to prevent deformities, retrain the affected limbs and help the patient gain independence in personal hygiene, and other activities of daily living. To do this, good positioning and physical therapy are necessary. Patient and family education are required to achieve the results quickly. The patient with cerebral haemorrhage requires bed rest, treatment of headache, antihypertensive drugs and reduction of cerebral oedema. They should also be prepared for surgery and rehabilitation afterwards just like the patient with head injuries.</p>

                        <h5>Management of a Patient Undergoing Intracranial Surgery</h5>
                        <p>Indications of intracranial surgery include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Brain tumour</li>
                            <li>Vascular abnormalities such as aneurysms</li>
                            <li>Cranio cerebral trauma</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Depending on the location of the pathologic condition a craniotomy may be done at the frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital or a combination of any of these.</p>
                        <p>Pre-operatively you should assist the patient while they are undergoing diagnostic tests. You can do this by answering questions from the patient and relatives.</p>
                        <p>Evaluate the patient's condition and prepare them for surgery by shaving the head, giving enema, administering pre-medication as ordered and informing the patient on what to expect after surgery. The patient may need to know about the various operations, drainage, what they can and cannot do and so on. Preoperative teaching is important in allaying the fears of the patient and the family and also in preparing them for post operative period.</p>
                        <p>One of the most common intracranial operations performed in Kenya is craniotomy to remove tumours, relieve pressure and evacuate blood clots.</p>
                        <p>Post-operatively, you must establish proper respiratory exchange, assess the patient's level of consciousness, evaluate for signs and symptoms of increasing intracranial pressure and control cerebral oedema. Steroids and osmotic diuretics will decrease cerebral oedema. Analgesics, changing the patient's position, an in-dwelling catheter and close observation are some of the measures that are put in place.</p>
                        <p>Always make sure you observe for drainage, which could be leaking cerebrospinal fluid, and for complications of intracranial haemorrhage such as post-operative meningitis, wound infections, pulmonary complications and posttraumatic epilepsy.</p>

                        <h4>Brain Tumours</h4>
                        <p>Tumours of the brain may be primary, arising from tissues within the brain or secondary, resulting from a metastasis from a malignant tumour elsewhere in the body.</p>
                        <p>The clinical features result from the local destructive effects of the tumour, the resulting accumulation of metabolites, displacement of the structures, the obstruction of CSF flow, effects of oedema and increased ICP on cerebral functions.</p>
                        <p>The management of the patient with a brain tumour involves total or partial removal of the tumour and decompression, radiation and chemotherapy. For surgery, the principles of care of a patient undergoing intracranial surgery will apply.</p>
                        <p>A patient on radiation requires steroids, close observation and education. Generally, principles applied in the care of patients with cancer will also apply. If a patient is on steroid therapy, they may be predisposed to infections. Always be observant for potential infection.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Two infections that affect the neurological system are meningitis and encephalitis.</p>
                        <p>Meningitis is an acute inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The infection may spread and cause suppuration in the brain. Infections can localise in the menengis resulting in Meningitis. They may also spread and cause suppuration in the brain. This could lead to a cerebral abscess. The mode of spread of infections is normally two-fold. The infecting micro-organisms may be blood borne, or they may get to the brain via local spread, that is, if there is communication with brain substance after trauma, therapeutic devices, for example, shunts or surgery. The local spread is a result of infection in the ear or fractures of the skull bones.</p>
                        <p>Encephalitis is the inflammation of the brain substance. It can be caused by trauma and infection. The infection is usually due to bacterial, viral and fungal micro-organisms. Patients with these infections will present with fever, severe headache, unconsciousness and convulsions. Stiffness of the neck, paralysis of cranial nerves and hemiplegia may also occur. Patients can go into coma and the risk of death is substantial.</p>
                        <p>The management of infections of the neurological system involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Investigations including lumbar puncture to examine the cerebrospinal fluid.</li>
                            <li>Use of intravenous anti bacterial drugs for meningococcal meningitis (or the most effective drug or those specific to the infective organisms).</li>
                            <li>Anti viral medications for aseptic meningitis, for instance, Zovirax.</li>
                            <li>Anti fungal medication for cryptococcal meningitis.</li>
                            <li>Anti pyretic and analgesic medications are necessary.</li>
                            <li>Anti convulsant drugs may be prescribed to prevent or control seizure activity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nursing management includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assessment of the vital signs and neurological evaluations two to four hourly.</li>
                            <li>The patient should be assisted to a position of comfort.</li>
                            <li>Fluid and electrolyte status is maintained through intravenous fluid placement until the patient is able to resume oral intake.</li>
                            <li>Supportive care is necessary to prevent complications related to prolonged bed rest. Activity should be gradually increased as tolerated, but adequate bed rest and sleep should be encouraged.</li>
                            <li>In most cases, meningitis does not require isolation with the EXCEPTION of meningococcal meningitis.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Demyelinating Disorder, Metabolic Disorders and Vitamin Deficiencies</h4>
                        <p>From our study of the normal structure of the nervous system, can you remember the myelin sheath? This is the covering of the nerve axon. When it is damaged, the conduction of nerve impulses is impaired. Certain disorders can result in impaired formation of the myelin sheath or damage to it (demyelination). One such disorder is multiple sclerosis. Its cause is not well understood. Another cause of demyelination is encephalitis.</p>
                        <p>Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurological disease characterised by multiple patchy demyelination of white matter in the central nervous system. Multiple sclerosis is chronic and manifests with impaired vision, paralysis, bladder dysfunction and emotional instability.</p>
                        <p>These manifestations can occur as acute episodes interspersed with recovery periods. This type of disorder requires patients to receive support and understanding from you, the nurse, and their families as part of the management. Considering the impaired vision and mobility, the environment should be structured in such a way that accidents are avoided.</p>
                        <p>Medical management will include drugs to control spasticity such as diazepam in combination with physiotherapy. For fatigue, patients may be treated with drugs such as Amantadine. Steroids may be administered for optic neuritis. Anti depressants and counselling is important where patient presents with psychological disturbances.</p>
                        <p>Vitamin deficiencies sometimes result in serious consequences to the nervous system. The most common deficiencies affecting the nervous system are vitamin B1 and B12 deficiencies. Vitamin B1 deficiency causes unsteadiness, double vision, and mental impairment. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes degeneration of the spinal cord. The deficiencies can occur because of alcoholism, deficiencies in the diet or malabsorption.</p>
                        <p>Metabolic disorders in the brain could result from hepatic encephalopathy, alcoholism and hypoglycemia. Poisoning of the brain substance can occur as result of direct toxins in substances consumed, drugs or as a result of toxins liberated through the metabolic process in the body, e.g. bilirubin.</p>
                        <h5>Care of the Adult with Multiple Sclerosis, Vitamin Deficiencies and Metabolic Disorders</h5>
                        <p>All patients initially require a thorough assessment. This provides the data for planning and eventually for evaluation. The main goal of care is to ensure the patient with multiple sclerosis should be treated for muscle spasticity through exercises, avoidance of muscle fatigue, prevention of muscle contractures, walking and the use of braces and crutches.</p>
                        <p>You should also avoid skin pressure and immobility. This decreases the possibility of pressure ulcers. Position change, avoidance of trauma, and giving careful attention to pressure areas are very important.</p>
                        <p>Assist the patient to overcome inability to coordinate by regularly practising walking techniques and support. If they have bladder dysfunction, catheterise and maintain adequate fluid intake. Bowel training for bowel incontinence is a good practice. For optic and speech problems, adequate attention should be given to training and use of assistive devices. Most importantly, attention to activities of daily living and patient education can help patients lead better quality lives. Vitamin deficiencies and degenerative disorders of the nerves that result in nerve damage will also require the same care as is given to the patient with multiple sclerosis.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Degenerative Disorders</h4>
                        <p>All patients with degenerative diseases require a structured and predictable environment. This means that you should give education to their caretakers to organise their environment in such a way that home accidents are prevented. They should always have somebody present to help them and should be oriented to their surroundings regularly.</p>
                        <p>Two degenerative disorders are Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's Chorea.</p>
                        <p>Degeneration of the neurons occurs in certain individuals due to certain disorders. In Alzheimer's disease there is dementia, that is, degeneration of intellectual ability, loss of short-term memory and loss of physical ability. The cause of Alzheimer's disease is not known.</p>
                        <p>Senile dementia affects elderly individuals and also results in the degeneration of intellectual ability. In Huntington's chorea, patients manifest with unusual grimacing and uncontrolled jerking movements, which we call chorea. This particular condition is inherited as a dominant trait.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Herniation of the Intervertebral Disc and Laminectomy</h4>
                        <p>Herniation refers to squeezing of the disc between two vertebral bodies. It is normally a very painful process and patients should be managed appropriately. The treatment of the herniated disc involves immobilisation to allow for healing of soft tissues and reduction of inflammation. Immobilisation involves the use of traction, bed rest, collars and braces.</p>
                        <p>Muscle relaxants, anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics are also generally used. Additionally, a moist heat compress will help the patient. The patient with lumbar disc herniation requires bed rest, anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs, heat treatment and sometimes surgery. Patient education should be included to ensure the patient co-operates with treatment procedures.</p>
                        <h5>Laminectomy</h5>
                        <p>Laminectomy is the removal of the lamina to expose the spinal cord. It is recommended for the prevention of irreversible neurological damage, for progressive disease with muscular weakness and for recurring episodes of pain. Pre operative management includes teaching the patient to practice log rolling to ensure the spinal column remains in alignment when turning until healing has occurred. Explain the importance of taking analgesics regularly, deep breathing and leg exercises.</p>
                        <p>Post-operatively, the patient requires bed rest, use of a pillow under the head and knee flexion to relax back muscles. Assess movement and sensation of extremities for signs of nerve compression. Change of position through logrolling, use of pillows between legs when turning and avoidance of extreme flexion must be part of the care. Assess for haematoma and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, and for urinary retention. The patient should void within eight hours after surgery.</p>
                        <p>You should give drugs to reduce inflammation, relieve pain and anxiety and decrease the possibility of infection. The patient should also be given education on self care and should be closely observed for complications.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Epilepsy</h4>
                        <p>The term refers to two or more unprovoked seizures in one year. The seizures are sudden and uncoordinated. Epilepsy is normally a manifestation of underlying disorders. If they are linked to a particular part of the brain, then they are called focal or partial epilepsy. However, if they cause unconsciousness and general brain dysfunction, they are called generalised epilepsy.</p>
                        <p>The manifestations of focal epilepsy are hallucinations of taste, smell or hearing. Jacksonian epilepsy affects motor functions, leading to twitching of particular areas. Generalised epilepsy can either be petit mal seizures or grand mal seizures.</p>
                        <h5>Grand Mal Seizures</h5>
                        <p>In grand mal epilepsy, the patient may be aware that the seizure is imminent. This is followed by an aura phase after which there is a generalised tonic contraction. The third phase is the clonic phase where muscles have jerky movements. The tonic and clonic phases are collectively referred to as the ictal phase. Finally the patient enters the phase of relaxation and moves from coma to sleep. This is the post-ictal phase.</p>
                        <h5>Petit Mal Seizures</h5>
                        <p>Petit mal seizures are characterised by a phase of transient loss of consciousness. Perhaps you have seen patients who stare expressionlessly for some time before they continue with their function without being aware. This is a characteristic of petit mal seizures.</p>
                        <p>Primary epilepsy has no known cause. Some of the causes of secondary epilepsy are cerebral scarring due to head injury, cerebral vascular accidents, infections, degenerative CNS diseases and childhood febrile illnesses. It is important to bear this in mind so that you control febrile illness well and avoid head injury in neonates during obstetric care.</p>
                        <p>Seizures that occur spontaneously in succession are called status epilepticus. These normally occur without recovery. This condition is considered a major medical emergency. Vigorous muscular contractions impose a heavy metabolic demand and can interfere with respirations. At the height of each seizure, some respiratory arrest occurs which produces venous congestion and hypoxia of the brain. Repeated episodes may lead to irreversible and fatal brain damage.</p>
                        <p>Factors that precipitate status epilepticus include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Withdrawal of anti epileptic drugs</li>
                            <li>Fever and infection</li>
                            <li>Cerebral oedema</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Management of status epilepticus includes positioning the patient to lie on the lateral position to prevent inhalation of secretions from the mouth. Give IV (not IM) diazepam 10-30 mg STAT slowly over three minutes, repeat if there is no response. If no response put 80 mg in 500 mls of normal saline, adjust rate to control seizures.</p>
                        <p>Other useful drugs include phenobarbitone sodium - IM 125 mg to 250 mg , phenytoin sodium (Epanutin) 100 mg tds. Treat hyperpyrexia by temperature reducing measures. Give care as for the unconscious patient. Oral anti convulsants are given as soon as the patient gains consciousness.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Care of the Adult Patient with Epilepsy</h5>
                        <p>You have studied epilepsy and its various forms. After a careful assessment of the patient with epilepsy, you should concentrate on meeting the following objectives as part of the management of the disorder:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Determine and treat (if possible) the primary underlying cause</li>
                            <li>Prevent recurrence</li>
                            <li>Manage the seizure and prevent injury</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>During a seizure period, closely observe the patient and support the patient by giving privacy and ensuring an adequate airway. Do not attempt to place anything in the mouth and always protect the head from injury, for example by placing a folded blanket under the head. After the convulsions have passed, reorient the patient to the environment.</p>
                        <p>Generally, medications such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbitone are useful anti-seizure drugs. Other drugs may be given for tranquilisation. Patient education on a safe environment and coping with stress is also required. If there are underlying causes, these should be treated, for example, in the case of a tumour, surgical excision is recommended.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Parkinson's Disease</h4>
                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> This is a progressive neuromuscular disease involving degenerative changes and dysfunction of the basal ganglia. It is a disorder of movement and posture.</p>
                        <p>Patients have deficient amounts of naturally occurring dopamine which is required for normal functioning of the basal ganglia in the brain.</p>
                        <p>The cause is unknown but it is associated with viral infections such as viral encephalitis or meningitis, cerebral vascular disease, toxicity or poisoning.</p>
                        <p>The clinical features are initially non specific aches and pains but the key features are tremors, rigidity and slowness of movement (Bradykinesia). Other features include slow eye movements, depression, postural hypotension.</p>
                        <p>Patients with parkinsonism are susceptible to respiratory complications because of muscle rigidity which prevents excursion and ability to cough. There is disturbance of autonomic nervous system. Patient's appearance deteriorates as they cannot attend to activities of daily living.</p>
                        <p>Patients with Parkinson's disease require medication such as Levadopa 0.25-0.5 mg daily. This relieves symptoms of tremor and rigidity.</p>
                        <p>The aim of nursing care is to maintain muscular and joint function so that the patient can be as independent as possible. Blood pressure monitoring to detect postural hypotension and teach the patient to avoid rapid postural changes. Moderate exercises to improve muscle tone which reduces stooping and shuffling movements. Patient should be instructed to walk slowly and carefully. Provide adequate rest to prevent fatigue.</p>
                        <p>General nursing care includes assisting the patient to feed slowly, prevent constipation and provide psychological support to counteract depression, discouragement and hopelessness. Speech therapy should be done to correct dysarthia. Involve patient in own care.</p>

                    <h3 id="eyes-ears-heading" class="section-heading">The Eyes and Ears</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Under the special senses, you should consider the vision, hearing, smelling and taste. However, you shall only learn about the diseases of the eye and ear and how to manage them.</p>
                        <h4>The Eye</h4>
                        <p>This is the organ of sight, which lies protected in the orbit of the skull. The other protective structures of the eye are eyelids, brows and eyelashes. The eye blinks by a reflex that serves as further protection. Eyes function as a pair. Anteriorly, a transparent mucus membrane called the conjunctiva covers the eye. The eye surface is kept moist by tears produced by lacrimal glands.</p>
                        <p>The eye has three layers. These are the sclera and cornea on the outside, the choroids, cilliary body and iris in the middle, and the retina is the inner most part of the eye. Anteriorly the cornea allows light rays to pass through. Since the lens is convex, it refracts or bends light rays to focus on the innermost part of the eye, the retina. Light rays are absorbed by the choroid to stimulate nerve endings.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-140-1.jpg" alt="A diagram of the human eye showing its external protective structures like the eyelid, eyelashes, and lacrimal gland." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>The cranial nerve that supplies the eye is the optic. The cilliary body is the point of attachment for muscles and ligaments whose contraction changes the thickness of the lens. The iris lies behind the cornea and is circular and forms an opening at its centre called the pupil. This varies in size depending on light intensity. The lens lies behind the pupil.</p>
                        <p>The innermost part, the retina, has cells involved in changing light rays into nerve impulses. Behind and in front of the cornea and lens is a clear fluid called aqueous fluid (humor) and vitrous humor respectively. The vitrous humor is colloidal. The aqueous and vitrous humor maintain intraocular pressure.</p>
                        <p>The nerve that supplies the eyes is the optic nerve. Light is focused onto the retina in both eyes and is bent by the lens. The pupils change size to allow the appropriate amount of light to enter the eye. The eyeballs also move to change the visual field. Once light is changed into nerve impulses, the brain can interpret and form a visual image.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Basic Assessment of the Eye and Vision</h4>
                        <p>This consists of a careful patient interview and physical assessment of the eye structures. The patient will normally have complaints e.g blurred vision, itchy eyes, discharge that must be examined. A basic assessment of the eye includes observing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eyelids and conjunctiva e.g for oedema</li>
                            <li>Corner e.g for clarity</li>
                            <li>Sclera e.g for colour</li>
                            <li>Iris and pupil e.g colour shape size</li>
                            <li>Lens - transparent or opaque</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Visual acquity means acuteness or sharpness of vision and includes measurement of distance and near vision.</p>
                        <p>A Snellen's chart is used to measure acuteness of vision. It consists of printed letters or words in various sizes.</p>
                        <p>The inspection of the internal structures is done by use of an ophthalmoscope. This allows the examiner to view the back of the eye through the pupil to see the optic nerve, retina, blood vessels and macula.</p>

                        <h4>Disorders of the Eye</h4>
                        <h5>Blepharitis</h5>
                        <p>Blepharitis is one of the most common disorders of the eye. It is an inflammation of the eyelids, characterised by irritation, burning, redness and itching of the eyelid margins. The assessment of a patient with blepharitis must gather all the information related to any recent trauma, possible exposure to allergic substances and infection. In our country, blepharitis is commonly associated with trachoma. During management you should consider the various causes. The drugs commonly used include tetracycline eye ointment, gentamycin and kanamycin eye drops. Any allergens should be eliminated from the patient's environment.</p>
                        <h5>Eye Infections and Inflammations</h5>
                        <p><strong>(a) Hordeolum/Stye:</strong> An infection of small glands of lid margins.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Causative organism:</strong> Staplylococcus aureours.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clinical features:</strong> Tender swollen pustule on eyelid, it eventually ruptures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Management:</strong> Apply warm compresses three to four times a day to facilitate ripening and drainage. This can be done by hot spoon bathing. Tetracycline eye ointment can be applied three times a day in severe cases after cleaning the lid margin. Incision and drainage should be done if it does not resolve.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>b) Chalazion:</strong> A Sterile cyst located in the connective tissue in the eyelid.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Clinical Features:</strong> Small lump, hard and non-tender but may put pressure on the eye and affect vision.</li>
                            <li><strong>Management:</strong> May resolve on its own otherwise incision and drainage is done if it does not resolve. Cleaning of eyes facilitates healing without further complications.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Uveitis</h5>
                        <p><strong>Uveitis:</strong> Acute inflammation of the uvea (i.e choroid)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Infection, allergy, toxic agents or systemic disorders e.g. diabetes</li>
                            <li><strong>Clinical Features:</strong> General eye pain around the eyeball. Swelling photophobia, visual impairment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <p>Treat the underlying cause. DO NOT ADMINISTER ANTIBIOTIC WITH STEROIDS this may mask the inflammation and cause further damage to the eye structures. Refer to an ophthalmologist for assessment and further care.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Corneal Ulceration and Corneal Detachment</h5>
                        <p>Ulceration of the cornea may be caused by trauma or cataract surgery. If a patient receives blunt trauma to the eye, the retina may separate from the choroid and vitreous humor seeps behind the eye. This will cause retinal detachment.</p>
                        <p>Clinically, the patient presents with flashes of light, they may see floating images (floaters) and there is a sensation of veiled sight. On examination, the patient may have loss of vision. Keratitis is the inflammation of the cornea that may be caused by infection, hypersensitivity, and trauma. The management will follow the same pattern as ulceration. Most importantly, the cause of the problem must be removed.</p>
                        <h6>Corneal Ulcer</h6>
                        <p>A patient who has a corneal ulcer requires examination, systemic antibiotics, warm compresses for comfort and padding of the eye. For the patient with retinal detachment, bed rest is always recommended to promote healing and tranquilisers may be administered to reduce anxiety. Surgery may be undertaken in specialised centres.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Ptosis</h5>
                        <p>Weakness of the muscle that elevates the eyelid causes ptosis. This is characterised by the drooping of the upper lid. This drooping makes it difficult to see. The commonest causes of ptosis is drugs, trauma and muscle weakness. The etiologic factor should be removed to promote vision.</p>
                        <h5>Conjunctivitis</h5>
                        <p>This is the inflammation of the conjunctiva. Infections, allergens, chemical agents or physical irritants commonly cause it. The signs and symptoms of conjunctivitis include redness, a burning sensation in the eye and tearing. Patients have a gritty sensation in the eye, and there may be itching and discharge. Bacteria, viruses and other agents may also cause conjunctivitis. The treatment includes antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesic drugs. One of the common drugs that you are likely to use is tetracycline eye ointment.</p>
                        <h5>Trachoma</h5>
                        <p>Trachoma is one of the most widespread eye problems in the drier regions of our country. It is caused by the agent chlamydia trachomatis. Flies normally transfer the micro-organisms from person to person. It is a common cause of blindness in Kenya. The micro-organisms will affect the conjunctiva leading to conjunctivitis. As the inflammation proceeds, the eyelids get turned inwards causing scratching and scarring. Finally, this may end up in blindness. This is a preventable cause of blindness. The main factors to concentrate on in prevention are good personal hygiene, avoiding the sharing of handkerchiefs, and getting rid of flies. The treatment of trachoma involves use of antibiotics and the commonest one is tetracycline.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Cataract</h5>
                        <p><strong>Cataract:</strong> is the opacity of the lens.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Cataracts may be associated with aging, trauma, congenital or secondary to other medical conditions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>Cataracts associated with aging may result from a decrease in protein, accumulation of water and an increase in sodium content that disrupts the normal fibres of the lens. This leads to opacification of the lens.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <p>The primary symptom of cataracts is a progressive loss of vision. The degree of loss depends on the location and extent of opacity, it can manifest with:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gradual painless blurring and loss of vision</li>
                            <li>Glare at night and in bright light</li>
                            <li>Haloes around lights</li>
                            <li>Cloudy white opacity on the pupil</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Diagnosis</h6>
                        <p>This is done by direct inspection of lens with an ophthalmoscope after pupil dilation.</p>
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <p>Surgery is the treatment of choice under local anaesthesia, the lens is extracted. An intraocular lens implant may be inserted.</p>
                        <h6>Pre-operative Management</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Informed consent is signed by the patient</li>
                            <li>Health messages on the expected post-operative restrictions are given e.g. avoid bending over or rubbing eyes to avoid dislodging of implant</li>
                            <li>Treat patient for any coughing or sneezing to avoid complications</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Post-operative Care</h6>
                        <p>Immediately after surgery:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Position patient to lie on back or on the side of the unoperated eye to prevent strawling by patient</li>
                            <li>Keep eye padded for rest</li>
                            <li>Clean aseptically before instilling eye ointment</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Complications</h6>
                        <p>These include infection, bleeding and elevated IOP. The patient is instructed to promptly report when they notice signs of complications.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Glaucoma</h5>
                        <p><strong>Glaucoma:</strong> is an eye disease characterised by progressive nerve atrophy and loss of vision.</p>
                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>The normal range of aqueous humor pressures in the eye ranges from 10 to 21 mmhg . In a normal eye there is a balance between the production and drainage of acqueous humor that allows the intraocular pressure to remain relatively constant. An increased intraocular pressure results from a blockage in the outflow. When this blockage persists, the optic nerve is damaged with loss of vision. In primary open-angle glaucoma, the changes occur slowly. The process can also occur more rapidly in response to injury infection or as a complication of surgery.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <p><strong>1) Open Angle Glaucoma</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intraocular pressure of >24 mmHg</li>
                            <li>Slow loss of vision, peripheral vision lost before central vision</li>
                            <li>Persistent dull pain in eyes</li>
                            <li>Difficulty adjusting to darkness</li>
                            <li>Failure to detect color changes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>2) Angle Closure Glaucoma</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In its acute form, it presents with severe ocular pain, decreased vision, pupil enlarged and fixed eye red, steamy cornea</li>
                            <li>It may cause nausea and vomiting</li>
                            <li>Intraocular pressure may exceed 50 mmHg</li>
                            <li>Permanent blindness can occur if there is marked increase in pressure for 24-48 hours</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>3) Congenital Glaucoma</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enlargement of eye, lacrimation, photophobia, blepharospasm</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Diagnosis</h6>
                        <p>Tests include: Tonometry: measurement of intraocular pressure, Ophthalmoscopy to evaluation of colour and shape of optic cup.</p>
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <p>This is first medical (conservative). Surgical intervention is indicated where conservative management fails.</p>
                        <h6>Conservative Management</h6>
                        <p>Drugs are used to lower the intraocular pressure and prevent loss of vision. Drug therapy does this by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increasing outflow of aqueous humor</li>
                            <li>Decreasing product of aqueous humor</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Drugs of choice include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Miotics constrict pupil e.g pilocarpine</li>
                            <li>Cholinesterase inhibitors to constrict ciliary muscle e.g eserine</li>
                            <li>Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to decrease aqueous humor production e.g. diamox</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Surgical Management</h6>
                        <p>Trabeculectomy is the common procedure performed. This creates an opening in the trabecular meshwork to allow for draining. The specific management includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Observations post anaesthesia</li>
                            <li>Protection of operative eye with patal or shield</li>
                            <li>Maintaining comfort in the eye by drug instillation</li>
                            <li>Regular assessment of intraocular pressure</li>
                            <li>Administration of medications in combination to protect the eye from infections and inflammation i.e. antibiotics and steroid</li>
                            <li>Patients to avoid lifting heavy objects and any straining e.g. at defecation to avoid prolapse of eye contents</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Colour Blindness</h5>
                        <p>At this point it is important also to make a note about the condition known as colour blindness. In this disorder individuals confuse, mismatch or have reduced acuity for colour discrimination. Mostly, this is a genetic problem.</p>
                        <h5>General Care of Eye Injury</h5>
                        <p>Eye injuries are a common occurrence in our environment. The types of injuries include lacerations to eyelids, corneal injuries, foreign bodies on cornea or in penetrating injuries, splashes to the eye. Preventive measures are more important in this case, but for the patient who already has an injury to the eye, you must undertake the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If there is any penetrating object, leave it in situ, cover the eye lightly with a sterile dressing and refer immediately.</li>
                            <li>In the case of splashes to the eye, irrigate the eye with saline solution for 15 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Prepare for examination of the eye and assist in determination of the extent of the injury.</li>
                            <li>Advise the patient on care and followup. Patients with severe injuries may have their eyes padded and should be advised to take good care of the eye to minimise infection and to seek medical care as soon as possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For the patient having eye surgery you must assist in the immediate pre-operative management by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preparing for general anaesthesia, for example, evacuation of bowel.</li>
                            <li>Removal of dentures.</li>
                            <li>Trimming eyelashes.</li>
                            <li>Instructing the patient regarding postoperative restrictions such as no showers or shampoos, no lifting and no sleeping on operated side until healing has taken place. They should also avoid sneezing and breathing through their noses as this increases intra-occular pressure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the post-operative period, the patients require good positioning, preferably, the dorsal recumbent position, with the use of lateral pillows. The patient also requires education on what to report, for example, severe pain, bleeding and how to communicate if they cannot see. Analgesics and other drugs may also be prescribed.</p>

                        <h4>The Ear</h4>
                        <p>The ear is the organ of hearing, and comprises the external ear, a middle ear and an inner ear. The external part of the ear has the auricle, which is externally visible. The auricle concentrates sound into the ear canal. The external auditory meatus ends at the eardrum, also called the tympanic membrane.</p>
                        <p>After this membrane is the middle ear, which has structures made up of three tiny bones: the tapes, the incus and malleus. By vibration, the three bones transmit sound waves to the inner ear. The three bones are called ossicles.</p>
                        <p>A coclear, which is the real organ of hearing, and semicircular canals that are involved in balance, is found in the inner ear.</p>
                        <p>Once the auricle has concentrated sound waves, they vibrate the tympanic membrane, which causes movement of the three tiny bones. The moving sound waves cause movement of fluid in the cochlear and specialised cells pick these waves to produce nerve impulses. These specialised cells are in the of Corti.</p>
                        <p>The brain interprets the impulses from the semi-circular canals. The three semi-circular canals are at right angles to each other. They, therefore, represent the three planes of position.</p>
                        <p>The nerve that supplies the ears is the vestibulo-cochlear nerve, which has a vestibular branch for balance and cochlear branch for hearing. The external auditory meatus produces wax or cerumen that protects the ear.</p>
                        <h5>Disorders of the Ears</h5>
                        <p>The diseases that affect the ears can be classified into those affecting the external ear, the middle ear and the inner ear.</p>
                        <h6>External Ear</h6>
                        <p>Tumours, foreign bodies or simple inflammation are the conditions that commonly afflict the external ear. Inflammation of the external auditory meatus is called external otitis. It is caused by irritation by various substances, for example objects placed in the ear. Ear wax produced from the ear canal may cause obstruction. The external ear may also suffer from tumours, which can be benign or malignant. General ear care can help prevent obstruction and inflammation. Tumours are normally excised if they cause hearing loss.</p>
                        <p>External Otitis can be bacterial or fungal or due to an allergic reaction e.g. from soaps, hairsprays. The patient experiences pain on touching or moving the auricle. Some people are prone to infection from swimming in contaminated water and this is referred to as 'Swimmers ear'. Furuncles also occur and these are mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Incision and drainage of the furuncle is rarely done and this is best managed by administration of antibiotics and application of hot packs. This usually results in resolution of the furuncle.</p>
                        <p>Cerumen in the ear canal may occasionally be impacted causing ear ache and hearing difficulties. These wax deposits may be softened using warm glycerine drops. When cerumen becomes difficult to dislodge, it can be removed with a cerumen spoon under magnification.</p>
                        <p>In some instances, foreign bodies are inserted accidentally into the ear canal. Insects can easily be removed by instillation of oil drops as the oil allows the insects to float and be flushed out. For foreign bodies of vegetable origin, irrigation with any fluid is contraindicated as they have a tendency to swell making removal difficult. Removal of foreign bodies should be by a skilled person as the object may be pushed even deeper, lacerating the skin of the canal and perforating the ear drum.</p>
                        <h6>The Middle Ear</h6>
                        <p>The middle ear is a cavity, which has the eardrum and the auditory ossicles. In the middle ear, we can have otitis media, caused by micro-organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, and inflammation caused by the insertion of foreign objects. This condition may be complicated or caused by a simple common cold.</p>
                        <p><strong>Problems of the Middle Ear</strong></p>
                        <p>Perforation of the tympanic membrane can result from accidents involving the skull. Traumatic damage may be from blast effects of explosives. Infection such as acute and chronic suppurative otitis media can also cause perforation. Other causes include foreign bodies, burns of the face that extend to the ear and accidental or deliberate blows to the face.</p>
                        <p><strong>Otitis Media</strong></p>
                        <p>Acute Otitis media is an inflammation of the middle ear as a result of entrance of pathogenic bacteria into the normally sterile middle ear. The mode of entry of the micro organisms is via the auditory canal from the respiratory tract. Bacteria that commonly cause this condition include streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus and Haemophilus Influenzae. Occasionally, infection also spreads from the external ear if the tympanic membrane is perforated. Infection usually leads to accumulation of pus in the middle ear and outward bulging of the tympanic membrane. When the membrane ruptures, there is purulent discharge from the ear (otorrhoea).</p>
                        <p>Chronic otitis media results from repeated attacks of otitis media causing persistent perforation of the ear drum. Bacterial resistance to antibiotic therapy and virulence of the infecting organisms are causative factors. Chronic otitis media presents with persistent or intermittent foul smelling discharge. Pain may be present with varying degrees of deafness.</p>
                        <p>Complications associated with otitis media include mastoiditis, brain abscess and seventh cranial nerve paralysis.</p>
                        <p>The treatment of otitis varies according to the organisms and severity. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs are given for the pathogens, as well as for pain and inflammation. Myringotomy, which is an incision into the posterior aspect of the tympanic membrane, is made surgically for drainage purposes. Your role here is to observe the drainage and assess hearing. In chronic otitis media and inflammation of the mastoid process (mastoiditis), antibiotics and surgery are the choice interventions. The surgical operations performed are simple mastoidectomy or radical mastoidectomy, which involve complete or partial removal of the mastoid bone.</p>
                        <h6>Inner Ear</h6>
                        <p>The inner ear also suffers otitis interna, labyrinthitis and sensorineural hearing loss. Patients who have disorders of the inner ear are likely to have vertigo (giddiness), tinnitus (buzzing in the ears) and unilateral deafness. The infections of the external ear may spread to the inner ear so they should be immediately treated.</p>
                        <p><strong>Motion Sickness</strong></p>
                        <p>This is disturbance of equilibrium caused by constant motion. There is excessive stimulation of the semicircular canal and vestibular apparatus resulting in dizziness, nausea and vomiting.</p>
                        <p><strong>Meniere's Disease</strong></p>
                        <p>This is an inner ear problem where there is labyrinthine dysfunction. It is characterised by the presence of a triad of symptoms which include paroxysmal whirling vertigo, tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss.</p>
                        <h6>Hearing Loss</h6>
                        <p>This is classified as either conductive or sensorineural. Conductive hearing loss results from impairment of the outer ear, middle ear or both. There is impaired transmission of sound waves from outside to the oval window. Causes of conductive hearing loss include presence of wax or foreign bodies in the ear canal, otitis media, barotraumas, otosclerosis and injury to the tympanic membrane.</p>
                        <p>Sensorineural hearing occurs where sensitivity to and discrimination of sound is impaired. Sounds may be conducted properly through the external and middle ear but are not analyzed correctly in the inner ear. This can result from disease of the cochlea, the cochlear branch of the vestibular nerve or the hearing area of the brain.</p>
                        <p>The nursing care of a patient following ear surgery involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inspecting for drainage and observing vital functions</li>
                            <li>Changing of dressings</li>
                            <li>Providing post-operative pain relief</li>
                            <li>Educating the patient to sneeze and cough with an open mouth</li>
                            <li>Advising patients to avoid flying, swimming and any activities that may jeopardise the healing process</li>
                            <li>Providing antibiotics</li>
                            <li>Observing patients for complications such as vertigo and hearing loss</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The patient with hearing loss should also be taught methods of communication that do not involve the use of sound, for example, lip reading.</p>
                        <h5>Other Senses</h5>
                        <p>The other senses, which you will briefly cover, are smell experienced by the nose, taste experienced by the tongue, and touch experienced by the skin. To be able to smell, chemical particles from substances get into the nose and epithelia cells on the upper part of the nose, where olfaction or smelling is carried out. The olfactory nerve is a cranial nerve involved in enabling the sense of smell. Taste is facilitated by the taste buds found on the tongue. The tongue can distinguish sweet, sour, bitter, salty and other tastes. A part of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve supplies the tongue with its sensory ability.</p>

                        <p>The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus act as a unit. The hypothalamus has a direct controlling effect on the pituitary gland and an indirect effect on many others.</p>
                        <p>The pituitary gland has three parts: the anterior lobe, posterior lobe and intermediate lobe. The term neurohypophysis refers to the posterior lobe, while adenohypophysis refers to the anterior lobe.</p>

                        <h5>The Posterior Lobe</h5>
                        <p>The posterior lobe of the pituitary secretes two hormones: antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin. The antidiuretic hormone increases permeability to water of the distal renal tubules. It also stimulates the contraction of the smooth muscles in blood vessels hence raising blood pressure. Oxytocin causes contraction of the uterus and cells in the lactating breast.</p>
                        <h5>The Anterior Lobe</h5>
                        <p>The Anterior Lobe produces several hormones. The growth hormone promotes fat metabolism while promoting fat mobilisation and catabolism. The thyroid stimulating hormone stimulates the synthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones. The adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulates the growth of the adrenal cortex and secretion of glucorcorticoids, for example, cortisol.</p>
                        <p>Follicle stimulating hormones cause the growth of the Graafian follicle and spermatogenesis. They also facilitate the secretion of oestrogen. Luteinising hormones are required for ovulation. They also stimulate the corpus luteum to secrete progesterone. Prolactin promotes breast development, stimulates progesterone secretion and promotes breast development during delivery.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Thyroid Gland</h4>
                        <p>The thyroid gland is situated in the neck in front of the larynx and trachea. It consists of two lobes one on either side of the thyroid cartilage. It's regulated by thyroid stimulating hormone from the anterior lobe.</p>
                        <h5>Functions</h5>
                        <p>The thyroid gland produces tetra-iodothyronine (thyroxine),triiodothyronine and calcitonin hormones. The first two hormones may enhance the affects of other hormones (adrenaline and noradrenaline),are essentials for physical growth and mental development and helps in regulating the metabolic rate of all body cells. Calcitonin controls calcium content of the blood by increasing bone formation and inhibiting bone breakdown and this results in decreased blood calcium levels.</p>

                        <p>There are four small parathyroid glands, two embedded in the posterior surface of each lobe of the thyroid gland.</p>
                        <h5>Functions</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Secretes the hormone parathormone which is an antagonist to calcitonin.</li>
                            <li>It increases the release of calcium and phosphate into the blood by causing less new bone to be formed and more old bone to be broken down. This helps in maintaining blood calcium within normal limits (9-11 mg/dl or 2.25-2.74 mmol/L).</li>

                        <h4>The Adrenal Glands</h4>
                        <p>The adrenal glands are located on the upper side of each kidney. Each adrenal gland has a cortex and medulla. The cortex produces glucocorticoids, mineralcorticoids and sex hormones.</p>
                        <h5>Adrenal Medulla</h5>
                        <p>The adrenal medulla produces the two catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine. These perform the functions of stimulating the breakdown of glycogen by skeletal muscle, increasing blood concentration of free fatty acids, constricting most blood vessels in the body and constriction of bronchial smooth muscle.</p>
                        <h5>Adrenal Cortex</h5>
                        <p>The cortex produces glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids and sex hormones. These are steroids and are known as corticosteroids.</p>
                        <h6>Glucocorticoids</h6>
                        <p>The main glucocorticoids are cortisol and corticosterone. They perform the following main functions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Regulating carbohydrate metabolism</li>
                            <li>Promoting utilisation of glycogen</li>
                            <li>Raising blood glucose level through gluconeogenesis</li>
                            <li>Promoting water and sodium re-absorption from the renal tubules</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Mineralcorticoids</h6>
                        <p>The main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone its functions are associated with the maintenance of the electrolyte balance in the body. It increases sodium reabsorption in the kidneys while increasing potassium excreted. The amount of aldosterone produced is influenced by the sodium level in the blood and the renin angiotensin mechanism.</p>
                        <h6>Sex Hormones</h6>
                        <p>In men, androgens are associated with deposition of proteins in muscles and retention of nitrogens.</p>

                        <h4>The Pancreas</h4>
                        <p>The Pancreas is an elongated gland with the head lying in the C shaped beginning of the small intestine (duodenum), with its body extending horizontally behind the stomach and its tail touching the spleen. This gland is located behind the stomach in the abdominal cavity. It has both exocrine and endocrine properties. The Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas produce insulin, glucagon and somatostatin hormones.</p>
                        <p>Insulin produced by beta cells (B cells) promotes cellular uptake of glucose, stimulates intracellular synthesis of glycogen, fat and proteins, and stimulates uptake of sodium and potassium.</p>
                        <p>Glucagon produced by delta cells (D cells), on the other hand, antagonises insulin in the liver (breakdown of glycogen), inhibits protein synthesis and induces hepatic fatty acid breakdown. Somatostatin inhibits the secretion of the other two hormones.</p>

                        <h4>Gonads</h4>
                        <p>These are the primary sex organs in the male termed as the testes and in the female termed as the ovaries.</p>
                        <h5>Ovaries</h5>
                        <p>These are a set of paired glands in the pelvis that produce some of the following hormones:</p>
                        <h6>Estrogens</h6>
                        <p>This includes estradiol and estrone which are steroid hormones secreted by the cells of the ovarian follicles. They promote the development and maintenance of the female sexual characteristics and are also responsible for breast development and the sequence of events in the menstrual cycle.</p>
                        <h6>Progestrone</h6>
                        <p>It is secreted by the corpus luteum (that is the tissue left behind after the rapture of a follicle during ovulation). Progestrone with oestrogen maintains the lining of the uterus which is necessary for successful pregnancy.</p>
                        <h5>Testes</h5>
                        <p>These are paired organs within a sac of skin called the scrotum which hangs from the groin area of the trunk. They are composed mainly of sperm producing seminiferous tubules. Interstitial cells are found in areas between these tubules and they produce androgens (male sex hormones). The main androgen produced is testosterone. This hormone is responsible for the growth and maintenance of the male sexual characteristics and for sperm production.</p>

                        <h4>Thymus Gland</h4>
                        <p>This is a gland in the mediastinum just beneath the sternum. It is large in children until puberty, when it begins to atrophy throughout adulthood. In old age the gland remains as a small amount of fat and fibrous tissue. It consists of two pyramidal lobes and each lobule is composed of a dense cellular cortex and an inner less dense medulla.</p>
                        <p>The thymus gland secretes the hormones thymosin and thymopoietin which are thought to stimulate the production of specialised lymphocytes called T lymphocytes necessary for cell mediated immunity.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The nervous and endocrine systems control most functions in the human body. Endocrine dysfunction may result from deficient or excessive hormone secretion, transport abnormalities, an inability of target tissue to respond to a hormone or inappropriate stimulation of the target tissue receptor.</p>
                        <h4>The Hypothalamus</h4>
                        <p>This is the mother gland and it controls the functions of most of the other glands. The disorders that can affect the hypothalamus are encephalitis, head injury, tumours in the brain and haematomas. Since it has many functions, the effects of disease on the hypothalamus will be varied. The effects include obesity, restlessness, disordered temperature regulation, diabetes insipidus and precocious puberty.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Pituitary Disorders</h4>
                        <p>If the posterior lobe of the pituitary is affected by either injury or disease, it can result in diabetes insipidus, which manifests with polyuria and polydipsia. The management will involve either surgery or hormone therapy. The most prominent disorders of the pituitary, however, are those that affect the anterior pituitary.</p>
                        <h5>Disorders of the Anterior Pituitary Gland</h5>
                        <p>This refers to the hyper-function of the pituitary. Excess of trophic hormones usually produce syndromes related to hormone excess from the target organ e.g if thyroid stimulating levels are excessive, hyperthyroidism develops while if adrenocorticotrophic hormone is involved, cushings diseases (hypercortisolism) results.</p>
                        <p>Enlargement of the anterior pituitary can lead to hyper-secretion of one or many of the hormones that we mentioned. When this happens, the function performed by the particular hormone is also affected. It can also lead to loss of temporal vision.</p>
                        <h5>Hyperpituitarism</h5>
                        <p>This is the hyper-function of the pituitary. It can result in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Excess prolactin, which leads to amenorrhoea and inappropriate secretion of breast milk. In males it leads to impotence.</li>
                            <li>If it starts in childhood, hyperpituitarism can result in gigantism. When it occurs in adulthood it leads to acromegaly. In acromegaly individuals have enlarged hands, feet and lower jaw. They also have coarse facial features and impaired glucose tolerance.</li>
                            <li>Cushing's syndrome, which you shall learn about later.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Hypopituitarism</h5>
                        <p>This is a rare disorder that involves a decrease in one or more of the anterior pituitary hormones. Primary hypofunction may be as a result of autoimmune disorders, infections, tumours, vascular diseases or destruction of the gland from trauma, radiation or surgical procedures but the most common cause is a tumour. This is the result of a deficiency of growth hormone, which produces retardation in children. Males may have testicular atrophy. Females will develop amenorrhoea. Other effects include: decreased muscle strength, defective renal function, altered thyroid metabolism and reduced basal metabolic rate. Glucocorticoid and androgen abnormalities can occur.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Hyperaldosteronism</h5>
                        <p>Excessive aldosterone leads to hypernatraemia, hypertension and headache. The treatment of hyperaldosteronism involves surgery, potassium supplements and sodium restriction. Nursing care involves assessing the patient and instituting interventions for hypokalaemia. These were covered under electrolyte imbalance. Maintenance therapy of the hormones may be given after adrenalectomy, that is, the removal of the adrenal gland.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Diabetes Insipidus and Syndrome of Inappropriate Secretion of Anti-diuretic Hormone (SIADH)</h5>
                        <p>Diabetes insipidus results from a lack or a deficiency of ADH. The patient will present with polyuria and polydipsia, accompanied by hemoconcentration. It is managed by rehydration and electrolyte replacement.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, SIADH is due to oversecretion of ADH and the patient presents with hemodilution, and decreased urinary output. These two conditions may be the result of an injury or infection to the brain, pituitary and/or hypothalamus.</p>
                        <p>In SIADH the nursing interventions that you should put in place include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Restriction of fluid intake and maintenance of electrolyte balance</li>
                            <li>Good positioning to enhance venous return</li>
                            <li>Frequent patient turning to avoid dependent oedema leading to pressure ulcers</li>
                            <li>Anti-seizure precautions because of the possibility of brain oedema and raised intracranial pressure</li>
                            <li>Assistance with ambulation and provision of hygiene</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The main goal of nursing intervention should be the restoration of fluid balance. We have learnt that hyperfunction of the anterior pituitary may result in acromegally. This requires surgery to the pituitary gland. The pre and post-operative management will follow that of the patient undergoing intracranial surgery. For the patient who undergoes surgery, hormone replacement therapy may be instituted afterwards. Radiation and drugs may be used to counter the effects of growth hormone. Meanwhile, treatment of hypopituitarism consists of surgery for tumour removal, permanent hormone replacement and a dietary plan to target nutritional deficiencies.</p>

                        <h4>Adrenal Disorders</h4>
                        <p>Adrenocortical insufficiency results in Addison's disease. This disease may be a result of an auto immune reaction or an infection which leads to hypofunction of the adrenal glands.</p>
                        <p>Addison's disease results in muscle weakness, loss of appetite and hypotension. The disease can be accelerated by stress and infections, resulting in what is referred to as Addison's crisis, which manifests as extreme weakness, severe hypotension, hypoglycemia, vomiting, diarrhoea and coma.</p>
                        <h5>Care of the Adult with Addison's Crisis</h5>
                        <p>The adult with Addison's crisis requires urgent assessment to ensure that the life-threatening manifestations such as hypoglycemia are managed. The main management will be supportive while investigations take place and, later, hormonal replacement may be considered. When there is adrenal insufficiency, patients may receive steroid therapy. These steroids have some adverse effects.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>General Management of Adrenocortical Insufficiency</h5>
                        <p>You have learnt that adrenocortical insufficiency can result from the hypofunction of the gland, Addison's disease or the deficiency of corticosteroids and adrogens. When a patient with Addison's disease is hospitalised, vital signs and signs of fluid volume deficit should be monitored in addition to electrolyte imbalance. In addition, daily weights, diligent steroid administration, protection against exposure to infection and assistance with daily hygiene should be part of the management. This patient needs to be protected from noise, light and environmental temperature.</p>
                        <p>In the long term, the patient must learn about chronic use of steroids. The goals of nursing for this patient, therefore, should involve managing selfcare, relief of symptoms, adjusting medication to personal life situation, avoiding insufficiency and actively participating in the long-term treatment plan.</p>

                        <h4 id="hypersecretion-heading">Hypersecretion</h4>
                        <p>Hypersecretion from the adrenal cortex can result in adrenogenital syndrome and Cushing's syndrome. In adrenogenital syndrome, boys get premature (precocious) puberty and girls acquire male sexual characteristics. If hypersecretion occurs in adulthood, women have musculinisation with atrophy of breasts and enlargement of the clitoris.</p>
                        <h5>Cushing's Syndrome</h5>
                        <p>Cushing's syndrome is a result of excessive corticosteroids, particularly glucocorticoids.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <p>The patient presents with several features which can be seen in most body parts. Glucocorticoids causes pronounced changes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Weight gain is the most common feature resulting from accumulation of adipose tissue in the trunk, face (main face) and cervical area (buffalo hump).</li>
                            <li>Glucose intolerance because of cortisol induced insulin resistance and increased gluconeogenesis.</li>
                            <li>Muscle wasting leading to muscle weakness especially in the extremities.</li>
                            <li>Increased calcium resorption and inhibited collagen synthesis leads to pathological fractures, bone and back pain.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Mineralocorticoids:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In excess may cause hypertension</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Sex Hormones:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In excess may cause acne and feminisation in men</li>
                            <li>Menstruation disorders and impotence from adrenal carcinoma</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Management of the Adult with Cushing's Syndrome</h6>
                        <p><strong>Medications:</strong></p>
                        <p>This is required before surgery or radiation in cases where Cushing's syndrome results from pituitary tumor. Or in the case of inoperable pituitary or adrenal malignancies.</p>
                        <p>The aim is to control the symptoms and examples of drugs used include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Mitotane</strong> - Used in adrenal cancer directly suppresses activity of adrenal cortex</li>
                            <li><strong>Metyrapone or Ketoconazole</strong> (or both) inhibits cortisol synthesis</li>
                            <li><strong>Somatostatis (octreatide)</strong> suppresses ACTH secretion</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Surgery:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Adrenalectomy</strong> is done if the disease is caused by adrenal cortex tumour (only one is usually involved)</li>
                            <li><strong>Bilateral adrenalectomy</strong> is done for an ACTH producing ectopic tumour</li>
                            <li><strong>Surgical removal of the pituitary gland</strong> is indicated if there is a pituitary disorder (Refer to nursing care of a patient after cranial surgery)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Care of the Adult with Cushing's Syndrome</h6>
                        <p>You learned that Cushing's syndrome is a result of high corticosteroids secretion. This may result from prolonged administration of high doses of corticosteroids, ACTH secreting pituitary tumour, cortisol secreting tumour within the adrenal cortex and secretion of ACTH from carcinoma of the lungs.</p>
                        <p>Therapeutic management involves adrenal cortical adenoma, carcinoma or hyperplasia removal. Pre-operative or post-operative management will, therefore, be necessary. Administration of steroids may also be undertaken. The specific nursing management includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vital signs monitoring</li>
                            <li>Taking and recording daily weights</li>
                            <li>Monitoring for signs of infection, abdominal pain, thromboembolic phenomena, bone pain and arthritis</li>
                            <li>Glucose monitoring</li>
                            <li>Management of mental status especially depression</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For the patient due for adrenalectomy, glucose and blood pressure monitoring is necessary. The patient requires a high protein meal before surgery. IV fluids, nasograstic suctioning, high doses of cortisone, close monitoring of vital functions are very critical in the immediate postoperative period. Always be alert for signs of glucocorticoid imbalance. Bed rest is important until blood pressure stabilises. Infection prevention should not be forgotten.</p>

                        <h4>Thyroid Disorders</h4>
                        <p>Thyroid disorders are manifested as hyperfunction (thyrotoxicosis), hypofunction, inflammation or enlargement. Two thyroid disorders are Goitre and Hyperthyroidism.</p>
                        <h5>Goitre</h5>
                        <p>This is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. It may be caused by a variety of factors, including hypofunction and tumours. Hypothyroidism, when occurring in infancy, can produce cretinism. Individuals with cretinism will have a vacant expression, protruding tongue and physical and mental retardation. The physical retardation is what we refer to as dwarfism. Myxoedema is the manifestation of hypothyroidism in adults. Patients have oedema of the skin, and a slowing down of mental and physical activity. There is normally intolerance to cold, muscle weakness, hoarse voice and weight gain.</p>
                        <h6>Types of Goitre</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Simple goitre</strong> - There is no clear cause for enlargement of the thyroid which is usually smooth and soft.</li>
                            <li><strong>Multiple nodular goitre</strong> - Is the most common especially in older patients. It's the most common cause of tracheal and oesophageal compression and may cause laryngeal nerve palsy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Solitary nodular goitre (Plummers syndrome)</strong> - They are usually cystic or benign with a history of pain, rapid enlargement or associated lymph nodes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fibroitic goitre (Riedel's thyroiditis)</strong> - Rare condition which is irregular and hard producing a 'woody' gland. It is often difficult to distinguish from carcinoma.</li>
                            <li><strong>Malignancy</strong> - It's a rare condition in the thyroid.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Causes:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hypertrophy caused by excess stimulation</li>
                            <li>Growth stimulating immunoglobulins</li>
                            <li>Goitrogens which inhibit synthesis of thyroid hormone only in individuals who live in an iodine deficient area</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Majority are painless but pain or discomfort can occur in acute cases</li>
                            <li>Diffuse or nodular goitre can cause dysphagia and difficulty in breathing, this may also result into oesophageal or tracheal compression</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Investigations</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thyroid function tests of thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine and thiodothyronine to determine whether a goitre is associated with hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism or normal thyroid function.</li>
                            <li>Chest and thoracic inlet x-rays to detect tracheal compression.</li>
                            <li>Measurement of thyroid antibodies to assess for thyroiditis.</li>
                            <li>Ultrasound to demonstrate whether the nodules are cystic or solid.</li>
                            <li>Thyroid scan to determine whether the nodule is malignant.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <p>A goitre associated with normal thyroid function in pregnancy and puberty rarely requires intervention and patient needs to be reassured. Surgery to remove large goitres may be necessary.</p>
                        <h6>Indications for Surgical Intervention</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The possibility of malignancy where there is a history of rapid growth, pain, cervical lymphadenopathy or previous irradiation.</li>
                            <li>Pressure symptoms on the trachea.</li>
                            <li>Cosmetic reasons.</li>
                            <li>A large goitre may cause anxiety to the patient even if benign.</li>

                        <p>This condition is also referred to as thyrotoxicosis (or thyroid overactivity). It is defined as sustained increased synthesis and release of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. It affects about 2-5% of all females between ages 20 and 40 years. It occurs as primary hyperthyroidism, also called Grave's disease, or as secondary hyperthyroidism, also called Toxic nodular Goitre.</p>
                        <h6>Aetiology and pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>Nearly 99% of all cases are caused by intrinsic thyroid disease and a pituitary cause is usually rare. Graves disease (diffuse toxic goitre) is the most common cause and is due to autoimmune process. The patient develops antibodies that stimulate over production of thyroid hormones. Graves' disease is also characterised by remissions and exacerbations and if not treated it may progress to destruction of thyroid tissue causing hypothyroidism.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <p>In Grave's disease there is thyroid enlargement, increased metabolic rate, intolerance to heat and nervousness. Patients sweat profusely, there is atrial fibrillation, and loss of weight in the presence of a good appetite.</p>
                        <p>Nodular goitres which are characterised by small discrete autonomously functioning but not TSH dependent nodule that secretes thyroid hormone. If associated with signs of hyperthyroidism a nodule is termed toxic. Where there are multiple nodules they're called multinodular goitre or single nodule (uninodular goitre, thyroid adenoma).</p>
                        <p>Toxic Nodular Goitre is more severe and patients have exophthalmos. Sometimes patients with thyrotoxicosis can also present with a thyroid crisis in which the symptoms are similar to those of thyrotoxicosis but more severe and acute.</p>
                        <h6>Diagnosis</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Serum T4 and T3 are measured with immunoassay techniques and are elevated.</li>
                            <li>T3 resin uptake (T3RU) is also elevated.</li>
                            <li>Electrocardiogram (ECG) may show tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and alteration in R and T waves.</li>
                            <li>In non pregnant and non lactating patients 24 hour radioactive iodine uptake may be done.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Hypothyroidism Myxoedema</h5>
                        <p>Is a disorder that results when the thyroid gland produces an insufficient amount of thyroid hormones. It is more common in women between ages 30-60 but the disorder can occur at any stage of life.</p>
                        <h6>Types of Hypothyroidism</h6>
                        <p>Hypothyroidism may be either primary or secondary.</p>
                        <p><strong>Primary Hypothyroidism</strong> is more common and may be caused by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Congenital defects in the gland</li>
                            <li>Loss of thyroid following treatment for hyperthyroidism with surgery or radiation</li>
                            <li>Antithyroid medication</li>
                            <li>Thyroiditis</li>
                            <li>Endemic ion deficiency</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Secondary Hypothyroidism</strong> may result from:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency</li>
                            <li>Peripheral resistance to thyroid hormones</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>When the thyroid hormone production decreases, the thyroid gland enlarges in a compensatory attempt to produce more hormones. The goitre that results is usually a simple or non toxic form. People living in areas where the soil is deficient in iodine are ore prone to become hypothyroid.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <p>Hypothyroidism affects all body systems:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Endocrine</strong> - goitre</li>
                            <li><strong>Neurological</strong> - Lethargy, confusion, slow speech and memory impairment</li>
                            <li><strong>Respiratory</strong> - Pleural effusion</li>
                            <li><strong>Cardiovascular</strong> - hypotension, body cardia, enlarged heart and anaemia</li>
                            <li><strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> - Constipation</li>
                            <li><strong>Musculoskeletal</strong> - Muscle stiffness, weakness, fatigue</li>
                            <li><strong>Reproductive</strong> - Menorrhagia (female), infertility (female), reduced libido (male)</li>
                            <li><strong>Integumentary</strong> - hair loss, brittle nails, coarse dry skin and non-pitting oedema</li>

                        <h4>Management of Hypothyroidism</h4>
                        <p>Hypothyroidism is treated with an objective of restoring a normal metabolic rate. For this purpose, administration of the thyroid hormone (Levothyroxine, liotrix or thyroid extract) is one of the main treatment measures. At the time of administration, you must be on the lookout and observe for diuresis, exaggerated reflexes and high pulse rate. In severe hypothyroidism, you should endeavour to maintain vital functions through monitoring blood gases, assisted ventilation, monitoring fluid intake, replacement of the thyroid hormone and treating the precipitating factors.</p>
                        <h4>Management of Hyperthyroidism</h4>
                        <p>The patient is nursed using the nursing process. The therapeutic goals are to block the adverse effects of thyroid hormones and stop their over secretion. The choice of treatment is influenced by the patient's age, severity of the disorder, complicating features and patients preferences. Management involves drug therapy with antithyroid medication, use of B-adrenergic blockers, radioactive iodine and subtotal thyroidectomy.</p>
                        <h5>Drug Therapy of Hyperthyroidism</h5>
                        <p>The most commonly used drugs are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Antithyroid drugs</strong> like Thionamides, propylthiouracil (PTU) or carbimazole and methimazole (Tapazol). These drugs inhibit the synthesis of the thyroid hormones. Propylthiouracil also blocks the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. Improvement usually begins one to two weeks after initiation of treatment. Therapy is continued for six months to two years.</li>
                            <li><strong>Iodine</strong> administered in large doses inhibits synthesis of active thyroid hormones and blocks the release of the hormone into circulation e.g solution of potassium iodide.</li>
                            <li><strong>B-adrenergic Blockers</strong> such as Propranol or Inderal is most frequently used. It relieves the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, arrhythmias and hypertension.</li>
                            <li>Also administer <strong>digoxin</strong> to prevent heart failure.</li>
                            <li>If surgery is to be performed propylthiouracil with iodine therapy added for 10 days before surgery is recommended.</li>
                            <li><strong>Radioactive iodine</strong>-limits thyroid hormone secretions by damaging or destroying thyroid tissue.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Nutritional Therapy</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High caloric diet of 4000 to 5000 kcal per day to satisfy hunger and prevent tissue breakdown.</li>
                            <li>Protein allowed in a meal should be 1 to 2 g/kg of ideal body weight.</li>
                            <li>Increased carbohydrate is required to compensate for disturbed metabolism, provide energy and spare protein.</li>
                            <li>High seasoned and high fibre diet should be avoided because it stimulates the already hyperactive gastrointestinal tract.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Subtotal thyroidectomy should be performed only in patients who have been previously on medication. Antithyroid drug is stopped 10-14 days before operation and instead patient is given potassium iodide 100 mg three times daily. This reduces the vascularity of the gland.</p>
                        <h6>Particular indications for surgery:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patients choice</li>
                            <li>A large goiter unlikely to respond to antithyroid medication</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Indications for either surgery or radioactive treatment are:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Persistent drug side effects</li>
                            <li>Poor compliance with drug therapy</li>
                            <li>Recurrent hyperthyroidism after drugs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once there is indication for surgery the patient must be adequately prepared pre-operatively to avoid post-operative complications. All patients with hyperthyroid states require a calm and quiet environment. You will now look at the care of the adult undergoing thyroidectomy.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Care of the Patient Undergoing Thyroidectomy</h4>
                        <p>The following steps should be taken when providing pre-operative care:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide a restful, quiet environment.</li>
                            <li>Regulate nutritional intake, that is, food should be high in carbohydrate and protein.</li>
                            <li>Support the patient during investigations.</li>
                            <li>Prepare the patient for surgery by sharing information, giving instructions on what to expect, consent and pre-medication.</li>
                            <li>Signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis must be alleviated and cardiac problems must be controlled.</li>
                            <li>The patient must be assessed for signs such as swelling of buccal mucousa and other mucous membranes, excessive salivation, nausea and vomiting and skin reactions. If toxicity occurs iodine administration should be discounted and doctor notified.</li>
                            <li>Pre-operative teaching should include comfort and safety measures. Coughing and deep breathing exercises should be practiced including how to support the neck manually while turning in bed because this minimises stress on the suture line after surgery and exercises of the neck.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Post-operatively</h5>
                        <p>When providing post-operative care for the patient who has undergone a thyroidectomy, you should ensure that you:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Oxygen, suction equipment and a tracheostomy tray are readily available in case airway obstruction occurs. Place patient in Fowler's position and support head with pillows.</li>
                            <li>Assess patient every two hours for 24 hours for signs of haemorrhage or tracheal compression e.g. irregular breathing, neck swelling, blood on the anterior and posterior dressing.</li>
                            <li>Monitor vital signs temperature, pulse, respiration and blood pressure.</li>
                            <li>Check for signs of tetany secondary to hypothyroidism e.g. tingling in toes, fingers or around mouth, muscular twitching.</li>
                            <li>Ensure control of postoperative pain by giving medications.</li>
                            <li>Reassure the patient that some hoarseness is expected for three to four days after surgery because of oedema.</li>
                            <li>Neck exercises should be performed three or four times daily to promote comfort and return of full range of motion.</li>
                            <li>Fluids are administered as soon as the patient can tolerate them and soft diet is introduced by the second day.</li>
                            <li>If the patient progresses well postoperatively ambulation is encouraged on the first day.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Complications include:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Thyrotoxicosis crisis (thyroid storm) which is an acute but rare condition in which all the hyperthyroid manifestation are worsened and may include severe tachycardia, heart failure, hyperthermia, restlessness.</li>
                            <li>Recurrent laryngeal nerve damage which may lead to vocal card paralysis.</li>
                            <li>Difficulty in breathing due to swelling of neck tissues, haemorrhage, haematoma formation.</li>
                            <li>Laryngeal stridor (harsh vibratory sound) may occur during respiration due to tetany from damaged or removal of parathyroid.</li>
                            <li>Early post-operative bleeding</li>
                            <li>Recurrent hyperthyroidism occurs in 1-3% within one year and then 1% per year</li>
                            <li>Hypothyroidism occurs in about 10% of patients within one year.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Parathyroid Disorders</h4>
                        <h5>Hyperparathyroidism</h5>
                        <p>This involves secretion of increased levels of parathyroid hormone. We have learnt that this hormone is involved in calcium metabolism. The objective of management is to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. The choice of therapy depends on the urgency of the problem, the degree of hypercalcemia, the underlying disorder, the status of renal and hepatic function, the patient's clinical presentation and the merits of each mode of treatment.</p>
                        <p>In severe cases, surgery is performed. In less acute cases, conservative management involving close monitoring, high fluid, and moderate calcium, sodium, and phosphorous supplementation are choice actions. Diuretics may also be administered. Diuretic medication will act on the kidney to cause fluid loss and hence lower the possibility of kidney stone formation. One of the drugs used as a diuretic is Frusemide (e.g. lasix). Some drugs, for example, mithramycin lower serum calcium. Oestrogen therapy for post-menopausal women can also be helpful. Strict monitoring of intake and output and levels of calcium, potassium and phosphate are necessary.</p>
                        <h5>Hypoparathyroidism</h5>
                        <p>In hypoparathyrodism, the main objectives of treatment are to treat tetany when present and prevent long-term complications of low calcium levels in plasma. IV calcium gluconate and vitamin D are used in this case. Digitalisation and the use of side rails are important nursing alerts to prevent cardiac arrest and falls during tetany. Anti-seizure precautions should be instituted.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Diabetes Mellitus</h4>
                        <p>You learnt that insulin is a hormone involved in glucose metabolism. The other hormones involved in glucose metabolism are glucagon, adrenaline, growth hormone and somatotrophin. Try to remember them and their functions.</p>
                        <p>Diabetes mellitus can be divided into:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Type I or Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM).</li>
                            <li>Type II or Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM).</li>
                            <li>Type III, due to excessive corticosteroids, for example in Cushing's syndrome or over enthusiastic treatment of addison's disease with corticosteroids</li>
                            <li>Type IV, also called gestational diabetes. It's due to the presence of a hormone called human placental lactogen, which antagonises the effects of insulin.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Type I Diabetes</h5>
                        <p>This type of diabetes has no clearly known cause. It is thought that some individuals have antibodies against cells producing insulin. It is also thought that hypersensitivity reactions may destroy the part of the pancreas involved in secretion of the hormones (the Islets of Langerhans). In this disorder, patients do not produce their own insulin. Hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, polyuria and polydipsia, and loss of weight are characteristic manifestations.</p>
                        <h5>Type II Diabetes</h5>
                        <p>Individuals with Type II diabetes have insulin, which may be low, normal or high, but they may have insulin resistance. In Type II diabetes, there is glycosuria (sugar in urine) and hyperglycaemia. It can complicate with hyperosmolar non-ketosis with or without coma, susceptibility to infection, vascular, renal and ophthalmic disorders. Some of the patients with Type II diabetes may be obese. Type II diabetic patients can generally be well managed throughout their lives.</p>
                        <h5>Management of Diabetes Mellitus</h5>
                        <p>In the management of diabetes mellitus, the goals are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maintenance of as near-normal blood glucose level as possible</li>
                            <li>Achievement of optimal serum lipids</li>
                            <li>Provision of adequate calories for attaining reasonable weight</li>
                            <li>Prevention and treatment of complications</li>
                            <li>Avoidance of hypoglycaemia</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The three modalities utilised in the management are drugs, including insulin and oral hypoglycaemic drugs such as diabenese, diet and exercise. These three have to be well balanced to avoid complications. Patient education is also important to decrease complications. Patients require education, which cover medication, injection sites, use of foods, blood glucose monitoring, exercise and activity home management and lifestyle improvement.</p>
                        <p>Both short-term and long-term complications may arise. Short-term complications include hyperglycemia, hypoglycaemia, ulcers, and coma, while long-term effects are nephropathies (kidney involvement), neuropathies (involvement of the nervous system) and visual problems. Administering oxygen, establishing IV access, determining blood sugar levels and monitoring vital signs manage Ketoacidosis. IV glucose and glucagon can also be administered as necessary.</p>
                        <p>Hyperosmolar nonketosis is treated with IV fluids and insulin. Electrolyte and vital signs are then closely monitored. Micro-vascular complications are best treated by preventive measures. Care of the eyes, care of the feet and avoiding injurious substances to the kidney will improve the patient's life.</p>

                        <h4>The Gastrointestinal Tract</h4>
                        <p>The gastrointestinal tract is a long tubular structure, which starts at the mouth and ends at the anus. The walls of the tract from the oesophagus onwards form four layers of tissues. The layers are the adventitia or outer covering, muscle layer, submucous layer, and mucous membrane lining. The tract is well supplied with nerves and blood vessels.</p>
                        <h5>The Mouth</h5>
                        <p>This is also called the oral cavity. Food taken in is chewed and mixed with saliva that contains the enzyme amylase (ptyalin). The tongue, which performs taste functions, turns the food in the mouth that is called mastication and also assists in swallowing.</p>
                        <h5>The Pharynx</h5>
                        <p>This is a tube like passageway about 12-14 cm that connects the mouth and oesophagus and is important in swallowing. As food and fluids pass through the pharynx into the oesophagus the trachea is closed by the epiglottis to prevent aspiration into the lungs.</p>
                        <h5>The Oesophagus</h5>
                        <p>This is a pliable muscular structure approximately 25 cm long that extends from the pharynx to the cardiac end of the stomach. Swallowed food is propelled to the stomach by peristalsis (sequential contraction and relaxation of outer longitudinal and inner circulation layers of muscles). It is the presence of food in the pharynx which triggers peristalsis. The oesophagus has a lower sphincter, which prevents regurgitation of food. Food is also prevented from regurgitating by the acute angle of attachment of the stomach to the oesophagus via the diaphragm, and increased muscle tone of the oesophageal sphincter.</p>
                        <h5>The Stomach</h5>
                        <p>The stomach is a dilated pouch, which occupies the upper abdomen, and lies slightly to the left. It consists of a fundus, body and antrum. At the lower end, the stomach has a sphincter called the pylorus. There are special secretor glands on the walls of the stomach, which secrete gastric juice. This juice contains enzymes, hydrochloric acid, intrinsic factor, mucous, water and mineral salts. The Intrinsic factor is a protein essential for absorption of vitamin B12 which is essential for erythropoiesis (RBC formation). In the stomach a gastric hormone is also manufactured and this hormone regulates enzyme production to facilitate digestion.</p>
                        <h6>Functions of the Stomach</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Temporary reservoir</li>
                            <li>Production of gastric juice</li>
                            <li>Absorbing water, vitamins and alcohol</li>
                            <li>Moving the food into the next point in the digestion process, which is the intestine</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Functions of the Gastric Juice</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Liquifying of food by the water</li>
                            <li>Digestion, where hydrochloric acid acidifies the food and stops action of ptyalin that comes with saliva, kills micro-organisms and provides an environment for digestion of proteins by the pepsin</li>
                            <li>Assisting in absorption of vitamin B12 through intrinsic factor</li>
                            <li>Mucus, which prevents autodigestion by the hydrochloric acid</li>
                            <li>Lubricating the contents</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>The Small Intestines</h5>
                        <p>This is a tube about 5 m long, which is divided into three parts: the duodenum, at which the pancreatic duct and common bile duct open, the jejunum which is the middle part, and the ileum. The intestines have four layers as you saw earlier. The mucous membrane has folds and finger-like projections called the villi. These increase the surface area for absorption. This part of the Gastrolntestinal Tract (GIT) is involved in continuing the movement of the food as it gets absorbed. Digestion (the actual chemical breakdown of food) also takes place here, as does the secretion of certain hormones. These hormones are cholecystokinin, pancreozymin and secretin.</p>
                        <h5>The Large Intestines</h5>
                        <p>The small intestine gives way to the large intestine, that is, the colon, the rectum and anal canal. The colon is divided into the caecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid colon. From the caecum is the blind-ended tube, the appendix, which has no known function. The rectum and anus are the distal ends of the gastrointestinal tracts. The anus has an internal sphincter, which is under autonomic nervous control, and the external sphincter, which is under voluntary control.</p>
                        <h6>Functions of the Large Intestines</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Absorption:</strong> An important function of the large intestine is absorption of water and electrolytes e.g. potassium. Absorption of water continues until the familiar semisolid consistency of fences is achieved. Other substances which are also absorbed into the blood capillaries from the large intestine are mineral salts, vitamins and some drugs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Microbial activity:</strong> There are micro-organisms which colonise the large intestine and they synthesise vitamin K and folic acid. Examples are Escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus faecalis and clostridium perfringens. The micro-organisms also breakdown proteins which were not digested in the small intestines and amino acids which are produced are deaminated and ammonia is transported to the liver for conversion into urea.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mass movement:</strong> At fairly long intervals (about twice an hour) a strong peristaltic wave sweeps along the transverse colon forcing contents into the descending and sigmoid colons. This mass movement is often precipitated by entry of food into the stomach. This combination of stimulus and response is what is referred to as the gastrocolic reflex.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Associated Structures of the GIT</h4>
                        <p>The associated structures of the digestive tract include the liver, the gall bladder (which is also called the biliary tract) and the pancreas.</p>
                        <h5>The Liver</h5>
                        <p>The liver is the heaviest internal organ in the human body weighing between 1200 gm to 1600 gm in an adult. It is located under the right diaphragm. It occupies the greater part of the right hypochondriac region, part of the epigastric region and extends into the left hypogastric region.</p>
                        <p>Most of the liver is enclosed in the peritoneum and has a fibrous capsule, which divides it into the right and left lobes. These are further subdivided into lobules that are composed of rows of hepatic cells. There are sinusoids or capillaries that are located between the rows of cells.</p>
                        <p>Phagocytic cells called Kupffer cells, which perform phagocytosis of bacteria and toxins, line these sinusoids. There are also bile ducts formed from bile capillaries (the canaliculi), which carry bile secreted by hepatic cells. Blood supply to the liver is by the portal circulatory system.</p>
                        <h6>Functions of the Liver</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Carbohydrate metabolism</strong> - the main function of the liver in carbohydrate metabolism is maintenance of blood glucose concentration. This involves conversion of glucose to glycogen in the presence of insulin and converting liver glycogen back to glucose in the presence of glucagons.</li>
                            <li><strong>Protein metabolism</strong> - In deamination of amino acids, the nitrogen portion is removed and this amino acid breakdown leads to formation of urea, synthesis of plasma proteins and non essential amino acids. Most of the blood clotting factors occur in the liver.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mononuclear phagocyte functions</strong> - This is carried out by Kupffer cells which line the sinusoids and the breakdown of erythrocytes and phagocytosis of microbes occur. When haemoglobin is broken down, bilirubin is formed. Since it is insoluble in water, it is bound to albumin for easy transport to the liver. In this form it is called unconjugated bilirubin. It is then conjugated with glucuronic acid to make it soluble (conjugated) and excreted in bile. The bile contains water, cholesterol, bile salts, pigments and other substances. This bile enters the intestines. Most bilirubin is broken down to stercobilinogen and excreted in faeces. This gives stool its brown colour and characteristic odour. Some small amounts of bilirubin are excreted in urine and the rest is reabsorbed to go back to the liver and begin the process all over. If there is a problem in the excretion of bilirubin, then it may get to the skin and mucous membranes and give a yellow colour.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fat metabolism:</strong> Fat is desaturated and converted to a form that can be used by the tissues to provide energy</li>
                            <li>Production of heat</li>
                            <li>Detoxification of drugs and noxious substances</li>
                            <li>Inactivation of hormones such as insulin, glucagon, cortisol, aldosterone, thyroid and sex hormones</li>
                            <li>Synthesis of vitamin A from carotene</li>
                            <li>Secretion of bile</li>
                            <li>Storage of vitamins and ions. Fat soluble vitamins stored in liver are A,D,E,K. Water soluble vitamins include riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, folic acid and vitamin B12, lons are ions and copper.</li>
                            <li>Metabolism of ethanol</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>The Gall Bladder</h5>
                        <p>The gall bladder and its duct system are called the biliary tract. This is a sac located below the liver. Its function is to concentrate the bile produced by the liver and store it. The ducts begin right from the liver where the inner lobular ducts unite to form the two main right and left hepatic ducts. These also join with the cystic duct from the gall bladder to form the common bile duct that finally enters the duodenum. A sphincter keeps the entry point closed except when stimulated by food present in the gastrointestinal tract. The functions of the gall bladder include storage of bile, adding mucous to bile, concentrating bile and, by contraction, expelling bile.</p>

                        <h5>The Pancreas</h5>
                        <p>The pancreas is a long slender organ that is about 12 to 5 cm long. The head of the pancreas is tucked into the curve of the duodenum and its tail touches the spleen. It is divided into lobes and lobules. The pancreas has both exocrine and endocrine functions. By exocrine action, pancreatic enzymes are released to aid in digestion, and by endocrine action the cells of Islets of Langerhans secrete insulin, glucagon and somatostatin hormones. These are hormones you have already learnt about. The pancreatic duct extends the whole length of the pancreas and opens into the duodenum. However, before it opens into the duodenum, it joins the common bile duct to form the Ampulla of the bile duct.</p>
                        <p>The pancreas has the function of producing the pancreatic juice, which aids in the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Some of the pancreatic enzymes include chymotrypsin, peptidase, pancreatic amylase and lipase.</p>

                    <h3 id="food-metabolism-heading" class="section-heading">Food Metabolism</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>You are now going to look at the process of food metabolism by summarising the process of digestion, absorption and utilisation of various food nutrients.</p>
                        <h4>Carbohydrates</h4>
                        <p>The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth where salivary amylase converts cooked starch into disaccharides. In the stomach, the hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice stops the action of the salivary amylase. In the small intestines, pancreatic juice, which contains amylase, sucrase, maltase and lactase, completes the digestion from disaccharides to monosacharides, mainly glucose. Glucose is absorbed into capillaries of the villi and transported to the portal circulation to the liver. Insulin and glucagon are involved in the utilisation and storage of glucose.</p>
                        <p>Carbohydrates are broken down by use of oxygen in aerobic oxidation to liberate energy. In the absence of oxygen, anaerobic respiration takes place. The energy liberated is in the form of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). Molecules in the form of lactic acid can also be produced in anaerobic oxidation. The other products include carbon dioxide and water. Excess glucose is stored as fat, or glycogen in the liver.</p>
                        <h4>Proteins</h4>
                        <p>Protein digestion begins in the stomach where hydrochloric acid in gastric juice works on pepsinogen to make pepsin, which in turn converts all proteins to smaller molecules, the polypeptides. Then trypsin and chymotrypsin from the pancreatic juice reduce the polypeptides further to dipeptides and tripeptides.</p>
                        <p>In the small intestines, peptidase converts these into amino acids, which are absorbed and transported to the liver. In the liver the amino acids form albumin, globulin, prothrombin and fibrinogen. You may remember that some of these are utilised in the clotting of blood. Amino acids also aid in cell repair and replacement, production of hormones, enzymes, and antibodies. Deamination is done in the liver to produce urea, which is excreted in urine. Proteins can also provide energy when there is starvation or be deposited as fats after conversion.</p>
                        <h4>Fat</h4>
                        <p>Digestion of fat begins in the small intestines where bile salts emulsify fats and pancreatic juice converts fats to fatty acids and glycerol. The digestion is completed in the small intestines.</p>
                        <p>Fatty acids and glycerol are absorbed and transported to the liver. They can be broken down to produce energy, carbon dioxide and water, or stored. In the process of fat breakdown, ketone bodies are produced which can be excreted in urine or expired in air. An example of a ketone body is acetone.</p>
                        <p>Fat can also be synthesised from carbohydrates and proteins for storage purposes.</p>
                        <h4>Vitamins and Minerals</h4>
                        <p>Vitamins and minerals form the coenzymes that are so important in chemical reactions. Deficiency of vitamins leads to many nutritional diseases which include: scurvy, rickets, and pellagra.</p>
                        <p>Minerals make up the electrolytes which were mentioned at the beginning of this unit.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Disorders of the Gastrointestinal Tract include disorders of the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, liver, gall bladder and the pancreas. You will also read about management and care of patients who suffer from these disorders.</p>
                        <h4>Disorders of the Mouth</h4>
                        <p>The mouth is the first port of call for food in the body. In the mouth, various disorders can give patients problems. The most common mouth disorder is dental caries. This is destruction of the teeth by bacteria and their products. The process starts with the enamel, and as it progresses, toothache ensues.</p>
                        <p>Bacterial and fungal infections also affect the mouth. Oral thrush (candidiasis) commonly affects children and immuno-compromised clients. Disorders of the oral cavity are better off prevented. Good oral hygiene is recommended for all individuals. Antifungal medication and betadine gargles are used in the treatment of mouth infections.</p>
                        <p>Cancer of the oral cavity occurs predominantly in persons with a history of alcohol abuse and smoking. It presents with alteration in taste and later pain. On examination, the patient will have white patches on the oral mucosa, ulcers and bleeding. The management includes surgery, radiation and proper nutrition. As the condition proceeds, the patient may require maintenance of a patent airway, fluid, electrolyte and nutrition balance. Frequent saline mouthwash is necessary to relief the dryness. Cysts and other tumours of the oral cavity are also common. These may require the same management.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Disorders of the Oesophagus</h4>
                        <h5>Oesophagitis</h5>
                        <p>Oesophagitis is the inflammation of the oesophagus. It is caused by chemical injury, infections and trauma. Consuming hot and spicy food can cause the injury. Oesophagitis is also caused by reflux of gastric contents. It manifests with heartburn and pain, which is retro-sternal and radiates to the shoulder and the back. A patient who has oesophagitis would require treatment of the underlying cause, use of antacids and avoidance of foods and substances which can cause limitation. In severe cases, surgery may be undertaken.</p>
                        <h5>General Care of the Adult with Oesophageal Diseases</h5>
                        <p>One of the most common disorders is gastrooesophageal reflux disease. The measures necessary to prevent reflux are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eating small frequent meals that are high in protein and low in fat</li>
                            <li>The patient should not lie down immediately after eating and should elevate the head of the bed</li>
                            <li>Avoidance of alcohol, smoking and beverages that contain caffeine. These beverages can weaken the lower sphincter and hence contribute to reflux</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The conservative management includes the above measures in addition to antacids, cholinergic and other drugs that act on the lower oesophageal sphincter to make it firmer. Surgery is always used as a last resort.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Hiatus Hernia</h5>
                        <p>Some individuals have the stomach herniating through the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity. This is referred to as hiatus hernia. The hiatus hernia results in reflux of gastric contents and symptoms like those of oesophagitis will ensue. Congenitally weak muscles, obesity, pregnancy, tight fitting clothes and other conditions that raise the intra abdominal pressure contribute to it. Hiatus hernia leads to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and the management will entail the same measures. The patient should also avoid constricting clothes and heavy lifting.</p>

                        <h5>Carcinoma of the Oesophagus</h5>
                        <p>Carcinoma of the oesophagus is usually squamous cell carcinoma. It can occur at any level of the oesophageal tract but are most common at the gastro esophageal junction. The pathogenesis of oesophageal carcinoma is facilitated by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Alterations of oesophageal structure and function that permit food and drink to remain in the oesophagus for prolonged periods.</li>
                            <li>Ulceration and metaplasia caused by oesophageal reflux.</li>
                            <li>Chronic exposure to irritants such as alcohol and tobacco.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Risk Factors</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tobacco use</li>
                            <li>Alcoholism</li>
                            <li>Dietary deficiencies of trace elements and malnutrition associated with poor economic conditions</li>
                            <li>Reflux oesophagitis</li>
                            <li>Sliding hiatal hernia</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Clinical Manifestations</h6>
                        <p>Chest pain, Dysphagia - This usually progresses rapidly and swallowing is mostly painless during early stages of oesophageal carcinoma. Initially, dysphagia starts with solid food and eventually with the fluids. This is then followed by a feeling of a lump in the throat, painful swallowing substernal pain or fullness and later regurgitation of undigested food with foul breath and hiccoughs.</p>
                        <h6>Diagnosis</h6>
                        <p>This is done by oesophagoscopy with biopsy.</p>
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <p>Treatment includes surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. The patient may be treated by surgical excision of the lesion, radiation or both. Surgery is preferred for lower esophageal tumours whereas irradiation is favoured for upper esophageal lesions.</p>
                        <h6>General Care of the Adult with Oesophageal Diseases</h6>
                        <p>Cancer of the oesophagus (Ca oesophagus) is one of the disorders that you are likely to meet in your practice. Depending on the stage at which it is discovered, the management modalities include: radiation, gastrostomy and simple palliative measures such as dilatation. Gastrostomy is the creation of a stoma into the stomach to assist in delivery of nutrients to the patient. In patients undergoing surgery of the oesophagus, there are several nursing actions that are necessary. They include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maintenance of a patent airway</li>
                            <li>Monitoring vital functions</li>
                            <li>Providing oral care</li>
                            <li>Maintaining nutritional status by providing total parental nutrition, tube feedings, and vitamin and mineral supplements</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Those with severe oesophageal disease may also require these actions, even if they have not undergone surgery.</p>
                        <h6>Prognosis</h6>
                        <p>Mortality among patients with cancer of the esophagus is high owing to three factors:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The patient is an older person usually with other disorders e.g. cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders.</li>
                            <li>Symptoms are more evident when the tumour has invaded surrounding structures.</li>
                            <li>The unique relation of the oesophagus to the heart and lungs makes the organs easily accessible to extension of the tumor.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Diverticuli</h5>
                        <p>These are pouches on the wall of the GIT, which occur as a result of weakness of the muscles. The diverticuli make the patient feel as if the food is sticking in the Oesophagus. They may also contribute to the development of cancer of the oesophagus. Patients with diverticular disease need to be given blended foods. Surgery may also be indicated and these patients would require pre and post-operative management. Generally pre and post-operative care is the same in most cases.</p>

                    <h5>Gastritis</h5>
                    <p>Gastritis is an inflammatory disorder of the gastric mucosa. This is the mucosa that protects the stomach from the actions of the hydrochloric acid.</p>
                    <p>Acute gastritis is the irritation of the gastric mucosa by alcohol, bacterial toxins, or acids. The surface epithelium is eroded in a diffuse or localised pattern and erosions are usually superficial. These acids may be hydrochloric acid or from drugs such as aspirin. Antinflammatory drugs cause gastritis perhaps because they inhibit prostaglandins which normally stimulate the secretion of mucous. The onset is insidious and patients begin vomiting with haematemesis and bleeding, if the disease is severe. Normally, the disease is self limiting.</p>
                    <p>Chronic gastritis on the other hand involves the atrophy of the epithelium in the stomach. This results in less hydrochloric acid being produced. The atrophy may be caused by chronic alcoholism or autoantibodies. This disorder produces pernicious anaemia. This is because the production of intrinsic factor is affected. Hence the absorption of vitamin B12 is affected. The condition also predisposes to gastric ulceration and cancer of the stomach. Clinical manifestations of chronic gastritis include vague abdominal discomfort, epigastric tenderness and bleeding. The management involves removal of the predisposing factors by educating patients on foods and drinks that they should avoid. If severe, surgery may be performed to bypass the diseased area, and deliver nutrients directly into the small intestines.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h5>Peptic Ulcers</h5>
                    <p>A peptic ulcer is a break/ulceration in the protective mucosal lining of the lower oesophagus, stomach or duodenum. This term encompasses both gastric and duodenal ulcers. Peptic ulcers occur in those areas of the GI tract exposed to HCL acid and the proteolytic enzyme (pepsin).</p>
                    <p>These can occur in any area of the gastrointestinal tract. They are associated with acid pepsin secretions. The ulcers can occur in the oesophagus, stomach or any part of the intestines particularly the duodenum. May be you have heard of such terms as gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.</p>
                    <h6>Risk factors for peptic ulcer</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smoking</li>
                        <li>Habitual use of non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs</li>
                        <li>Alcohol</li>
                        <li>Chronic diseases</li>
                        <li>Infections of the gastric and duodenal mucosa and helicobacter pylori</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The predisposing factors to peptic ulceration are related to imbalance between acid and pepsin production, and the mucosal barrier. Destruction of the mucosal barrier leads to ulceration. Increased acid-pepsin production is associated with increased numbers of acid producing cells and increased sensitivity of parietal cells to stimuli like alcohol, caffeine and so on.</p>
                    <p>Lack of gastric secretion inhibition and excessive stimulation of the vagus nerve are also associated with increased stimulation. A gastrin secreting tumour of the pancreas causes the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Once the gastric juice is produced, it affects the gastric mucosal barrier. The bacteria Helicobacter Pylori has also been associated with peptic ulceration in the stomach. It is thought that once ulceration occurs, the bacteria colonise the ulcer and make the healing process difficult.</p>
                    <h6>Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome</h6>
                    <p>This is a rare condition caused by a gastric secreting tumour. Gastric acid secretion reaches such levels that ulceration becomes inevitable. The increased gastric secretions cause symptoms related to peptic ulcer. Diarrhoea may result from hypersecretion or from inactivation of intestinal lipase and impaired fat digestion. Diagnosis is based on elevated serum gastric levels. Proton pump inhibitors are used to control gastric acid secretions.</p>
                    <p>Uncomplicated peptic ulcer manifests with discomfort and pain, which occurs when the stomach is empty. The pain is at the epigastrium and radiates to the back. Patients can also pass loose tarry stools. The ulcer can complicate with haemorrhage, intestinal obstruction and perforation. You will now learn how to manage this disorder.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h6>Types of Peptic Ulcer</h6>
                    <p><strong>Oesophageal Peptic Ulcers:</strong> These are erosions or ulcerations of oesophageal mucosa which can occur in patients with reflux oesophagitis. Presence of an incompetent lower oesophageal sphincter or hiatal hernia predispose to reflux of acidic gastric contents into the lower portion of the oesophagus, which then causes the erosion.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clinical Manifestations:</strong> Heart burn, Epigastric distress that may radiate to the back or lower abdomen, Oesophageal structure (due to recurrent oesphagitis and replacement of mucosa with scar tissue).</p>
                    <p><strong>Gastric Ulcers:</strong> They can develop on any part of the stomach and occur about equally in males and females. Patients with gastric ulcers are generally older than patients with duodenal ulcers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> Gastric ulcers frequently develop in the antrum of the stomach and usually the ulcer is round or oval shaped and has the appearance of a punched-out cavity with an inflammatory base. The primary defect is usually an abnormality that increases the mucosal barrier permeability to hydrogen ions.</p>
                    <p>Other factors in the causation of gastric ulcers include: Duodenal reflux of bile, Use of ulcerogenic drugs, Decreased mucosal synthesis of prostaglandins, Chronic gastritis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Duodenal Ulcers:</strong> Ulcers involving the duodenum are common than gastric ulcers. Duodenal ulcers are characteristically deep, penetrating through the submucosal layers of the intestinal wall. Duodenal ulcers tend to develop in younger persons and in persons with type O blood.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> These ulcers may result from increased gastric acid secretion, defective duodenal alkalinisation or decreased resistance of the duodenal mucosa to acid. Stress with its activation of the autonomic nervous system and increase in acid secretion may aggravate ulcer disease or encourage ulcer development. Other factors associated with duodenal ulcer disease include cigarette smoking, cirrhosis and chronic renal failure.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h6>Clinical Manifestations of Peptic Ulcers</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Epigastric pain which may radiate to the lower abdomen, sternum or back.</li>
                        <li>Pain follows a pain-food-relief cycle (food relieves the pain by buffering HCL).</li>
                        <li>Pain occurs one to three hours after a meal and is relieved by food or antacid.</li>
                        <li>Pain associated with gastric ulcers located high in the epigastrium and occurs spontaneously about one to two hours after a meal.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If the ulcer has eroded through the gastric mucosa food tends to aggravate rather than alleviate the pain. In duodenal ulcers the pain usually occurs two to four hrs after meals and is relieved by antacids and foods that neutralise and dilute HCL acid.</p>
                    <h6>Complications of Peptic Ulcer</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Intractability</li>
                        <li>Haemorrhage</li>
                        <li>Perforation</li>
                        <li>Stenosis and obstruction</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h6>Diagnosis of Peptic Ulcer</h6>
                    <p>This is done by endoscopy and barium studies.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h5>Caring for the Adult with Peptic Ulcers</h5>
                    <p>When planning care for the patient with peptic ulceration, the goals of care should include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduction of pain and discomfort</li>
                        <li>Reduction in complications</li>
                        <li>Complete healing of the peptic ulcer</li>
                        <li>Changes in the lifestyle which led to the ulcer</li>
                        <li>Compliance with management regime</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Conservative management is done by giving the patient adequate bed rest, a bland diet of six small meals a day and stress reduction. The patient should cease smoking. They will also be given drugs that will protect the ulcer, neutralise the acid, or decrease the production of acid. The drugs are antacids, H2 receptor blocking agents, anticholinergics, cytoprotective drugs, sodiumpotassium ATPase inhibitors and misoprostol.</p>
                    <p>The patient with acute exacerbation and no accompanying complications requires nil per oral. They also requires naso-gastric suction and bed rest to moderate light activity. They should receive IV fluids, medication and sedation.</p>
                    <h6>Drug Therapy</h6>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Antacids</strong> - they decrease gastric acidity and acid content of chyme reaching the duodenum.</li>
                        <li><strong>Histamin H2 - receptor antagonists.</strong> These include cimetidine (tagamet), ranitidine (zantac), famotidine (pepcid) and nizatidine (axid). These drugs block the action of histamine on the H 2 receptors and this reduce HCL secretion and accelerates ulcer healing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Proton pump inhibitors</strong> - These include omeprazole (prilosec), lansoprazole (pruscacid) and pantoprazole (pantoloc). They block the ATPase enzyme that is important for the secretion of gastric acid.</li>
                        <li><strong>Antibiotic therapy</strong> - This is given when presence of helicobacter pylon has been confirmed.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h6>Other Drug Therapies</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cytoprotective drugs e.g. sucralfate.</strong> It accelerates ulcer healing as a result of the formation of an ulcer adherent complex that protects the ulcer from erosion by pepsin, acid and bile salts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Colloidal bismuth</strong> facilitates healing of peptic ulcer and is thought to be partially effective against Helicobacter pylori infection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Misoprostol (cytotec)</strong> is a synthetic prostaglandin that has protective and some antisecretory effects on gastric mucosa.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <h5>Cancer of the Stomach</h5>
                    <p>This is also a common neoplasm in many populations. Malignant tumors of the stomach may be present for a long time and may have spread to adjacent organs before any distressing symptoms occur. In this case the tumour may have grown to large dimensions without obstructing the lumen of the stomach because the lumen is large. This delay is attributed to the vague intermittent experienced by the patient. Diagnosis can be confirmed from a biopsy obtained through gastroscopy.</p>
                    <h6>Clinical manifestations include:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Signs and symptoms of anaemia, this is due to chronic blood loss or as a result of pernicious anaemia</li>
                        <li>Symptoms similar to those of peptic ulcer disease</li>
                        <li>Vague epigastric fullness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, haematemisis</li>
                        <li>The stool may be positive for occult blood</li>
                        <li>Poor appetite and weight loss</li>
                        <li>An abdominal mass can be detected beneath the abdominal wall</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The patient with cancer of the stomach may require surgery and adjuvant therapy in the form of radiation, chemotherapy or a combination of these. The surgical aim is to remove as much of the stomach as is necessary to remove the tumour and a margin of normal tissue. The condition is common in the elderly. These patients may be unfit for surgery in many cases hence the need for conservative management. The nutritional management may require that the patient have a stoma for delivery of food to the stomach. Nutrition, fluid and electrolyte balance, and treatment of anaemia are all very important.</p>

                    <h5>Peritonitis</h5>
                    <p>Peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneum that occurs as a result of bacterial or chemical contamination. It can result from entry of gastrointestinal cavity into the peritoneal cavity following perforation along the GI tract or in any of the abdominal organs. Other causes are postoperative complications and abdominal trauma. The organisms that are commonly associated with peritonitis include Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci and pseudomonas.</p>
                    <h6>Clinical manifestations include:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Patient may present with fever, nausea and vomiting</li>
                        <li>The abdomen is rigid and tender to touch. Pain is usually intensified on movement.</li>
                        <li>Abdominal distension may be present due to movement of fluid into the abdominal cavity.</li>
                        <li>Signs of shock may be present e.g. tachycardia, low blood pressure, tachypnoea</li>
                        <li>Patient may have hiccups due to irritation of the phrenic nerve.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Management of peritonitis aims at arresting the infection, relieving abdominal pain and correcting fluid and electrolyte imbalance. If peritonitis is a result of perforation, surgical intervention is indicated to close the intestinal wall and to remove exudative material from the peritoneum.</p>

                    <h5>Disorders of the Small and Large Intestines and their Management</h5>
                    <p>Many disorders disrupt the normal functioning of the small and large intestines. They include inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, appendicitis and cancer of the bowel and rectum. Inflammatory bowel diseases include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These are rare conditions whose causes are not known but which are thought to affect other organs.</p>
                    <h6>Crohn's Disease</h6>
                    <p>This is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any segment of the Gl tract. It may occur at any age and being chronic, it is marked by exacerbations and remissions. The cause is unknown. It commonly affects the distal ileum which is characterised by a slow intestinal flow and therefore increased exposure of the intestinal epithelium to irritants. All layers of the intestinal wall are affected and this predisposes patients to fistula formation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clinical manifestations include:</strong> Crohn's disease manifests with intermittent diarrhoea, pain, weight loss, malaise and sometimes fever. Depending upon the area of intestine involved, the stool may contain occult blood. Where there is involvement of the upper GIT, symptoms similar to those of peptic ulcer disease may be experienced. Malnutrition may be present when the distal small intestine is involved due to inadequate absorption of nutrients.</p>
                    <p><strong>Management:</strong> Treatment is aimed at reducing inflammation and infection and alleviating symptoms. This is achieved by use of antimicrobial drugs and steroids. The patient needs a high calorie, high vitamin, high protein, low residue and milk free diet. Complications include perforation, fistula formation, haemorrhage, toxic megacolon, obstruction, malabsorption and susceptibility to neoplasia.</p>

                    <h6>Ulcerative Colitis</h6>
                    <p>This inflammatory disease affects the colon and the rectum. The inflammation is usually limited to the mucosal and sub mucosal layers of theintestinal wall.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clinical Manifestations:</strong> These include diarrhoea, which is sometimes bloody. Other symptoms include pus in the stool, lower abdominal pain and abdominal tenderness. The patient may also present with fever, anorexia, weight loss, nausea and vomiting.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p><strong>Management:</strong> The patient with ulcerative colitis will be managed and cared for depending on whether their case is considered mild, or whether they presented with severe disease. The patient with mild disease requires a low roughage diet, and no milk or milk products. They receive antimicrobial drugs, corticosteriod to decrease inflammation, and anti-cholinergics and antidiarrhoea drugs.</p>
                    <p>Those with severe disease may be given IV fluids with electrolytes, blood transfusion, NPO status, NG use and low suction in addition to the measures that have been mentioned for mild disease. If there is no improvement, these patients may be operated on and have a colostomy.</p>

                    <h6>Appendicitis</h6>
                    <p>Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. This is a common disorder in the five to 30 years age group. The cause is not clear but is related to obstruction or twisting of the appendix. In appendicitis, all layers of the wall of the appendix are inflamed. The obstruction usually results in swelling and inflammation and it can result to gangrene and perforation. In case of perforation, peritonitis occurs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clinical Manifestations:</strong> At the onset, the patient may have low grade fever. Abdominal pain is initially peri-umbilical but gradually localises to the right lower quadrant. Other features include rebound tenderness, vomiting and an elevated white blood cell count.</p>
                    <p><strong>Management:</strong> This involves surgical removal of the appendicitis (appendicectomy). Nursing care should aim at pain relief, maintaining vital signs within normal limits, preventing infections and ensuring that the patient returns to routine dietary intake, activity level and normal bowel function.</p>

                    <h6>Cancer of the Colon</h6>
                    <p>Tumours of the colon are relatively common and their incidence increases with age. In most cases, the patients are asymptomatic for long periods and only seek medical help when they notice a change in bowel habits or rectal bleeding.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Risk Factors of Colon Cancer</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age (40 years)</li>
                        <li>Blood in the stool</li>
                        <li>History of rectal polyps</li>
                        <li>Family history of colon cancer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Management:</strong> The tumour site and extent determine the surgical approach to be used in treatment of the carcinoma. When the tumour is removed, the involved colon is excised for some distance on each side of the growth to remove the tumour and the area of its lymphatic spread. The intestine is then re-united by an end-to-end anastomosis of the colon. It the tumour is located low in the sigmoid or rectum, the colon is cut above the growth and brought out through the abdominal wall. This abdominal anus is called a colostomy. Radiation is recommended for lesions that may not be operable. A combination of radiation and chemotherapy has been shown to result in longer survival rates.</p>

                    <h6>Care of a Patient with a Colostomy</h6>
                    <p>Before the procedure, the patient requires psychosocial support in order to accept a colostomy and adjust to a new life style. This support is necessary given that the patient and their family are dealing with two issues; diagnosis of cancer and the shock of a colostomy. Prior to the surgery, intestinal antibiotics may be given to reduce the bacterial content of the colon. Mechanical cleansing may be done by use of laxatives, enemas or colonic irrigation. Preoperative nasogastric intubation facilitates performance of intestinal surgery and minimises post operative distension. An indwelling catheter is inserted to ensure that the bladder is empty during surgery.</p>
                    <p>After surgery, the patient should be monitored for signs of complications which include prolapse of the stoma, perforation, leakage from an anastomotic site, stoma retraction, faecal impaction, skin irritation and pulmonary complications. The colostomy is opened on the second or third post operative day.</p>
                    <p>Since the stoma on the abdomen doesn't have voluntary muscular control, emptying may occur at irregular intervals. This can be regulated by irrigation or by training the bowel to evacuate naturally without irrigation. This usually depends on an individual and on the nature of the colostomy. Irrigating a colostomy aids in emptying the colon of gas, mucus and faeces. When this is done regularly, there is less retention of gas and irritating fluids. Irrigation is best done after a meal as ingestion of food usually stimulates defaecation. The peristomial skin should be washed frequently to avoid irritation.</p>

                    <h5>Acute Abdomen</h5>
                    <p>This term refers to a group of abdominal conditions for which prompt surgical treatment must be considered to treat perforation, peritonitis, vascular and other intra-abdominal catastrophes.</p>
                    <h6>Causes of acute abdomen include:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bowel</strong> - Acute appendicitis, perforated peptic ulcer, diverticular disease, intestinal obstruction and strangulation</li>
                        <li><strong>Vascular</strong> - Acute vascular insufficiency, ruptured aortic aneurysm</li>
                        <li><strong>Gynaecological</strong> - Ruptured ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst, acute salpingitis</li>
                        <li><strong>Others</strong> - Cholecystitis, pancreatitis, penetrating injury</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                    <p>Abdominal pain is the most prominent symptom with the pain being localised to the area of abdomen affected. Other features depend on the underlying cause.</p>
                    <h6>Management</h6>
                    <p>The emergency management of the patient with acute abdomen involves monitoring the airway, administering oxygen, establishing intravenous access and monitoring vital signs. An indwelling catheter should be inserted. Pain, intake and output should be monitored while observing for vomiting. The specific nursing interventions will depend on the medical or surgical management of the client.</p>
                    <p>Acute abdomen as a result of gynaecological problems would require the management to focus on the cause. The patient with abdominal trauma should receive the same management as indicated for acute abdomen. In addition they may undergo exploratory laparotomy and any other operations that are necessary. You should, therefore, provide these patients with pre and postoperative care.</p>
                    <p>Adults with peritonitis and inflammatory bowel diseases receive fluid replacement, antibiotic therapy, NG suction, analgesics and preparation for surgery. They may also require total parenteral nutrition in addition. Post operatively, the patient receives nil per oral and low intermittent suction. Always nurse the patient in Semi-Fowler's position. The patient should be on fluid replacement, antibiotics and sedations.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h5>Disordered Motility</h5>
                    <h6>Diarrhoea</h6>
                    <p>The most common disorders of the gastrointestinal tract in our setup are those that result in disordered motility. Diarrhoea is one of the disorders. This is excessive passage of loose stools that take the shape of the container. It can result from lactase deficiency, excess bile salts or fatty acids in the gut and bacterial growth.</p>
                    <h6>Constipation</h6>
                    <p>This is decrease in the frequency of passing stools. It can be caused by failure to respond to the urge, decreased fibre content in food, decreased fluid intake, weakened abdominal wall muscles, haemorrhoids, and certain drugs like the aluminium containing antacids.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <h5>Anal Rectal Problems and Haemorrhoids</h5>
                    <p>These include anorectal abscess, fistula in ano, fissure in ano and haemorrhoids.</p>
                    <h6>Anorectal Abscess</h6>
                    <p>This is an infection localised in the anorectal region. The abscess is often painful and contains foul smelling pus. For superficial abscesses, swelling, tenderness and redness are observed. Deeper abscesses result in toxic symptoms, lower abdominal pains and fever. Fistulas may result from the abscesses. The abscess can be incised and drained surgically. Palliative therapy consists of sitz baths and analgesics.</p>
                    <h6>Fissure in Ano</h6>
                    <p>This refers to a longitudinal ulcer in the anal canal. They are caused by diarrhoeal stools and persistent tightening of the anal canal. They can also occur during child birth, trauma to after cathartic abuse. There is usually pain and bleeding during defaecation. These usually heal on their own though minor surgery for repair may be necessary in others. Stool softeners and increased intake of water helps in easing the defaecation process. A suppository combining an anaesthetic with steroid may be comforting.</p>
                    <h6>Fistula in Ano</h6>
                    <p>This is a tiny tubular tract that extends into the anal canal from an opening located outside the anus. Fistulectomy is the recommended surgical procedure for repair of the fistula.</p>
                    <h6>Haemorrhoids</h6>
                    <p>These are varicose veins in the anal canal. Those occurring above the internal sphincter are referred to as internal haemorrhoids and those appearing outside the external sphincter are called external haemorrhoids.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clinical Features and Management:</strong> Haemorrhoids cause itching, bleeding during bowel movements and pain. Internal haemorrhoids are usually not painful until they prolapse or bleed due to enlargement. Symptoms of discomfort are relieved by personal hygiene and avoiding excessive straining during defaecation. Straining can be reduced through intake of a diet that contains roughage and increased fluid intake.</p>
                    <p>Ice packs alternated with warm packs are useful for thrombosed haemorrhoids. Internal haemorrhoids can be legated in addition to anal dilatation. A patient whose problem persists may have to have surgical excisions of the haemorrhoids. Nursing care must include pain management, teaching the patient to avoid prolonged standing or sitting, use of sitz baths and stool softeners.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h5>Malabsorption</h5>
                    <p>This is a term which refers to the failure to transport substances like proteins, vitamins, fats or carbohydrates from the lumen of the intestines to be used by the body. The condition may affect only one constituent or many. It can also be due to surgery to some parts of the gut or the disorders mentioned earlier; Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Symptoms include fatty diarrhoea, weight loss, abdominal pain and flatulence. These patients need supplementation of the required nutrients. When the disease is severe, surgery is performed.</p>

                    <h5>Intestinal Obstruction</h5>
                    <p>Intestinal obstruction is a condition that can be considered as part of acute abdomen. However, because of the increasing frequency with which it occurs, this will be covered separately. Intestinal obstruction can either be caused by mechanical obstruction due to hernia, twisting of intestines, faecal impaction, tumours or adhesions or by paralytic ileus, which sometimes follows abdominal surgery or peritonitis.</p>
                    <p>When there is obstruction, the blockage leads to strangulation and formation of gangrenous tissue. There follows pain, constipation, abdominal distension and vomiting. At first, the intestines try to remove the obstruction by hyper-peristalsis. Abdominal sounds can be heard at this time as rumbles. Later the rumbling disappears with strangulation. The pain also changes character. There is abdominal rigidity; the patient is weak, anxious and restless. This condition requires urgent attention before the gut becomes gangrenous.</p>
                    <h6>Management of Intestinal Obstruction</h6>
                    <p>In the patient with intestinal obstruction, treatment and care is directed towards decompression of the intestines by removal of gas and fluid. Correction and maintenance of fluids and electrolyte balance and relief or removal of the obstruction is also necessary. An NG tube is fixed and enemas, rectal tubes, sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy may be used. In most mechanical obstructions, necrosis is present. This, therefore, means that surgery is inevitable.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you perform such procedures as gastric lavage, NG tube fixing, giving enema, irrigation and care of colostomies and ileostomies you must remember to obtain informed consent from the patient.</p>
                    <p>The post-operative care of a patient who has gastric surgery should focus on assessing the wound or stoma, protecting the skin, and assisting the patient to adapt physiologically and psychologically to their wounds. The patient's nutrition is also an important aspect. You must ensure that the patient receives all the necessary nutrients.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h5>Disorders of the Liver</h5>
                    <p>Normal function of the liver is disrupted when regeneration of hepatocytes does not keep up with damage resulting in hepatocellular failure and also when there is gradual replacement of damaged cells with fibrous tissue. Diseases that lead to hepatocellular dysfunction may be caused by bacteria and viruses. Other causes include metabolic disorders, toxins and drugs and nutritional deficiencies. Once the liver cells have been destroyed, cell regeneration can occur only if the disease process is not too toxic for the cells. The end result of chronic damage is a shrunken fibrotic liver.</p>
                    <p>Manifestations of liver disease are mainly due to an alteration of metabolic and excretory functions of the liver. Jaundice is present due to an increase in serum bilirubin levels. Abnormal protein metabolism results in decreased serum albumin concentration and oedema. Serum ammonia levels increase leading to signs of central nervous impairment. Ascites occurs due to increased portal vein blood pressure which results in leakage of fluid into the peritoneal cavity. The patient may also have easy bleeding due to lack of production of blood clotting factors.</p>
                    <p>Acute liver damage may be completely reversible or may progress to cirrhosis whereby the parenchymal cells are replaced with fibrotic tissue. When the ability of the liver to carry out its excretory and metabolic function falls below the needs of the body, the patient is said to be in Liver failure. Hepatic coma results when liver dysfunction is so severe that the liver is unable to remove end products of metabolism from the blood stream.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <h6>Acute Hepatitis</h6>
                    <p>This may be a result of viral infection or ingestion of toxic substances.</p>
                    <p><strong>Viral Infections:</strong> Hepatitis A, also called infectious hepatitis is caused by the Hepatitis A virus and is transmitted through the fecal oral route. The incubation period is 15 to 40 days and the viruses are excreted in feaces. It is commonly transmitted sexually in homosexual men.</p>
                    <p>Hepatitis B, also called serum hepatitis is the more serious of the viral hepatitis. The incubation period is 50 to 180 days. It is spread by blood and blood products, thus making it common among persons whose occupation involves contact with blood and blood products and also among intravenous drug addicts and male homosexuals. The virus is also spread by body fluids e.g. saliva, semen, vaginal secretions and from the mother to the foetus. Infection usually leads to severe illness lasting 2 to 6 weeks. On infection, antibodies are formed and immunity persists after recovery. Type B virus may cause massive liver necrosis and death. This condition can result in hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis.</p>
                    <p>Hepatitis C virus is also spread by blood and blood products and is therefore prevalent in IV drug abusers. The infection can be asymptomatic but when hepatitis develops, it is often recurrent and may result in chronic liver disease.</p>
                    <p><strong>Toxic substances:</strong> The extent of the damage usually depends on the dose and duration of exposure. Some substances also cause liver damage while others do so only when hypersensitivity occurs. Alcohol toxicity also causes hepatitis. This occurs after chronic abuse of alcohol and the symptoms include jaundice, hepatomegally, anorexia and malaise.</p>
                    <h6>Chronic Hepatitis</h6>
                    <p>This is where hepatitis persists for more than 6 months.</p>
                    <h6>Diagnosis of Liver Disease</h6>
                    <p>Liver function is measured using liver function tests. However, these tests are not sensitive indicators as many other disorders can influence the results. On physical examination, the liver of a patient with cirrhosis is small and hard, while the liver of a patient with acute hepatitis is quite soft. Tenderness of the liver is a sign of recent acute enlargement with consequent stretching of the liver capsule. The absence of tenderness may imply that the enlargement is longstanding. The liver of a patient with viral hepatitis is tender, while that of a patient with alcoholic hepatitis is not. Liver enlargement is an abnormal finding that requires further evaluation. Liver biopsy facilitates sampling of the liver tissue by needle aspiration and this aids in diagnosis of hepatic disorders.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <h6>Liver Cirrhosis</h6>
                    <p>This is a disease characterised by fibrosis and formation of abnormal nodules of liver tissue. The disorder is commonly associated with alcoholism, but it can also follow such other conditions as hepatitis, toxic reactions, and iron and copper deposition. Cirrhosis can be post necrotic, that is, following an infection like viral hepatitis or it can be biliary which is preceded by obstruction to bile flow.</p>
                    <p>Patients present with pruritus, hepatomegally, pain, ascitis and easy bleeding because of decreased production of clotting factors. Toxic substances of metabolism will also accumulate and patients can have many other symptoms. Anaemia, peripheral oedema, oliguria, malabsorption, drug toxicities and hepatic encephalopathy develop. These manifestations affect the endocrine system, skin and haematological functions. It therefore, requires serious consideration during management.</p>
                    <h6>Management of Liver Disease</h6>
                    <p>Viral hepatitis is treated with a low protein, high carbohydrate and low-fat diet. Vitamin supplements and rest will help the patient recover faster. No drugs are given to these patients because the liver may be unable to metabolise them. However, supportive therapy can be included. General infection prevention measures are necessary to avoid the spread of viral hepatitis. Immunisation and use of immune globulin may also be useful.</p>
                    <p>Toxic and drug induced hepatitis are largely managed with support to the patient in terms of nutrition, rest, fluids and electrolyte monitoring. The patient with liver cirrhosis needs at least 300 calories in the diet per day. High carbohydrate intake, low proteins (depending on the stage), low fat diet, low sodium (for the patient with ascitis) is all indicated.</p>
                    <p>Should the condition get worse, proteins should be limited to avoid accumulation of ammonia in the body leading to hepatic encephalopathy. This particular patient should receive complete bed rest, diuretics and B-complex vitamins. They should abstain from alcohol totally.</p>
                    <p>The complications of cirrhosis that should be managed at the same time are portal hypertension and oesophageal varices, peripheral oedema, ascitis, hepatic encephalopathy and the hepatorenal syndrome.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <h6>Portal Hypertension</h6>
                    <p>This is a condition characterised by an elevation of portal venous pressure. Portal venous pressure is determined by the portal blood flow and the portal vascular resistance. In many instances, increased vascular resistance is usually the main factor in the aetiology of portal hypertension. In childhood, extrahepatic portal vein obstruction is frequently the cause of portal hypertension while in adults, cirrhosis is the main cause. Schistosomiasis also causes portal hypertension in endemic areas.</p>
                    <p>Increased portal vascular resistance results in a gradual reduction in the flow of portal blood to the liver and simultaneously to the development of collateral vessels which allow portal blood to bypass the liver and enter the systemic circulation directly. Collateral vessel formation is widespread but occurs predominantly in the GIT, mainly in the oesophagus, stomach, rectum, anterior abdominal wall and in the renal, ovarian and testicular vasculature.</p>
                    <p>Clinical features result from portal venous congestion and from collateral vessel formation. These include splenomegally and hypersplenism. Collateral vessels may be visible on the anterior abdominal wall and occasionally radiate from the umbilicus to from a caput medusae. Collateral vessels in the stomach, oesophagus and rectum cause bleeding. This condition can lead to ascites, renal failure and hepatic encephalopathy. Diagnosis of portal hypertension is via ultrasonography and portal venography.</p>
                    <h6>Hepatic Encephalopathy</h6>
                    <p>This is a neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by liver disease that is thought to result from accumulation of toxic substances such as ammonia within the brain. This occurs when these substances are not metabolised in the liver as occurs in cirrhosis.</p>
                    <p>Clinical features include changes of intellect, personality, emotions and consciousness, with or without neurological signs. In early stages, features are mild but as the condition becomes more severe, the patient has inability to concentrate, confusion, disorientation, drowsiness, slurring of speech and sometimes convulsions. Overt psychosis and convulsions may also occur.</p>
                    <p>Episodes of encephalopathy are usually reversible until terminal stages of cirrhosis. In managing this condition, the aim is to reduce or eliminate protein intake, and to suppress production of neurotoxins by bacteria in the bowel. Lactulose is also given and it produces an osmotic laxative effect, reduces the pH of the colonic content thereby limiting colonic ammonia absorption and promotes the incorporation of nitrogen into the bacteria. Neomycin is also used as it acts by reducing the bowel flora.</p>

                    <h5>Diseases of the Gall Bladder</h5>
                    <p>The gall bladder is most commonly affected by gallstones (cholelithiasis) and inflammation (cholecystitis). Gallstones are formed through precipitation of constituents of bile. Abnormal composition of bile, stasis of bile and inflammation of the gallbladder contribute to the process of precipitation. Gallstones start manifesting symptoms when they block the ducts. Pain is common.</p>
                    <p>Factors that predispose to gallstones include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Changes in bile composition</li>

                    <p>Diagnosis of gallstones is by ultrasonography, cholecystography and percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography. Complications of cholelithiasis include biliary colic, inflammation and inpaction. Cholelithiasis commonly occurs together with cholecystitis. The manifestations of cholecystitis include: Intolerance of fatty foods, Belching, Vomiting, Jaundice, Fever.</p>
                    <p>Cholecystitis can be acute or chronic. If chronic, it can contribute to cancer of the gall bladder.</p>
                    <h6>Care of the Patient with Gall Bladder Disease</h6>
                    <p>The management of an adult with gall bladder disease should start with a primary assessment. The patient with cholelithiasis (gall stones) may be put either on conservative or surgical treatment. Conservatively IV fluids, nil per oral, NG tube feeding, low fat diet, antiemetics, analgesics and fat soluble vitamins (ADE and K) are used. Anticholinergics, bile salts, antibiotics and bile acid therapy will benefit the patient. The Anticholinergics will affect the contraction of the bile duct.</p>
                    <p>The surgical management involves cholecystectomy. When one has cholecystitis, treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic. For instance, if nausea and vomiting are severe, gastric decompression is done to prevent gall bladder stimulation. Anticholinergic and analgesics may be given to these patients to decrease the pain.</p>

                    <h5>Pancreatitis</h5>
                    <p>Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas. Acute pancreatitis is when the structure and function of the pancreas usually return to normal after the acute attack. Chronic pancreatitis results in permanent abnormalities of pancreatic function. Acute pancreatitis occurs after digestion of this organ by the very enzymes it produces, especially trypsin. Other associated causes of pancreatitis include bacterial or viral infections, blunt abdominal trauma, ischemic vascular disease and use of drugs such corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, narcotics and thiazide diuretics.</p>
                    <h6>Management of Pancreatitis</h6>
                    <p>The objectives of therapeutic management of acute pancreatitis include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Relief of pain</li>
                        <li>Prevention or treatment of shock</li>
                        <li>Reduction of pancreatic secretions</li>
                        <li>Control of fluids and electrolyte balance</li>
                        <li>Prevention and treatment of infection</li>
                        <li>Removal of the precipitating cause</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The patient should therefore minimise physical activity through bed rest, receive a strong analgesic, nil per oral with NG tube suction, and IV fluids. The use of anti-cholonergic drugs can decrease pain.</p>
                    <p>The patient with chronic pancreatitis requires prevention of attacks and frequent doses of analgesics. Pancreatic exocrine and endocrine insufficiency should be assessed and modes of management considered. Diet, pancreatic enzyme replacement and control of the diabetes are measures used to control the insufficiency. The patient may not tolerate fatty, rich and stimulating foods and, these must be avoided. You should stress that the patients avoid alcohol totally. Antacids and anti-cholinergic drugs are given to decrease hydrochloric acid secretion. Surgery may be used to treat chronic pancreatitis. Patients who have surgery should have replacement of the hormones.</p>
