                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Nursing practice involves the application of knowledge and skills that improve an individual's level of health. In view of this, all nurses, regardless of their level of educational preparation, learn basic skills that are fundamental to the practice of nursing.</p>
                        <p>In unit one of this module you studied the definition of nursing. The American Nurses Association (1980) states that, "Nursing is the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to actual or potential health problems. Nursing involves skills that are beneficial to sick or well individuals."</p>
                        <p>You are being prepared to provide services in many diverse settings such as hospitals, schools, industry and home care.</p>
                        <p>The major goals of nursing are to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Promote health and prevent diseases</li>
                            <li>Restore health</li>
                            <li>Relieve suffering</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nursing skills help patients to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Breathe normally</li>
                            <li>Eat and drink adequately</li>
                            <li>Eliminate body wastes</li>
                            <li>Move and maintain desirable postures</li>
                            <li>Sleep and rest</li>
                            <li>Select suitable clothing, dress and undress</li>
                            <li>Maintain body temperature within normal range by adjusting clothing and modifying the environment</li>
                            <li>Keep the body clean and well groomed and protect the integument</li>
                            <li>Communicate with others in expressing emotions, needs fears or options</li>
                            <li>Worship according to ones faith</li>
                            <li>Work in such a way that there is a sense of accomplishment</li>
                            <li>Play or participate in various forms of recreation</li>
                            <li>Learn, discover and satisfy the curiosity that leads to normal health and use of the available health facilities</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the provision of comprehensive care you will be required to apply sciences such as anatomy, physiology, sociology and psychology. You will also be required to incorporate certain skills such as assessment, caring, counselling, and comforting skills.</p>

                        <h4>Basic Guidelines when Transferring a Patient</h4>
                        <p>Certain techniques are used when transferring a patient to help prevent injury to the patient as well as to the nurse. The basic recommended guidelines for you to follow are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Know the patient's diagnosis, capabilities, weaknesses and any movement they are not allowed to undertake.</li>
                            <li>Put on braces and other devices a patient may use before getting them out of bed.</li>
                            <li>Plan exactly what will be done while transferring a patient so that appropriate techniques will be utilised. This is because without planning you or the patient may acquire an injury.</li>
                            <li>Explain to the patient what will be done. Then use the patients ability to assist as much as possible to reduce the workload on you, the nurse.</li>
                            <li>Remove obstacles that may make transferring more difficult prior to transferral.</li>
                            <li>Elevate the patient's bed as necessary so that work is being done at a safe and comfortable level.</li>
                            <li>Lock the wheels of the bed, wheelchair or stretcher to prevent them from sliding as the patient is moved.</li>
                            <li>Observe sound principles of body mechanics so that muscles are not strained and injured.</li>
                            <li>Be sure to keep the patients in proper alignment during transfer procedures so that the patient is also protected from strain and muscle injury.</li>
                            <li>Support the patient's body, especially near the joints. Avoid grabbing and holding extremely by the muscles, which will injure tissues and often put unnecessary strain on joints.</li>
                            <li>Avoid causing friction on the patient's skin. Roll or push the patient when possible rather than pull them across bed linens. Friction can be reduced by sprinkling powder or cornstarch on the patient's skin and linens.</li>
                            <li>Use smooth rather than jerky movements when transferring the patient. Jerky motion tends to put extra strain on muscles and joints and is uncomfortable for the patient.</li>
                            <li>Be realistic about how much you can safely do without injury.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Transferring a Patient To and From a Stretcher</h4>
                        <p>You must take great care, when transferring a helpless patient, to prevent injuring the patient and yourself. The extremities and the head must be supported well. The most convenient way to move a patient is to place a sheet underneath them, then pull carefully on the sheet under the patient to another point, such as from a bed to a stretcher and from a stretcher back to a bed. When a patient must be lifted and carried, a three-carrier lift is recommended.</p>

                        <h4>Transferring a Patient From a Bed to a Chair and Back to Bed</h4>
                        <p>The chair in which a patient sits should make it possible for them to maintain good posture. If a patient can assist and stand while they are being transferred from a bed to a chair or wheel chair, use the following techniques:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use equipment with firm and stable surfaces. If the mattress is soft and the patient sinks into it, place a bed board under it before transferring the patient to a chair or wheelchair.</li>
                            <li>Take the patient's condition into account.</li>
                            <li>Make distance for transferring as short as possible.</li>
                            <li>Place the chair or wheel chair parallel to and near to the head of the bed. Be sure that the wheels of a wheelchair are locked and the foot supports are in the upright position.</li>
                            <li>Place the short bed rails in the up position so that the patient can grasp a rail to sit up in bed and steady their self as they move.</li>
                            <li>Stand on the side of the bed on which the patient will be moving. Do not reach across the bed to assist the patient. Help the patient to a sitting position.</li>
                            <li>Allow the patient to sit a few seconds until you are sure they are not feeling faint.</li>
                            <li>Pivot the patient appropriately as they sit at the side of the bed. If they are going to walk, help them put on shoes and stockings. Hard soled and well fitting shoes will give them more support than loose, floppy slippers.</li>
                            <li>Place the bed in the low position or have a foot-stool handy on which the patient can stand on as they get out of bed.</li>
                            <li>Face the patient, spread their feet to provide a wide base of support and balance, put one of your feet forward between the patient's feet, and flex the knees to provide stability. The patient puts their hands on your shoulders, while you hold in the ancillary area. Grasping the patient on their chest wall is uncomfortable and restricts breathing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some nurses prefer to lock arms to assist the patient to a standing position. This entails the following procedure:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As the patient's upper body is lifted, ask the patient to lift their self from the bed. If a footstool is used, assist the patient off of it while continuing to hold them.</li>
                            <li>Maintain a wide base of support while pivoting with the patient so that their back is towards the chair.</li>
                            <li>Bend the knees and keep the back straight as the patient is lowered into the chair or wheel chair.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After helping the patient to their feet, you should assist them into their chair. A chair with arms would provide another means for the patient to help support and guide them into the chair. Have the patient assist by holding onto the armrests of the chair or wheelchair if they are available as they are being lowered onto it. When a patient cannot assist with the transfer, for example, a patient cannot stand before they sit in a chair, it is best to have two persons lift the patient from the bed into a chair. One person can do so unless the patient is too heavy.</p>
                        <p>The single person technique is handy for home use and in situations when only one person is available. With the chair near the bed, and while supporting the patient from the back, gently move the helpless patient into the chair. You should have a wide base of support. Bend your knees and rock back as the patient slides to the chair. Place the patient's feet and legs onto the bed first as you roll them off the chair and onto the bed.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>You are conversant with most of the procedures involved in the collection of specimens from patients because you have been performing these procedures. You may have assisted a doctor or clinical officer in the collection of specimens.</p>
                        <p>You have already studied infection prevention and control. During these procedures you will be dealing with body fluids and sharps. You therefore need to apply the knowledge you have acquired on infection prevention to be able to protect yourself, the patient and coworkers. You also need to recall the body structures where the body fluids will be collected from and your knowledge of microbiology. You should not only know the techniques of collecting the specimens but also the interpretation of the findings. The specimens you will study include: blood, urine, stool, swabs and sputum.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Blood Collection</h4>
                        <p>The indications for the collection of blood specimen include: anaemia, infective conditions e.g. septicaemia, severe haemorrhage and so on.</p>
                        <p>A nurse should have a tray containing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Disposable syringes and needles</li>
                            <li>Sterile swabs and spirits swabs in separate containers</li>
                            <li>A receiver for used swabs</li>
                            <li>A rubber tourniquet</li>
                            <li>Assorted specimen containers</li>
                            <li>Strapping</li>
                            <li>A pair of scissors</li>
                            <li>Laboratory request forms</li>
                            <li>Container for sharps</li>
                            <li>Gloves</li>
                            <li>Two blood slides</li>
                            <li>Lancet/needle, which is sterile</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The collection procedure will vary, depending on the type of investigation required. Whatever the case, you will need to prepare the patient, environment, equipment and yourself. The following preparations need to be undertaken:</p>
                        <h5>Patient</h5>
                        <p>Explain the procedure to the patient and put them in a comfortable position.</p>
                        <h5>Environment</h5>
                        <p>Screen the bed. Ensure adequate working place.</p>
                        <h5>Equipment</h5>
                        <p>Wash the tray with soapy water, rinse and dry. Clean with antiseptic swab. Arrange the equipment neatly on the tray and take to the bedside. Label specimen bottles and slides.</p>
                        <h5>Nurse</h5>
                        <p>Wash your hands and put on gloves.</p>
                        <h5>Method of Sample Collection</h5>
                        <p>The following is standard procedure when collecting blood samples from a patient:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Identify the site</li>
                            <li>Apply the tourniquet</li>
                            <li>Decontaminate the skin at the site of puncture</li>

                        <h5>Method</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Call the patient by name. If there is no answer, give a command e.g. 'open your eyes' or 'close your eyes'.</li>
                            <li>If there is no response, record appropriately.</li>
                            <li>If there is no response, press firmly the angle of the jaw below the ear using thumb or prick lightly with a sterile pin and observe facial expression.</li>
                            <li>Record under response to stimuli as 'responding well' or 'not well'.</li>
                            <li>If there is no response, or poor response, record under level of consciousness column as 'deeply unconscious' or 'semiconscious'.</li>
                            <li>To determine muscle tone and strength, ask the patient to grasp and squeeze your hands and compare the strength of each hand.</li>
                            <li>Ask the patient to bend their knees and push feet against your palms and compare response and strength.</li>
                            <li>Open both eyes and note size and shape of each pupil. Also check if both pupils are equal in size and whether they react to light equally.</li>
                            <li>Open the left eye by raising the upper eyelid and shine the torch from lateral side towards the middle of the eye and note the pupil reaction to light. Wait for a few seconds, repeat the process and note reactions. Record response to light of left eye under 'L', if dilated or constricted and reacting or not reacting or sluggish reaction to light as applicable.</li>
                            <li>Repeat the process for right eye and record under 'R'.</li>
                            <li>Take the vital observations and record under appropriate headings.</li>
                            <li>Note and report any change in all observations (it is important to report promptly) to include volume of pulse, depth and regularity of breathing, temporary cessation of breathing.</li>
                            <li>Continue with these observations 1/4 to 1/2 hourly or as indicated by the doctor.</li>
                            <li>Keep the patient comfortable.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Clearing</h5>

                        <h4>Injections</h4>
                        <p>There are several types of injections, that is: intramuscular, hypodermic/subcutaneous and intradermal. Each of these will be covered in turn.</p>
                        <h5>Intramuscular</h5>
                        <p>This injection can be administered on several sites. These include: the upper outer quadrant of the buttock (deep into the muscles); anterior lateral aspect of the thigh and the deltoid muscle in selected cases. The method of injection involves holding the needle at an angle of 90 degrees to the skin.</p>
                        <h5>Hypodermic/Subcutaneous</h5>
                        <p>This injection can be administered on the upper outer arm or thigh (into the connective tissue) or in the abdominal wall. The needle should be held at an angle of 45 degrees to the skin.</p>
                        <h5>Intradermal</h5>
                        <p>An intradermal injection is performed on the dorsum of the forearm. The injected fluid raises a wheal. This is used mainly for BCG, Mantoux test or drug test doses. Stretch the area of the skin between the thumb and finger. Introduce the needle into the skin keeping it parallel to the skin at 10-15 degrees angle. Do not massage the area after removing the needle.</p>

                    <h3 id="iv-heading" class="section-heading">Monitoring Intravenous Fluids</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Intravenous fluids are those solutions instilled within the patient's vein. They may include solutions of water and chemicals normally found within the body, dissolved medications or blood, blood extracts and blood substitutes. You will be expected at times to administer and regulate intravenous fluids. You will also be assigned to care for patients receiving parenteral fluids thereby monitoring the infusion, observing the patient and discontinuing the therapy as necessary.</p>
                        <p><strong>Indications for administering intravenous fluids:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To restore fluid balance quickly when a patient experiences a significant fluid loss</li>
                            <li>To prevent fluid imbalance for a patient who is currently or potentially likely to experience a loss of body fluid</li>
                            <li>To maintain fluid balance when the patient temporarily is unable to eat and drink</li>
                            <li>To replace specific electrolytes or other chemicals such as water soluble vitamins</li>
                            <li>To provide some measure of nutrition</li>
                            <li>To administer medications</li>
                            <li>To replace blood cells or specific components of blood</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You must exercise extreme caution to ensure that the correct solution is infused, because any substance that is instilled directly into the circulatory system produces a rapid effect due to its almost instant distribution throughout the body. There are two categories of intravenous fluids: crystalloid or colloid solutions.</p>
                        <h4>Crystalloid Solutions</h4>
                        <p>Crystalloid solutions are a mixture of water and salt or sugar. They can be further sub-divided into isotonic, hypotonic and hypertonic solutions.</p>
                        <p>An isotonic solution contains an equal amount of dissolved crystals as normally found in plasma.</p>
                        <p>A hypotonic solution contains fewer dissolved crystals than are normally found in plasma. It presents as a dilute solution in comparison to the fluid within and around cells.</p>
                        <p>A hypertonic solution has a higher amount of dissolved crystals than present in plasma. It will draw water into the intravascular compartment from the more dilute areas of water within the cells and interstitial spaces.</p>

                        <p>Normally nursing units stock commonly used intravenous solutions in utility rooms or medication cupboards. Blood and blood products are stored in the blood bank. The preparation of solutions and equipment requires adherence to principles of asepsis. You should therefore practice good hand washing technique, and skills that will prevent contamination of any openings, or equipment that could introduce organisms into the patients' circulatory system.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A terminal illness is one from which recovery is beyond reasonable expectations. The condition contributing to death may be a disease or the result of injury. When a patient is dying, you are faced with dual responsibilities. The patient requires holistic care, while at the same time the patient's family and friends need support, because all persons who have a significant relationship with the patient are dealing with grief.</p>
                        <p>Grief encompasses the physical and emotional feelings related to separation and loss. You will deal with many aspects of the dying and grieving experiences. You will cover the unique emotional, spiritual and physical problems of the terminally ill, and approaches that are hopeful in dealing with anticipatory grief.</p>
                        <p>Most individuals react instinctively when they are personally involved with impending death. Some common reactions among patients, family members and health care professional include denial, avoidance and hope.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Denial</dfn> is a physiological technique in which an individual does not believe certain information to be true.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Avoidance</dfn> is a technique used to separate oneself from situations that are threatening or unpleasant.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Hope</dfn> is the ability to cling to the possibility of a positive outcome against overwhelming odds. Most individuals prefer to deal with death only when it becomes absolutely necessary to do so.</p>

                        <h5>How do you prepare yourself to provide terminal care?</h5>
                        <p>You may have already cared for a terminally ill patient. How did you feel? What were your coping mechanisms? Personal values and attitudes are closely associated with the quality of care you provide. You will explore various aspects of death and dying before being faced with the actual experience.</p>
                        <p>You must understand your personal feelings about death and dying before you provide terminal care. If you neglect to do so, you will avoid involvement and remain detached. The most likely result of this attitude is that the dying person and the family will feel emotionally abandoned and are left to face a very frightening situation alone as you provide care without feelings.</p>
                        <p>Go through the following questions to provoke your thinking about death and dying. Assess your personal feelings. Some good questions to ask yourself are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is my concept of death?</li>
                            <li>Who or what has contributed to my feelings about death?</li>
                            <li>What experiences are especially important to me before I die?</li>
                            <li>Would I want to know that my condition is terminal?</li>
                            <li>If I could control the events that lead to my death what would I want them to be?</li>
                            <li>Whom would I want to be present during my terminal illness?</li>
                            <li>Where would I prefer to die?</li>
                            <li>What fears do I have about death?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Developing a Support System</h5>
                        <p>You should not feel that the burden of care depends solely on you. Other healthy team members may complement and supplement the nursing care of the terminally ill patient and their family. When you feel a sense of support you are in a better position to support others.</p>
                        <p>A support system among peers begins by developing an environment, within which nurses working together know that they can turn to each other. Peer support works best not only when you reach out for the support you need but also recognise when your peers need help and can readily say, "How can I help you?"</p>
                        <p>You will find yourself dealing with ethical and legal issues when caring for a terminally ill patient, such as euthanasia, a living will, and organ donations.</p>
                        <h5>Euthanasia</h5>
                        <p>Euthanasia means an easy death or mercy killing. Euthanasia is considered when death is inevitable and life-saving measures are of questionable benefit.</p>
                        <p>Passive euthanasia uses techniques that relieve pain but do not delay natural death from occurring.</p>
                        <p>Active euthanasia is the deliberate ending of life of an individual who is suffering from an incurable condition. This latter form of euthanasia is illegal.</p>
                        <p>No matter how hopeless the situation is, the patient and their family must remain the focus of attention. They need medical care. Remember, they need time to work through their feelings. There is need for providing quality care and dignity to the dying patient's life. Effective communication must be central to all decisions. When a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order has been given, you should ensure that the following is done:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient and their family must understand the terminal nature of the condition.</li>
                            <li>The patient and their family should receive explanations of the possible alternatives for treatment and the options that are available.</li>
                            <li>Some notation about the discussion with the patient or family should be documented in the progress notes.</li>
                            <li>The patient should make the final decision if they are rational and capable of doing so.</li>
                            <li>The family members should all be involved in the decision, substituting their judgement for what they believe would be the wishes of the patient, should the patient not be capable of making a decision.</li>
                            <li>The order must be written on the patient's permanent record. A verbal order or a telephone order is not sufficient.</li>
                            <li>The order should be reviewed periodically and changed at any time the patient or the family so decides.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>A Living Will</h5>
                        <p>A living will is a written statement describing the wishes of a person concerning their medical care when their death is near. The written document helps guide the family and health workers to understand and implement an individual's wishes if they are unable to participate in the decision making process. A living will may specify the desire for life sustaining measures or opposition to these. It generally describes a desire to avoid being kept alive by artificial means or use of heroic measures when the patient is terminally ill and when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. You are advised to follow the doctors' orders and the laws of the country when using life-prolonging measures for a terminally ill.</p>
                        <h5>Organ Donation</h5>
                        <p>Body organs and tissues such as kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas, corneas, lungs and skin may be needed for transplants. Donations must be voluntarily given. Prior to death patients may grant such permission. After death, the next of the kin must sign a permit before tissue or organs may be removed from the body. Should you find yourself involved in asking terminally ill patients or their families about eventual donation of organs, you must be sensitive, compassionate and articulate. Keep these points in mind:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No one should feel that another patient is being favoured at the expense of the donor.</li>
                            <li>Those approached as potential donors may feel victimised and extremely distraught.</li>
                            <li>Care must be taken that these individuals are not coerced into agreeing to organ donations or made to feel guilty for refusing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should get acquainted with the laws and policies concerning organ donations.</p>

                        <p>Most patients realise even without being told that they are suffering from an incurable disease. This may be through non-verbal communication of the patients' family and health personnel. Patients feel isolated, lonely and rejected when the truth is withheld. Informed patients usually react negatively at first. Nonetheless, there are several advantages when the truth is revealed. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maintaining all relationships with the patients on the basis of honesty rather than sustaining the false premise that recovery will occur.</li>
                            <li>Providing the patient with the opportunity to complete unfinished business.</li>
                            <li>Permitting the use of still unidentifiable inner resources that have been demonstrated to prolong life 'the will to live'.</li>
                            <li>Promoting more meaningful communication between the patient, family and health care personnel.</li>
                            <li>Resolving grief earlier and more effectively. Grief is resolved well when individuals state they want say and do things with the dying patient that they would later regret not having done.</li>

                        <h5>Patterns of Emotional Reactions</h5>
                        <p>Studies have shown that there is a common pattern of responding to the knowledge of an impending death. Dr. Elisabeth Kubler Ross describes stages that a dying person experiences as follows:</p>

                        <p>Note that not all persons go through these stages in the order described in the Stages of Dying table. A person may skip one of those stages, or fall back a stage. Stages may overlap. The length of any stage may range from a few hours to months. Knowing about these stages will assist you to understand and help patients and the families cope with dying. Here are some suggestions Kubler Ross and others have offered on how to help patients through the stages of dying:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Accept whatever manner in which the patient responds.</li>
                            <li>Provide a non-judgemental atmosphere in which the patient can express their feelings freely.</li>
                            <li>Be ready to listen, especially at night when patients tend to awaken and want to talk.</li>
                            <li>Work to understand the patient's feelings.</li>
                            <li>Provide the patient with a broad opening for communication such as "Do you want to talk about it?" This allows the patient to choose the topic that they wish to discuss.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A terminally ill patient may require continuous hospitalisation, home care or hospice care. You should be able to anticipate the services needed by the family and assist in obtaining them. You should be able to provide support and continuity of care at home.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Home Care</h5>
                        <p>When coordinating home care, make sure that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The family and the patient prefer home care to other options</li>
                            <li>The family and the patient are aware of the patient's diagnosis and prognosis</li>
                            <li>A support system is available for professional consultation and help with care as necessary</li>
                            <li>Any special equipment needed for the patient is availed</li>
                            <li>A person is ready and able to assume primary responsibility for the patient's care</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Generally, terminally ill patients cared for at home, compared to those in hospital, enjoy greater emotional comfort and dignity and their families adjust better to their dying and death.</p>
                        <p>When their family members in a familiar environment surround the terminally ill patient, they feel more secure. The family members are able to communicate and demonstrate their love and affection without any intimidation. Having family members care for the patient lessens guilty feelings. Children can participate more extensively in the last days and can be helped to understand death with less fear. The process of dying is a gradual one. Family members can start working through some grieving phases. When the care of the dying patient is too complex or very demanding for family members, hospice care is recommended when available.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Hospice Care</h5>
                        <p>Hospice care as defined by Dr. Cicely Saunders of England, is a way station where terminally ill persons can live out their final days with dignity and meaningfulness in a caring environment. Hospice care emphasises helping the patient live until they die with their family with them and helping the family return to normal living after the patients' death. Hospice cares also emphasises preserving a bond between the patient and their family and helping them to be prepared so that death can be more readily accepted as a normal part of life. If you are not familiar with the term hospice care there is a facility of this nature at the Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret and others are gradually coming up.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Responding to Emotional Needs</h5>
                        <p>A dying patient requires emotional support. The patient's helpless feelings cause them to depend upon others to provide them with a sense of being safe, secure loved and worthwhile. You can help the patient and their family by sustaining realistic hope, understanding common fears, facilitating communication and helping the family accept reality.</p>
                        <h6>Sustaining Realistic Hope</h6>
                        <p>Realistic hope involves a wish for something that is more than likely possible. The patient, the family and health care personnel will manifest some degree of hope which may not be realistic nor in agreement with one another. Nonetheless, unrealistic hope should be supported. You should provide statement like 'we will continue to do everything we can and hope you are right about your expectations'. This comment neither shatters hope nor supports unrealistic hope.</p>
                        <h6>Understanding Common Fears</h6>
                        <p>Fears are as varied as attitudes toward death. Most people fear death because it represents a force over which there is no control. Some may choose to fight it, while others look forward to death as a relief from earthly suffering and sorrow. Yet others feel so depressed and desperate that they have suicidal tendencies. You are required to relieve the patient's fear concerning death so as to facilitate moving to stage of acceptance in which the patient can die in peace and dignity.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Confirming Death</h4>
                        <p>You may determine that a patient is dead when there is no evidence of pulse, respiration or blood pressure. Pupils will be dilated and fail to respond to light. A doctor, by law, is the one to pronounce the patient dead.</p>
                        <h4>Obtaining Permission for an Autopsy</h4>
                        <p>An autopsy (post-mortem examination) is an examination of the organs and tissues of a human body. It is usually performed if the death was of a suspicious nature, involved a crime, and/or occurred without any medical consultation prior to death. An autopsy cannot be performed without the written consent of the next of kin. It is the doctor's responsibility to obtain permission for an autopsy. The procedure involves delicate communication, tact and compassion. Many relatives will be more comfortable if they are told that the reason for performing autopsy is to establish proof of the exact cause of death.</p>
                        <h4>Issuing a Death Certificate</h4>
                        <p>The laws of Kenya require that a death certificate be issued for each person who has died. The laws specify the information that is needed. Notification of death is usually sent to the Registrar of Births and Deaths. This information is used to compile statistics, which are important in identifying trends, needs and problems in the fields of health and medicine.</p>
                        <h4>Nursing Responsibilities Following the Patient's Death</h4>
                        <p>You should always remember that you are still involved with both the patient and the family even after death occurs. The relatives may wish to view the body if the death occurred in their absence. You should ask them if they would wish to be left alone or if they do not mind you accompanying them. If the former, do not be too distant.</p>
                        <p>It is human for you to become involved and attached to patients and their families. Many families are touched that the nurse has also shared their loss. You should not fight to control expressing how you feel. At times you may not have words of comfort, but just listening and allow them time to reminisce or express their emotions. You should encourage the survivors of a sudden death to view the body, seeing and touching the body confirms the realty of death. You should clean and cover mutilated areas.</p>
                        <h4>Accounting for Valuables</h4>
                        <p>Every hospital has policies about the care of valuables when patients are admitted. Get a copy from the administration of your hospital. There are some valuables, which a patient chooses to keep with them, for example, a ring, a wristwatch or money. These need careful handling. Occasionally, the patient's family take the valuables home when death becomes imminent. Make sure you note it down in the patient's notes and they sign for them.</p>
                        <p>If valuables are still with the patient at the time of death, they should be identified, accounted for, and sent to the appropriate department for safe keeping until the family claims them. A wedding ring should not be removed, but should be secured with adhesive so that it does not slip off and get lost. You should note that the ring remained on the body.</p>
                        <p>Loss of valuables is serious and may result in a lawsuit. You should, therefore, take every precaution to prevent loss or misplacement of valuables.</p>
