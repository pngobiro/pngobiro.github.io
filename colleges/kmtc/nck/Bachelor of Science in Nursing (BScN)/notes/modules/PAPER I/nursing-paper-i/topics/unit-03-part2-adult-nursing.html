                        <p>Part two will start with the respiratory system and will highlight topics that have not been covered in part one. The nursing process from the previous units has been used, as this should be applied in patient care.</p>
                        <p>Adult nursing involves the provision of care to all individuals aged above twelve years of age. It forms the core of general nursing practice. As a nurse, you must have cared for many adult patients. This unit will equip you with additional knowledge, skills and attitudes to give better quality care to your patients.</p>
                        <p>This unit is composed of four sections:</p>

                        <h4>The Structures and Functions of the Respiratory System</h4>
                        <p>The most important function of the respiratory system is to facilitate intake of air in the body, enabling the gaseous exchange and excretion of waste gases. The structures of the respiratory system will be divided into upper and lower airways. You will start with the upper airway.</p>
                        <h5>The Upper Airway</h5>
                        <p>The job of the upper airway is to filter, moisten and warm air entering the body during respiration. This is done through the mucocilliary action of cilia in the upper airway. The upper part of the respiratory tract consists of the nose and pharynx.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-180-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of the upper airway, showing the nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, and epiglottis." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <h6>The Nose</h6>
                        <p>The nose has both the functions of respiration and olfaction (to smell). The respiratory function of the nose is the conditioning of the air through warming, filtering, clearing and humidification. The nasal cavity is divided into two by a septum. The cavity has a roof, a floor, lateral walls and a posterior wall followed by a posterior pharynx. Mucous secreting cells line it. There are openings into the nasal cavity. The anterior nostrils open into the nasal cavity, while posterior naris open from the nasal cavity into the pharynx. Adjacent to the nasal cavity are air filled cavities located within the bony structure. These are called sinuses. The main sinuses include the maxillary sinuses in the maxillary bone, frontal, sphenoidal and ethmoidal sinuses in the respective bones.</p>
                        <h6>The Pharynx</h6>
                        <p>The pharynx is the tube that extends from the nose at the base of the skull to the 6th cervical vertebra and is 12-14 cm long. It is divided into the nasopharynx, the oropharynx and the laryngeopharynx. The eustachian tube from the ear empties into the nasopharynx and, therefore, infection from the ear can also involve the pharynx and vice versa. There is a mass of lymphoid tissue within the pharynx called the tonsils. The three groups of tonsils are the palatine tonsils, the bilingual tonsils and the pharyngeal tonsils, also referred to as adenoids. The functions of the pharynx include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Passage of air and food.</li>
                            <li>Taste</li>
                            <li>Hearing</li>
                            <li>Protection through presence of lymphatic tissue</li>
                            <li>Warming and humidification of air</li>
                            <li>Speech</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The tonsils filter bacteria from circulating lymph fluid and trap any particles as the inhaled air passes through. Inflammation of the tonsils is referred to as tonsillitis.</p>
                        <p>The other part of the upper airway is the larynx also known as the voice box. The larynx is a tube made up of cartilage, fibrous membranes and muscles. Its function is to produce sound and also to protect the lower airway from foreign objects. Finally in the upper airway, there is a triangular space between the vocal cords and the opening of the larynx called the glottis.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>The Lower Air Way</h5>
                        <p>The lower air way enables gaseous exchange to take place. It consists of the trachea, bronchi, and lungs.</p>
                        <h6>Trachea</h6>
                        <p>It is referred to as the wind pipe and extends from the larynx to the level of the fifth thoracic vertebrate where it bificates into the left and right bronchus. It is made of the C-shaped cartilages which prevents it from collapsing thus effecting its function of air passage. Its functions, include conditioning of the air, are filtering, warming, and humidifying, removing of particles and mucus through its ciliary function and cough reflex.</p>
                        <h6>Bronchi and Bronchioles</h6>
                        <p>The bronchus sub divides into smaller branches thus forming different lobes of the lung. They further sub-divide to form the bronchioles and respiratory bronchioles. Their main function is to provide air passage and control the amount of air passing through into the alveoli, conditioning of air is maintained as it enters into the alveoli.</p>
                        <h6>The Alveoli</h6>
                        <p>At the distal end, the respiratory tract terminates with the blind end of alveolar ducts and alveoli which is a sac like structure where air interchange takes place. Alveoli are well supplied with blood supply to allow for diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Surfactant factor is produced here, which is important in maintaining the air sac open.</p>
                        <h6>Lungs</h6>
                        <p>The lungs are elastic organs, made up of conducting airways. There are millions of gas exchange units called acini. An acinus is composed of respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli. This is where the gas exchange takes place.</p>
                        <p>The lungs are contained within the bony thoracic cage. This comprises the ribs, the sternum and clavicles, spinal column and scapulae. Below the lungs is the diaphragm, which also takes part in the process of respiration. The lungs are enclosed within an elastic membrane called the pleura. The pleura has two parts; the one adjacent to the lungs is called the visceral pleura and the other, adjacent to the thoracic cavity, is called the parietal pleura. In between the two is a space, the pleura space, which has a thin film of serous fluid.</p>
                        <p>The respiratory tract is generally supplied by blood from the pulmonary and bronchial arteries. Oxygen diffuses into blood in the capillaries from where it is carried to the heart to be pumped to other tissues. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs for oxygenation while the four pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart for onward delivery to the rest of the body.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The respiratory centre in the brainstem controls breathing. This is stimulated by an increase in the acidity (pH) of the blood. Movement of air into and out of the lungs comprises the respiratory cycle. This cycle occurs about 15 times in a minute, and consists of inspiration, expiration and a pause. Pressure differences are created by changes in the thoracic cavity, which make movement of air into and out of the lungs easier.</p>
                        <p>Some of the structures, which participate in the movement of the thoracic cavity to create the pressure differences, include the inter-costal muscles and the diaphragm. During respiration the lungs and passages are never empty. Since exchange of gases takes place only across alveolar ducts, the rest of the passage is called anatomical dead space.</p>
                        <h5>Lung Volumes and Capacities</h5>
                        <p><strong>Tidal Volume:</strong> Tidal volume is the amount of air that comes into and out of the lungs with each cycle of respiration. This is normally about 500 mls.</p>
                        <p><strong>Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV):</strong> is the largest additional volume of air that can be forcibly expired after a normal inspiration and expiration. ERV is about 1000-1200 mls.</p>
                        <p><strong>Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV):</strong> is the largest additional volume of air that can be forcibly inspired after a normal inspiration. Normal IRV is 3000-3300 mls.</p>
                        <p><strong>Residual Volume:</strong> Residual volume is that air that cannot be forcibly expired from the lungs. It is normally about 1200 mls.</p>
                        <p><strong>Forced Expiratory Volume:</strong> Forced expiratory volume is the volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled within a specific time normally 1-3 seconds.</p>
                        <p><strong>Inspiratory Capacity:</strong> This is the amount of air that can be inspired with the maximum effort. It consists of tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume.</p>
                        <p><strong>Functional Residual Capacity:</strong> Functional residual capacity is the amount of air that remains in the air passages and alveoli at the end of a quiet inspiration. This prevents collapse of the alveoli during expiration. It comprises of expiratory reserve volume and the residual volume.</p>
                        <p><strong>Vital Capacity:</strong> Vital capacity is the amount of air that can be forcibly expired after forcible inspiration. This varies with the size of the thoracic capacity. It is made up of the tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume, and expiratory reserve volume.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>General Clinical Features of Patients Suffering From Respiratory Conditions</h4>
                        <p>Patients suffering from conditions that affect the respiratory system will present with various clinical features.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cough:</strong> The cough is very common from irritation of respiratory mucosa. The cough reflex protects the patient from accumulation of secretions and irritant substances. Therefore, a cough may arise from inflammation and exudation of secretion or irritation by foreign materials or irritants. A cough may be described as dry, brassy, high pitched, wheezy, hackling, loose or severe.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sputum:</strong> This results from over production of secretion which may result from the inflammatory process. Sputum is examined for consistency and colour.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chest Pain:</strong> This can be associated with pathological process on the affected area. However, note that the lung and viscera have no sensory nerve ending and are unlikely to produce much pain except when parietal plural is affected. It produces sharp pain called pleuric pain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wheeze:</strong> It is associated with bronchospasms and constriction of the airway. It is usually heard without the help of a stethoscope and is usually on expiration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hemoptysis:</strong> Here, blood may be expectorated with sputum. This ranges from blood stained to hemorrhage. It is usually associated with bronchitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, bronchial asthma, carcinoma of the lung, pulmonary embolism and infarction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clubbing of Fingers:</strong> It results from hypoxic lung disease like malignancies or bronchiectasis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cyanosis:</strong> It appears when circulating haemoglobin carries less oxygen than 2/3 of the expected amount. It can be either central or peripheral.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dyspnoea:</strong> This is laboured or breathing in increased lung rigidity and airway resistance. Dysponea may lead to tachypnoea.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Mechanism of Breathing</h5>
                        <p>There are chemoreceptors in the walls of the aorta and carotid arteries which sense changes in partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide. These will determine the rate of breathing. For example, now while you are seated reading, you breathe quietly. However, if you stop reading and start doing some exercise, the breathing will become faster and deeper in response to the need for more oxygen and to get rid of carbon dioxide.</p>
                        <p>While you are breathing quietly, you are using your inter-costal muscles and diaphragm. In difficult breathing accessory muscles, such as the abdominal muscles, may be used.</p>
                        <p>Following phrenic nerve stimulation, the diaphragm and respiratory muscles will start to contract. The thoracic cavity increases; the lungs follow the move and begin to expand. Air rushes from positive pressure outside to negative pressure in the lungs. The inspiration is completed and expiration starts with the reverse process.</p>
                        <h5>Control of Respiration</h5>
                        <p>Alveolar stretch receptors on the walls of the lungs send messages to the brain to prevent over distension of the lungs. Blood pH stimulates the respiratory centre directly. Blood pCO2 and pO2 stimulate receptors to control the rate of breathing. In the body tissues, gas exchange occurs by diffusion from high concentration to low concentration. Oxygen binds to haemoglobin to be transported to tissues for use in producing energy.</p>

                    <h4 id="upper-respiratory-heading">Disorders of the Upper Respiratory Tract</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Many of the patients you have been nursing may have been suffering from upper respiratory tract infections. Others may also have had inflammation, trauma or tumours. Another common disorder, especially among young people, is epistaxis. This is nose bleeding. The most common causes of epistaxis are trauma, infection, tumours and high blood pressure. Foreign objects inserted accidentally can cause airway obstruction, which you should treat as an emergency.</p>
                        <h5>Upper Respiratory Tract Infections</h5>
                        <p>The upper respiratory tract often falls victim to viral infections. The most common viral infections are pharyngitis, tracheitis, tonsilitis, laryngotracheobronchitis and influenza. These infections are common in children in whom they cause serious illnesses. Even the common cold is a viral infection. Viral infections cause inflammation resulting in congestion and watery exudate formation. In adults these conditions do not cause very serious illnesses unless the individual's immunity is compromised.</p>
                        <p>The management of infections involves use of antibiotics, control of fever, and relief of discomfort. The nose is part of the respiratory system. Nasal polyps can affect it. These are small masses that protrude into the cavity. Their cause is not clear but chronic inflammation is thought to be a risk factor.</p>
                        <p>Allergic rhinitis is commonly associated with allergens such as pollen, animal fur and dust. Patients have frequent sneezing, running nose and nasal blockage.</p>
                        <p>Acute sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses. Microorganisms that spread from the adjacent nose and pharynx commonly bring about the inflammation. There follows congestion, blocking the drainage from the structures. This results in dull pain over the affected sinus, fever and sometimes purulent discharge, if there is communication with the nasal passages. Sinusitis can become chronic if not well managed.</p>
                        <p>Acute pharyngitis accompanies common colds. The infection causes inflammation resulting in congestion. The infection can spread to the nose and sinuses. Laryngitis and tracheitis are the other infections that affect the upper respiratory tract mostly due to trauma, foreign bodies or infection. The trachea may be accessed via an endo-tracheal tube. This is inserted to open an airway for emergency resuscitation or to deliver anaesthetic gases.</p>
                        <p>Tonsillitis is another common inflammation. It affects the tonsils. It can be acute or chronic. Streptococcus pyogenes and some viruses commonly cause the inflammation of the tonsils. Other micro-organisms that can affect the tonsils are Staphylococci and Haemophilus influenza. Tumours are rare in the upper respiratory tract.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Care of Adults with Upper Respiratory Tract Disorders</h5>
                        <h6>Epistaxis</h6>
                        <p>This is nose bleeding. The most common causes of nose bleeding include trauma especially picking of nose, infection, tumours and high blood pressure. Bleeding is caused by the rupture of tiny blood vessels in the mucus membrane. It may also occur as a sign of rheumatic fever.</p>
                        <p><strong>Management:</strong> For a patient with epistaxis, which manifests quite often in our communities, simple first aid means may be effective in stopping the bleeding. It is important to keep the patient quiet. Place them in a sitting position, leaning forwards or reclining with head and shoulders elevated. You can apply pressure by pinching the lower portion of the nose for 10-15 minutes. Apply ice, if it is available, to try and stop the bleeding. Partially insert small gauze and call for more help. If first aid is not effective, management involves application of vaso-constrictive agents or cauterisation. If after packing the patients require oxygen, then it should be given. Mouth care and antibiotics will decrease the possibility of toxic shock syndrome.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Rhinitis</h6>
                        <p>Rhinitis is the inflammation of the mucus membrane of the nose. It could be as a result of infection or allergic reaction. When the cause is allergy, it is referred to as allergic rhinitis. Rhinitis can be caused by infections that could be bacterial or viral, the most common being viral. Rhinitis causes inflammation of the nasal mucosa, leading it to become congested, swollen and oedematous. This leads to an increase in nasal discharge and in cases of bacterial infection this could be a thick nasal discharge. This is then referred to as acute rhinitis. Recovery may follow after a few days.</p>
                        <p>Repeated attacks lead to deposition of abnormally large connective tissue in the nasal mucus membrane leading to thickening and hypertrophy. This causes formation of spurs and polyps on the nasal septum. There could be excessive exudation leading to atrophic rhinitis. Patients present with frequent sneezing, running nose, pulurent discharge and nasal blockage.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Pharyngitis</h6>
                        <p>This is the inflammation of the pharynx which commonly accompanies the common cold. It is caused by several viruses and bacteria. The throat becomes inflamed leading to the mucus membrane becoming fiery red. The lymphoid tissue including the tonsils become swollen with exudation. Uncomplicated pharyngitis resolves in 3-5 days, while complicated pharyngitis may cause otitis media, sinusitis, mastoiditis, rheumatic fever, nephritis and adenitis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Management:</strong> For uncomplicated pharyngitis, a lot of fluids are recommended with saline, antimicrobial, antifungal gargles. Intravenous fluids are recommended if one is not able to take them orally. Liquid diet is given due to discomfort in swallowing. Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics. Staphylococcal and streptococcal infections are treated with penicillins.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Laryngitis</h6>
                        <p>This is the inflammation of the larynx. It may be caused by use of irritants, abuse in use of voice or infection. Bacteria infections are usually secondary to viral infection. Causes include exposure to low temperatures, malnutrition, low immunity and dietary deficiencies. Laryngitis presents with hoarseness or complete loss of voice (aphonia), severe cough and general malaise.</p>
                        <p><strong>Management of Laryngitis:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Irritants like tobacco smoking must be avoided.</li>
                            <li>Steam inhalation or aerosol therapy is important to sooth the mucus membrane and facilitate drainage of mucus secretions.</li>
                            <li>Anti bacterial therapy is done where bacterial infections have been suspected.</li>
                            <li>Rest of the voice promotes healing. This is done in a well humidified environment.</li>
                            <li>Plenty of fluids must be given to replace lost fluids and to thin the secretions.</li>
                            <li>Steroids could be beneficial in reducing inflammation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Sinusitis</h6>
                        <p>This refers to the blockage of the nasal sinus by either inflammation or hypertrophy of the mucosa. It may affect one or more of the four sinuses. The main causes include obstruction by nasal polyps, deflected nasal septum, spurs or hypertrophid turbinates due to inflammation. The blocked nasal ostia (exit) results in the accumulation of secretions which provide media for growth of micro-organisms. This results in a secondary infection.</p>
                        <p>Acute sinusitis results from upper respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis, swimming or dental manipulation which cause inflammation resulting in increased secretions and blockage of their drainage. Chronic sinusitis is usually associated with chronic infection of sinuses and nasal polyps.</p>
                        <p><strong>Clinical Features:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is usually pain over the affected sinuses due to inflammatory process and accumulation of pus and absorption of air.</li>
                            <li>Purulent nasal drainage due to hyper secretion.</li>
                            <li>Nasal obstruction due to inflammation or altered anatomy.</li>
                            <li>The turbinate will be oedematous, enlarged with tenderness over the affected area.</li>
                            <li>Recurrent headache which changes with position.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Investigations include:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A CT scan will show sinus filled with fluid or hypertrophied mucosa.</li>
                            <li>A nasal endoscopy to examine or drain the sinus to get the secretions for culture and sensitivity.</li>
                            <li>An X-ray of sinus will show fluid in the sinus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Management:</strong></p>
                        <p>If the patient has pain related to decreased sinus drainage, inflammation or infection:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Encourage patient to take the prescribed medication. Requires antibiotics for example amoxil to decrease risk of recurrent infection.</li>
                            <li>Expectorants may be used to drain secretions. A steroid like the hydrocortisone to relieve inflammation especially in allergic sinusitis.</li>
                            <li>Use analgesics and decongestants to relieve pain.</li>
                            <li>Instruct the patient to use plenty of fluids to dilute the secretion hence allow good drainage.</li>
                            <li>Nurse patient elevated to facilitate drainage and encourage frequent nose blowing.</li>
                            <li>Nasal irrigation, nasal drops may be used to relieve obstruction or decongest the nostrils.</li>
                            <li>Teach patient to avoid situations which aggravate sinusitis like swimming and diving.</li>
                            <li>Take vital signs and report any increased temperature.</li>
                            <li>If allergies, follow instructions of environmental control by identifying the allergen and avoiding stimulation of allergy.</li>
                            <li>Assess patient for features of infection and give appropriate medication.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Peritonsilar Abscess</h6>
                        <p>Peritonsillor abscess develops above the tonsil following tonsillar infection or pharyngitis. The tonsils grossly enlarge to sometimes threaten the patency of the airway. The patient will have difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) and pain (odinophagia). The patient presents with thickened voice, chills, fever and swelling of the soft palate.</p>
                        <p><strong>Management:</strong> Peritonsilar abscess occurs as a complication of tonsilitis and acute pharyngitis. The tonsils may enlarge to threaten airway passage. High fever, leukocytosis and chills will occur and the patient needs IV antibiotics, incision and drainage for the abscess. Tonsillectomy may be performed after the infection has subsided. When a patient has a mass in the upper airway, patency may be lost. In such a patient, endotracheal intubation may have to be done.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Airway Obstruction</h5>
                        <p>This is the blockage of the air passage through the airways, that is, the nose, pharynx, larynx into the trachea and the lungs. It may be either partial or complete obstruction. The causes include: Laryngeal oedema, aspirated food or foreign body, laryngeal tracheal stenosis, neurological depression, tumour.</p>
                        <p>Clinical features include: Stridor, uses of assessory muscle in breathing, substernal and intercostal muscles retraction, wheeze, restlessness, tachycardia, cyanosis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Management:</strong> This is an emergency and interventions are aimed at establishing and maintaining a patent airway, the Heimlich manoeuvre, cricothyroidectomy, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy are commonly used.</p>
                        <h6>Intubation</h6>
                        <p>Make sure the patient is well oxygenated, explain the procedure and assemble and check the equipment. Then remove any dentures, and administer pre-medication. After intubation, the responsibilities include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assessing for correct tube placement</li>
                            <li>Inflating the cuff</li>
                            <li>Assessing oxygenation and acid-base balance</li>
                            <li>Suctioning to remove secretions and preventing accidental disconnection from ventilator or blockage</li>
                            <li>Prevention of the over-inflation of the cuff</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Tracheotomy</h6>
                        <p>Tracheotomy is an incision into the trachea for the purpose of establishing an airway. Tracheostomy is the surgical creation of an opening into the trachea through the neck. It is used:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To bypass airway obstruction</li>
                            <li>To facilitate removal of secretions</li>
                            <li>To facilitate weaning from a ventilator</li>
                            <li>To permit long-term mechanical ventilation and improve patient comfort</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Care of the patient with tracheostomy involves avoiding dislodgment, assessing the respiratory function and evaluating the risk of swallowing, and speech problems. The patient on long-term tracheostomy should be taught about its care. The suctioning of the airway for a patient with endotracheal tube or tracheostomy should be done in such a way as to avoid cuff deflation while maintaining good respiratory function. Principles of asepsis must be strictly adhered to.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Cancer of the Head and Neck</h5>
                        <p>Cancer of the head and neck can greatly affect respiration. The choice of treatment in cancer of the head and neck is dependent on such factors as extent of the disease, cosmetics, and urgency of treatment. However, surgery and radiation are commonly used. Whatever the mode of management, the patient requires health education on radiation, duration of treatment, change of voice, speech and emotional adjustments.</p>
                        <p>Nutritional management and improvement of respiratory function are the most important aspects to concentrate on, in addition to the teaching just mentioned. The post-operative care is done by undertaking the following actions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Putting the patient in semi-fowlers position</li>
                            <li>Clearance of the secretions</li>
                            <li>Care of pressure areas and dressings, checking on drainage tubes and use of a humidifier</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Wound management should always be part of the post-operative care. Later, stoma care, voice rehabilitation and home care are taught to the patient for long-term home management.</p>

                        <h5>Acute and Chronic Bronchitis</h5>
                        <p>Acute and chronic bronchitis are common conditions of the respiratory tract. This is an inflammation of the bronchi. Acute bronchitis is caused by bacteria and may follow a common cold. Streptococcus, staphylococcus aureus and H. influenza are commonly associated with acute bronchitis. Chronic heavy smoking and air pollution contribute to chronic bronchitis. The inflammation of the bronchi brings about thickening and an increase in mucous secretions, oedema, decrease in ciliated cells and narrowing of the bronchi.</p>
                        <p>Acute bronchitis is commonly a bacterial infection, which responds well to broadspectrum antibiotics. Patient education goes hand in hand with the antibiotics, especially on the importance of completing the dose and recognition of symptoms of complications such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>

                        <h5>Bronchial Asthma</h5>
                        <p>It is an intermittent, reversible, obstructive airway disease that is characterised by increased responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to stimuli resulting in the narrowing of the airway.</p>
                        <h6>Types</h6>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Extrinsic asthma</strong> - Patients usually have a history of earlier allergic conditions like eczema or allergic rhinitis. They usually have known allergies like pollens, animals and food. Children with this type of asthma recover with age especially in adolescence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intrinsic</strong> - This is not related to any allergen. The attacks become more severe and frequent with time and can progress into chronic bronchitis or emphysema. Factors associated with intrinsic asthma include environmental pollutants, cold weather, exercise, respiratory tract infection or drugs especially the non steroidal like aspirin.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mixed</strong> - This is the most common and has both the characteristics of the intrinsic and extrinsic type.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>Exposure of the person to a stimulant causes the initiation of an immunological response which leads to production of antibodies against the allergen and antigen. Re-exposure results into the antigen binding into the antibodies resulting into the production of cell mediators which include histamine, and prostaglandins. These mediators cause the muscles of the airway to go into spasms, mucus membrane swelling and hyper production of mucus secretion. This leads to broncho constriction with increased secretion causing further obstruction of the airway. Breathing in becomes easier with more effort required in expiration due to narrowing of the bronchus and increased secretion. The secretion produces a sound as air squeezes out of the constricted bronchus. This sound is called a wheeze.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cough is present due to production of excessive mucus secretion</li>
                            <li>Slow laboured breathing with excessive use of accessory muscles</li>
                            <li>Obstructed airway creates dyspnoea</li>
                            <li>Profuse sweating, weak pulse and cold extremities is experienced due to fluid loss and dehydration</li>
                            <li>Occasionally nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea</li>
                            <li>Air hunger and chest tightness</li>

                        <h5>Status Asthmaticus</h5>
                        <p>Status asthmaticus is severe bronchial asthma that is unresponsive to conventional therapy and lasts for more than 24 hours.</p>
                        <h6>Causes include:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Infection that is not resolved</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>There is narrowing of bronchus, with bronchospasms and swelling. Increased mucus production limits air movement and patient ends up with hypoxaemia. Patient presents with respiratory alkalosis initially and as condition persists progresses to acidosis.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <p>Severe form of the acute asthmatic. However, with severe asthma, wheeze may be minimised.</p>
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient is admitted, preferably in a pulmonary ICU.</li>
                            <li>Intravenous fluids are given to replace lost fluids.</li>
                            <li>Nebulisation can be attempted if not initially used to cause broncho dilation.</li>
                            <li>Low humidified oxygen is used where dyspnoea is marked. With poor ventilation, treat with endotrachial intubation and mechanical ventilation.</li>
                            <li>Intravenous drip of aminophylline is commenced with corticosteroid used to restore bronchial reactivity.</li>
                            <li>Mucolytis may also be used to help in the removal of secretions.</li>
                            <li>Antibiotics are used for treatment of underlying respiratory infection or prophylactically.</li>
                            <li>Carry out constant monitoring of the vital signs to identify deviations from normal and also to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy.</li>

                        <h5>Bronchiectasis</h5>
                        <p>When small bronchi are permanently dilated it is called this bronchiectasis. This is associated with bacterial infection. There is persistent cough to remove mucous retained in the dilated areas, which increases the pressure, worsening the dilation. Pus may form or bleeding may occur. This condition can lead to hypoxia and it can also contribute to right sided heart failure.</p>
                        <p>Bronchiectasis is normally treated with bronchodilators, mucolytic agents, expectorants and antibiotics. Good hydration, to liquefy secretions, must be maintained. Postural drainage and avoidance of air irritants are also important.</p>

                        <h5>Lung Cancer</h5>
                        <p>Lung cancer is mainly treated by surgery and radiation therapy. Make sure that the patient has effective breathing patterns, adequate airway clearance, adequate oxygenation, minimal pain (or none at all), and adherance to treatment regimen. If one has undergone surgery, postural drainage, airway clearance and an effective breathing pattern are the goals of care.</p>

                        <h5>Emphysema</h5>
                        <p>Pulmonary emphysema is an irreversible distention of the bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli. This results in increased capacity of the lungs. In this condition, the alveoli may merge, hence decreasing the surface area. The factors thought to predispose to emphysema are smoking, acute inflammation, chronic cough and congenital defects that result in deficiency of proteolytic enzyme in the lungs.</p>
                        <p>Emphysema may also result from rupture of the lung through stab wounds and accidents. Emphysema can be divided into alveolar or interstitial emphysema.</p>
                        <p>Emphysema is managed by:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>The procedure of setting an underwater seal drainage is done in the ward or at the emergency room. The thoracotomy tube is passed through a system of bottles with fluids to prevent back flow or entry of air into the chest and to provide for suction pressure. The fluid contained must be sterile to prevent ascending infection.</p>
                        <h6>Patient care</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>X-ray of the chest is done to confirm the position of the tube.</li>
                            <li>Keep patient in a comfortable position where patient is able to breath effectively to improve oxygenation and prevent hypoxia.</li>
                            <li>Keep tubings straight to avoid coiling which might end up with obstruction to flow.</li>
                            <li>Ensure tight tubings to prevent leakage and back flow and air entry in pleural space.</li>
                            <li>Check vital signs to evaluate patients condition.</li>
                            <li>Observe the bubbles/dripping of fluids into the underwater seal fluid to ascertain patency.</li>

                        <h5>Pneumonia</h5>
                        <p>Pneumonia is an acute respiratory illness, which is either segmental or affecting more than one lobe. It can be community acquired, hospital acquired or occurring due to immunosuppression. It can also occur as a result of aspiration of contents. The factors that contribute to this process include damage to the epithelia lining by chronic disease, chronic bronchitis and aspiration of contents from the stomach when drunk or unconscious. In our setup, the common infectious agents include: streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus. In patients with an impaired immune system, the agent pneumocystis carinii commonly causes pneumonia in the immunocompromised.</p>
                        <p>Patients with pneumonia clinically present with breathlessness, cough, fever, chest pain, tachypnoea and reduced chest movements. Subjectively, the patient with pneumonia may complain of dyspnoea, and fatigue. On x-ray the film may show pulmonary infiltration. The cough accompanying pneumonia may have several characteristics. It could be purulent, or yellow and blood stained, or red and gelatinous.</p>
                        <p>The goals of nursing care for a patient with pneumonia are: the patient to have clear breath sounds, normal breathing pattern, normal chest x-ray and no complications related to pneumonia. Although many patients in our set up are treated on an outpatient basis, some may be admitted into hospital and will require interventions ranging from measures to ensure comfort, good nutrition, fluids and electrolytes and patient education on infection prevention and control.</p>
                        <p>Before the actual management, it is recommended that vital signs and breathing patterns are assessed. It is recommended that sputum is collected for culture and sensitivity testing. Determine the colour, consistency and amount of sputum the patient is producing.</p>

                        <h5>Manifestations of Tuberculosis</h5>
                        <p>Bacteria cause tuberculosis. This is the mycobacterium tuberculosis, also referred to as acid-fast bacilli. These bacteria are spread either by droplet infection or dust contaminated by sputum. Tuberculosis is divided into primary TB and secondary TB.</p>
                        <p>Primary TB is infection to the lungs as a result of mycobacterium tuberculosis. When microbes colonise the lung, macrophages surround the microbes, triggering the body's defence mechanisms. These macrophages spread to other areas and primary complexes are formed at the Hillary lymph nodes. Caseous material forms in several areas including the lungs. Caseous material is basically necrotic (dead) tissue. The disease may then be referred to as pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
                        <p>The clinical features of pulmonary TB are persistent cough for more than four weeks, unexplained weight loss, chest pain, night sweats, poor appetite and haemoptysis.</p>
                        <p>It is called extra pulmonary tuberculosis if it affects areas outside the respiratory system. When the disease is extra pulmonary, the manifestations may include enlarged lymph nodes, pain and swelling in the joints, meningitis and paralysis if the spine is involved. This is a condition that is very common in Kenya.</p>
                        <p>Secondary TB is infection that is due to the caseous material in other organs such as the spinal cord, bone and brain.</p>
                        <h6>Management of Tuberculosis</h6>
                        <p>TB is treated with standard pharmacologic agents. While nursing a patient with tuberculosis, the overall nursing goals are that the patient will:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Comply with the therapeutic regimen</li>
                            <li>Have no recurrence of the disease</li>
                            <li>Have normal pulmonary function</li>
                            <li>Take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of the disease</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Pleural Disease</h5>
                        <p>The pleura can be inflamed after injury or as a result of introduction of microbes from other processes. Accumulation of air within the pleural cavity results in pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax is due to stab injury that allows air to enter, but not leave, the pleural space. Pleural pain, dyspnoea, chest asymmetry and hypoxia are common manifestations of pleural involvement.</p>
                        <h6>Pleural Effusion</h6>
                        <p>Pleural effusion refers to accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity. The fluid may be blood, serous exudates or pus. It can be a complication of diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis or lung cancer. It can also follow increased pressure due to heart failure, and increased permeability due to inflammation and impaired drainage. The manifestations are almost the same as pneumothorax. However, the percussion note on examination is different (dull).</p>
                        <p>Generally, a detailed history and physical assessment must be undertaken to come up with nursing diagnoses. Other than the medication, teaching on how to avoid spreading the disease, continued follow-up and compliance with the drug regimen and good nutrition must be given.</p>
                        <h6>Management of Pleural Disease and Chest Trauma</h6>
                        <p>The emergency management of chest injuries involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establishing and maintaining an airway</li>
                            <li>Administering high flow oxygen</li>
                            <li>Establishing IV access</li>
                            <li>Monitoring vital signs, level of consciousness and urinary output</li>
                            <li>Assessing for tension pneumothorax</li>
                            <li>Dressing a sucking chest wound with nonporous material</li>
                            <li>Putting the patient in semi-Fowler's position or laying them on the injured side if breathing is easier</li>
                            <li>A pneumothorax can be aspirated if there is minimal air or fluid in the pleural space</li>
                            <li>Chest tubes and under water seal drainage are the most definitive treatment modalities</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nursing care for a patient on underwater seal drainage includes the following actions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid kinks in the tubing</li>
                            <li>Keep all connections tight</li>
                            <li>Keep the water seal and suction chambers at appropriate levels by adding sterile water as needed</li>
                            <li>Mark the drainage levels appropriately</li>
                            <li>Follow principles of asepsis when emptying the fluid and when changing the bottle</li>
                            <li>Observe for air bubbles in the water seal chamber and fluctuations in the chest tubes</li>
                            <li>Air should be bubbling from the chest tube. Check for intermittent bubbling in the water seal</li>
                            <li>Monitor the patient's status and avoid elevating the drainage system to the level of the patient's chest or above</li>
                            <li>Encourage the patient to cough</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Pulmonary Embolism</h5>
                        <p>Pulmonary embolism develops when venous thrombus or embolus from peripheral circulation lodge in the pulmonary artery or one of its branches. The commonest causes are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Venous stasis as a result of immobility</li>
                            <li>A flushed blood clot from an IV line</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The clinical findings are: dyspnoea, restlessness, anxiety, sharp pleuritic pain, and increased pulse, respirations and temperature. The management involves anti-coagulants and thrombolytic drugs.</p>
                        <p>The patient should be placed in a good comfortable position preferably High Fowler's position. Monitor them closely and administer oxygen. Keep the patient calm and monitor for the development of hypoxia. The patient with pulmonary embolism should be given IV fluids with caution if pulmonary oedema has developed.</p>

                        <h4>Composition and Function of Blood</h4>
                        <p>Blood carries oxygen and carbon dioxide, nutrients and wastes, hormones, protective substances such as antibodies and blood clotting factors. Blood consists of plasma and different blood cells. Plasma is a fluid that is almost 90% water. It contains plasma proteins, salts, nutrients, organic wastes, enzymes and antibodies dissolved in it. Three groups of cells are found in the blood.</p>
                        <p>These are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>White blood cells (Leucocytes)</li>
                            <li>Red blood cells (Erythrocytes)</li>
                            <li>Platelets (Thrombocytes)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>White Blood Cells</h5>
                        <p>White blood cells are the largest of all the blood cells. They contain nuclei, and some have granules in their cytoplasm. There are three main types, each have different functions. These are granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes. The granulocytes are involved in the phagocytosis of bacteria and foreign particles. The granulocytes include neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. They are also referred to as polymorphonuclear leucocytes.</p>
                        <p>Lymphocytes are of two types and they form the basis of the immune response.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Thymus dependent (T) lymphocytes</li>
                            <li>Non-thymus dependent (B) lymphocytes</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The lymphocytes are involved in keeping memory of the various antigens encountered over time.</p>
                        <h5>Red Blood Cells</h5>
                        <p>Red blood cells (erythrocytes) are produced through a process called erythropoiesis. This process is regulated by oxygen requirements and is controlled by a hormone called erythropoietin, which is produced by the kidneys. When patients have chronic renal failure, they suffer from anaemia due to decreased erythropoiesis.</p>
                        <p>The function of the red blood cells is to transport gases and regulate the acid base balance. The major component of the red blood cell is haemoglobin. This is the red pigment that gives blood its colour. This has the characteristic of combining with oxygen to transport it to various points in the body.</p>
                        <p>When a red blood cell has lived for about 120 days it is destroyed by spleen macrophages through a process known as haemolysis. This destruction produces bilirubin, which is mixed with bile.</p>
                        <h5>Platelets</h5>
                        <p>These have the major function of initiating blood clotting. They also act as plugs in capillaries to close any opening.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Blood Clotting</h5>
                        <p>Normal blood clotting relies upon the complex interaction between the vessel wall, the platelets and various coagulation factors. The process of blood clotting takes place after the activation of prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of other clotting factors. The thrombin acts on the protein fibrinogen to form fibrin that is part of the clot.</p>
                        <h5>Blood Groups</h5>
                        <p>These are associated with genetically determined antigens on the red blood cell membrane and naturally occuring antibodies in serum. Two systems are commonly used in blood grouping. One is the ABO system and the other is the Rhesus system. By the ABO system, people are of blood group AB, A, B, or O depending on whether they have A and B, A, B, or no antigens on their red blood cells.</p>
                        <p>Blood group A has 'A' antigens and has natural antibodies against the other types, that is B and AB. The person with blood group B has "B" antigens and has natural antibodies against A and AB.</p>
                        <p>The Rhesus system depends on whether an individual has the Rhesus antigen, in which case they are Rhesus positive, or not. If they don't have it, then they are Rhesus negative and will form antibodies against the Rhesus antigen and lyse (destroy) the Rhesus positive blood.</p>
                        <p>The person with Blood group O Rhesus negative has no antigens and has antibodies against A, B, and AB. This person can therefore donate blood to anybody but can only receive blood from group O negative. The person who is type AB Rhesus negative can receive blood from any donor both Rhesus positive and negative. However, AB Rhesus negative can only give blood to itself.</p>

                        <h4>Structure and Function of the Heart</h4>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-194-1.jpg" alt="Anatomical diagram of the human heart showing its four chambers (right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle), valves (tricuspid, mitral, pulmonary, aortic), and major blood vessels (vena cavae, pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins, aorta)." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>The heart is a cone shaped hollow muscular organ about the size of a person's fist. It is located within the thoracic cavity between the lungs. Its apex is pointed down and towards the left at the fifth inter-costal space.</p>
                        <p>The walls of the heart consist of three layers. The first is the endocardium, which is a single layer of epithelium and underlying connective tissue. This is the innermost layer and it is continuous with the inner lining of arteries and veins. The middle layer is the myocardium, which comprises specialised cardiac muscle fibres. The third and outer layer of the heart is the pericardium which is made up of two sacs: an outer fibrous sac and an inner sac, a serous membrane, whose parietal layer lines the fibrous sac and the visceral layer or epicardium which is adherent to the heart muscle. The space between the parietal and visceral layers is only a potential space.</p>
                        <p>The heart is divided into a right and left side by a wall called the atrioventricular septum. This wall is composed of myocardium lined by endocardium.</p>
                        <p>Each side is further divided by a valve into an upper chamber (the atrium) and a lower chamber (the ventricle). The right atrioventricular valve has three flaps and is called the tricuspid valve. The left has two flaps and is called the mitral valve. These valves open and close according to pressure changes and allow blood to pass from one chamber to another.</p>
                        <p>The heart acts as a pump and because of its two sides, it can be considered as two pumps in one.</p>
                        <p>Blood flows into the heart from the superior and inferior vena cavae. The blood is emptied into the right atrium, passes through the right valves into the right ventricle where it is pumped into the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery has the pulmonary valve to ensure blood does not flow backwards. This pulmonary valve has three flaps that make the semilunar valve(s). After leaving the heart, the artery divides into two to supply the right and left lungs. This ensures that the blood becomes oxygenated before it returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins into the left atrium.</p>
                        <p>The blood then passes through the left atrioventricular valve, the mitral valve, into the left ventricle to be pumped into the aorta and into the rest of the body. The aorta has a valve as well to ensure blood does not flow back to the left ventricle when it relaxes.</p>
                        <p>The heart itself is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries, which branch off from the aorta. They form a network of capillaries traversing the heart. Venous blood is collected into small veins that join to form the coronary sinus which empty into the right atrium.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>The Conducting System of the Heart</h4>
                        <p>The heart muscle is intrinsically excitable and, therefore, can contract on its own. There are specialised cells in the myocardium, which start an impulse. These specialised areas include the sinoatrial node (SA node) in the wall of the right atrium. This is the 'pace maker' of the heart. The other one is the atrioventricular node (the AV node) located on the wall of the septum near the right atrioventricular valves. This is stimulated by impulses from the SA node. It can also initiate its own impulses but at a slower rate than the SA node.</p>
                        <p>The last one is the Bundle of His, located in the wall of the septum. It passes downwards into the ventricular septum, and at the apex of the heart divides into the right and left Purkinje fibres. The Purkinje fibres pass impulses to the apex of the heart where the wave of contraction begins.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-195-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of the heart's electrical conduction system, showing the SA node, AV node, Bundle of His, and Purkinje fibers." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>The heart functions as a pump and consists of a series of events, comprising contraction and relaxation. The contraction and relaxation is called the cardiac cycle. When the heart contracts and relaxes, blood passes through the valves into the various chambers. The opening and closing of the valves produces heart sounds that are audible on auscultation. Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle in one minute. Cardiac output is equal to the heart rate multiplied by the stroke volume, the amount of blood pumped by a ventricle with each beat. Sounds that are audible on auscultation are described as the 'lub' and 'dub'.</p>
                        <p>The blood is then circulated around the body at a certain pressure maintained by peripheral resistance, elasticity of artery walls and the force of contraction.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Pulse</h4>
                        <p>Pulse refers to the palpable wave of distension and relaxation in arterial walls following left ventricular contraction. The pulse rate is the number of heartbeats per unit time. The pulse rhythm is the regularity with which the heart beats.</p>
                        <p>The average pulse rate in an adult is 60-100 per minute. This is determined by the state of the arteries supplying the periphery and the ability of the heart to generate enough force to circulate blood to the periphery.</p>
                        <h4>Arteries</h4>
                        <p>These are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. Large arteries have more elastic tissue allowing them to possess the elasticity property. They sub-divide into small blood vessels called the arterioles. Anastomoses may also be formed linking one artery with another.</p>
                        <h4>Veins</h4>
                        <p>These carry blood back into the heart. Their walls are thinner and are continuous with the arteries thus forming a closed circuit through where blood circulates. Between the arteries and the veins are capillaries which facilitate the interchange of substances between the tissue and the circulatory system. Some veins in the lower extremities have valves which prevent back flow of blood.</p>
                        <h4>Blood Pressure</h4>
                        <p>The blood pressure refers to the transmitted force of contraction that moves blood through the various vessels. The pressure is measured during contraction (systole) and during relaxation (diastole) of the ventricles. The pressure that you have been measuring is the arterial blood pressure. There is also venous pressure that can be measured centrally through a catheter. This is called central venous pressure (CVP). The central venous pressure measures the pressure in the heart chambers.</p>

                        <h4>Structure and Function of the Blood Circulation</h4>
                        <p>Blood pumped from the heart (the left ventricle) is carried by the aorta, which has three distinct parts: The ascending aorta, The arch of the aorta, and The descending aorta.</p>
                        <p>Various arteries branch off from these three parts of the aorta to supply all parts of the body. These arteries subdivide further until the capillary network is formed. The capillaries start re-grouping until they form veins that return blood to the right atrium through the superior and inferior vena cavae.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The pulmonary circulation refers to that part of circulation taking blood from the heart to and from the lungs. Branches of aorta supply the neck and the head. The major arteries supplying the head and the neck are common carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries. The common carotid arteries subdivide into the internal and external carotid arteries.</p>
                        <h5>The Circle of Willis</h5>
                        <p>This refers to the network of arteries that supply the brain. It comprises of: two anterior cerebral arteries, two internal carotid arteries, one anterior communicating artery, two posterior communicating arteries, two posterior cerebral arteries, and one basilar artery.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The blood circulation from the abdominal organs forms the portal circulation. The portal circulation is involved in taking blood from the intestines where nutrients have been absorbed to the liver where the nutrients will be stored or broken down.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The lymphatic system consists of lymphatic capillaries and ducts, which carry fluid from the interstitial spaces to the blood and the lymph nodes, which trap particles. Lymph is important because it transports proteins and fat from the gastrointestinal tract. It also transports certain hormones back to the blood. Excess interstitial fluid returns to the blood through the same process to avoid development of oedema.</p>
                        <h5>Lymphatic Fluid</h5>
                        <p>Lymph fluid is pale yellow and diffuses through lymphatic capillary walls. It circulates through its own vessels. When the fluid is too much, and there is blockage of the vessels, lymphoedema can develop.</p>
                        <h5>Lymph Nodes</h5>
                        <p>Lymph nodes are part of the lymphatic system. They are small and round or bean shaped and vary in size. Their function is filtration of bacteria and foreign particles. They are situated at strategic places in the body for this purpose.</p>
                        <h5>Spleen</h5>
                        <p>The spleen is formed by reticular and lymphatic tissue and lies in the left hypochondriac region of the abdominal cavity. It is enclosed in a fibro-elastic tissue that forms trabeculae. It has the splenic pulp made of lymphocytes and microphages.</p>
                        <p>The function of the spleen includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maintenance of body immunity</li>

                        <h4>Disorders of the Pericardium</h4>
                        <p>The pericardium is the outer covering of the heart and many processes can affect it. Infectious agents like bacteria, fungi and viruses can bring about inflammation of the pericardium. Inflammation can also result from immune disorders, metabolic disorders such as myxoedema, tissue injury, physical and chemical agents, for example drug reactions and radiation. All these factors bring about pericarditis, which can be chronic or acute.</p>
                        <h5>Pericarditis</h5>
                        <p>This is the inflammation of the pericardium of the heart. Possible causes of pericarditis include viruses, bacteria, tuberculosis, fungi, syphilis, parasites, injury, auto immune disorders, rheumatic fever, radiation or neoplasm.</p>
                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>Pericardial tissue damage triggers inflammatory response causing vasodilatation, hyperaemia and oedema. Capillary permeability increases allowing proteins to escape into pericardial space. Exudates which contains blood cells may form and if due to infection may be pulurent. This may increase the pericardial fluid substantially causing pericardial effusion. Pericarditis may heal with fibrosis or scarring which may restrict heart function.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <p>Patients with pericarditis present with chest pain, a friction rub and various symptoms that are related to the chest pain. These include anxiety, restlessness and palpitations.</p>
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assessment on quality and nature of pain and anxiety is important to rule out myocardial infarction</li>
                            <li>Careful nursing observation including vital signs must be done to identify any deviation from normal</li>
                            <li>Pain relief measures - allow bed rest, anti-inflammatory medication</li>
                            <li>Antibiotics must be given for infections</li>

                        <h4 id="pericardial-effusion-heading">Pericardial Effusion</h4>
                        <p>Pericardial effusion is the presence of fluid in the pericardial cavity. The fluid can accumulate slowly or fast, and the amount can be small or large. This is what will determine the symptoms that patients will present with. Pericarditis on its own can result in effusion. The symptoms of pericardial effusion may therefore mimic those of pericarditis, in addition to high blood pressure and impaired cardiac return.</p>
                        <h5>Cardiac Tamponade</h5>
                        <p>Cardiac tamponade, which refers to compression, is one of the consequences following pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusion can lead to increased pressure in the heart and interfere with venous return. Cardiac tamponade is a very serious and life threatening disorder that needs urgent action.</p>
                        <h6>Cause</h6>
                        <p>Pericardial effusion, trauma, cardiac rapture or haemorrhage can cause cardiac tamponade.</p>
                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>There is increase in intra cardinal pressures that decreases the ventricular filling time and cardiac output. During inspiration, the right ventricle receives more venous return thus causing the ventricular septum to bulge towards the left ventricle. This reduces the left ventricular pressure - and leads to low pulse pressure during inspiration. This is called pulsus paradoxicus.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <p>These include pulses parodoxicus, reduced cardiac output, dyspnoea, tachypnea, tachycardia, distended neck veins, mumbled heart sounds and dilated atrium.</p>

                            <li>Pericardiocentesis may be done to remove fluid from the pericardial sac</li>
                            <li>Drug treatment includes anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce inflammation and promote comfort</li>
                            <li>Surgery can be done in restrictive pericarditis</li>

                        <h4>Management of Inflammatory Heart Disease</h4>
                        <p>Adults with such conditions as endocarditis, infective endocarditis, myocarditis and pericarditis are likely to come under your care at sometime.</p>
                        <h5>Endocarditis</h5>
                        <p>Endocarditis is the inflammation of the innermost layer of the heart. It may be infective or noninfective. Infective endocarditis is due to bacteria, viruses, yeast and fungal infection, while non-infective endocarditis may be due to rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever might be caused by autoimmunity. Endocarditis presents with fever, heart murmurs, anorexia, malaise and lethargy.</p>
                        <h5>Infective Endocarditis</h5>
                        <p>Infective endocarditis will be managed by giving appropriate antibiotic therapy, antipyretics, rest and surgical valve repair if the valves are damaged. Rest periods can give the heart opportunity to use the little oxygen available well. Antipyretic medication is intended to control the fever. For the patient with infective endocarditis, blood culture, X-ray and other specialised investigations may identify the problem. Then appropriate antibiotics can be given for the infection.</p>
                        <h5>Myocarditis</h5>
                        <p>Most patients with myocarditis recover spontaneously. However, they may be treated in the same manner as those with pericarditis. Generally, the patient with inflammatory heart disease must be assessed well through clinical, radiological and laboratory techniques. Chest xray, blood culture and cardiac catheterisation may be used.</p>
                        <p>People, especially young children, undergoing dental surgery should be given prophylactic treatment to avoid the possibility of development of infective heart disease.</p>
                        <h5>Pericarditis</h5>
                        <p>Pericarditis is treated after identification of the underlying cause with aspirin, bed rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids. Steroids are intended to decrease the inflammation, while aspirin has thrombolytic activity. If blood clotting occurs in the coronary circulation, there may be a decrease in the supply of oxygen to the heart muscle, leading to myocardial infarction.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Coronary Heart Disease</h4>
                        <p>This results from impaired blood flow to the heart muscles. Impairment of coronary heart flow may lead to myocardial infarction, angina and conduction disorders. It can also result in heart failure and death. Myocardial ischaemia occurs due to deficient blood flow to the myocardium. Ischaemia is deficient oxygen supply to a particular tissue. In the heart, this can manifest with a condition referred to as angina pectoris, which is chest pain or pressure sensation that the patient will describe as constricting and suffocating. Sometimes there can be ischaemia without angina. With continued lack of oxygen and nutrients, myocardial infarction can occur. An infarction is dead tissue.</p>
                        <p>The manifestations of myocardial ischeamia are: pain, weakness, dysrhythmias and signs of inflammation. Nausea, vomiting and epigastric discomfort are common. Tachycardia, restlessness and anxiety occur with the patient's skin becoming cold and moist. Myocardial infarction can cause shock, pericarditis, heart failure and ultimately, death.</p>
                        <p>The adult patient with coronary heart disease should be involved in identifying modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors and then managing those that are modifiable. These will decrease the risk of myocardial infarction. The modifiable factors include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hypertension</strong> - The patient should have regular check ups and take prescribed medications. They should reduce salt intake, stop smoking and reduce their weight.</li>
                            <li><strong>Smoking</strong> - Patients should stop smoking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Obesity</strong> - Patients should change feeding patterns and habits, reduce caloric intake, exercise regularly, avoid fad and crash diets and avoid large, heavy meals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong> - Patients with diabetes mellitus should control their diet, reduce their weight and monitor their blood glucose closely.</li>
                            <li><strong>Elevated serum lipids</strong> - Individuals should reduce animal (saturated) fat, engage in regular exercise and increase complex carbohydrates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical inactivity</strong> - Advise patients to develop and maintain a routine for physical activity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stressful lifestyle</strong> - Increase patient awareness of behaviour that is detrimental to health such as long hours in stressful situations without breaks or leave.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition, the specific management of the disease includes drugs and supportive therapy. Patients can receive drugs, which increase lipoprotein removal, for example. cholesterol, and drugs that restrict lipoprotein production, for example, nicotinic acid.</p>
                        <p>Coronary artery disease can manifest as angina pectoris. This is treated with nitroglycerin if the patient has acute attacks. The tablets will be given sublingual when the patient is working hard and is likely to experience exertion. They are taken in three doses repeated one after every five minutes. Chronic angina prophylaxis involves antithrombotic therapy, nitroglycerin treatment, long acting nitrates, adrenergic blocking drugs and calcium channel blockers. Nitrates increase oxygen supply to the heart muscle. The overall goals of nursing care in coronary heart disease involve pain relief, reduced anxiety and modification of risk factors.</p>

                        <h4 id="myocardial-infarction-heading">Myocardial Infarction</h4>
                        <p>This refers to destruction of myocardial tissue on the regions where blood supply has been deprived because of reduced coronary blood flow.</p>
                        <h5>Causes</h5>
                        <p>The causes may include reduced coronary flow due to shock, haemorrhage or coronary occlusion.</p>
                        <h5>Pathophysiology</h5>
                        <p>Coronary artery may be occluded by an atheroma or emboli, resulting in reduced blood supply to the distal areas of heart. This result into an imbalance between oxygen supply and oxygen demand by the myocardial cells. This results into ischemia, injury and lastly complete death of the myocardium cells called infarction.</p>
                        <h5>Clinical Features</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Characteristic chest pain, usually described as sudden, sternal or may be abdominal, radiates to shoulders or down arms. The pain is persistent and may be relieved by either rest or nitroglycerine. Referred to as anginal pain.</li>
                            <li>The pulse may become rapid, irregular and feeble.</li>
                            <li>Sweating may be present.</li>
                            <li>Patient becomes very anxious due to release of catecholamine.</li>
                            <li>Nausea and vomiting may result from reflex stimulation of the vomiting centre.</li>
                            <li>Fever may be present which may be a manifestation of the inflammatory process of the dying cells.</li>
                            <li>Blood pressure may be reduced with reduced urinary output as a result of reduced cardiac output.</li>
                            <li>Ventricular aneurysm may be revealed under further examination.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>Investigations include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>12 lead ECG will reveal areas of infarction.</li>
                            <li>Cardiac enzymes - there are enzymes released by dead cells. Some are specific to the cardiac cells and forms basis of diagnosis of cardiac infarction.</li>
                            <li>Echocardiogram to assess the function of the valves.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Myocardial infarction requires IV fluid therapy, continued electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, narcotic analgesics and oxygen. Vital signs should be monitored every one to two hours while the patient is put on strict bed rest. Thrombolytic therapy, anticoagulants and nitroglycerin are given while at the same time recording intake and output. An infusion of lidocaine may be given to prevent ventricular fibrillation.</p>
                        <p>When nursing the patient with myocardial infarction always make sure that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient experiences pain relief</li>
                            <li>The patient has no progression of myocardial infarction</li>
                            <li>The patient receives immediate treatment and modifies high-risk behaviours.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Many of the patients that you will meet will be emergencies and, will therefore, need quick action to prevent death. The oxygen and nitroglycerin will come in handy. Patient teaching is important during rehabilitation. They must know how to adjust their lifestyles to cope with their problem.</p>
                        <h5>Complications</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cardiac arrhythmias - this may range from simple tachycardia to complex ventricular rhythms especially when the conducting system has been involved. ECG changes will be involved.</li>
                            <li>Congestive heart failure occurs when pumping powers of the heart diminishes.</li>
                            <li>Cardiogenic shock will follow in adequate oxygen transport to the tissues.</li>
                            <li>Papillary muscle dysfunction - where infarcted area affects the areas controlling the valves.</li>
                            <li>Ventricular aneurysms appear in the destroyed muscle tissue.</li>
                            <li>Pericarditis may occur.</li>
                            <li>Dresslers syndrome caused by antigenantibody reactions to the necrotic myocardium.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary embolism may occur where a thrombus is involved.</li>

                        <h4>Cardiac Arrhythmias</h4>
                        <p>Cardiac arrhythmias are the result of a disordered contraction of the heart muscle. Fibrillation is the contraction of heart muscle in a disordered sequence.</p>
                        <h5>Atrial Fibrillation</h5>
                        <p>The atria has uncoordinated and disorganised atrial stimulation due to presence of numerous ectopic foci stimulating the atria at a very fast rate. Atrial contraction is limited to quivers with no effective atrial contraction. Ventricular rhythm will depend on the response of the atrio-ventricular node. Most impulses may be blocked allowing ventricles to have a slower rate.</p>
                        <h5>Ventricular Fibrillation</h5>
                        <p>The ventricle has rapid, uncoordinated and disorganised impulse stimulation due to presence of many ectopic foci pacing the heart resulting into ineffective ventricular contraction. Blood flow to various organs is impaired because there is no stroke volume and death results if no emergency measures are taken. Emergency cardio-pulmonary resuscitation is the only option with ventricular defibrillation being the management of choice.</p>
                        <h5>Atrio Ventricular Block</h5>
                        <p>Heart block occurs when there is delay of an impulse between the atria and ventricles. This is due to a delay of stimulation of the AV node. This results in bradycardia or heart rate of less than 35 beats per minute. Improper use of certain drugs, myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction cause heart block.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Care of the Patient with Dysrythmia</h5>
                        <p>The patient with dysrythmia needs to be investigated and the underlying cause treated. They may receive drugs, bed rest and surgical corrections. The various drugs indicated for cardiomyopathy include digitalis, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The digitalis increases the force of contraction of the heart muscle. The diuretics will decrease the venous return, hence decrease the cardiac output. This lessens the work that the heart has to perform.</p>
                        <h6>Emergency Management of Dysrhythmias</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establishing and maintaining a patient's airway</li>
                            <li>Administration of oxygen via nasal canular</li>
                            <li>Establishing an IV line with a large gauge needle</li>
                            <li>ECG monitoring</li>
                            <li>Being prepared to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation should the need arise</li>
                            <li>Monitoring vital signs</li>
                            <li>Reassuring the patient</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some of the drugs that are used in the treatment of dysrhythmias are atropine, digoxin, quinidine, procainamide, verapamil and beta-blockers. Some of the drugs increase the force of heart contraction, while others open up the peripheral circulation to relieve the heart of too much work. It is important that you get acquainted with the use of cardiac electrodes and the technique for CPR and defibrillation.</p>

                        <p>Hypertension is another common condition in your practice. Hypertension can lead to rupture of small blood vessels, hence eye, renal and heart complications, ascitis, liver failure and so on. It can also lead to coronary heart disease, heart failure, kidney failure, and stroke.</p>
                        <p>The causes of hypertension are not very clear, but there are some predisposing factors. These include heart disease, liver and kidney disease and eclampsia in pregnancy. In many individuals, hypertension has a genetic predisposition.</p>
                        <p>A stressful lifestyle can also contribute to hypertension. Hypertension is confirmed when there is an increase of over 20 mm Hg diastolic pressure on more than two occasions. That means that the individual is measured on different days and the increase is persistent.</p>
                        <p>The management involves the use of drugs and modification of one's lifestyle. The drugs commonly used are diuretics, blood vessel dilators, centrally acting drugs, and betablockers. The more familiar names are aldomet (methyldopa), inderal (propranolol), lasix (frusemide), and captopril.</p>
                        <p>The objective is to decrease the intravascular volume, decrease the force of contraction and decrease peripheral resistance. This is intended to decrease the amount of work being performed by the heart.</p>
                        <p>The preventive message given to the patient with hypertension is:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>Rheumatic heart disease is one of the heart disorders that have serious consequences. It is caused by rheumatic fever which is an autoimmune disease following a throat infection by streptococcus pyogenes, that is, ßhaemolytic group A-streptococci.</p>
                        <p>The disease may cause heart valve damage leading to heart failure and death. The antibodies that result from rheumatic heart fever can also affect the myocardium, the endocardium or/and the pericardium.</p>
                        <p>The manifestations of rheumatic fever are fever, abdominal pain, sore throat, headache, polyarthritis, nausea and vomiting. Patients who have a sore throat should be vigorously treated. Adults with rheumatic fever need bed rest. The rest is intended to avoid overworking the heart.</p>
                        <p>Benzathine penicillin is used prophylactically, while aspirin decreases the likelihood of clotting and corticosteroids are used to decrease inflammation.</p>
                        <p>The important aspects are to ensure there is no residual heart disease. Patients with vulvular heart disease can be treated either nonsurgically or surgically. They receive prophylactic antibiotics, digitalis, diuretics, sodium restriction and anticoagulants. They may also benefit from anti-dysrhythmic drugs and β adrenergic agents. These drugs and the purposes for which they are given have been mentioned previously. Surgery may be undertaken at specialised institutions.</p>

                        <p>Heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to meet the metabolic requirements of the body. Some of the causes of heart failure are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Damage of heart muscles</li>
                            <li>Rupture of heart valves</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary embolism</li>
                            <li>Cardiac arrhythmias</li>
                            <li>Severe hypertension</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Heart failure can either be right-sided or left-sided failure.</p>
                        <h5>Right-sided Heart Failure</h5>
                        <p>Right-sided heart failure occurs when the right ventricle is unable to pump blood adequately. This results into congestion in the right side of the heart, the viscera and peripheral tissues. Increased blood flow in the periphery, leads to congestion in the blood vessels resulting into pitting oedema. Congestion in the hepatic circulation also leads to venous engorgement resulting into hepatomegally, ascitis and respiratory distress due to pressure on diaphragm. Cardiac output improves at night due to improved rest and venous return. This increases diuresis usually referred to as nocturial diuresis. The patient with right-sided heart failure will manifest with fatigue, oedema, distension of jugular veins, ascitis, cyanosis, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting.</p>
                        <h5>Left-sided Heart Failure</h5>
                        <p>This results from left ventricular failure. The left ventricle is not able to adequately pump blood out of the heart resulting in congestion in the pulmonary circulation. Fluid accumulates in the lungs resulting into pulmonary oedema which manifests in dyspnoea at rest. Dyspnoea may be at night due to increased congestion in pulmonary circulation. This is caused by increased venous return which results into much more alveolar congestion. Low cardiac output results into fatigability with decreased removal of catabolic waste.</p>
                        <p>Left-sided heart failure manifests with pulmonary oedema, hence shortness of breath, cyanosis and dyspnoea. It is important that you remember this well, so that you understand the rationale for management of patients with heart failure.</p>
                        <p>Congestive heart failure refers to accumulation of fluids in the body (especially the lungs) due to impaired cardiac function.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Care of the Adult with Congestive Heart Failure</h5>
                        <p>It was mentioned earlier that congestive heart failure might be right-sided or left-sided. Therapy is directed towards improving left ventricular function by decreasing the after-load. There is also the need to increase cardiac output, improve gas exchange and reduce anxiety.</p>
                        <h6>Treatments for Congestive Heart Failure</h6>
                        <p><strong>Underlying Cause:</strong> Investigations have to be done extensively to determine the cause of the failure.</p>
                        <p><strong>History and Physical Examination:</strong> A history should be taken and a physical examination done. Cardiac monitoring, 12 lead ECG, echocardiogram nuclear imaging studies, and cardiac catheterisation may be done for specific diagnosis and management.</p>
                        <p><strong>Improve Oxygenation:</strong> This may be achieved by administration of oxygen to increase the percentage of oxygen inspired per breath. If patient has severe heart failure with pulmonary oedema, endotracheal intubation might be necessary. Administration of morphine may also reduce oxygen demand by reducing anxiety. It also improves blood circulation by reducing venous return.</p>
                        <p><strong>Promotion of Rest:</strong> Rest improves heart function by reducing venous return due to reduced work load. It reduces blood pressure and increases blood reserve in the veins. It also rests the respiratory system thus resulting into improved respiration and oxygen exchange.</p>
                        <p><strong>Position the Patient:</strong> Position the patient in a sitting up position to reduce pulmonary congestion. This reduces venus return thus improving cardiac contraction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Digitalis Therapy:</strong> Digitalis increases the force of contraction of the myocardium. It is helpful in patients suffering from atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation or fast ventricular rates. Digitalis therapy promotes diuresis thus reducing venous return. It also causes mild venus dilation which helps to increase venous pooling and reduce ventricular congestion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Vasodilators:</strong> Vasodilators are used to reduce arterial congestion hence lower central venous pressure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dopamine:</strong> Dopamine may be used. When in low doses of below 10 micrograms/min improves renal circulation thus reducing incidence of renal failure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Anti-arrhythmic Drugs:</strong> Anti-arrhythmic drugs may be used to improve cardiac function.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cardiac Arrest:</strong> Incase of cardiac arrest, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation must be initiated within the next four minutes.</p>
                        <p>In addition the patient should have their:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Weighed checked daily</li>
                            <li>Sodium diet restricted</li>
                            <li>Oedema monitored</li>
                            <li>Urea and electrolyte levels tested to ensure balance and prevent weight gain</li>

                            <li>Vital signs monitored to evaluate their condition and response to therapy</li>
                            <li>Right-sided heart monitored for failure</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the acute phase the patient should be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maintained in the High-Fowlers position</li>
                            <li>Given oxygen, morphine, diuretics, nitroglycerine, and ionotropic drugs</li>

                        <p>Heart surgery is increasingly becoming common in our centres. These operations involve open-heart surgery for the reconstruction and repair of the heart valves. For cardiac surgery, the patient is usually placed under cardio pulmonary bypass. This is a form of extra corporeal circulation of blood to outside environment. This provides means of circulating and oxygenating blood without passing through the heart or the lung. Heamodilution, hypothermia and heparinisation are done to prevent complications that may result from extra corporeal circulation.</p>

                            <li>Aimed at ensuring optimum heart function before surgery. Investigations are done to confirm the diagnosis and the operation to be done.</li>
                            <li>Patients and relatives have the fear of the unknown outcome. They are allowed enough time to express their fears. Reassurance is given to calm the patient and reduce their anxiety.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Shock</h4>
                        <p>Shock occurs when there is inadequate blood flow to vital organs and/or inability to utilise oxygen by the tissues. It is characterised by hypotension.</p>
                        <h5>Classification</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hypovolaemic Shock</strong> - this results from volume loss of blood. This may happen in diarrhoea and vomiting, bleeding and plasma loss in burns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cardiogenic Shock</strong> - this results from the inability of the heart to contract and supply the tissues with oxygenated blood, for example, infarctions, cardiac tamponade, pulmonary embolism, general anaesthesia or advanced hypovolaemia.</li>
                            <li><strong>Neurogenic Shock</strong> - this results from dilated blood vessels as a result of drugs, for example, anaesthesia.</li>
                            <li><strong>Distributive Shock</strong> - this is when blood does not reach the tissues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Septic Shock</strong> - this is when blood arteries become dilated as a result of endotoxins from gram-negative microorganisms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Pathophysiology</h5>
                        <p>Low arterial pressures stimulate the release of catecholamines which causes vasoconstriction and increase heart activity. Renin-angiotensin mechanism is also stimulated. This is where the kidney cells produce renin which acts on angiotensinogen to give angiotensin I. Angiotensin I passes through the lungs and it is activated by angiotensin conventing enzyme into angiotensin II which cause generalised vasoconstriction. It also stimulates release of aldosterone compensatory mechanisms triggered by shock. Patients will manifest with a cold clammy skin, thready pulse, and low blood pressure among others.</p>
                        <p>Shock is managed by concentrating on the cause. The vital organs must receive adequate perfusion by positioning the patient on the left lateral position, keeping them warm and giving IV fluids. The patient may require transfusion and haemostasis to stop bleeding. After the initial resuscitation, investigations can then start to focus on the real cause of the shock.</p>

                        <h4>Vascular Disorders</h4>
                        <h5>Atheroma</h5>
                        <p>Atheroma is the accumulation of cholesterol compounds in the inner wall of the blood vessels. Predisposing factors are genetic, sex (males are commonly affected), environmental, smoking, obesity, certain lifestyles, alcohol and certain diets. The atheroma can lead to thrombosis or blood clots and the formation of aneurysms. Aneurysms are formed due to a weakened wall of an artery. The arteries affected can be narrowed or occluded. This may lead to tissue ischaemia and infarction. Diets that are high in saturated fats and also high in cholesterol can cause atheromas.</p>
                        <h5>Arteriosclerosis</h5>
                        <p>Degeneration of arteries is associated with loss of elasticity and hardening of the vessel. When it affects the intima of the blood vessel, it is called arteriosclerosis. Vessels lose their elasticity and their lumen becomes smaller. A smaller lumen does not deliver blood to the target tissues efficiently. Arteriosclerosis can lead to stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.</p>
                        <h5>Embolism</h5>
                        <p>Embolism is an obstruction of the blood flow by an embolus in the blood. The emboli may be fragments of blood clots, tumours, pus, fat or air bubbles. Emboli can affect the heart, lung, liver or brain and result in ischaemia and infarction. Thrombi and emboli are common causes of cerebro-vascular accidents.</p>
                        <p>This is an emboli that is found in the arteries. It may develop from the chambers of the heart due to atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, endocarditis, cardiac failure or as a result of transport from the venous circulation into the heart. It can also develop from arteriosclerosis. When the thrombus is carried into the peripheral circulation, it results in blockage of blood circulation to the vessel. It tends to lodge in arterial dification and athelosclerotic narrowing.</p>
                        <p>Clinical features include severe pain aggravated by movement, gradual loss of sensory and motor function and reduced or lost pulse which is usually accompanied by sharp line of colour and temperature demarcation. Embolectomy is the management of choice. This must be done early in 6-10 hrs to prevent permanent necrosis. Intravenous anticoagulants like heparin may also be given to prevent propagation of the clot and reduce muscle neclosis. Thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase or urokinase is effective in dissoving of the clot. In the post-operative period the patient is encouraged to perform simple exercises to promote blood flow. Pain is managed with strong analgesics.</p>
                        <h5>Varicose Veins and Haemorrhoids</h5>
                        <p>Predisposing factors of varicosities are heredity, advanced age, obesity and high blood pressure. As one grows older, the veins lose their elasticity. The affected veins protrude and become tortuous. High blood pressure impedes venous return. Haemorrhoids, on the other hand, are due to increased pressure and structural weaknesses in the veins of the anus and rectum. Protrusion and difficulty in defecation are the initial manifestations, followed by bleeding and infection.</p>
                        <h5>Raynauds Disease</h5>
                        <p>This is severe vasoconstriction resulting from vasospasms caused by environment stimuli. It involves small arteries and affects one or two digits unilaterally. The main stimulant includes cold climate, pain and ulceration of finger tips. Patients presents with terrible pain which is associated with removal of ischemic materials when the vasoconstriction reduces. Management involves avoidance of stimulant, though sympathectomy may improve the patient's condition.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Aneurysms</h4>
                        <h5>Arterial Embolism</h5>
                        <p>These are out pouching or dilation of the arterial wall of a blood vessel. This condition commonly affects the aorta. They are associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis and smoking.</p>
                        <h6>Classification</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>True aneurysm:</strong> is when walls of the artery form aneurisms with at least one layer intact. A true aneurysm may be fusiform which is of circumferential and uniform shape or a saccular aneurysm which is pouch-like with a narrow neck bulging to one side.</li>
                            <li><strong>False aneurysm:</strong> is also called pseudoaneurysm and has disruption of all the layers of the vessel resulting into bleeding. This may result from trauma, infection, disruption of arterial suture line, removal of canulas and catheters.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>The walls of the blood vessels weaken and dilate with tabulate blood flow. Thrombi are deposited in the aortic wall resulting into danger of embolising. In atherosclerosis, plaque deposited on the intima causes degenerative changes on the middle layer, thus leading to loss of elasticity, weakening and dilation of the vessel. The vessel may rupture. A Ruptured aneurysm causes massive bleeding because of its turbulence. It also causes cerebral vascular accident when the rupture is in the brain. However the most common site for an aneurysm is the aorta.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical features of Aortic Aneurysm</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Deep diffuse chest pain for ascending aorta</li>
                            <li>Hoarseness due to laryngeal nerve pressure for arch of aorta aneurysms</li>
                            <li>Dysphagia due to pressure an oesophagus</li>
                            <li>In case they press on the vena cava, they cause decreased venous-return resulting into oedema</li>
                            <li>Abdominal pain</li>
                            <li>Blue toe syndrome due to formation of emboli</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <p><strong>Investigations:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physical examination</li>
                            <li>Chest X-ray</li>
                            <li>CT Scan</li>
                            <li>Aotography</li>
                            <li>Echocardiogram</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The goal of management is to prevent rapture of the aneurysm. Detailed evaluation is done also to identify any existing problem or obstruction to blood flow that may be co-existing. The management of choice is surgical interventions. Surgical technique depends on location, size and pathophysiological effects.</p>

                        <p>Occlusive disease can be treated with nonsurgical and surgical means. The non-surgical treatment involves use of mild analgesics, walking daily as tolerated, foot care, avoidance of trauma and avoidance of tobacco. First, the individuals must avoid foods that can predispose to arterial depositions. Nutritional care involves adjusting caloric intake to achieve optimum weight, decreasing dietary cholesterol, reducing saturated dietary fat and restricting sodium to 2 g/day.</p>
                        <h5>Care of Patients with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</h5>
                        <p>Deep vein thrombosis is treated with both conservative and surgical measures. The conservative measures are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continuous IV heparin</li>

                        <p>Any of the cellular components of the blood can be affected by disease. The cellular components were mentioned before, they are erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes.</p>
                        <h4>Leucopoenia</h4>
                        <p>Leucopoenia is a decrease in the number of white blood cells. It may affect any of the specific types of white blood cells. Granulocytopenia is a decrease in circulating granulocytes. In many cases, it is a result of drugs, irradiation, bone marrow disease or severe infections. Patients become susceptible to infections when the number of circulating white blood cells is low.</p>
                        <h4>Lymphoproliferative Diseases</h4>
                        <p>Lymphoproliferative disorders are those that affect the white blood cells and lymphoid tissue. They include leukaemia, lymphomas and multiple myeloma.</p>
                        <h5>Leukaemia</h5>
                        <p>Leukaemia is a malignant neoplasm of the white blood cells. The types of leukaemia according to the predominant cell type are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Myelocytic leukaemia</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>They can also be classified according to whether they are acute or chronic. There is Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) among others. Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia is common in children, while Acute Myelocytic Leukaemia is common in patients aged between 13 and 39 years.</p>
                        <p>Chronic Myelocytic Leukaemia (CML) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) are common in the elder generation. The causes of leukaemia are not known. However, associated factors are irradiation, genetic predisposition, exposure to certain chemicals and viral infections.</p>
                        <p>The clinical manifestations include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bone marrow suppression</li>

                            <li>Frequent infections</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once a diagnosis of leukaemia has been made, therapeutic management includes chemotherapeutic drugs and sometimes radiation. The patient should be evaluated and support given to avoid complications such as haemorrhage and infection.</p>
                        <p>In more advanced treatment centres, bone marrow transplant is undertaken. Nurses should know the various drug combinations used for treatment of leukaemia and the cycles of treatment, the doses and side effects.</p>
                        <p>The specific nursing actions necessary are:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <h6>Hodgkin's disease</h6>
                        <p>This is characterised by abnormal proliferation of multinucleated cells in the lymph node known as Reed-Sternberg cells. It's of two types, Hodkins paragramutoma which is milder and Hodkins Sarcoma which is more severe.</p>
                        <p>Hodgkin's disease is characterised by enlargement of lymph nodes, which is not painful. Lymph nodes become enlarged and the spleen increases in size. Patients also suffer high-grade swinging fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue and anaemia.</p>
                        <p>The liver, lungs, digestive tract and central nervous system also get involved. Due to the proliferation of abnormal cells, the immunologic response is defective. Hodgkin's disease is staged according to lymphoid involvement. In the assessment, the objective data that may be obtained is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enlarged lymph nodes</li>
                            <li>Progressive anaemia</li>
                            <li>Elevated temperature</li>
                            <li>Enlarged liver and spleen</li>
                            <li>Pressure symptoms due to enlarged nodes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Hodgkin's disease is managed depending on the stage of the disease. Radiation, a combination of radiation and chemotherapy, or chemotherapy are the choice methods. The drug combination for Hodgkin's disease is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>MOPP - Nitrogen Mustard and vincristine (Oncovin) on day 1 and day 8, Procarbazine and prednisone on day 1 and day 14</li>
                            <li>ABVD - Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and Bleomycin on day 1 and day 15, Vinblastine and Darcabazine on day 1 and day 15</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Skin therapy, psychological and social aspects are included in each case. The nursing actions are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Providing emotional support</li>
                            <li>Protecting the patient from infection</li>
                            <li>Monitoring the patient's temperature</li>
                            <li>Observing for symptoms of anaemia and managing accordingly</li>
                            <li>Encouraging good nutrition</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas</h6>
                        <p>One type of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma is Burkitt's lymphoma, which is common in Kenya. It may affect the jaw or abdomen. Patients present with fever, frequent infections, enlarged asymmetrical jaw, abdominal mass and anaemia. Medical and nursing management is similar to that of Hodgkin's disease.</p>

                        <h5>Multiple Myeloma</h5>
                        <p>Multiple Myeloma is a disorder of the plasma cell (B lymphocytes). There is abnormal proliferation of plasma cells. The first symptoms to appear are bone pain, weight loss, pathological fractures and weakness. This may progress to heart failure, neurological problems and renal failure.</p>
                        <p>Multiple myeloma can be easily treated if diagnosed early, by addressing both the disease and its symptoms. Ambulation and hydration are used to treat hypercalcemia accompanying multiple myeloma, hyperuricemia and dehydration. Weight bearing helps the bones reabsorb some calcium. Pain control and chemotherapy are all part of the management. Some drugs such as allopurinol may be used to counteract the hyperuricaemia (that may cause gout) due to chemotherapy.</p>

                        <h4>Disorders of the Red Blood Cells and Coagulation</h4>
                        <p>The red blood cells are involved in oxygen transport and fine pH adjustment. After about 120 days, the red blood cells become old and are destroyed, resulting in the formation of bilirubin.</p>
                        <h5>Anaemia</h5>
                        <p>Anaemia is a condition in which there is a low number of circulating red blood cells and, therefore, abnormally low haemoglobin, which is defined according to age, sex and geographical location. Anaemia can result from:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Excessive loss through bleeding</li>
                            <li>Deficient cell production because of nutritional deficiencies and bone marrow failure</li>
                            <li>Premature or excessive haemolysis</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Sickle Cell Anaemia</h5>
                        <p>It is a disorder that affects the red blood cells which contain a special protein called haemoglobin ( Hb for short). The function of haemoglobin is to carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body.</p>
                        <p>People with Sickle Cell Anaemia have Sickle haemoglobin ( HbS ) which is different from the normal haemoglobin ( HbA ). When sickle haemoglobin gives up its oxygen to the tissues, it sticks together to form long rods inside the red blood cells making these cells rigid and sickleshaped. Normal red blood cells can bend and flex easily.</p>
                        <p>Because of their shape, sickled red blood cells can't squeeze through small blood vessels as easily as the almost disc-shaped normal cells. This can lead to these small blood vessels getting blocked which then stops the oxygen from getting through to where it is needed. This in turn can lead to severe pain and damage to organs. The most affected parts are joints, however the abdomen and chest can also be affected. Sometimes infarction can occur in tissues lacking oxygen.</p>
                        <p>A person with sickle cell trait does not have the disease but carries the gene that causes the disease. Persons with sickle cell trait usually have both HbS and HbA , but the HbA is more thus preventing the person from having symptoms of sickle cell disease. If two people with sickle cell trait get married there is a 25% chances of bearing children with sickle cell disease. They therefore require genetic counselling before marriage.</p>
                        <p>A sickle cell crisis occurs when sickled red blood cells block small blood vessels that carry blood. This causes pain that can begin suddenly and last several hours to several days. The patient might have pain in their back, knees, legs, arms, chest or stomach. The pain can be throbbing, sharp, dull or stabbing. A sickle cell crisis can also cause a severe attack of anaemia.</p>
                        <p>The mode of management of a patient who has sickle cell disease involves pain control, treatment for anaemia and patient education. These patients must be given genetic counselling. The therapeutic management of sickle cell disease is mainly supportive with alleviation of symptoms such as chronic leg ulcers, which are treated with bed rest, antibiotics and dressings.</p>
                        <p>Since nutritional anaemia's are more common in our population, it will be necessary to learn more about them.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Nutritional Deficiency Anaemia</h5>
                        <p>Iron deficiency anaemia is usually caused by dietary lack of iron. Hookworm infestation and deficiencies of other foods can also cause iron deficiency.</p>
                        <p>Megaloblastic anaemia, on the other hand, is due to vitamin B12 deficiency, pernicious anaemia and folic acid deficiency. Pernicious anaemia is anaemia caused by a lack of intrinsic factor leading to a lack of absorption of vitamin B12. Fish tapeworm infestation can also cause megaloblastic anaemia.</p>
                        <p>The causes of anaemia generally are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Deficiency of materials for synthesis of haemoglobin, through deficient diets, malabsorption, high demands through pregnancy and lactation, drugs that lead to non-absorption, bowel disease that causes poor absorption, and pernicious anaemia</li>
                            <li>Blood loss</li>
                            <li>Destruction of red blood cells</li>
                            <li>Failure to produce red blood cells</li>
                            <li>Blood cell cancers</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are several manifestations of anaemia. When assessing a patient, look for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Brittle hair</li>
                            <li>Signs of fatigue</li>
                            <li>Dyspnoea</li>
                            <li>Palpitations</li>
                            <li>A smooth tongue</li>
                            <li>Dysphasia</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Other manifestations include decreased sensation, pallor, rapid pulse, faintness and dizziness, high output heart failure and spoon shaped nails (koilonychia). High output failure is congestive failure because of overload, which affects the left side of the heart. In some of the vitamin deficiencies, loss of sensation may be a clinical sign.</p>
                        <p>When managing anaemic patients, you should try to ensure that they can participate in activities of daily living (ADL's), experience no fatigue and replace essential nutrients. The different causes of anaemia will determine the different nursing interventions. Dietary changes, blood transfusion and pharmacologic agents can be tried.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Aplastic Anaemia</h5>
                        <p>Bone marrow suppression results in aplastic anaemia. Aplastic anaemia is due to irradiation, infections, drugs such as chloraphenical, and toxic chemicals. Cytotoxic therapy can result in aplastic anaemia. Aplasia results in failure to produce blood cells, leading to a reduction in leucocytes, erythrocytes and thrombocytes. The red bone marrow gets replaced with fatty tissue. Due to involvement of different cells in the bone marrow, patient may present with abnormal cellular levels. There could be marked bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, pallor, weakness, breathlessness on exertion, dyspnoea and fever.</p>
                        <p>Management involves a bone marrow transplant to provide the patient with intact hemopoietic tissue. Antilympholytic globulin and high dose of methypredinison therapy is given. Careful assessment and supportive therapy is important for these patients.</p>
                        <h5>Polycythaemia</h5>
                        <p>When the red blood cell mass is abnormally high, the condition is called polycythaemia vera. The haemoglobin level is abnormally high. It may occur with living at high altitude. The blood becomes thick and this can result in hypertension.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Coagulation Disorders</h5>
                        <p>The process of coagulation involves vessel spasm, platelet aggregation, and formation of fibrin clot, clot retraction and fibrinolysis afterwards. This was mentioned when you covered the process of blood clotting. The conditions associated with hypercoagulation are atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, smoking, high cholesterol, pregnancy and puerperium. Immobility and malignancies accelerate the activity of the clotting system.</p>
                        <h6>Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation</h6>
                        <p>Coagulation defects, on the other hand, result in easy bleeding. This is initiated by situations where there is massive consumption of coagulation factors leading to easy bleeding. Endothelial damage resulting from many causes, for example, obstetric conditions such as placental abruption, malignancies, severe burns, severe infection and severe malaria, shock, surgery and blood transfusion reaction can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).</p>
                        <p>This is a life threatening condition that you may have heard about. The therapeutic management of DIC involves relief of the underlying cause, for example, IV antibiotic for suspected septicaemia. Exacerbating factors such as acidosis, dehydration, renal failure and hypoxia should be corrected. Blood transfusion to correct identified deficiencies such as platelets, fibrinogen, and so on, should be given. Here you must remember that observing for any bleeding, minimising skin punctures and providing emotional support are important nursing actions.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Haemophilia</h5>
                        <p>Haemophilia A is a sex linked disorder which is characterised by reduced or absent factor VIII activity, while haemophilia B is a similar disease but is due to the absence of or reduced factor IX . The main characteristic of haemophilia is persistent bleeding into joints and muscles, hence crippling arthritis. Easy bleeding is the hallmark of the disease. The female is the carrier; but it is her male offspring that may suffer.</p>
                        <p>Management of haemophilia includes emergency measures to prevent bleeding and administration of the missing clotting factors after proper investigation. Use of blood products and transfusion are necessary measures while investigations are undertaken. The main role of the nurse in this situation is health education on healthy living and avoidance of injury by the patient. When you are caring for patients with haemophilia you must ensure measures are taken to stop the bleeding as soon as possible, administer specific coagulation factor, give rest and manage any life threatening complications. Most of the long-term measures are related to education. All activities of daily living should be done with utmost care to avoid trauma.</p>

                        <h5>Blood Transfusion Reaction</h5>
                        <p>The reactions that are likely to occur during a blood transfusion include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute haemolytic reactions</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>If a patient on blood transfusion gets a transfusion reaction, you should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stop the transfusion</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The kidney is an important organ of excretion. If kidneys fail completely, then there is a threat to survival.</p>
                        <h4>Structure</h4>
                        <p>The kidneys are bean shaped organs located behind the peritoneum on either side of the vertebral column, from the 12th thoracic vertebral to the third lumbar vertebra. Each kidney is about 11 cm long, 7 cm wide and 3 cm thick and weighs 120-170 g. The right kidney is slightly lower than the left probably due to the space occupied by the liver.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-213-1.jpg" alt="Gross structure of the kidney, showing the cortex, medulla, pyramids, calyces, renal pelvis, and hilum." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>A thin, smooth layer of fibrous membrane, called the capsule, covers the surface of each kidney. The lateral surface of the kidney is convex and the medial surface is concave and forms a vertical cleft called the hilum where the renal blood and lymph vessels and nerves enter and renal vein and ureters exit.</p>
                        <p>On cutting the kidney longitudinally, various internal structures can be seen. The outer layer is the cortex while the inner part is the medulla. The medulla is made up of many pyramids. The apices of these pyramids are called papillae. It is through these papillae that urine passes to enter minor calyces, which merge to form major calyces. The calyces form the funnel shaped renal pelvis. The lumen of the pelvis decreases to form the ureter.</p>

                        <p>The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron. Each kidney has more than one million nephrons. A nephron consists of a glomerulus, Bowman's capsule and a tubular system. The tubular system has a proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and the distal convoluted tubule. Many distal convoluted tubules drain into a collecting duct. The glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, the proximal and distal tubules are in the cortex while the loop of Henle and the collecting ducts are in the medulla.</p>

                        <h5 id="renal-failure-management-heading">Clinical Features</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Has a rapid onset which results from retention of fluids metabolic wastes and the inability to regulate electrolytes.</li>
                            <li>The patient is acutely ill and may suffer from acidosis, anaemia, fluid and electrolytes imbalances, fluid overload or deficit and gastrointestinal distress.</li>
                            <li>Oliguria (urine output of less than 400 ml per day) or anuria (urine output of less than 100 ml/day).</li>
                            <li>Oedema and hypertension when the fluid intake exceeds the urinary output and insensible losses (skin and lungs).</li>
                            <li>Signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure and pulmonary oedema in excessive fluid overload.</li>
                            <li>Symptoms of uremia - nausea, vomiting drowsiness, fatigue, shortness of breath, confusion, convulsions, coma or gastrointestinal bleeding.</li>
                            <li>Fever, pleuric pain from pericarditis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>The Phases of Acute Renal Failure</h5>
                        <p>There are three phases:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Onset:</strong> This is the initial phase of injury to the kidney and reversal or prevention of kidney dysfunction is possible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Oliguric Phase:</strong> Urine is less than 400 ml/day. Is accompanied by a rise in serum concentration of the elements usually secreted by the kidneys (urea, creatinine, uric acid and intracellular cations potassium and magnesium). The patient is acutely ill and the phase lasts approximately 10-14 days. The longer this phase, the worse the prognosis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diuretic Phase:</strong> Patient experiences a gradual increase in daily urinary output which may be greater than 2000 ml/day, but about one to three litres per day. Despite the urinary output rising, the nephrons are still not fully functional. The kidneys have also recovered their ability to excrete wastes but not to concentrate urine.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Recovery Period:</strong> The phase begins when the glomerular filtrate rate rises and the blood urea nitrogen and serum creatirinine levels start to stabilise and then decrease. The phase lasts 3-12 months.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>History taking and physical examination are done to determine the causes.</li>
                            <li>Urinalysis will show casts or proteins in intrarenal disorders.</li>
                            <li>Decreased or absent urinary output.</li>
                            <li>Increase levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, sodium, potassium and chloride.</li>
                            <li>Decreased serum calcium, carbon dioxide (bicarbonate) and haemoglobin.</li>
                            <li>If the diagnosis cannot be made by history and physical examination, then the following tests may be done: Renal ultrasound, renal scan, retrograde pyelogram, Computed Tomography (CT) scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>Because acute renal failure is reversible the primary goal of treatment is to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Admit the patient in a well ventilated room.</li>
                            <li>Maintain the patient in as normal state as possible while the kidneys are repairing themselves.</li>
                            <li>The predisposing cause is determined and corrected.</li>
                            <li>Management is focused on controlling the patient's symptoms and preventing complications.</li>
                            <li>The first step in the management is to determine if there is adequate blood supply to the kidneys.</li>
                            <li>Replace fluid carefully because fluid overload can easily occur. The amount of fluid administered is based on previous days output (urine, vomitus, diarrhoea) plus an amount to account for the body's insensible loss (500-600 ml).</li>
                            <li>During oliguric phase prevent hyperkalaemia, severe acidosis, severe fluid overload and pulmonary oedema which may become life threatening.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Nutritional Therapy</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Proteins and potassium are restricted to help reduce the accumulation of electrolytes and metabolic wastes.</li>
                            <li>Fluid and sodium are restricted during the oliguric phase to decrease fluid overload.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Drug Therapy</h6>
                        <p>Drugs used in acute renal failure include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Digoxin to increase stroke volume.</li>
                            <li>Antihypertensive to reduce the elevated blood pressure.</li>
                            <li>Stool softeners may be given to prevent constipation and excessive straining.</li>
                            <li>Dietary supplements, for example multivitamin and iron supplements.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Dialysis, preferably haemodialysis is done to control the build up of electrolytes, metabolic wastes and fluids. The most common indications for dialysis in acute renal fails include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Volumes overload resulting in congestive heart failure</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary oedema</li>
                            <li>Potassium levels greater then 6.0 mmoL</li>
                            <li>Metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate level less than 15 mml/L)</li>
                            <li>BUN level greater than 120 gm/dl 43 mMol/L</li>
                            <li>Significant change in mental status</li>
                            <li>Pericarditis</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Chronic Renal Failure</h4>
                        <p>This is the progressive irreversible destruction of the nephrons in both kidneys. The destruction progresses and the nephrons are destroyed and replaced by non-functional scar tissue.</p>
                        <h5>Causes</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chronic glomerulonephritis</li>
                            <li>Acute renal failure</li>
                            <li>Polycystic kidney disease</li>
                            <li>Obstruction</li>
                            <li>Repeated pyelonephritis</li>
                            <li>Nephrotoxins</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Other systemic diseases that may cause chronic renal failure include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diabetes mellitus</li>
                            <li>Hypertension</li>
                            <li>Polyarteritis</li>
                            <li>Sickle cell disease</li>
                            <li>Amyloid disease</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Pathophysiology</h5>
                        <p>The specific pathophysislogy depends on the underlying disease process.As the nephrons are destroyed, the total glomerular filtration rate falls and clearance is reduced. BUN and serum creatinine levels rise. There is increased hypertrophy of the remaining nephron as a result of increased workload. Glomerular filtration remains effective until 70% to 80% of renal function is lost.</p>
                        <h5>Clinical Manifestations</h5>
                        <p>As the renal function deteriorates, every body system becomes involved. The clinical manifestations are as a result of retained substances which include urea creatinine, hormones, electrolytes and water, imbalance of fluids and electrolytes. Manifestations may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Uremia, anaemia, acidosis.</li>
                            <li>Fluid and sodium are either abnormally retained or excreted.</li>
                            <li>Urinary volume may be increased, normal or decreased.</li>
                            <li>Hypertension is common due to increase in total body water and sodium.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
                        <p>Based on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>History.</li>
                            <li>Symptoms.</li>
                            <li>Laboratory studies - serum creatinine and creatinine clearance. A rise in serum creatinine and a fall in creatinine clearance indicates renal failure.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>The focus is on conservative management. Every effort is made to detect and treat potentially reversible causes of renal failure, for example cardiac failure, dehydration, pyelonephiritis, nephrotoxins and urinary tract obstruction.</p>
                        <p>Conservative management is directed toward:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preserving existing renal function</li>
                            <li>Treating the symptoms</li>
                            <li>Preventing complications</li>
                            <li>Providing for the patient's comfort</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Drug Therapy</h6>
                        <p>A patient with renal insufficiency is cautioned to avoid non-steroidal anti-inflamanatory drugs since they block synthesis of prostaglandin in the kidney that promote vasodilatation and thereby reducing blood supply to the kidney.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute hyperkalaemia is treated by (IV) glucose and IV 10% calcium gluconate.</li>
                            <li>Hypertension - treatment consists of: Sodium and fluid restriction, The administration of antihypertensive, for example beta blockers like nicardipine, nifedipine, Diuretic therapy.</li>
                            <li>Anaemia - treated with iron supplements and folic acid. Transfusion is recommended in severe anaemia when the patient is symptomatic.</li>
                            <li>Gastrointestinal symptoms, for example nausea is treated with antacids, antiemetics, dietary control of nitrogenous wastes and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Nutritional Therapy</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Restrict proteins - administer only 20 g of high quality protein to prevent accumulation of nitrogenous waste products. The restriction depends on the ability of the person to excrete wastes from the body.</li>
                            <li>Restriction of sodium and potassium. Sodium restriction may depend on the degree of oedema and hypertension. Patient is advised to avoid food high in sodium like canned foods.</li>
                            <li>Water restriction - mainly to depend on the daily urine output.</li>
                            <li>Phosphate intake is reduced to less than 1000 mg/day.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Promotion of Patient's Comfort</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patients are prone to muscle cramping, pruritus, headaches, ocular irritation, insomnia and fatigue.</li>
                            <li>The primary treatment involves control of the electrolyte imbalance.</li>
                            <li>Treatment of pruritus is aimed at decreasing the phosphorus.</li>
                            <li>Local and systemic agents may be administered to decrease the itching.</li>
                            <li>Ocular irritation is as a result of calcium deposits and treatment is aimed at decreasing the plasma phosphate levels.</li>
                            <li>Insomnia and fatigue are due to uremia and are treated by decreasing metabolic wastes and providing psychological support.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the above measures are not successful then renal dialysis is performed.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Bladder Dysfunction and Neurogenic Bladder</h4>
                        <p>Bladder dysfunction essentially results in retention and obstruction to urine flow. The signs and symptoms of this are bladder distension, frequency of micturition, a small and weak stream of urine, a feeling of incomplete emptying and hesitating before micturition. Some of the causes include stones, tumours and scarring due to injury or infection.</p>
                        <p>When there is involuntary loss of urination control, it is known as urinary incontinence. It may be due to stress, physiologic dysfunction, reflex incontinence or overflow incontinence. An incompetent bladder sphincter should be managed with the objective of avoiding urinary leakage. A catheter with urine bag could be used. It is important to give emotional support to the patient.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Cancer of the Bladder</h4>
                        <p>Malignant tumors of the bladder are the most common tumors within the urinary system, but when considering the entire genitourinary system, then prostate tumors are more prevalent. Cancer of the bladder is most common between the ages of 60 and 70 years and it is three times as common in men as in women.</p>
                        <p>There are three types of bladder cancer:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Transitional cell carcinoma.</li>
                            <li>Squamous cell carcinoma.</li>
                            <li>Adenocarcinoma - common in individual with chronic recurrent bladder stones, chronic lower urinary tract infections and in patients who have indwelling catheters for long periods.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Transitional cell carcinoma is the most common, accounting for approximately 90% of all bladder cancers. It develops in the epithelial lining of the bladder. The tumours can be identified as being papillary or non-papillary lesions. Papillary lesions are usually superficial and grow outward from the mucosa, while non-papillary tumours are solid growths that tend to extent deep into the bladder wall and are likely to metastasize.</p>
                        <h5>Predisposing Factors</h5>
                        <p>Bladder cancer is related to a number of environmental and occupational health hazards:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Certain chemicals used by industrial workers in the rubber and cable industries, textile, printing, coal and gas production and sewage works.</li>
                            <li>Cigarette smoking.</li>
                            <li>Drinking coffee.</li>
                            <li>Women treated with radiation for cervical cancer and patients receiving cyclophosphamide (cytoxan).</li>
                            <li>Chronic abuse of phenacetin containing analgesics.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Clinical Manifestations</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Painless haematuria (most common symptom) and may be a gross or microscopic finding. This can occur with each voiding or intermittently.</li>
                            <li>Irritative voiding symptoms such as dysuria, frequency and urgency.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
                        <p>This is based on symptoms, history and diagnostic tests which may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Urine specimen is taken for cytology to determine the presence of neoplastic cells.</li>
                            <li>Radiological studies - intravenous pyelogram, ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT) scan or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>The type of treatment initiated depends on the form of tumour and the stages of the disease. The following various therapies are used in the management of cancer of bladder:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bloodless destruction of the lesion</li>
                            <li>Multiple tumours can be eradicated without using anaesthesia</li>
                            <li>Minimal risk of operation</li>
                            <li>Lack of need for a urinary catheter</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Laser therapy (Laser photocoagulation):</strong> This procedure can be repeated a number of times to prevent recurrence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open loop resection:</strong> This method is used for the control of bleeding for large superficial tumours and for multiple lesions which require segmental resection of the bladder (segmental cystectomy).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Surgical Treatment of Non-papillary or Muscle - Invasive Bladder Cancer</h5>

                            <li><strong>Segmental or partial cystectomy:</strong> Is done if there is a tumour in the bladder that in not accessible to treatment by transurethral resection. The objective is to only remove that portion of the bladder affected without injuring the ureters, bladder neck or prostate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intravesical immunotherapy:</strong> The treatment involves the instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin into the bladder.</li>
                            <li><strong>Radical cystectomy:</strong> Is performed when the bladder cancer is not treatable by conservative measures or when there is recurrence after conservative therapy.</li>

                        <h4>Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy</h4>
                        <p>Benign prostatic hypertrophy is a non-malignant disorder occurring in men over 40 years of age. As the prostate enlarges, it compresses the urethra causing obstruction. The urinary stream flow becomes weaker. Incontinence, frequency and nocturia are common.</p>
                        <p>The specific nursing care for patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy involves many actions. You must encourage increased fluid intake of at least 3,000 ml per day. Urinary antiseptics and antibiotics are given to prevent urinary tract infections. Nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin are good drugs in this case. Immediately after prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate, vital observations, monitoring the patency of the urinary catheters, input-output monitoring and change of dressings must be undertaken. As part of the postoperative education, you should instruct the patient to perform perineal exercises to regain bladder control.</p>

                        <h4>Prostatic Cancer</h4>
                        <p>Prostatic cancer is the most common cancer in men. Its incidence increases with age and its symptoms are similar to those of benign prostatic hypertrophy. As it progresses, there is anaemia, with metastases to other organs and hence a more varied clinical picture. Mainly weight loss, easy fatigability, urinary obstruction, nocturia, and frequent urinary tract infections are manifested. The assessment of the patient involves rectal examination, enzyme studies and other investigations involving blood and electrolytes.</p>
                        <p>Benign prostatic hypertrophy and early cancer of the prostate can be managed surgically. The most common procedure is prostatectomy.</p>
                        <p>After prostatectomy, irrigation of the bladder, close observation, antibiotics and wound care must be undertaken. If the cancer cannot be treated surgically, then chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be attempted. Education on the populations at risk and frequent checkups for men from the age of 40 years must be shared with the community. For the patient with cancer of the prostate who has undergone prostatectomy, you need to explain to them that female sexual characteristics may develop as a result of estrogen therapy. Provide general nursing care related to chemotherapy such as infection prevention and treatment of anaemia.</p>

                        <h4>Cancer of the Testis</h4>
                        <p>Cancer of the testis occurs commonly in men aged 20-35 years.</p>
                        <h5>Predisposing Factors</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Common in males who have had undecended testes (cryptorchidism) or with a family history of testicular cancer.</li>
                            <li>Those individuals with a history of mumps, orchitis, inguinal hernia in childhood and trauma.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Pathophysiology</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>90 to 95% of all primary testicular cancers arise from the germ cell epithelium of the testis.</li>
                            <li>The cancer is classified as either seminomas or non seminomas.</li>
                            <li>Seminomas are the most common of all cancer of the testis, they grow slowly and are usually localised in that they may be confined to the testicles or retroperitoneal lymph nodes and have a good prognosis.</li>
                            <li>Non seminomas tend to be invasive and metastasize quickly through the lymphatic system or blood.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Clinical Manifestations</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In early stages cancer of the testis is asymptomatic except for the hardened area or lump on the testis.</li>
                            <li>A dull ache or heavy feeling develops in the lower abdomen, inguinal or scrotal area.</li>
                            <li>If it is associated with infection the patient presents with acute testicular pain necrosis and haemorrhage.</li>
                            <li>Symptoms from metastasis may include: Neck mass, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal disturbances, central and peripheral nervous system involvement, lower extremity oedema, anorexia and weight loss.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>The therapeutic interventions include removal of the testis, lymph node resection in the retroperitoneal area, radiation and chemotherapy. The specific nursing care will be similar to that given to patients receiving chemotherapy. After surgery, close observation, wound care and patient counselling on hormonal therapy will be necessary.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The skin is an organ that is involved in excretion, regulation, protection and sensory input in the human body. The integuments include the skin, hair, nails and various glands. The diseases affecting the other integuments are mainly communicable diseases and you will cover them in unit four of module three. The skin has three layers.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-225-1.jpg" alt="Cross-section of the skin showing its three main layers: Epidermis, Dermis, and Subcutaneous tissue (hypodermis)." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <h5>The Epidermis</h5>
                        <p>The epidermis is the outermost layer. It is thin and is nourished from diffused nutrients and oxygen. It is composed of stratified epithelium, which varies in thickness and is composed of five layers. Dead cells from the outermost layer slough off and are replaced by others.</p>
                        <h5>The Dermis</h5>
                        <p>The dermis is the second layer of the skin. It has blood vessels, nerves, lymphatic vessels, hair follicles, involuntary muscle fibres, glands and collagen fibres. It is the collagen that gives the skin its elasticity. The dermis is divided into two layers. These are the upper papillary layers and the lower reticular layers.</p>
                        <h5>Subcutaneous Tissues</h5>
                        <p>This is mainly composed of adipose tissue. It attaches the skin to underlying structures.</p>
                        <h5>Functions of the Skin</h5>
                        <ul>

                        <h4>Disorders of the Integuments</h4>
                        <p>Some disorders that can afflict the skin are: eczema, psoriasis, and tumors of the skin.</p>
                        <h5>Skin Lesions</h5>
                        <p>When these are observed they should be described in terms of type, colour, size, shape, configuration and arrangement, distribution and texture.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Proper description terminology should be used for clear accurate communication about skin lesions, for example the term vesicle provides a clear picture of a lesion that is clear, fluid filled and smaller than 1 cm.</li>
                            <li><strong>Colour:</strong> This varies from pale, brown, red to normal background pigmentation. Colour helps to identify whether the lesion may be secondary to an inflammatory process, infection, and sun exposure or hereditary.</li>
                            <li><strong>Size:</strong> The metric system is used for measurement, but where a ruler is not available the size of a lesion may be estimated by measuring a portion of ones finger to use a gauge.</li>
                            <li><strong>Share and Demarcation:</strong> Shape describes the contour of a lesion and this may be round, oral, polygonal (many sided) and asymmetric. Demarcation refers to the sharpness of the edge of a lesion, whether discrete or diffuse.</li>
                            <li><strong>Texture:</strong> The lesion is described as being rough or smooth, dry or moist and on the surface, or deeply penetrating into the tissue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> Refers to the arrangement or pattern of lesions in relation to other lesions. Skin lesions can occur discretely or in groupings. The groupings may be termed as linear, following a line, annular, ring like, confluent, merging together, or serpiginous, serpent like, while disseminated refers to multiple scattered lesion diffusely distributed over the body.</li>
                            <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> This takes into consideration both the arrangement of lesions over an area of skin as well as the pattern. This may be described as discrete (isolated), localised, regional and generalised.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Diagnostic Tests</h5>
                        <p>Most skin disorders are diagnosed by careful physical assessment. Diagnostic tests may be used when further information is required to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
                        <h6>Laboratory Tests</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tzanck prep test:</strong> The test can be used to further differentiate sign disorders that produce vesicles or blisters. The blister is unroofed with a cotton swab or blade and the base of the vesicle is seraped to obtain cells for examination.</li>
                            <li><strong>Potassium hydroxide (KOH) prep test:</strong> The test is done if fungal infection is suspected to assist in the identification of the fungal forms. Dry scale is scraped from the lesion and put on a slide. One or two drops of 20% KOH are placed onto the slide and gently heated.</li>
                            <li><strong>Culture:</strong> Gram stain and culture and sensitivity of weeping or pustular lesions is performed to rule out bacterial sources for infection. Streptococci and staphylococci are the most common organisms that cause skin infections. Wound cultures are obtained by swabbing of the exudates from the lesion surface.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Other Skin Disorders</h5>
                        <p>There are a vast number of dermatological conditions but the common conditions include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acne</li>

                            <li>Psoriasis</li>
                            <li>Viral warts</li>
                            <li>Benign and malignant skin tumors</li>
                            <li>Leg ulceration</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Eczemas</h5>
                        <p>Eczema is characterised by superficial inflammation of the skin. The terms eczema and dermatitis are often used interchangeably. There are many forms or eczema each of which is triggered by certain non-infective factors.</p>
                        <h6>Contact Dermatitis</h6>
                        <p>There are two types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Irritant Contact Dermatitis</li>
                            <li>Allergic Contact Dermatitis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Irritant Contact Dermatitis:</strong> This is a non-allergic reaction occurring in any person on contact with a sufficient concentration of irritant. It occurs four times more commonly than allergic contract dermatitis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Mechanical irritation from wool or glass fibres. Chemical irritants include acids, alkalis, solvents detergents, insecticides and industrial compounds. Biologic irritants include urine, faeces and toxins from insects or aquatic plants. Persons engaged in wet work such as food handlers, health care workers and child care providers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Allergic Contact Dermatitis:</strong> This is a cell mediated type IV delayed hypersensitivity immune reaction from contact with a specific antigen.</p>
                        <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Typical antigens include: Poison ivy, Synthetics, Industrial chemicals, Drugs for example: penicillin, Metals especially nickel in jewellery (most common) and chromate. Once the skin has been sensitised, further contact with a sensitising substance will produce an eczematous reaction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mode of Transmission:</strong> The sensitising allergen may reach the site by: Direct contact, Indirect contact for example; transmission by animals, From one part of the body to the other by hands, From clothing, By the air for example: in smoke.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pathophysiology:</strong> The lesions appear sooner in an irritant contact than in allergic type. The rash develops on the exposed areas, particularly the more sensitive areas for example: dorsal more than the palmar surface of the hands.</p>
                        <p><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Patch testing is performed where the agent is unknown.</p>
                        <p><strong>Management:</strong> Weeping vesicular lesions are treated with domeboro soaks (aluminum acetate) applied one to two times a day. Crusts and scales are not removed but are allowed to drop off naturally as the skin heals. Topical corticosteroids are applied twice a day to the affected areas for approximately two weeks. When the affected areas are on the face, genital and skin folds weaker steroids are used, for example: hydrocortisone 0.5% to 1%. In case of generalised rash or significant face and hand involvement oral corticosteroids may be prescribed. Itching is relieved by administering oral antilistaminies and topical antipruritic agents.</p>
                        <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> This can be ensured by: Avoiding the irritating or sensitising substance whenever possible. Protecting the skin by wearing appropriate clothing where poison ivy is grown or by immediately rinsing the skin for 15 minutes with running water to prevent skin penetration when in contact with poison ivy. If in contact, clothes should be removed carefully to prevent skin contact. Change of environment if sensitivity develops in living or working environment. Use of gloves when handling irritant or allergenic substances. Use of mild soap in case of sensitivity to detergents.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Atopic Dermatitis</h5>
                        <p>This is a common inflammatory skin condition linked to a larger group or atopic diseases including asthma and hay fever. It's a chronic condition. Common in children and often develops symptoms by six months of age and becomes less severe between the ages of two and three.</p>
                        <h6>Predisposing Factors</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sudden changes in temperature and humidity</li>
                            <li>Exercise</li>
                            <li>Psychologic stress</li>
                            <li>Fibres such as wool, fur or nylon</li>
                            <li>Detergents</li>
                            <li>Perfumes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intense pruritus</li>
                            <li>Chronic rubbing and scratching which is followed by skin thickening (lichenification) and alteration in pigmentation (hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation)</li>
                            <li>Rough dry skin</li>
                            <li>Infants may develop moist, oozing, crusting lesions on the scalp and face and this may spread to the trunk, arms and legs</li>
                            <li>Later the lesions become localised on the neck, wrist, popliteal fossae, and eyelids and behind the ears</li>
                            <li>The erythema is dusky</li>
                            <li>Excoriations may become infected</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Pathophysiology</h6>
                        <p>The protective barrier function of the skin is diminished greatly. Lipid content changes in the epidermis permit water loss from the cells resulting in dry skin. There is a marked tendency toward vasoconstriction of superficial blood vessels. Cold and low humidity are poorly tolerated because of drying effects. Heat and high humidity are poorly tolerated because vasodilatation increases the inflammatory reaction and therefore aggravates the dermatitis and as well causing increased itching and discomfort.</p>
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <p>The aim is to control the symptoms but there is no cure. Topical therapies are sufficient to control atopic eczema and triple therapy is usually recommended for example: Topical steroid twice daily, Bath oil (oilatum) and soap (aqueous cream). General management: erythema. Avoid non irritants, for example soaps and animal fur. Manipulating the diet, for example taking dairy free diet.</p>
                        <h6>Complications</h6>
                        <p>Bacterial infections e.g. staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas.</p>

                        <h5>Psoriasis</h5>
                        <p>This is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the skin where the replacement of epidermal cells is faster than normal. The real causes are not known and the actual pathology is not well understood.</p>
                        <h6>Predisposing Factors</h6>
                        <p>Its associated factors are trauma, genetic, emotional, immunologic, drugs, infections such as streptococci, and excessive exposure to sunlight among others. Environmental factors that trigger psoriasis include:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Tumours of the Skin</h5>
                        <p>The tumours of the skin may be benign, premalignant or malignant. The benign ones include the more common keloids and cutaneous cysts. Malignant ones are basal cell carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma which is gaining prominence due to HIV/AIDS, and the melanomas.</p>
                        <h5>General Management of the Adult with Skin Disorders</h5>
                        <p>There are three principles to be followed in the management of skin disorders:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Treatment should be simple and aimed at preserving or restoring the physiologic state of the skin. Topical therapy is preferred because medication can be delivered in optimal concentrations at the exact site where it is needed.</li>
                            <li>If the condition the patient is suffering from makes the skin dry, then aim at making it more moist.</li>
                            <li>If the condition the patient is suffering from makes the skin wet, then aim at making it drier.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Skin diseases must be treated appropriately because they may make the patient develop emotional problems. Many skin problems are unlikely to lead to patients getting admitted and the medications are normally locally applied. Antibiotic creams and ointments are given in addition to skin dressings. Understanding drugs and procedure in skin care is all that is required.</p>
                        <p>Health education is of utmost importance in the management of skin problems. This is because most people associate dermatological diseases with poor skin hygiene. The kind of information that a patient with skin problem needs to have so as to facilitate better care is related to: Appropriate hygiene, Nutritional and metabolic requirements, Elimination pattern, Activity - exercise pattern, Perception of unusual sensations, Use of birth control hormones.</p>
                        <p>It is also important to know that drugs that may cause photosensitivity to the skin include antidysrhythmic drugs such as quinine, antihistamines, some antimicrobial agents, for example tetracycline and nalidixic acid, some diuretics, and oral hypoglycemic agents for example sulphonamides.</p>
                        <p>Health message sharing on preventive measures should be done regarding: Use of the sun for light skinned people and how drugs cause photosensitivity, Radiation therapy and its effects on the skin, Hygiene, Nutritional management, particularly fatty foods, vitamins and adequate proteins.</p>
                        <p>The general measures in the treatment are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use of phototherapy especially in the treatment of jaundice</li>
                            <li>Radiation therapy for cutaneous malignancies</li>
                            <li>Antibiotics for bacterial infections</li>
                            <li>Corticosteroids, especially topically applied</li>
                            <li>Antihistamines for hypersensitivity reactions</li>
                            <li>Surgery by use of various techniques such as lasers, curettage</li>
                            <li>Wet dressings - for dry conditions of the skin</li>
                            <li>Baths using appropriate solutions and general wound care</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Principles and Approaches Used in Palliative Care</h4>
                        <p>Palliative care is caring for people (and their families) who are suffering from life limiting illnesses.

Palliative care employs a holistic approach, which enables people to die with dignity while supporting those close to them.</p>
                        <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines palliative care as 'the active total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment', control of pain, psychological, social, and spiritual problems is paramount. The goal of palliative care is the achievement of the best quality of life for all patients and their families. Palliative care is an affordable and appropriate way of taking care of those with terminal illnesses. It is the key to supporting people with incurable illnesses. It has great relevance to your country because of the number of people living with HIV/AIDS and cancer.</p>
                        <p>Benefits of palliative care:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It improves the quality of life for the sick</li>
                            <li>It is suited to home care</li>

                        <h4>Principles of Pallative Care</h4>
                        <p>Palliative care is based on the philosophy of total care. It employs the following principles.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Involving team of medical workers, i.e. physicians, nurses , social workers, pastoral care professionals, physical and occupational therapist, pharmacist whose skills are required.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pain relief:</strong> Ensuring that the client experience death free of avoidable pain and suffering and in accordance with the client's and family's issue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Support:</strong> Ensuring availability of support for the client to enable them carry out activities they enjoy doing that improve the quality of their life.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Stages of Dying</h4>
                        <p>Kubler-Ross described 5 stages of dying. These are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Denial:</strong> During denial, a person may act as though nothing has happened and may refuse to believe or understand what the impending loss means.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anger:</strong> The individual resists the loss and may strike out at everyone and everything.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bargaining:</strong> During bargaining, the individual tries to postpone awareness e.g.'God, if you give me life I will serve you better' as though the loss can be prevented.</li>
                            <li><strong>Depression:</strong> In the depression stage, a person realises the impact of the loss. They feel very lonely and may withdraw from interpersonal interaction, refusing to talk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> Acceptance stage, loss is accepted and they begin to look to the future.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The stages do not necessarily appear in this order. Each terminally ill patient presents differently because of difference in personalities.</p>
                        <p>In the delivery of palliative care the nurse does the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms</li>
                            <li>Affirms life and regards dying as a normal process</li>
                            <li>Neither hasten nor postpone death.</li>
                            <li>Integrates psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care</li>
                            <li>Offers support systems to help client and family cope with patients illness and own bereavement</li>
                            <li>Enhances the quality of life</li>
                            <li>Ensures the patients dignity and self esteem are maintained</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Management of the Terminally Ill Client.</h4>
                        <h5>a) Assessment</h5>
                        <p>In caring for this patient, assessment includes the client, family and significant others. Grief assessment is ongoing throughout the period of illness. Questions that may be asked include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tell me how this diagnosis makes you feel?</li>
                            <li>How has this change in your life affected you today?</li>
                            <li>What are your feelings about your family, illness, etc?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>b) Nursing Diagnosis</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hopelessness related to failing physical condition</li>
                            <li>Dysfunctional grieving related to loss, e.g. loss of breast</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>c) Planning</h5>
                        <p>The focus in planning is to support the client physically, emotionally, developmentally and ensure self esteem and dignity are maintained. Therefore: Select communication strategies that assist patient adapt to loss. Provide skills/knowledge for the family to manage and understand care for the dying patient. The outcomes should include e.g: Patient will be able to continue the parental responsibilities of their children; Patient will express hope in radiotherapy. Interdiscplinary teams help in identifying and meeting the needs of patient and family.</p>
                        <h5>d) Implementation</h5>
                        <p>Although return to full function is not expected, the goal should be to return to optimal health. This is achieved through: Therapeutic communication, Promoting hope, Facilitating mourning, Pain management. Support is offered in this way for both client and family.</p>
                        <p>Some of the diseases you should have listed are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HIV/AIDS</li>
                            <li>Cancer: cancer of the cervix, prostate cancer, cancer of the oesophagus, leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease, cancer of the breast and many others</li>
                            <li>Terminal liver disease and kidney disease</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>First, you must build a therapeutic relationship, develop a patient profile, and anticipate symptoms by determining the patient's main problem. This could be pain, bleeding, discharge or other problem. You will need to find out the patient's expectations and their priorities For instance, which things are most important to them right now? You should find out the patient's understanding of the illness and anticipated symptoms.</p>

                        <h4>Patients Requiring Palliative Care</h4>
                        <p>One of the biggest challenges to health care in Kenya is HIV/AIDS. The disease is a drain on scarce resources. It is treated with a lot of stigma in many communities. It is, therefore, a challenge to give palliative care to people living with HIV/AIDS.</p>
                        <h5>HIV/AIDS</h5>
                        <p>The disease presents with many manifestations related to opportunistic infections. Currently, antiretroviral medications are available to prolong life. The opportunistic infections can be treated well with appropriate antibiotics. Some of the symptoms that you may have to deal with include cachexia and anorexia, anxiety, diarrhoea, cough, delirium and dementia, mouth ulcers, skin problems and sometimes constipation.</p>
                        <h5>Cancer</h5>
                        <p>About 30,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed each year. However, in many developing countries, this is a forgotten disease, such that when one is diagnosed, the disease will be advanced and there will be few resources to fight it. The main symptoms of cancer include pain, wasting, anaemia, anxiety, depression, skin problems, and infections among others.</p>
                        <h5>Liver and Kidney Disease</h5>
                        <p>Although technology is making it possible to manage chronic kidney and liver failure, due to a lack of resources and failure of the patients to present early to the health facility for diagnosis, some patients have to be put on measures that can only relieve their symptoms indefinitely.</p>
                        <h5>Degenerative Nervous System Diseases</h5>
                        <p>Some diseases of the nervous system may be incurable, hence the management of symptoms. Remember multiple sclerosis, senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease? Senile dementia and other types of dementias may present to you and you have to undertake palliative care.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Symptom Management</h4>
                        <p>Before you start palliative care for any patient, you must evaluate the nature and severity of the symptoms. The following are some of the questions that you will ask to evaluate the nature and severity of the symptoms.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How does the symptom affect the patient's life?</li>
                            <li>How does it affect the patient's physical function and mobility?</li>
                            <li>What makes the symptom better, is it food, drugs, activity or position?</li>
                            <li>What makes the symptom worse?</li>
                            <li>At what time is the symptom worse?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once you have evaluated the symptom(s), its relief requires organisation and communication. You must organise and plan the care through teamwork. You must also communicate to the family and treat psychological stress.</p>
                        <h5>Principles of Management</h5>
                        <p>The first principle is relief of the symptom. Some symptoms are only relieved partly, while others can be completely relieved. For example, if you are treating somebody with cancer of the breast, it may be possible to completely alleviate the pain while, if they have dyspnoea due to involvement, this may be difficult to alleviate In such a case, the goal is to give the patient a feeling of being in charge and not being subdued by the symptom.</p>
                        <p>Another principle that is employed in palliative care is the maintenance of independence. Some treatments may limit somebody's movement, for example, during dialysis, oxygen therapy and so on. In some cases, the patient may become so dependent on the treatment that they cannot undertake other activities. In this case you must ensure good balance.</p>
                        <p>The third principle involves a treatment plan. You should consider both drug and non-drug methods. The non-drug methods include explaining and reassuring, avoidance of factors that make the symptom worse, correction of biochemical derangements, treatment of recurrent disease, for example, opportunistic infections and treatment of psychological problems. Drug therapy, on the other hand, involves drugs given by mouth and injections. Whatever the treatment, keep it simple and individualise it.</p>

                        <h4>Techniques of Pain Management</h4>
                        <p>Analgesic drugs are commonly prescribed for pain management. Adjuvant drugs must be given as well to make the management more effective. Before the pain can be treated, you must know the location, severity, radiation, type, aggravating factors and alleviating factors of the pain. Certain principles have been developed by WHO to guide pain management.</p>
                        <h5>The WHO Analgesic Ladder</h5>
                        <p>WHO recommends that drugs for pain management be given:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>By mouth:</strong> This should be the route of choice because it is convenient and easy. If no longer tolerable, subcutaneous route should be used.</li>
                            <li><strong>By clock:</strong> By clock means that drugs should be given regularly at the same time.</li>
                            <li><strong>By ladder:</strong> This means that you start with one drug that is the weakest, increase the dosage as necessary and only move to the next stronger drug after exhausting the potential of the weaker drug. For example, you cannot move straight to opioid drugs such as morphine before you finish exploiting paracetamol.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following is the WHO analgesic ladder.</p>
                        <h6>Step 1 Non Opioids</h6>
                        <p>These are drugs such as Paracetamol and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
                        <h6>Step 2 Mild Opioids</h6>
                        <p>These are drugs such as Codeine often combined with Paracetamol.</p>
                        <h6>Step 3 Strong Opioids</h6>
                        <p>In this category, there are immediate release drugs such as Oramorph and sustained release drugs such as subcutaneous Diamorphine.</p>
                        <p>Other techniques of pain relief include: patient controlled analgesia, which may not yet be available in Kenya. In this technique, the patient has equipment which has been prepared to deliver a certain dosage of the drug and the patient is allowed to adjust the flow rate depending on the intensity of pain they are feeling.</p>
