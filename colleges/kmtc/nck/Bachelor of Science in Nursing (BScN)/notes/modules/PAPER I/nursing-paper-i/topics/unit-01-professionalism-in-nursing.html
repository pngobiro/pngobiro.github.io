                        <h3>Profession</h3>
                        <p>You are already working in the nursing profession, and now you are being trained to become a Kenya Registered Community Health Nurse. On completion of this programme, you will be expected to be proficient in providing general nursing, reproductive health and community health services. This section of unit one, aims at moulding you to become a professional nurse. You will at all times, whether on or off duty, be expected to display certain professional characteristics. You will begin by defining a profession, a professional nurse and professional nursing practice.</p>
                        <p>Bailliere's Nurses dictionary defines a profession as a 'calling, vocation requiring specialised knowledge, methods and skills, as well as preparation in an institution of higher learning in the scholarly, scientific and historical principles underlying such methods and skills'. The dictionary further states that members of a profession are committed to continuing study, to enlarging their body of knowledge, to placing service above personal gain and to providing practical services, vital to human society and social welfare. It adds that a profession functions autonomously and is committed to higher standards of achievement and conduct (Baillieres').</p>
                        <p>You may be familiar with reputable professions such as engineering, law and medicine. All these professions have similar characteristics.</p>
                        <p>The nursing profession is distinguished by its philosophy of care, full time commitment to human well being, particular blend of knowledge and skills, valuable service to the community and the regulation of its practice.</p>
                        <p>What are the characteristics of a profession?</p>
                        <p>A profession:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Has a theoretical body of knowledge and skills</li>
                            <li>Encourages full time commitment to service, establishing standards of practice which are maintained by all members</li>
                            <li>Exercises self-discipline</li>
                            <li>Protects the public</li>
                            <li>Is responsible for the advancement of the profession</li>
                            <li>Develops its ethics to accommodate new demands and circumstances of the profession</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Professional Nurse</h4>
                        <p>A professional nurse is an individual who has successfully undergone a prescribed nursing training programme, has passed a licensing examination and is registered by the national nursing regulatory body, in our context the Nursing Council of Kenya (NCK).</p>

                        <h3>Characteristics of a Professional Nurse</h3>
                        <p>A professional nurse:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Displays high standards of performance and integrity in nursing practice</li>
                            <li>Seeks constantly to improve her/his technical and interpersonal skills through continuing education and research</li>

                            <li>Puts what is good for professional services to patients ahead of self-interest</li>
                            <li>Coordinates and evaluates nursing services in cooperation with members of other health services (collaboration and networking)</li>
                            <li>Is not overly concerned with the materialistic aspects of nursing</li>
                            <li>Expects to find satisfaction and spiritual values in their work</li>
                            <li>Feels responsible for the status of nursing and tries to advance and never to retard it</li>
                            <li>Has inner resources to which she/he can turn to, for renewal of faith and courage when weary and discouraged</li>
                            <li>Is proud of her/his profession and considers it to be at par with other professions like medicine or law or any other vocation practised for compensation, which at the same time contributes in its own unique way to the welfare of humanity</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Personal Attributes</h4>
                        <p>Personal attributes that help a nurse to display professionalism include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Good personal appearance with a voice that does not scare patients</li>
                            <li>A ready smile, gentle hand, orderly in thought and action</li>
                            <li>Emotionally mature, compassionate, dignified, tolerant, friendly, sympathetic and interested in other people</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All characteristics are advantageous to the creation of a friendly and conducive environment for the patient's recovery. As a nurse, you must at all times have serenity of mind and self-control to be able to handle a variety of situations and patients.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> A professional nurse at all times displays integrity, commitment and ethical behaviour. They display intelligence, good judgement and handle emergencies well.</p>
                            <p>A professional nurse is also responsible in professional and social situations.</p>
                        </aside>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Personal Grooming</h3>
                        <p>Personal grooming is very important to nurses. Remember, every patient has a mental picture or image of how their nurse should be. The nurse's appearance provides security and hope to a patient.</p>
                        <p>A nurse's uniform should not be tight or very loose to hinder free movement during an emergency. It must be very clean to prevent cross infection and is to be well pressed. The dress or skirt should be below the knee cap to give allowance for bending. The material should not be 'see-through'. Female nurses should avoid bright inner wear especially if their uniform is white. The uniform should be well maintained, that is, fallen buttons or torn zippers should be replaced, rips and tears mended and stains removed.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, hair is a source of microorganisms. Female nurses should tie back long hair neatly. Male nurses should have their beards and moustaches neatly shaven. The nurse's cap should be worn neatly and securely.</p>
                        <p>Shoes should be low-heeled and soft to avoid making excessive noise, which may disturb patients. The nurse should maintain daily care of shoes, socks or stockings in order to prevent cross infection. Nails should be trimmed and coloured nail polish avoided. The freedom to wear jewellery, watches, pens, scissors or handkerchiefs will depend on individual hospital regulations.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The patients have a right to identify the nurse who is providing their care. It is advisable therefore to wear an identification tag at all times showing full names and qualifications.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Nursing Ethics</h3>
                        <p>You are being prepared to practise professional nursing which involves adherence to the code of ethics. Collin's dictionary defines ethics as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Moral principles</li>
                            <li>Code of behaviour</li>
                            <li>Study of morals</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We can further define ethics as morals and philosophical principles that define actions as being either right or wrong. The ethical concepts touch on your practice as you interact with other people, the society, co-workers and the profession.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The patient is to be at the centre of your practice. Patients have the right to contribute to their own care and as you provide care, always remember to respect the beliefs, values and customs of the patient. As a professional nurse you are expected to uphold and abide by the code of ethics.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h4>Guidelines</h4>
                        <ul>

                        <h3>Have you heard of the International Council of Nurses Code of Ethics?</h3>
                        <p>The International Council of Nurses (ICN) Code of Ethics was adopted in Mexico City in 1973. It states that the fundamental responsibility of the nurse is to promote health, prevent illness, restore health and alleviate suffering. Moreover, the need for nursing is universal. Inherent in nursing is respect for life, dignity and the rights of man.</p>
                        <p>Nurses are to provide care to individuals regardless of nationality, race, creed, colour, age, sex, politics or social status. As a nurse you will be providing health care to the individual, family and the community. You will be operating in teams, such as a nursing team which is within a health team.</p>
                        
                        <h3>CODE OF ETHICS (INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF NURSES)</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Ethical Concepts Applied to Nursing</h4>
                        <p>The fundamental responsibility of the nurse is fourfold; to promote health, to prevent illness, to restore health and to alleviate suffering.</p>
                        <p>The need for nursing is universal. Inherent in nursing is respect for life, dignity and rights of man. It is unrestricted by considerations of nationality, race, creed, colour, age, sex, politics or social status.</p>
                        <p>Nurses render health services to the individual, the family and the community and coordinate their services with those of related groups.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Nurses and people</h4>
                        <p>The nurse's primary responsibility is to those people who require nursing care.</p>
                        <p>The nurse, in providing care, promotes an environment in which the values, customs and spiritual beliefs of the individual are respected.</p>
                        <p>The nurse holds in confidence personal information and uses judgement in sharing this information.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Nurses and practice</h4>
                        <p>The nurse carries personal responsibility for nurse practice and for maintaining competence by continual learning.</p>
                        <p>The nurse maintains the highest standards of nursing care possible within the reality of a specific situation.</p>
                        <p>The nurse uses judgement in relation to individual competence when accepting and delegating responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>The nurse when acting in professional capacity should at all times maintain standards of personal conduct which reflect credit upon the profession.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Nurse and Co-workers</h4>
                        <p>The nurse sustains a cooperative relationship with co-workers in nursing and other fields.</p>
                        <p>The nurse takes appropriate action to safeguard the individual when their care is endangered by a co-worker or any other person.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Nurses and the profession</h4>
                        <p>The nurse plays the major role in determining and implementing desirable standards of nursing practice and nursing education.</p>
                        <p>The nurse is active in developing a core of professional knowledge.</p>
                        <p>The nurse, acting through the professional organisation, participates in establishing and maintaining equitable social and economic working conditions in nursing.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Code of Ethics as applied to Nursing</h3>
                        <p>Nurses minister to the sick, assume responsibility for creating a physical, social and spiritual environment which will be conducive to recovery and stress the prevention of illness and promotion of health by teaching and example. They render health service to the individual, the family and the community and co-ordinate their services with members of other health professions.</p>
                        <p>Service to mankind is the primary function of nurses and the reason for the existence of the nursing profession. The need for a nursing service is universal. Professional nursing service is based on human need and is therefore unrestricted by considerations of nationality, race, creed, colour, politics or social status.</p>
                        <p>Inherent in the code is the fundamental concept that the nurse believes in the essential freedoms of mankind and in the preservation of human life. It is important that all nurses be aware of the Red Cross Principles and of their rights and obligations.</p>
                        <p>The profession recognises that an international code cannot cover in detail all the activities and relationships of nurses, some of which are conditioned by personal philosophies and beliefs.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The fundamental responsibility of the nurse is threefold; to conserve life, to alleviate suffering and to promote health.</li>
                            <li>The nurse shall maintain at all times the highest standards of nursing care and of professional conduct.</li>
                            <li>The nurse must not only be well prepared to practice but shall maintain knowledge and skill at a consistently high level.</li>
                            <li>The religious beliefs of a patient shall be respected.</li>
                            <li>Nurses hold in confidence all personal information entrusted to them.</li>
                            <li>Nurses recognise not only the responsibilities but the limitations of their professional functions, do not recommend or give medical treatment without medical orders except in emergencies, and report such action to a physician as soon as possible.</li>
                            <li>The nurse is under an obligation to carry out the physician's orders intelligently and loyally and to refuse to participate in unethical procedures.</li>
                            <li>The nurse sustains confidence in the physician and other members of the health team; incompetence or unethical conduct of associates should be exposed but only to the proper authority.</li>
                            <li>The nurse is entitled to just remuneration and accepts only such compensation as the contract, actual or implied, provides.</li>
                            <li>Nurses do not permit their names to be used in connection with the advertisement of products or with any other forms of self advertisement.</li>
                            <li>The nurse co-operates with and maintains harmonious relationships with members of other professions and with nursing colleagues.</li>
                            <li>The nurse adheres to standards of personal ethics which reflect credit upon the profession.</li>
                            <li>In personal conduct, nurses should not knowingly disregard the accepted pattern of behaviour of the community in which they live and work.</li>
                            <li>The nurse participates and shares responsibilities with other citizens and other health professions in promoting efforts to meet the health needs of the public - local, state, national and international.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The professional nurse also has to be knowledgeable of what they are practising at the health facility and should acquire the technical skills that will assist in and improve the work performance.</p>
                        <p>The 'Code' incorporates general statements of principle applicable to all circumstances, upon infringement of which a nurse practitioner is liable to disciplinary action or penalty or both.</p>
                        <p>The Code of Ethics embodies the standards by which each nurse practitioner forms a conscience, a capacity for moral reasoning and governs the practice of nursing.</p>
                        <aside class="callout warning">
                            <p>You should also get yourself a copy of the Procedure Manual from the Nursing Council of Kenya, (at a fee) if you do not have one. It will assist you both in your daily work and in the study of this course.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Provider of nursing care and health services</li>
                            <li>Policy maker</li>
                            <li>Collaborator with the public and other health professionals</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Health is a universal right of every human being regardless of the social status. You have to encompass teamwork within multidisciplinary teams. Finally, you have to keep abreast by incorporating science and technology into the health delivery services in nursing practice. You will now study trends in nursing.</p>

                        <h3>Historical Background</h3>
                        <p>Historically the nursing practice in Kenya, just like anywhere else in the world, was performed on a tradition that sick people received care from female family members in their own homes. Therefore, it can be said that the family is the oldest and the most used health care delivery service in the world. Currently this approach to care provision is known as 'family nursing'.</p>
                        <p>Florence Nightingale (1869) stated: "...it has been said and written scores of times that every woman makes a good nurse, but I believe, on the contrary, that the elements of nursing are all but unknown...". She further stated: "It is well known that nursing exists to serve the society."</p>
                        <p>As social conditions and health care needs change, the nurses' roles and nursing practices continue to alter in response to these changes. Florence Nightingale is the founder of professional nursing. She initiated formal nursing training using a curriculum replacing apprenticeship.</p>
                        <p>Western medicine in Kenya was introduced with the arrival of missionaries in 1895. Doctors and nurses were brought from Britain and Europe. They trained dressers and assistants on the job. Later on they began to conduct basic training in missionary hospitals.</p>
                        <p>In 1949, a nurses, midwives and health visitors council was formed by an ordinance. In 1950, formal nursing training at enrolled and registered levels was started. The practice of nursing followed a medical model. The patient was nursed as fragments of diseased body parts using task allocation.</p>

                        <h3>Task Allocation/Job Assignment</h3>
                        <p>This method of dividing duties was based on the industrial concept of division of labour. The patient was fragmented into a series of jobs assigned to different nurses of different grades. Thus a hierarchy of tasks and staff was created for patients. This resulted in a fragmentation and lack of continuity of care, with patients subordinated to the system rather than being central to it.</p>
                        <p>You may recall a practice in the wards whereby the most junior nurse was assigned sluice rooms, others observations, wound dressings, drug administration, specimen collection, theatre cases, doctors round and so on.</p>
                        <p>In the 1950s, nurse leaders in North America began to recognise that the development of nursing knowledge and practice must run simultaneously with research. Florence Nightingale in 1859 wrote that nursing was more than the administration of medicine and application of poultices. This shows that Florence Nightingale had recognised that nursing needed a combination of both intellectual and practical skills.</p>
                        <p>In the 1960s to 1980s, many developments and changes in nursing took place stemming from the professional desire for innovation and change in practice. The nurses' leaders felt that the patient was alienated from their own care, and that there was a need for improvements in nursing. Nurse leaders began trying to demonstrate that nursing was a profession with its own unique body of knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Virginia Henderson (1966) delineates the unique functions of the nurse as follows:</p>
                        <blockquote>"...to assist the individual, sick or well, in the performance of those activities contributing to health or its recovery (or to peaceful death) that he would perform unaided if he had the necessary strength, will, knowledge. And to do this in such a way as to help him gain independence as rapidlyas possible."</blockquote>
                        <p>In the search for a unique body of knowledge, nurse theorists were using scientific methods to describe, explain and predict nursing practice and its outcomes. You must be wondering how these developments were reflected on nursing in Kenya?</p>
                        <p>In the 1960s and 1970s task allocation was exclusively practised in the context of hospital nursing. Task assignment is still practised when there is shortage of staff. During the said period, however, lots of changes took place in the health delivery system in Kenya.</p>
                        <p>Politically, independence was attained in 1963. The KANU manifesto declared its intention to fight what it saw as the three greatest enemies of development: poverty, illiteracy and disease. Within this context, health care had to be made available to the community. This led to the introduction of community health nursing training (KECHN) in 1966 at MTC Kisumu.</p>
                        <p>Midwifery training had already been introduced in the 1950's at enrolled level, and at registered level in 1965. At the same time, expatriate nurses who were administrators of nursing services, and nursing educators were leaving the country at independence. In anticipation of gaps in training and skills, a Diploma in Advanced Nursing was started in 1968 at the University of Nairobi to prepare Nurse Educators and administrators.</p>
                        <p>The shift to community health nursing was to provide preventive and promotive health care service delivery.</p>
                        <p>Florence Nightingale (1867), states in her private notes, "my vision ...is that the ultimate destination of all nursing is the care of the sick in their own homes ... I look to the abolition of all hospitals and workhouse infirmaries. But it is no use to talk about the year 2000."</p>
                        <p>Do you think this was a prediction of the global Primary Health Care Concept of 'Health for all by the year 2000'?</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>What is Health?</h3>
                        <p>Many people think that health is the absence of illness but the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1946 defined health as a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. The health delivery services in the 1970's laid great emphasis on communitybased health care in the implementation of Primary Health care concept (WHO, 1978).</p>
                        <p>Nurse leaders worldwide became dissatisfied with the task allocation method of organising patient care as it alienated the patient from the nursing care. Nurses felt that there should be accountability of the care being given with a view to improving the quality of care. Therefore, in the 1980's nurses started moving away from 'tasks' to individualised nursing care. This move away from a pre-occupation with tasks to a focus on patients led to the introduction of a nursing process that provided a systematic method for individualised nursing. The progression of these systems started with patient allocation to team nursing and then primary nursing.</p>

                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>

                        <h3>Definition of the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p>The nursing process is a technique which scientifically attempts to solve problems created by the patient's illness and to meet the health care and nursing needs of patients.</p>

                        <h3>Rationale for Using the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p>The nursing process introduces a concept of objective measurement into nursing management at the bed side. It compels you as the nurse to look more closely at the problems as the patient sees them rather than as you assume the problems to be. Furthermore, it defines what the nursing role is all about and creates a boundary within which you can safely practise clinical skills. The nursing process establishes nurse-patient relationship on a firm basis because it is objective and is a total care technique. The care plan, being related to one individual, gives you as a nurse greater professional job satisfaction. The nursing process, apart from being practical, is also a research tool since you can collect data that is retrospective, current and prospective.</p>
                        
                        <p>With regards to patients problems, how do you define a problem? A problem is any condition or situation which requires nursing intervention for the patient to regain a state of health or towards a peaceful death.</p>
                        <p>In learning the art of applying the nursing process, you are applying science which is the skilled art of making the well and the sick more comfortable and to feel well cared for.</p>
                        <p>You may have already used the nursing process. As a reminder, however, the steps are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Assessment</li>
                            <li>Planning</li>
                            <li>Implementation</li>
                            <li>Evaluation</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Assessment starts with your very first encounter with the patient. It involves a systematic collection of data conducted on a patient, done to determine their health status and to identify any actual or potential health problems in order to formulate a nursing diagnosis, this becomes the basis of the nursing care plan. A sensitive and continuous nursing assessment by means of nursing history and health assessment is essential in maintaining awareness of the nursing care that a patient receives.</p>
                        <p>The nursing history is taken for the purposes of determining the patient's state of illness. It also provides you as a nurse with the opportunity to collect the data and to convey interest, support and understanding to the patient. The skill used in obtaining history is interviewing. An interview is a dialogue between patients and you as their nurse, which is a very personal experience.</p>
                        <p>Interviewing is a process that requires wisdom, judgement, tact and experience. It involves a sensitive direction of a conversation with patients in order to obtain information about them.</p>
                        <p>Your approach to the patient will largely determine the amount and quality of information that you will receive. Achieving a relationship of mutual trust and respect will require the ability to communicate a sincere interest in the patient. You must make the patient as comfortable as possible and offer privacy for the interview.</p>
                        <p>The skills involved in interviewing a patient include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Listening and questioning</li>
                            <li>Observing and interpreting</li>
                            <li>Synthesising</li>
                            <li>Incorporating what is learnt into a plan of care</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>The Process of Interviewing</h3>
                        <p>The process of interviewing involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Talking and listening to the patient</li>
                            <li>Allowing the patient to tell their story in their own way</li>
                            <li>Looking for the main area of concern</li>
                            <li>Giving the patient time, without interruption, to tell you why they are seeking help</li>
                            <li>Being attentive not only to the patient's verbal expression but also to their nonverbal behaviour which may be displayed in the form of gestures, postures and facial expressions</li>
                            <li>Anticipating the patients' anxieties and trying to relieve them</li>
                            <li>Making relevant enquiries</li>
                            <li>Ensuring that the client feels that they are being understood</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Health facilities have developed their own interview guides but what is important is to conduct a thorough assessment of the patient with regard to their basic human needs and their state of wellness or illness.</p>
                        <p>A variety of models can serve as the framework for the assessment of basic needs. These include Functional Health Patterns (Gordon:1982), Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Eriksson's Eight Stages of Human Development. Assessment of the total needs of the patient includes their physical, psychological, emotional, intellectual, developmental, social, cultural and spiritual needs.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Health Assessment</h3>
                        <p>The health assessment of the patient may be carried out prior to, during or following the nursing history, depending on the patient's physical and emotional state, their response to their illness and hospitalisation, and the immediate priorities of their illness situation.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the health assessment is to identify the parameters of physical, psychological and emotional function that include a nursing need that exists. The techniques and skills that are utilised in conducting the health assessment include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use of the senses of sight, touch, hearing and smell</li>
                            <li>Use of appropriate interview skills and techniques</li>
                            <li>Physical examination</li>
                            <li>Techniques and strategies for assessing behaviours and role changes</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>The Physical Examination</h4>
                        <p>You have been performing physical examinations on patients in various situations. A physical examination is designed to determine the patient's assets which may serve to compensate for their limitations. Therefore, to accomplish the purposes of the physical examination, you must be skilled in the techniques of inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. You must also have a sound basic knowledge of anatomy and physiology and of the symptomatology of the disease process with which the patient presents. You must learn to observe with the 'seeing' eyes, hear with the 'hearing' ears, feel with 'feeling' hands and interpret the findings of the examination.</p>
                        <p>At the completion of the nursing history and health assessment, you should inform the patient how the data will be used, the conclusions that will be drawn, and the fact that they and their family or significant others will be involved in developing the plan for care. By the termination of the assessment they should know who you are as their nurse and how they can communicate with you.</p>
                        <p>You are familiar with performing a physical examination which is usually carried out following the health history. In order to facilitate the data collection process, the assessment is performed in well lit, warm area. The patient is undressed and draped appropriately so that only the area to be examined is exposed.</p>
                        <p>The physical and psychological comfort of the patient is considered at all times. If a particular manoeuvre may cause discomfort, an explanation of what to expect precedes that part of examination. Fingernails are kept short to avoid injuring the patient. The examination is to be performed in an organised and systematic manner. This encourages cooperation and trust on the part of the patient.</p>
                        <p>The patient's health history provides you with a complete health profile that guides all aspects of the physical assessment. In addition, it helps you to focus on body organs and systems that are of particular concern to the patient.</p>
                        <p>The basic tools of the physical examination are the human senses of vision, hearing, touch and smell. These human tools may be augmented by special man-made appliances, for example, stethoscope and ophthalmoscope. The first fundamental process in physical examination is inspection, and the power to observe must be cultivated.</p>
                        <p>A general inspection is carried out at the first contact with the patient. While creating rapport by introducing yourself to the patient, shaking their hand and talking to them, many impressions register in this exchange, and numerous valuable observations can be made. For example, age can be assessed, the general appearance whether thin or fat, anxious or depressed, body structure normal or deformed, posture and stature, body movements, nutritional status, speech pattern and body temperature. The physical examination requires a systematic approach of a head to toe and is accompanied by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Taking vital signs such as temperature, pulse, respiration and blood pressure</li>
                            <li>Measuring height, weight, fluid intake and output</li>
                            <li>Auscultating for body sounds of the lungs, the navel and other organs using stethoscope</li>
                            <li>Palpating soft areas of the body to check for solid masses, abnormal rigidity or tenderness</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You will review physical examination again when you study the clinical diagnosis.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Nursing Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>After the completion of the nursing history and the health assessment, you should analyse, synthesise and summarise the data collected and determine the patient's need for nursing care. You should also identify the actual or potential health problems responsive to resolution by nursing actions as nursing diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>When developing the nursing diagnosis for a particular patient, you must first identify the commonalities among the assessment data you have collected. These common features lead to the categorisation of related data that reveals the problem that needs nursing intervention. Therefore, the patient's nursing problem is defined as the nursing diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Remember that nursing diagnosis is not medical diagnosis or medical treatment or diagnostic studies. Nursing diagnoses are the patient's actual or potential problems that are enumerable to resolution by nursing actions. Nursing diagnoses that are succinctly stated in terms of the specific problems of the patient will guide you to develop a nursing care plan.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Recording the Nursing Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>You should record the patient's nursing diagnosis in the nursing care plan as well as in the patient problem list. A problem is defined as anything that concerns the patient, endangers their health, requires management and concerns any member of the health care team.</p>
                        <p>You have already gone through the assessment steps of the nursing process by looking at the data collection methods, that is, interview, observation, physical examination and taking vital observations.</p>
                        <p>Remember you will be required to utilise communication, interpersonal and clientprovider skills in conducting the assessment, collecting and analysing data using subjective and making objective observations and performing the necessary physical examination. This is followed by formulating a nursing or medical diagnosis to clarify client's needs. Then comes arranging the client's needs accordingly in order of priority, and forming partnership with clients in assessing their care needs and determining appropriate intervention strategies to address them.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Planning</h3>
                        <p>Once you identify the nursing diagnosis, the next step is to develop the planning components of the nursing process. This phase involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Setting priorities to the nursing diagnoses specifying immediate, intermediate and long term goals of nursing action</li>
                            <li>Identifying specific nursing interventions, appropriate for attaining goals.</li>
                            <li>Identifying interdependent interventions</li>
                            <li>Documenting the nursing diagnosis, goals, nursing interventions and expected outcomes on the nursing care plan</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>During this phase of the nursing process, it is your responsibility to communicate with the appropriate persons any assessment data indicative of health needs that can be met by other members of the health care team.</p>

                        <h4>Setting Priorities</h4>
                        <p>Setting priorities for the nursing diagnoses should be a process of collaboration between you and the patient or their family members.</p>
                        <p>Consideration must be given to the urgency of the problem, with the most crucial problems receiving the highest priority. Maslow's hierarchy of needs provides a useful framework for the determination of priority problems. The use of this hierarchy requires that high priorities be given to physical needs. After the priorities of the physical needs are met, subsequent priorities are reassigned according to the urgency of needs at other levels of the hierarchy.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Establishing Goals for Nursing Action</h3>
                        <p>After establishing the priorities of the nursing diagnosis, identify the immediate, intermediate and long-term goals and the nursing actions appropriate for the attainment of your goals. You should include the patients and the family in the establishment of the goals for the nursing actions.</p>
                        <h5>Immediate Goals</h5>
                        <p>Immediate goals address existing problems.</p>
                        <h5>Intermediate Goals</h5>
                        <p>Intermediate goals address the potential problems likely to occur in the near future.</p>
                        <h5>Long Term Goals</h5>
                        <p>Long term goals require longer periods of time for their accomplishment. This usually involves prevention of complications and further health problems, health education and rehabilitation.</p>
                        <p>You should involve the patient and the family in decision-making about the nursing interventions to meet the goals. Involvement of the patient and the family in the planning of nursing interventions promotes their cooperation in the implementation of the nursing care.</p>
                        <p>The identification of appropriate nursing interventions and their related goals depends on your recognition of the strengths and potential of the patient and the family; his understanding of the patho-physiological alterations that he experiences and his sensitivity to his emotional, psychological and intellectual response to his state of illness. In addition, your knowledge of nursing, your clinical experience and awareness of available supporting resources influence the validity of the nursing interventions that you identify as appropriate in resolving the patient's nursing diagnosis.</p>

                        <h4>Establishing Expected Outcomes</h4>
                        <p>You should state the expected outcomes of the nursing interactions. These outcomes should be stated in terms of the patient's behaviour. They should be realistic and measurable.</p>
                        <p>What you should realise is that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The outcomes that define the expected behaviour of the patient will serve as the basis for evaluation of the effectiveness of the nursing interventions.</li>
                            <li>The critical time periods provide a time frame for determining effectiveness of the nursing interventions and existence of a need for additional or altered nursing care.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Formulating the Nursing Care Plan</h3>
                        <p>The nursing care plan serves to communicate the following information to all members of the nursing team:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The nursing diagnosis and priorities</li>
                            <li>The goals of the nursing intervention</li>
                            <li>The nursing interventions which are expressed in the form of nursing orders</li>
                            <li>The expected outcomes which identify the expected behavioural responses of the patient</li>
                            <li>The critical time periods within which each outcome must be met</li>
                        </ul>

                        </figure>
                        <p>You must write down the precise behaviour expected in the nursing care plan. It should be written in a systematic manner that facilitates its use by all nursing personnel. You should provide space in the care plan for the documentation of the patient's response in the nursing interventions and the outcomes.</p>
                        <p>The nursing care plan is subject to change as the patients problems change or as the priorities of the problem and resolution of the problems shift and as additional information about the patient's state of health is collected. As you implement nursing interventions, the patient's responses are evaluated and documented and the care plan changed accordingly. A well-developed and continuously updated nursing care plan is the greatest assistance to the patient, since their nursing diagnosis will be resolved and their needs will be met.</p>

                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <p>Implementation of the nursing process follows the formulation of the nursing care plan. Implementation refers to carrying out the proposed plan of care. You should assume responsibility for the nursing team, or other members of the health care team as appropriate. You are to coordinate the activities of all persons involved in the implementation.</p>
                        <p>Keep in mind that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The nursing care plan serves as the basis for implementation.</li>
                            <li>The immediate, intermediate and longterm goals are used as a focus for the implementation of the designed nursing interventions.</li>
                            <li>While implementing nursing care, you are to continually assess the patient and their response to the nursing care.</li>
                            <li>Alterations are made in the care plan as the patient's condition, problems, and responses change, and priorities are thus reassigned.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Implementation includes all of the nursing interventions that are directed toward resolution of the patient's diagnosis and meeting their health needs.</p>
                        <p>Nursing interventions include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hygienic care</li>
                            <li>Promotion of physical and psychological comfort</li>
                            <li>Support of respiratory and elimination functions</li>
                            <li>Facilitation of the ingestion of food, fluids and nutrients</li>
                            <li>Environmental management health teaching</li>
                            <li>Promotion of a therapeutic relationship</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should use judgement and decisionmaking skills in the selection of nursing interventions that are based on physiological principles. You will also need to integrate and apply your knowledge of physiology. All nursing interventions are patient-focused and goal directed. They are based on scientific principles. You should implement them with compassion, confidence and willingness to understand the patient's problems.</p>

                        <h3>Delegating Nursing Action</h3>
                        <p>You may delegate certain specific actions to other members of the nursing team. When delegating, you must:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Know the capabilities and limitations of the members of the nursing team.</li>
                            <li>Select the most appropriate person to implement and supervise the performance of the actions.</li>
                            <li>You should provide the nursing team members with all information that is needed to perform the actions in such a way that the patient remains at all times the focus of the actions.</li>
                            <li>You should communicate verbally and in writing to the appropriate persons the coordination and continuity of care, information about the patient's responses to their care and any changes that must be made in the plan of care. This is because many members of the nursing team and health care team are involved in the patient's care. Continuous updating of the care plan is of paramount importance in ensuring coordination and continuity of care.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Recording Outcomes</h3>
                        <p>The implementation phase of the nursing process is concluded when the nursing interventions have been completed and the patient's responses to them have been recorded. You should concisely and objectively make the recordings.</p>
                        <p>The recordings should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Relate to the nursing diagnosis</li>
                            <li>Describe the nursing interventions and the patient's response to the interventions</li>
                            <li>Include any additional pertinent data</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can make good evaluation after accurate recording. Documentation of information therefore provides the basis for the measurement of the patient's behavioural response to the nursing intervention.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>Evaluation is the final component to the nursing process. It is directed towards determining the patient's response to the nursing intervention and the extent to which the goals have been achieved.</p>
                        <p>The nursing care plan, therefore, provides the basis for evaluating the nursing diagnosis, goals, and nursing interventions. Expected outcomes provide the specific guidelines that dictate the focus of evaluation.</p>

                        <h4>What is the rationale for using the Nursing Process</h4>
                        <p>Did you think of the following?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Introduces a concept of objective measurement into nursing management at the bed side.</li>
                            <li>Compels the nurse to look more closely at the problems as the patient sees them, rather that assuming them.</li>
                            <li>Defines what the nursing role is all about and creates a boundary within which to safely practice clinical skills.</li>
                            <li>Establishes nurse patient relationship on a firm basis because it is objective and is a total technique.</li>
                            <li>Is a research tool for collecting retrospective, current and prospective data.</li>
