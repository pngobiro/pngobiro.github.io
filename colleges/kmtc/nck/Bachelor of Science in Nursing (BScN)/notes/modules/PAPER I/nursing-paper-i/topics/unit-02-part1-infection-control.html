                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Over the past few decades Kenya has experienced a drastic change in the pattern of infectiousdiseases. Some of those that had been eradicated are re-emerging, and new ones are being identified. There have also been sporadic outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, measles, the plague, and yellow fever. New viruses such as the Hepatitis B and C have become increasingly common. The situation has been made worse by the fact that some micro-organisms are rapidly developing resistance to common antibiotics. Hospital acquired infections are on the increase. This drug resistance, combined with the high HIV/AIDS prevalence, makes infection prevention and control extremely important.</p>
                        <p>The World Health Organisation WHO (1996) observes that millions of people all over the world suffer and even die of hospital acquired infections which have become known as nosocomial infections. These hospital acquired diseases range from trivial to life threatening conditions such as septicaemia. It is thought that this spread may be due to the advance in medicine that exposes patients to more surgical and medical invasive procedures which increase the risk of infection. It is important to note that shortage of resources may have contributed to some nosocomial infections.</p>
                        <p>Globally the most frequent infections are: surgical wounds infection, lower respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. The emergence of highly infectious diseases such as the Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF) also increases the risk of hospital acquired infection. Health care facilities are ideal settings for the transmission of infections because the invasive procedures routinely performed on patients have the potential of introducing microorganisms into the body.</p>

                        <p>The service providers in health care facilities are at high risk because they constantly perform procedures that expose them to infections. They can easily spread an infection they have contracted at the health facility to their families because of poor infection prevention practices.</p>
                        <p>The community is also at risk of infections if they come into contact with medical waste such as contaminated sharps, dressings, tissue and chemical waste that have been inappropriately disposed. Everyone who works at a health care facility is potentially at risk of infections.</p>

                    <h3 id="transmission-cycle-heading" class="section-heading">The Disease Transmission Cycle</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Infectious agents survive, grow or multiply in a reservoir and then leave the reservoir through a place of exit by a modeof transmission. The infectious agents then enter the susceptible host through a place of entry. Micro-organisms are normally present on people's skin, respiratory, intestinal and genital tracts. These micro-organisms are called normal flora. Micro-organisms not normally found on or in the human body are associated with disease and are known as pathogens.</p>
                        <p>All micro-organisms can cause infection or disease. This happens when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The normal flora are introduced into an area of the body in which they are not normally found</li>
                            <li>Pathogens are introduced into the body</li>
                            <li>Micro-organisms are introduced into the body of a person who is immunocompromised and thus susceptible to infections</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The mode of transmission is the easiest point at which to break the disease transmission cycle. In a health care facility, this can be accomplished by following appropriate infection prevention practices, such as washing the hands before and after procedures, practising aseptic technique and correctly processing instruments.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Transmission of Infection in the Health Care Setting</h4>
                        <p>In the health care setting infection can be transmitted:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When the health care worker's skin is pierced or cut by contaminated needles or other sharp instruments</li>
                            <li>When the health care worker's broken skin (cuts, scratches, rashes, chapped skin, fungal infections) comes into contact with the patient's blood or other body fluids</li>
                            <li>When the patient's blood or other body fluids are splashed on the healthcare worker's mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All cases of transmission of Hepatitis B and HIV from patients to health care workers have occurred through accidents such as needle stick injuries. Furthermore, as a health worker you can spread infections from one patient to another and from patients to yourself, your family and the community.</p>
                        <p>Infectious diseases could be minimised or eliminated by adhering to medical principles and practices that reduce cross infection in healthcare settings. The spread of most infections can be controlled by observing basic infection prevention control guidelines and proper and adequate treatment of primary cases.</p>
                        <p>The WHO's guidelines demand that you should treat all patients as potentially infectious. Furthermore, WHO stipulates proper precaution and use of correct and appropriate protective gear when dealing with or handling blood and blood products, body fluids or contaminated equipment.</p>
                        <p>According to WHO guidelines, you should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Observe and maintain good personal hygiene and wear appropriate attire.</li>
                            <li>Be vaccinated against vaccine preventable conditions, especially if you are working in high risk areas.</li>
                            <li>If you work in vulnerable areas, for example areas where you handle cooked food, you should be periodically screened for certain diseases, such as typhoid.</li>
                            <li>If you are suffering from infectious conditions and you are working with susceptible patients, for example, in an operating room, special care baby unit, or the ICU burns unit, you should be redeployed until you are cleared of the infection.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Having looked at the overview of infection prevention and control, you will now look at it in some more detail.</p>
                        <p><strong>How can you spread infections from one patient to another or to your family and community?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you do not wash your hands before and after contact with patients, or when you do not wash your hands before leaving the health facility and then touch members of your family or household items</li>
                            <li>When you use surgical instruments, such as needles, syringes and other equipment that have not been processed properly</li>
                            <li>When medical waste is not disposed of properly, members of the community may come into contact with that waste</li>
                            <li>When you contaminate your clothing or hair in the course of rendering care to patients</li>
                            <li>When you contract infections and spread them to some members of your family, they will in turn spread them to other members of the family, who in turn will spread them to others in the community</li>

                        <p>Adherence to appropriate infection prevention practices breaks the cycle of spreading infections at the mode of transmission stage. This will:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Standard precautions are a set of clinical practice recommendations designed to help minimise the risk of exposure to infectious materials, such as blood and other body fluids by both patients and staff. They help break the disease transmission cycle at the mode of transmission step.</p>
                        <p>A standard procedure is a procedure that should be followed routinely at all times. It should apply to every patient regardless of their presumed infection status. This is because you will not be able to tell who is infected with viruses such as HIV or hepatitis. Even the infected persons themselves may not know that they are infected. You should therefore follow the standard precautions when dealing with every patient.</p>
                        <p>You will now cover these precautions in more detail.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Hand Washing</h4>
                        <p>Washing your hands before and after contact with each patient is the single most effective method of preventing/decreasing transfer of micro-organisms between you and the patients within a health facility. This method is easy to follow and is an inexpensive procedure. The purpose of hand washing is to remove soil, organic material and transient micro-organisms from the skin.</p>
                        <p><strong>Appropriate times for washing your hands whilst at work:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Immediately after arriving at work</li>
                            <li>Before examining each patient</li>
                            <li>After examining each patient</li>
                            <li>After touching accidentally any instrument or object that might be contaminated with blood or other body fluids</li>
                            <li>After touching mucous membranes, e.g. eyes, nose, mouth</li>
                            <li>After un-gloving since hands can be contaminated if gloves contain invisible holes or tears</li>
                            <li>After using the toilet or latrine</li>
                            <li>Before eating</li>
                            <li>Before leaving work at the end of the day</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The three elements that are essential for effective hand washing are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Soap</li>
                            <li>Running water</li>
                            <li>Friction</li>

                        <h5>Four types of hand washing</h5>
                        <h6>Routine hand washing using plain soap and running water</h6>
                        <p>Routine hand washing removes transient micro-organisms and soil, blood or other organic material from the hands. This method is appropriate in most situations and the hands should be washed as frequently as possible.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Hand washing with antiseptic and running water</h6>
                        <p>In this method, transient micro-organisms and soil are removed. It kills or inhibits the growth of resident microorganisms. Moreover, it may reduce the risk of infections in high risk situations, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When there is heavy microbial contamination</li>
                            <li>Before performing invasive procedures such as vein punctures and other aseptic procedures</li>
                            <li>Before contact with patients who have immune defects, for example, patients with burns, leukaemia etc.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>Alcohol hand rub</h6>
                        <p>Alcohol hand rub kills or inhibits the growth of most transient and resident micro-organisms but does not remove all micro-organisms or soil. It can be used when hand washing with soap and running water is not possible as long as hands are not visibly soiled with dirt, blood or other organic material.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Surgical hand scrub</h6>
                        <p>Scrubbing with antiseptic before beginning surgical procedures will help prevent the growth of micro-organisms for a period of time. It will also reduce the risk of infections to the patient if the gloves are damaged.</p>

                            <li>Whenever there is a chance of contamination.</li>
                            <li>Before putting on gloves for performing clinical procedures such as insertion of IUD or invasive procedures.</li>
                            <li>Before putting on gloves for performing invasive procedures.</li>
                            <li>Between certain procedures on the same patient where soiling of hands is likely, to avoid cross-contamination of body sites.</li>
                            <li>After contact with items known or considered likely to be contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions (e.g. bedpans, urinals, wound dressing), whether or not gloves are worn.</li>
                            <li>After touching blood, body fluids, secretions excretions, exudates from wounds.</li>
                            <li>Before and after gloves are removed.</li>
                            <li>Before medication preparation.</li>
                            <li>Before preparing, handling, serving or eating food and before feeding a patient.</li>
                            <li>After diapering or toileting children.</li>
                            <li>When hands are visibly soiled.</li>
                            <li>After personal body functions such as using the toilet, wiping or blowing one's nose.</li>
                            <li>Before leaving work.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>You should wash your hands with antimicrobial soap or an antiseptic solution which should then be followed by good rinsing under running water. This is a more effective method of removing and killing transient micro-organisms.</p>
                        <p>Vigorously rub soaped hands for 15-30 seconds and then rinse under running water. Plain water removes 50% of transient micro-organisms, while soap removes 80-90% of micro-organisms. After washing your hands you should dry them with a clean towel or air dry them. Be aware that shared towels can become contaminated quickly.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Personal Protective Equipment</h4>
                        <p>These are physical barriers used to prevent transmission of infection to the patient or from the patient to the persons attending them, for example, gloves, gowns, surgical masks and protective eye wear.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Gloves</h5>
                        <p>Gloves provide a barrier against potentially infectious micro-organisms in blood, other body fluids, and medical waste, thus lowering the risk of transmitting infections to both health care workers and patients. Gloves also protect against hazardous chemical waste. You should wear gloves whenever you may come into contact with patient's blood and other body fluids, for example, while:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Providing clinical services</li>
                            <li>Handling or cleaning used instruments and other items</li>
                            <li>Performing housekeeping activities</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Use a new pair of gloves for each patient! Disposable gloves are used once and then thrown away. Disposable gloves are preferable to renewable gloves because it is difficult to properly process gloves. Disposable gloves should never be processed or reused.</p>
                        
                        <h5>TYPES OF GLOVES</h5>
                        <h6>Sterile Surgical Gloves or High Level Disinfected Surgical Gloves</h6>
                        <p>These should be worn during all procedures in which your main aim is to avoid introduction of pathogens into the patient, for example during:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Surgical procedures</li>
                            <li>Insertion of Norplant implants</li>
                            <li>Pelvic examination of women in labour</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Disposable surgical gloves are recommended for use.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Single use examination gloves</h6>
                        <p>Single use means discard gloves after use. These should be worn for all procedures in which you will be in contact with intact mucous membranes, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>IUCD insertion</li>
                            <li>Manual vacuum aspiration</li>
                            <li>Pelvic examination</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Also where the primary purpose of wearing gloves is to reduce the risk of you being exposed to blood or other body fluids for example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When drawing blood</li>
                            <li>When working in the laboratory</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Gowns and Aprons</h5>
                        <p>These should be made of waterproof material and worn full size to give maximum protection. They should be used when splashing of blood or other body fluids or when any other potentially infectious materials are anticipated, for example during:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Surgical operations</li>
                            <li>While conducting deliveries</li>
                            <li>During intubations and sanctioning procedures</li>
                            <li>Any other procedure/activities where splashing is anticipated</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Masks and Eye Shields</h5>
                        <p>These provide some protection against airborne pathogens and shield against splashes. They should be worn during dental surgery, when conducting deliveries and endoscopies or in any other situations where splashing or spattering is anticipated.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Headgear and Boots</h5>
                        <p>Caps are worn full length to cover the head. Boots and shoe covers should be waterproof and should be cleaned frequently. These should be used in operative procedures.</p>
