                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Paediatric nursing is concerned with the health of infants, children and adolescents, their growth and development and their opportunity to achieve full potential as adults.</p>
                        <p>In order to provide quality nursing care you will have to acquire knowledge in child health, growth and development. This will assist you to identify any deviations from the normal and to take appropriate corrective measures. As far as is practically possible, sick children should be nursed in their own home environments, among people they are used to. This is necessary because hospitalisation and separation of children from their parents or guardians can have serious psychological effects hence worsening their health.</p>
                        <p>Whether the care of children is given in hospital, home or the community, it is paramount that the paediatric nurse and the parents or guardians work in harmony in order to achieve set objectives for the benefit of the child's well being.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Review the normal growth and development of children</li>
                            <li>Define and explain the principles of paediatric nursing</li>
                            <li>Identify and know when to implement health promotional measures necessary in the prevention of diseases</li>
                            <li>Explain health messages to be shared with the individual, the family and the community in order to prevent common childhood illnesses</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Normal Growth and Development of Children</h4>
                        <p>You are already aware that in normal circumstances, given the right environment, childrens growth and development takes place rapidly. You are now going to look at the definition of the concepts 'growth' and 'development'.</p>
                        <h5>Growth</h5>
                        <p>Growth implies a change in quantity. Human growth can be defined as a change in body structure. The changes are both in height and size. They are influenced by various factors, which will be covered later.</p>
                        <h5>Development</h5>
                        <p>Development is a physiological process, which occurs in children right from conception until puberty. It involves a qualitative change in this case from a lower to a more advanced stage of complexity. This process is also influenced by a number of factors.</p>
                        <p>Factors that influence growth and development:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Good nutrition or a well balanced diet is a very significant requirement for proper growth and development. A child requires food rich in proteins, minerals and vitamins for the development of body tissues and bones.</li>
                            <li>Hormones are necessary for normal bodily functions, growth and mental development. During the puberty period common hormones involved in these activities include growth hormones, the thyroid hormone and sex hormones.</li>
                            <li>Genetic disposition, for example, where the offspring inherits the qualities of parents of being tall or short.</li>
                            <li>Environmental influence is important as it determines physical growth and mental development. Children who are deprived of love or subjected to emotional and physical abuse are more likely to suffer from growth failure and mental development. In some cases, if the environment is not conducive, the onset of puberty may be delayed when compared to children of the same age group.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Rate of Development</h4>
                        <p>During the foetal period the child's growth rate is rather rapid if it is well supplied with the essential requirements through its mother's placenta. At the infantile stage, up to 18 months of age, growth is similarly rapid, provided the child's health is maintained and the essential requirements are given.</p>
                        <p>During the childhood phase, growth tends to slow down and the process is prolonged. The child's height gradually increases under the influence of hormones. This also plays a part in the psychosocial development of the child. When the child reaches puberty, the sex hormones facilitate the individual's physical, psychological and emotional development.</p>

                        <h4 id="health-promo-details-heading">Factors that Promote Health</h4>
                        <p>The health of a growing child can be sustained to an acceptable standard when various activities are readily available. The nursing mother and her child should have a well balanced diet rich in proteins, vitamins, iron and calcium for proper growth of the child. In addition, the child requires enough rest, sleep, play, love, recognition and a certain amount of independence. You should explain these in details to the mother during your health education sessions.</p>
                        <h4>Health Promotion in Paediatric Nursing</h4>
                        <p>In order to give holistic care to children under your jurisdiction, you should remember that your role goes beyond nursing. You should operate as health educator, patients' advocate and a counsellor both in the hospital and in the community for the well being of the child. You will now study the main areas of health promotion for the well being of children.</p>
                        <h5>Prevention of Illness</h5>
                        <p>Prevention of illness in the health care of infants, children and adolescents is at the core of Paediatrics. The outcome of preventive interventions in children is measurable in terms of decades of the remaining life. Thus, through professional activities nurses should focus on individual patients, especially on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Health supervision of healthy infants, children and adolescents</li>
                            <li>Practical approaches to some common issues presenting during health supervision</li>
                            <li>Health supervision of children suffering from chronic conditions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a nurse, you should help parents/guardians and their children to strive for a higher level of wellbeing. This, in turn, will lead to the prevention of illness and accidents. In the hospital, special precautions have to be taken for the safety of the child. You should ensure that children are supervised at all times and restrained. This does not, however, mean the children should be kept unnecessarily in bed when their conditions do not warrant it.</p>
                        <p>The ward environment should be pleasantly set with all equipment in its rightful place. A playroom should be created where possible, and you should allocate staff to participate in playroom activities as a therapeutic measure for the child. Children should also be given an opportunity to sleep undisturbed.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Health Maintenance</h5>
                        <p>This aspect of child health care applies to those who are in good health as well as those with chronic health problems, which do not significantly interfere with the normal bodily functions. In this group of children you will find those mildly mentally retarded, stabilised diabetics, or those with physical deformities. Your role here is basically to be supportive and educative.</p>

                        <h5>Immunisation and Vaccination</h5>
                        <p>The immune system is a network of cells and chemical substances that responds in many different ways to the invasion of the body by these micro-organisms and to the entry of poisons (toxins) and other harmful substances. These micro-organisms and foreign substances, usually harmful to the body are called antigens. Any foreign body that stimulates immunity is referred to as an antigen.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The immune system of the body responds to the presence of the antigen in two main ways:</p>
                        <p><strong>The First Possible Immune Response:</strong> The first way is through substances called antibodies which circulate within the body and can act against antigens at sites very far from where they were produced. Antibodies are produced by special cells called B-lymphocytes within the lymphatic tissues of the body. They are complex chemical substances called immunoglobulin which match the particular antigen they were made for just like a key matches one particular lock only. This forms what is called the humoral immune system.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Second Possible Immune Response:</strong> The second way is through other special cells called T-lympocytes and macrophages that circulate through the body and destroy microorganisms or other cells that the microorganisms may have invaded. The special T-cells are tuned in the same way as the antibodies to a particular infecting germ. They form what is called the cell mediated immune system.</p>
                        <p>Today it is possible to offer children a substantial measure of protection against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and influenza. Therefore, teaching the community by display of posters and through personal contact with parents and community members should convince them of the value these protective measures have for their children.</p>

                        <h5>Active Immunisation</h5>
                        <p>Immunisation can be described as the process of protecting a person from a specific disease. This happens automatically when a person gets an infection and develops their own antibodies. It also happens when a vaccine against a disease is given to someone. This is called active immunisation and it is because the vaccine is serving as an antigen and stimulates the body to produce its own immunity.</p>
                        <p>These vaccines are prepared from microorganisms in special laboratories. These may be live bacteria or viruses that have been modified enough to infect the body but only to cause very mild or local effects that may not even be noticeable, although they still resemble the original bacteria or viruses closely enough for the body not to be able to tell the difference. These are called live attenuated vaccines. The property lost is called their virulence and can sometimes be called avirulent strains of the original or wild bacteria or viruses. Other vaccines are made out of killed bacteria and are called killed vaccines and yet others are modified poisons or toxins that bacteria produce and these are called toxoids.</p>

                        <h5>Passive Immunisation</h5>
                        <p>It is also possible to take ready made antibodies and give them to another person and because the person receiving these antibodies is not making them alone, this is referred to as passive immunisation. A good example of passive immunisation occurs every time a baby develops in the uterus of the mother as the mother's antibodies pass into the baby's blood and provide them with ready made antibodies against these diseases for a short time after birth.</p>
                        <p>The main advantage with this is that the individual who has this type of immunisation gets immediate assistance in fighting against an infection and is necessary especially in cases of snake bites or tetanus infection when you need to help the person quickly. As a disadvantage, since they are not their own, there is no antigen stimulating the body to produce more, thus antibodies are gone in few weeks or months and the protection is lost.</p>
                        <p>Another way of classifying types of immunisation is in two ways:</p>
                        <h6>Natural Immunisation</h6>
                        <p>Natural immunisation means immunisation that occurs naturally in one's life, without vaccines or the assistance of a health worker. An example is when a foetus is developing and gets antibodies from their mother's blood and also when a person gets an infection and produces their own antibodies.</p>
                        <h6>Artificially Induced Immunisation</h6>
                        <p>Artificial Immunisation occurs any time that a medical worker immunises a person either by giving them a vaccine (antigen), or by passively immunising them with antibodies.</p>

                    <h4 id="immunization-schedule-heading">Current National Immunisation Schedule</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Since the year 2002, the immunisation schedule in Kenya has been modified from three specific immunisations given as DPT, that is, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus to five specific immunisations given in combination as Pentavalent, that is the DPT with hepatitis B and influenza in addition.</p>
                        <h5>BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) Vaccine</h5>
                        <p>This is a live attenuated bacterial vaccine against tuberculosis that is usually freeze-dried. It is named after two French scientists, Dr Calmette and Dr Guerin, who first discovered the vaccine. The vaccine is given to babies soon after birth, preferably before they are discharged from the maternity unit. It should be stored in a regular refrigerator (not in the freezing compartment). In this way it can remain potent for up to two years. Once it has been diluted, the vaccine loses its potency very quickly and must be discarded after three hours.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> The BCG vaccine should be protected from exposure to sunlight, otherwise it becomes impotent. Cover both diluted and undiluted vaccine with dark paper.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h6>Administration and Dosage</h6>
                        <p>The vaccination is usually given 0.1 ml below the right elbow intradermally. The successful result is noticed as a small red nodule within the first week. This is followed by ulceration and a permanent scar after about six weeks or more.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The dosage of the BCG vaccine will depend on themanufacturer's instructions.</p>
                        <h6>Possible Complications</h6>
                        <p>Complications are uncommon but if they occur, they may include chronic ulceration or enlargement of lymphatic glands. Complications usually occur if the injection is administered subcutaneously instead of intradermally.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)</h5>
                        <p>The oral polio vaccine contains live attenuated virus from all three types of polio. Polio O, (OPV, O) is administered at birth. The first OPV is given six weeks after birth and the second OPV at ten weeks after birth, followed by the third OPV at 14 weeks.</p>
                        <h5>Pentavalent</h5>
                        <p>This is the newly introduced combination of immunisation against diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, hepatitis B and influenza. The dose is 0.5 ml . The first dose is given six weeks after birth, the second dose at ten weeks after birth and the third dose at the age of 14 weeks.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Always remember to inject the pentavalent into the outer aspect of the left thigh. DO NOT inject into the buttock.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h5>Measles Vaccine</h5>
                        <p>This is a live attenuated freeze-dried vaccine given when the child is nine months old. It is administered by intramuscular injection only once in a dose of 0.5 ml. An oral vitamin A tablet, 200,000 i.u., is routinely given with the measles vaccine.</p>
                        <h6>Failure of Measles Vaccination</h6>
                        <p>It has been noted that some children still suffer from measles in spite of the fact that they were vaccinated. The possible causes of this may be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Impotent measles vaccine may have been used</li>
                            <li>The vaccine may have expired or may have been kept at the wrong temperature</li>
                            <li>The child may have been vaccinated while still too young thus having their mother's antibodies still in their blood</li>
                            <li>The parents may have misreported some rashes and pyrexia, which appear similar to measles yet it is not</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Contraindication for Measles Vaccination</h6>
                        <p>In severe malnutrition, it is recommended that the vaccination be delayed until the child is well nourished. In mild or moderate malnutrition, it should still be administered.</p>
                        <p>Parents are sometimes concerned that immunising their children may result in adverse effect. You should enquire from parents about:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The present immunisation status of their children</li>
                            <li>Past responses to immunisation</li>
                            <li>Past and current illnesses</li>

                    <h4 id="cold-chain-heading">The Cold Chain</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The main problem in immunisation is reaching every mother and child with a vaccine that is potent. Heat destroys vaccines, some much faster than others, that is, some types of vaccines are destroyed much faster than others because of their sensitivity hence lose their potency. Vaccines should therefore be kept cold from the time they are manufactured to the moment when the mother and child are vaccinated. The vaccine that has lost its potency cannot be restored and should be destroyed. The cold environment in which the vaccines pass from the manufacturer to the vaccinator is called the 'cold chain.'</p>
                        <p>The cold chain is concerned with the maintenance and monitoring of temperature as the vaccines pass out along a chain of storage places. Different vaccines have different sensitivities to temperature and therefore have to be dealt with slightly differently.</p>
                        <p>Polio vaccine is the most sensitive to heat, followed by measles, DPT, BCG and tetanus, which is the least sensitive (most heat stable). On the other hand, tetanus and DPT vaccines are destroyed by deep freezing and so should never be frozen.</p>
                        <h5>Vaccines</h5>
                        <p>It is important to know what state of preparation the different vaccines are in and within what temperature limits they must be maintained. Some vaccines need reconstituting just before delivery to the child or other like pentavalent, as an example.</p>
                        <p>Vaccines are packed in different containers in different number of doses, usually five or ten. All will have a date of manufacture and expiry date. It is important to read the instructions on the vaccines vials as some look different when destroyed, for example, tetanus toxoid will flocculate and settle at the bottom of the ampoule, if frozen hence destroyed.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Various Refrigerators and Cold Boxes</h5>
                        <p>As a health worker, you must make it your business to know how to check and maintain a refrigerator. You need to know what type of refrigerator you have and how to clean it, maintain adequate stocks of fuel and spare parts, monitor the temperatures of both the freezing compartment and the main cold compartment and detect the faults and where repairs are necessary.</p>
                        <p>You need to separate the vaccines into those that must not be frozen and those that can be frozen, and check that the refrigerator is not being used for anything else as opening and closing the door frequently will shorten the lifespan of not only the vaccines but also the refrigerator. It is also important to know how to pack a cold box properly so that you get the maximum benefit out of storage space and time.</p>
                        <h5>Temperature Monitoring Devices</h5>
                        <p>There are a number of different techniques now available to indicate whether the cold chain has been broken at any time to the point where the vaccine should not be used. Many of these make use of chemicals that change colour or characteristics at different temperatures over time. An example of a common indicator is a cold chain monitor which is placed in each box of vaccines and travels with it down the cold chain.</p>
                        <p>A similar type of monitor is used with toxoid and killed vaccines to warn of exposure to freezing temperatures, which will destroy their potency as much as too much heat.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Ordering the Right Amount of Vaccine</h5>
                        <p>This should not be too much so that the unused vaccine expires and not too little so that the clinics run out of vaccines. To estimate requirements according to WHO-EPI requires the following steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Estimate the size of the population your programme serves</li>
                            <li>Calculate the target population - say under three years old and over nine months old in case of measles</li>
                            <li>Estimate the expected coverage - say 70%</li>
                            <li>Calculate the number of doses given say three in case of pentavalent</li>
                            <li>Estimate the frequency of supply - say once a month</li>
                            <li>Add a reserve stock - say 25% of the total</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is nothing worse than to assure mothers that immunisation works and then for them to find that it does not. One of the main reasons for failure of an immunisation programme is a failure in the cold chain.</p>

                        <h4>Admission Procedure</h4>
                        <p>When working with children, you as a nurse should realise that even if the procedures are routinely normal to you, children and their parents or guardians may be anxious and distressed. With experience and observation, you will detect their concerns.</p>
                        <p>A concerned attitude calls for a kind approach and understanding on your part. Some parents or guardians may feel guilty or blame themselves, especially if the disease or condition the child is suffering from could have been prevented.</p>
                        <p>Avoid criticising the child's parent/guardian who is misinformed about the nature of disease, causes and prognosis. Instead you must reassure that person so as to alleviate fears whenever possible.</p>
                        <p>The parents/guardians should be allowed to accompany their children to the assigned bed within the ward. The parents should receive a pleasant and friendly reception in a clean and a quiet environment. Even if you are too busy, you must protect the trust patients place in nurses. This respect is partly based on calmness and positive attitudes displayed from the very onset of their arrival.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>Remember that the first impression counts and is extremely vital.</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The older child, if not seriously ill on admission, should be introduced to other children, as this reduces possible anxiety and stress. Similarly, the parents should be introduced to other parents. It is important you use the correct names and pronunciation. You should carry out the procedures carefully and methodically. You should also be ready to answer any questions clearly and fully as ambiguity may cause distress and misunderstanding to parents or guardians.</p>
                        <p>If older children are not seriously ill and are mobile, they and their parents/guardians should be introduced to the ward or unit, including orientation to available facilities such as call bell, toilets, bathrooms and playroom. Information such as visiting hours for friends, parents, guardians and siblings including the types of food and drinks that may be brought, should be given.</p>
                        <p>You should make every effort to find out from the parents/guardians the child's likes, dislikes and what the child's commonly used name is. Such investigations will enable you to adapt accordingly. The same enquiries should apply to family history and spiritual beliefs, which you should address without causing embarrassment. Finally, informed consent for care and operation should be obtained before the parents/guardians leave for home.</p>

                        <h4>History Taking</h4>
                        <p>In almost all cases, the history is usually taken from the parents or guardians, especially when the child is young. For older children, additional information as to how they feel may be obtained directly. The most important details to be recorded should include medical history, which is, whether the child has been ill before and the nature of any previous illness. It is also necessary to find out whether the patient has had any surgery before and for what purpose.</p>
                        <p>You should also take the family, social and economic history because these may be contributing factors to illness. In addition, the mother's obstetric history, including the number of children she has and her marital status should be taken. All these will give you a comprehensive view of the child and their family. The information obtained must be written clearly and accurately on the available forms because they form permanent records for the period the patient is hospitalised and are useful for future reference. The records become legal documentation, which may assist the health institution in case of problems.</p>
                        <p>You should, at all times, make an effort to establish rapport with the parents or guardians in order to allay anxiety and gain confidence. You should be extra careful in selecting the words used when interviewing the parents/guardians. Sometimes, your words may be misinterpreted. It is advisable to clarify to parents/guardians why you are asking questions to avoid any offence being taken.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the period of history taking, you should try to observe non-verbal clues and form your own impression or opinion on the patient and their family members.</p>

                        <h4>Physical Examination</h4>
                        <p>In order to make a nursing diagnosis and prepare the nursing care plan, you should perform an objective physical examination from head to toe. Exercise patience and make friends with the child before examining them. Be flexible in the order of examination, that is leave upsetting and disturbing procedures until last. In most cases the standard techniques of inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation is used.</p>
                        <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Should be both visual and clinical. You should personally observe the patient as well as check temperature, pulse and respiration.</p>
                        <p><strong>Inspection:</strong> Involves critical scrutiny to look for signs and symptoms of disease or abnormality.</p>
                        <p><strong>Palpation:</strong> Is the process of examining with a finger over the chest or abdomen.</p>
                        <p><strong>Percussion:</strong> Involves placing the left middle fingers over the chest and then tapping with the right finger.</p>
                        <p><strong>Auscultation:</strong> Is listening for sound by use of the ears and stethoscope.</p>
                        <h6>Position/Place for Examination</h6>
                        <p>When examining a child, it is important to seek the help of the parent or guardian to prevent unnecessary movement and resentment by the child. The young child will have to be undressed by the parent/guardian, while the examination will be performed on their laps. The use of distracters may also win the child's confidence and enhance their cooperation.</p>
                        <p>You should talk to the child and mother in a low voice and persuasive manner maintaining eye contact at the level to that of the patient. Older children may be given the necessary instruction on what to do and should be allowed to choose the position they wish to adopt during physical examination. The child's developmental and nutritional status is also assessed during the physical examination.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Investigations</h4>
                        <p>Children, like adults, who are admitted at the hospital or attend clinic, will require detailed investigations in order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and prescription of the remedial measure. You will be particularly responsible in carrying out these investigations, or assigning them to the relevant personnel in other departments to do so. These personnel may be the doctor, radiographer, laboratory technologist, and of course, you will assess each child individually to determine the type of investigations required.</p>
                        <p>As a professional operating close to a patient, you must ensure that all investigations are carried out accurately, punctually and aseptically. All forms pertaining to these investigations must be correctly written to avoid mix up in handling specimens. Once forwarded to various departments, you should ensure the results are collected and made ready so that the management of the child is commenced without delay.</p>
                        <h5>Common Investigations</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Body fluids, excretions and secretions, and tissues for culture and sensitivity tests</li>
                            <li>Blood for white cell counts and differentials</li>
                            <li>Haemoglobin and malarial parasites</li>
                            <li>Grouping and cross matching</li>
                            <li>Urine for microscopic, albumen, sugar, acetone</li>
                            <li>Stool for ova and cysts and occult blood</li>
                            <li>Radiological investigations, although for very young babies this may have to be kept to a minimum</li>
                            <li>Endoscopic investigations may also be carried out but only in a few selected patients according to the problems they are suffering from</li>
                            <li>Sputum for microscopic culture and sensitivity</li>
                            <li>Where the patient is unable to produce the specimen, insertion of a naso-gastric tube may be considered and stomach content aspirated and sent to laboratory</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should endeavour to ensure that the parents and the patients are physically and psychologically prepared before, during and after the procedures. Similarly you should be able to help and assist to ensure that the child is not subjected to unnecessary pain and discomfort during the process. Above all, the principles of infection control must be observed when handling specimens.</p>

                    <h4 id="imci-heading">IMCI - Integrated Management of Childhood Illness</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>The IMCI Concept</h5>
                        <p>This is a strategy, which combines improved management of childhood illnesses with aspects of nutrition, immunisation and several other important influences on child health, including maternal health. The IMCI strategy aims at reducing the infant mortality rate, severity of illness and disability by integrating treatment and prevention of major childhood illness to contribute to an improved growth and development.</p>
                        <h5>The History</h5>
                        <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO), working in collaboration with UNICEF, introduced this new plan for comprehensive and timely management of sick children under the age of five years. The new initiative was born of the fact that 1.2 million children in developing countries die before celebrating their fifth birthdays, many within the first year of life. It was further noted that seven in ten (that is 58%) of deaths are mainly due to acute respiratory infection, specifically pneumonia.</p>
                        <p>Other diseases in this category are measles, malaria, malnutrition and diarrhoea. These diseases may occur singly but in most cases they tend to develop in combination. Three out of four episodes of illness in children are caused by one of these diseases.</p>
                        <p>Millions of parents and guardians present themselves with sick children in hospitals, health centres and dispensaries daily. Some opt to visit traditional healers, community care providers and pharmacists for treatment.</p>
                        <p>Projections based on global burden of diseases analysis of 1996 shows that five specific diseases, that is, acute respiratory infection, measles, malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea will continue to be major contributors of childhood mortality right up to the year 2020, unless drastic and significant efforts are made to control them. As a result of these reasons the World Health Organisation, Division of Child Health and Development, in collaboration with ten other WHO programmes and UNICEF developed the IMCI. This should be adopted in the Kenyan context.</p>
                        <p>The evidence that a large proportion of childhood morbidity and mortality in the developed world is caused by just five conditions is really not enough justification for an integrated approach. However, it is known that most sick children present with clinical features related to more than one of these conditions. The overlap means that a single diagnosis may neither be possible nor appropriate.</p>

                        <h5>Benefits of IMCI Strategy</h5>
                        <p>In smaller health facilities such as health centres, the IMCI strategy has several advantages.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Promotion of accurate identification of childhood illnesses in the outpatient situation.</li>
                            <li>Ensures appropriate combined treatment of all major illnesses and strengthens the counselling of relatives who are looking after the sick children while simultaneously providing preventive services.</li>
                            <li>IMCI helps to accelerate the referral system of severely ill children and improves the care of these patients.</li>
                            <li>In the home environment, the strategy promotes appropriate care seeking behaviours.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Relationship of IMCI with Existing Technical Programmes</h5>
                        <p>The IMCI strategy helps to promote several interventions and areas of activity such as immunisation, vitamin A supplementation and ongoing supply and management, which are handled by other technical programmes.</p>
                        <p>Implementation of the IMCI strategy involves the following three components:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improvements in the case management skills of health staff through the provision of locally adapted guidelines on IMCI and activities to promote their use</li>
                            <li>Improvements in the health care system required for effective management of childhood illnesses</li>
                            <li>Improvements in family and community practices</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The objective of IMCl is not to takeover the responsibilities of the various programmes, but to ensure that the activities are well coordinated and effectively implemented in order to contribute to IMCI.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>You are already conversant with the various types of foods used in Kenyan society and their nutritive value as well as how they vary from one ethnic group to another and from one religious group to another. However different they may be, the common denominator is that they provide us with all the nutrients we need for our bodily functions.</p>
                        <p>You learnt earlier in this unit of the importance of nutrition in growth and development and general health maintenance. You will look at the known food constituents available for human consumption.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this unit you will be able to:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Food Nutrients and Their Functions</h4>
                        <h5>Proteins</h5>
                        <p>These are a group of foods that supply amino acids for the growth and repair of body tissue. Proteins play a very important role in immunity, the blood clotting mechanism, transport of body substances and the regulation and maintenance of osmotic pressure. Therefore, a good amount of protein should be given to patients, especially children. When taken into the body, proteins are broken down to amino acids, which are then absorbed into the blood stream via the villi so as to be utilised by the body.</p>

                                <caption>Sources of Proteins</caption>

                            </table>
                        </div>
                        <h5>Carbohydrates</h5>
                        <p>These are the main energy source for the body. When eaten and absorbed into the bloodstream in its simplest form, carbohydrate is referred to as glucose. Glucose is very important for the brain and nerve function. Carbohydrates can further be divided into three main categories, that is, sugar, starch and polysaccharides. Carbohydrates can be obtained from potatoes, rice, ugali, fruits, milk, cereals, starches and vegetables. Some carbohydrates form indigestible polysaccharides and cellulose, which form roughage essential for the stimulation of intestinal peristalsis.</p>
                        <h5>Fats</h5>
                        <p>Although fats have a higher caloric value, they are less efficiently utilised by the brain and nerve tissue. However, fats are the body's largest energy store. Fat is found under the skin and around some body organs, such as the kidneys to give support and protection from injuries. Other functions include formation of cholesterol and steroid hormones. They are also vehicles for the absorption of vitamins A, B, E and K . They are usually broken down to fatty acids and glycerols before being absorbed into the bloodstream via intestinal villi and lacteal vessels. Fats are available in fatty meat, chicken, fish, butter, milk and vegetable oils and so on.</p>
                        <h5>Vitamins</h5>
                        <p>These are organic compounds which are classified as water soluble and fat soluble vitamins. The water soluble vitamins are B and C while fat soluble include A, D, E and K. All the vitamins are obtained through food consumption. Vitamin D can be synthesised through the action of sunlight and vitamin K, which itself is synthesised by the large intestinal bacteria. Fat soluble vitamins are found in fish, meat, milk, butter and plant oils. They can easily be stored in the liver and adipose tissue. Over consumption of fat can lead to hyper vitaminosis, though that is a rare occurrence. Deficiency in fat soluble vitamins is rare but if it occurs, it is usually due to trauma or severe illness.</p>
                        <h5>Mineral Salts</h5>
                        <p>The main mineral salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chlorine and sulphur. Only small amounts of each mineral are required to sustain bodily functions. They are essential for enzyme components. Those of significant nutritional value are iron, zinc, and iodine. Iron deficiency leads to anaemia, while iodine deficiency leads to goitre. Zinc is also required for enzyme reaction, especially during growth and wound healing.</p>
                        <h5>Water</h5>
                        <p>This is the major component of the body and the dietary intake must have sufficient quantity in order to meet daily needs. Without adequate amounts of water, the body tissues cannot function properly. Water is the solvent for cellular changes. Water acts as a medium for ions, and transports nutrients and waste products. It is also important for the regulation of body temperature. The amount required varies from one person to another, though in adults an average of two to three litres should be taken daily. In children, the amount will vary according to the age.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Malnutrition is more than a medical problem. It is brought about by dysfunctions in economic, demographic, cultural religious and ecological processes. Malnutrition may be due to an excess, deficit or imbalance in the essential components of a balanced diet.</p>
                        <h5>Over Nutrition</h5>
                        <p>This refers to ingestion of more food than is required for the body needs, as may be seen in the case of obesity. This condition is more common in rich western countries (the developed world).</p>
                        <h5>Under Nutrition</h5>
                        <p>This describes a state of poor nourishment as a result of inadequate diet or presence of disease, which interferes with the normal appetite, absorption and assimilation of ingested food. Inadequate or poor nourishment diet is more prevalent in the third world countries that are still developing and poor. Included in under nutrition are protein energy malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies.</p>
                        <p>The main causes of under nutrition are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Insufficient food resources</li>
                            <li>Lack of education about nutritional needs</li>
                            <li>Poor socioeconomic conditions</li>
                            <li>Chronic illnesses</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM)</h5>
                        <p>This condition is also referred to as protein calorie malnutrition (PCM). It is the most common form of under nutrition in children. Protein Calorie Malnutrition can be classified as primary type, which means the nutritional needs are not met as a result of poor eating habits, or secondary type, which refers to malnutrition occurring as a result of an alteration or defect in ingestion, absorption or metabolism. In such circumstances, the tissue needs are not met even though the dietary intake would be deemed satisfactory under normal conditions, for example in diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, mal-absorption syndromes and so on.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Forms of Protein Energy Malnutrition</h6>
                        <p>The two clinical forms of protein energy malnutrition are kwashiorkor and marasmus. In kwashiorkor the main deficient nutrient is protein, while in marasmus the deficiency is caloric. There are some children who fall in between the two forms, and who suffer growth failure but exhibit no signs of either disease. Both conditions impair growth and if they are chronic will end up reducing the size of an individual.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Kwashiorkor</h5>
                        <p>In this condition there is a lack in protein relative to calories, often associated with a normal growth pattern until six to eight months of age when the weight of the child begins to decrease. The name originated from a local Ghanaian language meaning 'displayed child'. Characteristics include growth retardation, changes in skin tone, mental apathy and other bodily changes.</p>
                        <h6>Causes</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Kwashiorkor may be caused by a sudden change from breast milk to porridge, which is entirely comprised of carbohydrates. This sudden change in feeding habits may be prompted if the mother realises that she is pregnant while still breast feeding.</li>
                            <li>Infections, such as malaria, measles and so on, accompanied by fever which tends to use up the scarce protein stored in the body may result in kwashiorkor.</li>
                            <li>Anorexia, due to other illnesses, and intestinal worms, which draw on the child's food supply, may also be predisposing factors.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following are some of the clinical features of kwashiorkor:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Growth failure and some muscle wasting</li>
                            <li>Oedema of the face, hands, anus, feet and bulging abdomen</li>
                            <li>The hair becomes thin, straight and brownish in colour</li>
                            <li>The child has poor appetite and is irritable</li>
                            <li>There is mental apathy and lack of interest in the surroundings</li>
                            <li>Diarrhoea</li>
                            <li>Hepatomegaly and anaemia</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When undertaking diagnostic investigations, you should carry out the following procedures:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First, you should always take the child's personal history from the parents.</li>
                            <li>Secondly, physical and laboratory examinations to exclude infections such as malaria which is done by testing blood slide for malarial parasites and intestinal worms which are checked from the stool (ova and cysts).</li>
                            <li>Thirdly, blood tests for WBC and haemoglobin estimation should exclude anaemia.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Marasmus</h5>
                        <p>The term marasmus refers to starvation. The disease is caused by lack of food of any kind, which includes proteins, carbohydrates, fats and vitamins. Marasmus occurs at any age, but is more commonly found in infants who do not get enough breast feeding or during the weaning period, when poor bottle feeding practices are followed or supplementary foods are not given. Clinical features of marasmus include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The weight of the affected child normally drops to 60% below the standard expected weight</li>
                            <li>Muscular atrophy, especially visible on the arms and legs, with loss of subcutaneous fat and legs and arms are thin</li>
                            <li>Wrinkled, thin and flaccid skin</li>
                            <li>The face of the child usually looks old and anxious</li>
                            <li>The child may have diarrhoea or constipation</li>
                            <li>The child has very good appetite when being fed but does not put on weight</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Marasmic Kwashiorkor</h5>
                        <p>Any child with kwashiorkor has some muscle wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat, regardless of the presence of oedema. If this process is severe enough to result in weight loss below 60% of the normal expected weight according to their age, then the child is said to have marasmic kwashiorkor.</p>
                        <p>There are several factors, which contribute to protein energy malnutrition (PEM). Many people in developing countries know very little about the nutritional values of the food they eat. In addition, some people in the developing countries are traditionalists and the food they consume is often dictated by cultural norms. For example, there may be customs outlining what men, women and children are supposed to eat and what they are forbidden.</p>
                        <p>Poverty is also an important factor. Most body building foodstuffs suitable for weaning, for example, milk and eggs, are too expensive for a large percentage of the population. This factor often pre-disposes parents to act in a seemingly negligent manner, especially in instances where they are pre-occupied by income generating activities, leaving the child in the care of other people who may not be aware of the child's dietary requirements.</p>
                        <p>Poor farming practices, and natural disasters, like droughts and floods may also lead to a loss in income and inability to meet the dietary requirements of the child. Finally, political instability often drives people away from their natural environment to camps (as refugees), where they are unable to engage in productive activities and may have no means of supplementing their basic rations.</p>
