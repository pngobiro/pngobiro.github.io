                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Paediatric nursing is concerned with the health of infants, children and adolescents, their growth and development and their opportunity to achieve full potential as adults.</p>
                        <p>In order to provide quality nursing care you will have to acquire knowledge in child health, growth and development. This will assist you to identify any deviations from the normal and to take appropriate corrective measures. As far as is practically possible, sick children should be nursed in their own home environments, among people they are used to. This is necessary because hospitalisation and separation of children from their parents or guardians can have serious psychological effects hence worsening their health.</p>
                        <p>Whether the care of children is given in hospital, home or the community, it is paramount that the paediatric nurse and the parents or guardians work in harmony in order to achieve set objectives for the benefit of the child's well being.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Review the normal growth and development of children</li>
                            <li>Define and explain the principles of paediatric nursing</li>
                            <li>Identify and know when to implement health promotional measures necessary in the prevention of diseases</li>
                            <li>Explain health messages to be shared with the individual, the family and the community in order to prevent common childhood illnesses</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Normal Growth and Development of Children</h4>
                        <p>You are already aware that in normal circumstances, given the right environment, childrens growth and development takes place rapidly. You are now going to look at the definition of the concepts 'growth' and 'development'.</p>
                        <h5>Growth</h5>
                        <p>Growth implies a change in quantity. Human growth can be defined as a change in body structure. The changes are both in height and size. They are influenced by various factors, which will be covered later.</p>
                        <h5>Development</h5>
                        <p>Development is a physiological process, which occurs in children right from conception until puberty. It involves a qualitative change in this case from a lower to a more advanced stage of complexity. This process is also influenced by a number of factors.</p>
                        <p>Factors that influence growth and development:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Good nutrition or a well balanced diet is a very significant requirement for proper growth and development. A child requires food rich in proteins, minerals and vitamins for the development of body tissues and bones.</li>
                            <li>Hormones are necessary for normal bodily functions, growth and mental development. During the puberty period common hormones involved in these activities include growth hormones, the thyroid hormone and sex hormones.</li>
                            <li>Genetic disposition, for example, where the offspring inherits the qualities of parents of being tall or short.</li>
                            <li>Environmental influence is important as it determines physical growth and mental development. Children who are deprived of love or subjected to emotional and physical abuse are more likely to suffer from growth failure and mental development. In some cases, if the environment is not conducive, the onset of puberty may be delayed when compared to children of the same age group.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Rate of Development</h4>
                        <p>During the foetal period the child's growth rate is rather rapid if it is well supplied with the essential requirements through its mother's placenta. At the infantile stage, up to 18 months of age, growth is similarly rapid, provided the child's health is maintained and the essential requirements are given.</p>
                        <p>During the childhood phase, growth tends to slow down and the process is prolonged. The child's height gradually increases under the influence of hormones. This also plays a part in the psychosocial development of the child. When the child reaches puberty, the sex hormones facilitate the individual's physical, psychological and emotional development.</p>

                        <h4 id="health-promo-details-heading">Factors that Promote Health</h4>
                        <p>The health of a growing child can be sustained to an acceptable standard when various activities are readily available. The nursing mother and her child should have a well balanced diet rich in proteins, vitamins, iron and calcium for proper growth of the child. In addition, the child requires enough rest, sleep, play, love, recognition and a certain amount of independence. You should explain these in details to the mother during your health education sessions.</p>
                        <h4>Health Promotion in Paediatric Nursing</h4>
                        <p>In order to give holistic care to children under your jurisdiction, you should remember that your role goes beyond nursing. You should operate as health educator, patients' advocate and a counsellor both in the hospital and in the community for the well being of the child. You will now study the main areas of health promotion for the well being of children.</p>
                        <h5>Prevention of Illness</h5>
                        <p>Prevention of illness in the health care of infants, children and adolescents is at the core of Paediatrics. The outcome of preventive interventions in children is measurable in terms of decades of the remaining life. Thus, through professional activities nurses should focus on individual patients, especially on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Health supervision of healthy infants, children and adolescents</li>
                            <li>Practical approaches to some common issues presenting during health supervision</li>
                            <li>Health supervision of children suffering from chronic conditions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a nurse, you should help parents/guardians and their children to strive for a higher level of wellbeing. This, in turn, will lead to the prevention of illness and accidents. In the hospital, special precautions have to be taken for the safety of the child. You should ensure that children are supervised at all times and restrained. This does not, however, mean the children should be kept unnecessarily in bed when their conditions do not warrant it.</p>
                        <p>The ward environment should be pleasantly set with all equipment in its rightful place. A playroom should be created where possible, and you should allocate staff to participate in playroom activities as a therapeutic measure for the child. Children should also be given an opportunity to sleep undisturbed.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Health Maintenance</h5>
                        <p>This aspect of child health care applies to those who are in good health as well as those with chronic health problems, which do not significantly interfere with the normal bodily functions. In this group of children you will find those mildly mentally retarded, stabilised diabetics, or those with physical deformities. Your role here is basically to be supportive and educative.</p>

                        <h5>Immunisation and Vaccination</h5>
                        <p>The immune system is a network of cells and chemical substances that responds in many different ways to the invasion of the body by these micro-organisms and to the entry of poisons (toxins) and other harmful substances. These micro-organisms and foreign substances, usually harmful to the body are called antigens. Any foreign body that stimulates immunity is referred to as an antigen.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The immune system of the body responds to the presence of the antigen in two main ways:</p>
                        <p><strong>The First Possible Immune Response:</strong> The first way is through substances called antibodies which circulate within the body and can act against antigens at sites very far from where they were produced. Antibodies are produced by special cells called B-lymphocytes within the lymphatic tissues of the body. They are complex chemical substances called immunoglobulin which match the particular antigen they were made for just like a key matches one particular lock only. This forms what is called the humoral immune system.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Second Possible Immune Response:</strong> The second way is through other special cells called T-lympocytes and macrophages that circulate through the body and destroy microorganisms or other cells that the microorganisms may have invaded. The special T-cells are tuned in the same way as the antibodies to a particular infecting germ. They form what is called the cell mediated immune system.</p>
                        <p>Today it is possible to offer children a substantial measure of protection against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and influenza. Therefore, teaching the community by display of posters and through personal contact with parents and community members should convince them of the value these protective measures have for their children.</p>

                        <h5>Active Immunisation</h5>
                        <p>Immunisation can be described as the process of protecting a person from a specific disease. This happens automatically when a person gets an infection and develops their own antibodies. It also happens when a vaccine against a disease is given to someone. This is called active immunisation and it is because the vaccine is serving as an antigen and stimulates the body to produce its own immunity.</p>
                        <p>These vaccines are prepared from microorganisms in special laboratories. These may be live bacteria or viruses that have been modified enough to infect the body but only to cause very mild or local effects that may not even be noticeable, although they still resemble the original bacteria or viruses closely enough for the body not to be able to tell the difference. These are called live attenuated vaccines. The property lost is called their virulence and can sometimes be called avirulent strains of the original or wild bacteria or viruses. Other vaccines are made out of killed bacteria and are called killed vaccines and yet others are modified poisons or toxins that bacteria produce and these are called toxoids.</p>

                        <h5>Passive Immunisation</h5>
                        <p>It is also possible to take ready made antibodies and give them to another person and because the person receiving these antibodies is not making them alone, this is referred to as passive immunisation. A good example of passive immunisation occurs every time a baby develops in the uterus of the mother as the mother's antibodies pass into the baby's blood and provide them with ready made antibodies against these diseases for a short time after birth.</p>
                        <p>The main advantage with this is that the individual who has this type of immunisation gets immediate assistance in fighting against an infection and is necessary especially in cases of snake bites or tetanus infection when you need to help the person quickly. As a disadvantage, since they are not their own, there is no antigen stimulating the body to produce more, thus antibodies are gone in few weeks or months and the protection is lost.</p>
                        <p>Another way of classifying types of immunisation is in two ways:</p>
                        <h6>Natural Immunisation</h6>
                        <p>Natural immunisation means immunisation that occurs naturally in one's life, without vaccines or the assistance of a health worker. An example is when a foetus is developing and gets antibodies from their mother's blood and also when a person gets an infection and produces their own antibodies.</p>
                        <h6>Artificially Induced Immunisation</h6>
                        <p>Artificial Immunisation occurs any time that a medical worker immunises a person either by giving them a vaccine (antigen), or by passively immunising them with antibodies.</p>

                    <h4 id="immunization-schedule-heading">Current National Immunisation Schedule</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Since the year 2002, the immunisation schedule in Kenya has been modified from three specific immunisations given as DPT, that is, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus to five specific immunisations given in combination as Pentavalent, that is the DPT with hepatitis B and influenza in addition.</p>
                        <h5>BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) Vaccine</h5>
                        <p>This is a live attenuated bacterial vaccine against tuberculosis that is usually freeze-dried. It is named after two French scientists, Dr Calmette and Dr Guerin, who first discovered the vaccine. The vaccine is given to babies soon after birth, preferably before they are discharged from the maternity unit. It should be stored in a regular refrigerator (not in the freezing compartment). In this way it can remain potent for up to two years. Once it has been diluted, the vaccine loses its potency very quickly and must be discarded after three hours.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> The BCG vaccine should be protected from exposure to sunlight, otherwise it becomes impotent. Cover both diluted and undiluted vaccine with dark paper.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h6>Administration and Dosage</h6>
                        <p>The vaccination is usually given 0.1 ml below the right elbow intradermally. The successful result is noticed as a small red nodule within the first week. This is followed by ulceration and a permanent scar after about six weeks or more.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The dosage of the BCG vaccine will depend on themanufacturer's instructions.</p>
                        <h6>Possible Complications</h6>
                        <p>Complications are uncommon but if they occur, they may include chronic ulceration or enlargement of lymphatic glands. Complications usually occur if the injection is administered subcutaneously instead of intradermally.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)</h5>
                        <p>The oral polio vaccine contains live attenuated virus from all three types of polio. Polio O, (OPV, O) is administered at birth. The first OPV is given six weeks after birth and the second OPV at ten weeks after birth, followed by the third OPV at 14 weeks.</p>
                        <h5>Pentavalent</h5>
                        <p>This is the newly introduced combination of immunisation against diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, hepatitis B and influenza. The dose is 0.5 ml . The first dose is given six weeks after birth, the second dose at ten weeks after birth and the third dose at the age of 14 weeks.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Always remember to inject the pentavalent into the outer aspect of the left thigh. DO NOT inject into the buttock.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h5>Measles Vaccine</h5>
                        <p>This is a live attenuated freeze-dried vaccine given when the child is nine months old. It is administered by intramuscular injection only once in a dose of 0.5 ml. An oral vitamin A tablet, 200,000 i.u., is routinely given with the measles vaccine.</p>
                        <h6>Failure of Measles Vaccination</h6>
                        <p>It has been noted that some children still suffer from measles in spite of the fact that they were vaccinated. The possible causes of this may be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Impotent measles vaccine may have been used</li>
                            <li>The vaccine may have expired or may have been kept at the wrong temperature</li>
                            <li>The child may have been vaccinated while still too young thus having their mother's antibodies still in their blood</li>
                            <li>The parents may have misreported some rashes and pyrexia, which appear similar to measles yet it is not</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Contraindication for Measles Vaccination</h6>
                        <p>In severe malnutrition, it is recommended that the vaccination be delayed until the child is well nourished. In mild or moderate malnutrition, it should still be administered.</p>
                        <p>Parents are sometimes concerned that immunising their children may result in adverse effect. You should enquire from parents about:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The present immunisation status of their children</li>
                            <li>Past responses to immunisation</li>
                            <li>Past and current illnesses</li>

                    <h4 id="cold-chain-heading">The Cold Chain</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The main problem in immunisation is reaching every mother and child with a vaccine that is potent. Heat destroys vaccines, some much faster than others, that is, some types of vaccines are destroyed much faster than others because of their sensitivity hence lose their potency. Vaccines should therefore be kept cold from the time they are manufactured to the moment when the mother and child are vaccinated. The vaccine that has lost its potency cannot be restored and should be destroyed. The cold environment in which the vaccines pass from the manufacturer to the vaccinator is called the 'cold chain.'</p>
                        <p>The cold chain is concerned with the maintenance and monitoring of temperature as the vaccines pass out along a chain of storage places. Different vaccines have different sensitivities to temperature and therefore have to be dealt with slightly differently.</p>
                        <p>Polio vaccine is the most sensitive to heat, followed by measles, DPT, BCG and tetanus, which is the least sensitive (most heat stable). On the other hand, tetanus and DPT vaccines are destroyed by deep freezing and so should never be frozen.</p>
                        <h5>Vaccines</h5>
                        <p>It is important to know what state of preparation the different vaccines are in and within what temperature limits they must be maintained. Some vaccines need reconstituting just before delivery to the child or other like pentavalent, as an example.</p>
                        <p>Vaccines are packed in different containers in different number of doses, usually five or ten. All will have a date of manufacture and expiry date. It is important to read the instructions on the vaccines vials as some look different when destroyed, for example, tetanus toxoid will flocculate and settle at the bottom of the ampoule, if frozen hence destroyed.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Various Refrigerators and Cold Boxes</h5>
                        <p>As a health worker, you must make it your business to know how to check and maintain a refrigerator. You need to know what type of refrigerator you have and how to clean it, maintain adequate stocks of fuel and spare parts, monitor the temperatures of both the freezing compartment and the main cold compartment and detect the faults and where repairs are necessary.</p>
                        <p>You need to separate the vaccines into those that must not be frozen and those that can be frozen, and check that the refrigerator is not being used for anything else as opening and closing the door frequently will shorten the lifespan of not only the vaccines but also the refrigerator. It is also important to know how to pack a cold box properly so that you get the maximum benefit out of storage space and time.</p>
                        <h5>Temperature Monitoring Devices</h5>
                        <p>There are a number of different techniques now available to indicate whether the cold chain has been broken at any time to the point where the vaccine should not be used. Many of these make use of chemicals that change colour or characteristics at different temperatures over time. An example of a common indicator is a cold chain monitor which is placed in each box of vaccines and travels with it down the cold chain.</p>
                        <p>A similar type of monitor is used with toxoid and killed vaccines to warn of exposure to freezing temperatures, which will destroy their potency as much as too much heat.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Ordering the Right Amount of Vaccine</h5>
                        <p>This should not be too much so that the unused vaccine expires and not too little so that the clinics run out of vaccines. To estimate requirements according to WHO-EPI requires the following steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Estimate the size of the population your programme serves</li>
                            <li>Calculate the target population - say under three years old and over nine months old in case of measles</li>
                            <li>Estimate the expected coverage - say 70%</li>
                            <li>Calculate the number of doses given say three in case of pentavalent</li>
                            <li>Estimate the frequency of supply - say once a month</li>
                            <li>Add a reserve stock - say 25% of the total</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is nothing worse than to assure mothers that immunisation works and then for them to find that it does not. One of the main reasons for failure of an immunisation programme is a failure in the cold chain.</p>

                        <h4>Admission Procedure</h4>
                        <p>When working with children, you as a nurse should realise that even if the procedures are routinely normal to you, children and their parents or guardians may be anxious and distressed. With experience and observation, you will detect their concerns.</p>
                        <p>A concerned attitude calls for a kind approach and understanding on your part. Some parents or guardians may feel guilty or blame themselves, especially if the disease or condition the child is suffering from could have been prevented.</p>
                        <p>Avoid criticising the child's parent/guardian who is misinformed about the nature of disease, causes and prognosis. Instead you must reassure that person so as to alleviate fears whenever possible.</p>
                        <p>The parents/guardians should be allowed to accompany their children to the assigned bed within the ward. The parents should receive a pleasant and friendly reception in a clean and a quiet environment. Even if you are too busy, you must protect the trust patients place in nurses. This respect is partly based on calmness and positive attitudes displayed from the very onset of their arrival.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>Remember that the first impression counts and is extremely vital.</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The older child, if not seriously ill on admission, should be introduced to other children, as this reduces possible anxiety and stress. Similarly, the parents should be introduced to other parents. It is important you use the correct names and pronunciation. You should carry out the procedures carefully and methodically. You should also be ready to answer any questions clearly and fully as ambiguity may cause distress and misunderstanding to parents or guardians.</p>
                        <p>If older children are not seriously ill and are mobile, they and their parents/guardians should be introduced to the ward or unit, including orientation to available facilities such as call bell, toilets, bathrooms and playroom. Information such as visiting hours for friends, parents, guardians and siblings including the types of food and drinks that may be brought, should be given.</p>
                        <p>You should make every effort to find out from the parents/guardians the child's likes, dislikes and what the child's commonly used name is. Such investigations will enable you to adapt accordingly. The same enquiries should apply to family history and spiritual beliefs, which you should address without causing embarrassment. Finally, informed consent for care and operation should be obtained before the parents/guardians leave for home.</p>

                        <h4>History Taking</h4>
                        <p>In almost all cases, the history is usually taken from the parents or guardians, especially when the child is young. For older children, additional information as to how they feel may be obtained directly. The most important details to be recorded should include medical history, which is, whether the child has been ill before and the nature of any previous illness. It is also necessary to find out whether the patient has had any surgery before and for what purpose.</p>
                        <p>You should also take the family, social and economic history because these may be contributing factors to illness. In addition, the mother's obstetric history, including the number of children she has and her marital status should be taken. All these will give you a comprehensive view of the child and their family. The information obtained must be written clearly and accurately on the available forms because they form permanent records for the period the patient is hospitalised and are useful for future reference. The records become legal documentation, which may assist the health institution in case of problems.</p>
                        <p>You should, at all times, make an effort to establish rapport with the parents or guardians in order to allay anxiety and gain confidence. You should be extra careful in selecting the words used when interviewing the parents/guardians. Sometimes, your words may be misinterpreted. It is advisable to clarify to parents/guardians why you are asking questions to avoid any offence being taken.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the period of history taking, you should try to observe non-verbal clues and form your own impression or opinion on the patient and their family members.</p>

                        <h4>Physical Examination</h4>
                        <p>In order to make a nursing diagnosis and prepare the nursing care plan, you should perform an objective physical examination from head to toe. Exercise patience and make friends with the child before examining them. Be flexible in the order of examination, that is leave upsetting and disturbing procedures until last. In most cases the standard techniques of inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation is used.</p>
                        <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Should be both visual and clinical. You should personally observe the patient as well as check temperature, pulse and respiration.</p>
                        <p><strong>Inspection:</strong> Involves critical scrutiny to look for signs and symptoms of disease or abnormality.</p>
                        <p><strong>Palpation:</strong> Is the process of examining with a finger over the chest or abdomen.</p>
                        <p><strong>Percussion:</strong> Involves placing the left middle fingers over the chest and then tapping with the right finger.</p>
                        <p><strong>Auscultation:</strong> Is listening for sound by use of the ears and stethoscope.</p>
                        <h6>Position/Place for Examination</h6>
                        <p>When examining a child, it is important to seek the help of the parent or guardian to prevent unnecessary movement and resentment by the child. The young child will have to be undressed by the parent/guardian, while the examination will be performed on their laps. The use of distracters may also win the child's confidence and enhance their cooperation.</p>
                        <p>You should talk to the child and mother in a low voice and persuasive manner maintaining eye contact at the level to that of the patient. Older children may be given the necessary instruction on what to do and should be allowed to choose the position they wish to adopt during physical examination. The child's developmental and nutritional status is also assessed during the physical examination.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Investigations</h4>
                        <p>Children, like adults, who are admitted at the hospital or attend clinic, will require detailed investigations in order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and prescription of the remedial measure. You will be particularly responsible in carrying out these investigations, or assigning them to the relevant personnel in other departments to do so. These personnel may be the doctor, radiographer, laboratory technologist, and of course, you will assess each child individually to determine the type of investigations required.</p>
                        <p>As a professional operating close to a patient, you must ensure that all investigations are carried out accurately, punctually and aseptically. All forms pertaining to these investigations must be correctly written to avoid mix up in handling specimens. Once forwarded to various departments, you should ensure the results are collected and made ready so that the management of the child is commenced without delay.</p>
                        <h5>Common Investigations</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Body fluids, excretions and secretions, and tissues for culture and sensitivity tests</li>
                            <li>Blood for white cell counts and differentials</li>
                            <li>Haemoglobin and malarial parasites</li>
                            <li>Grouping and cross matching</li>
                            <li>Urine for microscopic, albumen, sugar, acetone</li>
                            <li>Stool for ova and cysts and occult blood</li>
                            <li>Radiological investigations, although for very young babies this may have to be kept to a minimum</li>
                            <li>Endoscopic investigations may also be carried out but only in a few selected patients according to the problems they are suffering from</li>
                            <li>Sputum for microscopic culture and sensitivity</li>
                            <li>Where the patient is unable to produce the specimen, insertion of a naso-gastric tube may be considered and stomach content aspirated and sent to laboratory</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should endeavour to ensure that the parents and the patients are physically and psychologically prepared before, during and after the procedures. Similarly you should be able to help and assist to ensure that the child is not subjected to unnecessary pain and discomfort during the process. Above all, the principles of infection control must be observed when handling specimens.</p>

                    <h4 id="imci-heading">IMCI - Integrated Management of Childhood Illness</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>The IMCI Concept</h5>
                        <p>This is a strategy, which combines improved management of childhood illnesses with aspects of nutrition, immunisation and several other important influences on child health, including maternal health. The IMCI strategy aims at reducing the infant mortality rate, severity of illness and disability by integrating treatment and prevention of major childhood illness to contribute to an improved growth and development.</p>
                        <h5>The History</h5>
                        <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO), working in collaboration with UNICEF, introduced this new plan for comprehensive and timely management of sick children under the age of five years. The new initiative was born of the fact that 1.2 million children in developing countries die before celebrating their fifth birthdays, many within the first year of life. It was further noted that seven in ten (that is 58%) of deaths are mainly due to acute respiratory infection, specifically pneumonia.</p>
                        <p>Other diseases in this category are measles, malaria, malnutrition and diarrhoea. These diseases may occur singly but in most cases they tend to develop in combination. Three out of four episodes of illness in children are caused by one of these diseases.</p>
                        <p>Millions of parents and guardians present themselves with sick children in hospitals, health centres and dispensaries daily. Some opt to visit traditional healers, community care providers and pharmacists for treatment.</p>
                        <p>Projections based on global burden of diseases analysis of 1996 shows that five specific diseases, that is, acute respiratory infection, measles, malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea will continue to be major contributors of childhood mortality right up to the year 2020, unless drastic and significant efforts are made to control them. As a result of these reasons the World Health Organisation, Division of Child Health and Development, in collaboration with ten other WHO programmes and UNICEF developed the IMCI. This should be adopted in the Kenyan context.</p>
                        <p>The evidence that a large proportion of childhood morbidity and mortality in the developed world is caused by just five conditions is really not enough justification for an integrated approach. However, it is known that most sick children present with clinical features related to more than one of these conditions. The overlap means that a single diagnosis may neither be possible nor appropriate.</p>

                        <h5>Benefits of IMCI Strategy</h5>
                        <p>In smaller health facilities such as health centres, the IMCI strategy has several advantages.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Promotion of accurate identification of childhood illnesses in the outpatient situation.</li>
                            <li>Ensures appropriate combined treatment of all major illnesses and strengthens the counselling of relatives who are looking after the sick children while simultaneously providing preventive services.</li>
                            <li>IMCI helps to accelerate the referral system of severely ill children and improves the care of these patients.</li>
                            <li>In the home environment, the strategy promotes appropriate care seeking behaviours.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Relationship of IMCI with Existing Technical Programmes</h5>
                        <p>The IMCI strategy helps to promote several interventions and areas of activity such as immunisation, vitamin A supplementation and ongoing supply and management, which are handled by other technical programmes.</p>
                        <p>Implementation of the IMCI strategy involves the following three components:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improvements in the case management skills of health staff through the provision of locally adapted guidelines on IMCI and activities to promote their use</li>
                            <li>Improvements in the health care system required for effective management of childhood illnesses</li>
                            <li>Improvements in family and community practices</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The objective of IMCl is not to takeover the responsibilities of the various programmes, but to ensure that the activities are well coordinated and effectively implemented in order to contribute to IMCI.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>You are already conversant with the various types of foods used in Kenyan society and their nutritive value as well as how they vary from one ethnic group to another and from one religious group to another. However different they may be, the common denominator is that they provide us with all the nutrients we need for our bodily functions.</p>
                        <p>You learnt earlier in this unit of the importance of nutrition in growth and development and general health maintenance. You will look at the known food constituents available for human consumption.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this unit you will be able to:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Food Nutrients and Their Functions</h4>
                        <h5>Proteins</h5>
                        <p>These are a group of foods that supply amino acids for the growth and repair of body tissue. Proteins play a very important role in immunity, the blood clotting mechanism, transport of body substances and the regulation and maintenance of osmotic pressure. Therefore, a good amount of protein should be given to patients, especially children. When taken into the body, proteins are broken down to amino acids, which are then absorbed into the blood stream via the villi so as to be utilised by the body.</p>

                                <caption>Sources of Proteins</caption>

                            </table>
                        </div>
                        <h5>Carbohydrates</h5>
                        <p>These are the main energy source for the body. When eaten and absorbed into the bloodstream in its simplest form, carbohydrate is referred to as glucose. Glucose is very important for the brain and nerve function. Carbohydrates can further be divided into three main categories, that is, sugar, starch and polysaccharides. Carbohydrates can be obtained from potatoes, rice, ugali, fruits, milk, cereals, starches and vegetables. Some carbohydrates form indigestible polysaccharides and cellulose, which form roughage essential for the stimulation of intestinal peristalsis.</p>
                        <h5>Fats</h5>
                        <p>Although fats have a higher caloric value, they are less efficiently utilised by the brain and nerve tissue. However, fats are the body's largest energy store. Fat is found under the skin and around some body organs, such as the kidneys to give support and protection from injuries. Other functions include formation of cholesterol and steroid hormones. They are also vehicles for the absorption of vitamins A, B, E and K . They are usually broken down to fatty acids and glycerols before being absorbed into the bloodstream via intestinal villi and lacteal vessels. Fats are available in fatty meat, chicken, fish, butter, milk and vegetable oils and so on.</p>
                        <h5>Vitamins</h5>
                        <p>These are organic compounds which are classified as water soluble and fat soluble vitamins. The water soluble vitamins are B and C while fat soluble include A, D, E and K. All the vitamins are obtained through food consumption. Vitamin D can be synthesised through the action of sunlight and vitamin K, which itself is synthesised by the large intestinal bacteria. Fat soluble vitamins are found in fish, meat, milk, butter and plant oils. They can easily be stored in the liver and adipose tissue. Over consumption of fat can lead to hyper vitaminosis, though that is a rare occurrence. Deficiency in fat soluble vitamins is rare but if it occurs, it is usually due to trauma or severe illness.</p>
                        <h5>Mineral Salts</h5>
                        <p>The main mineral salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chlorine and sulphur. Only small amounts of each mineral are required to sustain bodily functions. They are essential for enzyme components. Those of significant nutritional value are iron, zinc, and iodine. Iron deficiency leads to anaemia, while iodine deficiency leads to goitre. Zinc is also required for enzyme reaction, especially during growth and wound healing.</p>
                        <h5>Water</h5>
                        <p>This is the major component of the body and the dietary intake must have sufficient quantity in order to meet daily needs. Without adequate amounts of water, the body tissues cannot function properly. Water is the solvent for cellular changes. Water acts as a medium for ions, and transports nutrients and waste products. It is also important for the regulation of body temperature. The amount required varies from one person to another, though in adults an average of two to three litres should be taken daily. In children, the amount will vary according to the age.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Malnutrition is more than a medical problem. It is brought about by dysfunctions in economic, demographic, cultural religious and ecological processes. Malnutrition may be due to an excess, deficit or imbalance in the essential components of a balanced diet.</p>
                        <h5>Over Nutrition</h5>
                        <p>This refers to ingestion of more food than is required for the body needs, as may be seen in the case of obesity. This condition is more common in rich western countries (the developed world).</p>
                        <h5>Under Nutrition</h5>
                        <p>This describes a state of poor nourishment as a result of inadequate diet or presence of disease, which interferes with the normal appetite, absorption and assimilation of ingested food. Inadequate or poor nourishment diet is more prevalent in the third world countries that are still developing and poor. Included in under nutrition are protein energy malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies.</p>
                        <p>The main causes of under nutrition are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Insufficient food resources</li>
                            <li>Lack of education about nutritional needs</li>
                            <li>Poor socioeconomic conditions</li>
                            <li>Chronic illnesses</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM)</h5>
                        <p>This condition is also referred to as protein calorie malnutrition (PCM). It is the most common form of under nutrition in children. Protein Calorie Malnutrition can be classified as primary type, which means the nutritional needs are not met as a result of poor eating habits, or secondary type, which refers to malnutrition occurring as a result of an alteration or defect in ingestion, absorption or metabolism. In such circumstances, the tissue needs are not met even though the dietary intake would be deemed satisfactory under normal conditions, for example in diseases such as measles, tuberculosis, mal-absorption syndromes and so on.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Forms of Protein Energy Malnutrition</h6>
                        <p>The two clinical forms of protein energy malnutrition are kwashiorkor and marasmus. In kwashiorkor the main deficient nutrient is protein, while in marasmus the deficiency is caloric. There are some children who fall in between the two forms, and who suffer growth failure but exhibit no signs of either disease. Both conditions impair growth and if they are chronic will end up reducing the size of an individual.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Kwashiorkor</h5>
                        <p>In this condition there is a lack in protein relative to calories, often associated with a normal growth pattern until six to eight months of age when the weight of the child begins to decrease. The name originated from a local Ghanaian language meaning 'displayed child'. Characteristics include growth retardation, changes in skin tone, mental apathy and other bodily changes.</p>
                        <h6>Causes</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Kwashiorkor may be caused by a sudden change from breast milk to porridge, which is entirely comprised of carbohydrates. This sudden change in feeding habits may be prompted if the mother realises that she is pregnant while still breast feeding.</li>
                            <li>Infections, such as malaria, measles and so on, accompanied by fever which tends to use up the scarce protein stored in the body may result in kwashiorkor.</li>
                            <li>Anorexia, due to other illnesses, and intestinal worms, which draw on the child's food supply, may also be predisposing factors.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following are some of the clinical features of kwashiorkor:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Growth failure and some muscle wasting</li>
                            <li>Oedema of the face, hands, anus, feet and bulging abdomen</li>
                            <li>The hair becomes thin, straight and brownish in colour</li>
                            <li>The child has poor appetite and is irritable</li>
                            <li>There is mental apathy and lack of interest in the surroundings</li>
                            <li>Diarrhoea</li>
                            <li>Hepatomegaly and anaemia</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When undertaking diagnostic investigations, you should carry out the following procedures:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First, you should always take the child's personal history from the parents.</li>
                            <li>Secondly, physical and laboratory examinations to exclude infections such as malaria which is done by testing blood slide for malarial parasites and intestinal worms which are checked from the stool (ova and cysts).</li>
                            <li>Thirdly, blood tests for WBC and haemoglobin estimation should exclude anaemia.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Marasmus</h5>
                        <p>The term marasmus refers to starvation. The disease is caused by lack of food of any kind, which includes proteins, carbohydrates, fats and vitamins. Marasmus occurs at any age, but is more commonly found in infants who do not get enough breast feeding or during the weaning period, when poor bottle feeding practices are followed or supplementary foods are not given. Clinical features of marasmus include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The weight of the affected child normally drops to 60% below the standard expected weight</li>
                            <li>Muscular atrophy, especially visible on the arms and legs, with loss of subcutaneous fat and legs and arms are thin</li>
                            <li>Wrinkled, thin and flaccid skin</li>
                            <li>The face of the child usually looks old and anxious</li>
                            <li>The child may have diarrhoea or constipation</li>
                            <li>The child has very good appetite when being fed but does not put on weight</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Marasmic Kwashiorkor</h5>
                        <p>Any child with kwashiorkor has some muscle wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat, regardless of the presence of oedema. If this process is severe enough to result in weight loss below 60% of the normal expected weight according to their age, then the child is said to have marasmic kwashiorkor.</p>
                        <p>There are several factors, which contribute to protein energy malnutrition (PEM). Many people in developing countries know very little about the nutritional values of the food they eat. In addition, some people in the developing countries are traditionalists and the food they consume is often dictated by cultural norms. For example, there may be customs outlining what men, women and children are supposed to eat and what they are forbidden.</p>
                        <p>Poverty is also an important factor. Most body building foodstuffs suitable for weaning, for example, milk and eggs, are too expensive for a large percentage of the population. This factor often pre-disposes parents to act in a seemingly negligent manner, especially in instances where they are pre-occupied by income generating activities, leaving the child in the care of other people who may not be aware of the child's dietary requirements.</p>
                        <p>Poor farming practices, and natural disasters, like droughts and floods may also lead to a loss in income and inability to meet the dietary requirements of the child. Finally, political instability often drives people away from their natural environment to camps (as refugees), where they are unable to engage in productive activities and may have no means of supplementing their basic rations.</p>

                            <li>Usually the onset is acute and sudden</li>
                            <li>Older children may complain of a headache that becomes severe and spreads down the neck</li>
                            <li>The patient becomes pyrexial with tachycardia</li>
                            <li>Rigors are often present</li>
                            <li>Pain in the back and limbs</li>
                            <li>The patient's neck and possibly the spinal column become stiff/rigid</li>
                            <li>Kernig's sign is positive: patient supine with hip flexed to 90°; pain and inability to fully extend the knee, Kernig's sign is negative if the patient can fully extend knee</li>
                            <li>Due to the fever, convulsions may occur</li>
                            <li>The child cries with a high-pitched voice</li>
                            <li>Anorexia is usually present</li>
                            <li>In very young babies, the anterior fontanelle may bulge outwards instead of positive Kernig's sign</li>
                            <li>The child is irritable, drowsy and goes into a comatose state</li>
                            <li>Photophobia is usually common and in some cases circulatory collapse with petechial haemorrhage may occur (bleeding spots) on the skin</li>
                            <li>Cyanosis and vomiting are present</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Diagnostic Investigations</h5>
                        <p>Begin by taking the patient's personal history. A physical examination should follow. A lumbar puncture is performed to analyse the CSF and may show that polymorph cells are increased. CSF is turbid in appearance (cloudy), the pressure is raised, glucose level is lower than normal and/or the amount of proteins is raised. You should also investigate other suspected infections, for example, measles, malaria, typhoid, broncho-pneumonia.</p>

                        <p>You should observe the patient carefully and report to the physician in charge the onset of one or more of the following complications:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Meningococcal septicaemia</li>
                            <li>Hypostatic pneumonia</li>
                            <li>Peripheral circulatory shock</li>
                            <li>Adrenal damage</li>
                            <li>Central nervous system: Hydrocephalus, cranial nerve palsies, mental retardation, subdural effusions, deafness, blindness, epilepsy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Prognosis</h5>
                        <p>If the condition is identified early and effectively treated, the mortality rate does not exceed 5%. However, if treatment is delayed the mortality rate is 30%, but those who survive usually have permanent brain damage.</p>
                        <h5>Prevention and Control</h5>
                        <p>Cases of meningococcal infection should be isolated and treated. As it is a communicable disease, identified cases should be reported or notified to the District Medical Officer of Health immediately for control measures. The community should be informed of the importance of early reporting and treatment. The dangers of overcrowding should be stressed. Prophylactic penicillin should be given to household contacts. In suspected epidemic children, who are drowsy or have fits, a referral should be made for screening and further observations. Suspected outbreaks in schools should be investigated and surveillance maintained.</p>

                        <h4 id="other-infectious-heading">Whooping Cough (Pertussis)</h4>
                        <p>This is an infectious respiratory disease, which is characterised by an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the lungs, pharynx, trachea and bronchi. Thick, stringy mucus is produced which the child tries to expectorate by coughing. The attacks of coughing reach a peak of violence, ending in an inspiratory whoop. The infection is caused by a type of bacterium called bordetella pertussis (or pertussis bacillus). It is a gram-negative aerobic bacillus which is transmitted either through direct contact with soiled fomites or through airborne droplets spread from the infected person. The incubation period is usually seven to 14 days but the infectivity period is from two days before the onset of cough and continues for up to four or even six weeks. This is a worldwide disease common among children between the ages of two to three years reaching up to five years. In infants of up to one year, it presents in a very severe form with a very high mortality rate. Both sexes are equally affected.</p>
                        <h5>Clinical Manifestations of Whooping Cough</h5>
                        <p>The following are some of the main clinical features of whooping cough:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute illness, with a slow onset of cough and fever resembling common cold (catarrhal stage), the catarrhal stage takes a period of approximately 14 days</li>
                            <li>The cough increases and manifests as spasms of cough while breathing out (expiration) followed by crowing or whooping while breathing in (inspiration)</li>
                            <li>In mild cases or in babies, the typical whoop may be missing</li>
                            <li>Young babies may be very ill or have attacks of not breathing (apnoea) resulting in cyanosis</li>
                            <li>Coughing attacks are always associated with vomiting and strings of sticky mucus usually hang down the sides of the mouth and are more common at night</li>
                            <li>The underneath and the sides of the tongue may be sore and ulcerated</li>
                            <li>The whoop can last several weeks and may recur every time the child has another acute respiratory infection</li>
                            <li>There is a high mortality rate in young babies</li>
                            <li>Leucocytosis (up to 100,000 cm) and lymphocytosis are usually present and these are quite important in confirming the diagnosis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Nursing Care and Treatment</h5>
                        <p>Nurse the child on complete bed rest to prevent paroxysms of coughing. The room environment should be kept warm and humid. Oxygen therapy is given continuously or when the child is cyanosed. The child's nutritional status is maintained by giving small, frequent feeds and when the child vomits, an attempt should be made to feed them again.</p>
                        <p>For a child with whooping cough you should maintain a fluid balance chart and observe the child's vital signs such as the temperature, pulse and respiration. Record any findings every two to four hours until the condition improves. Give health education to the parents. Continue to maintain the child's personal hygiene.</p>
                        <h5>Medical Management</h5>
                        <p>Medical treatment includes Erythromycin 40 mg/kg daily or Septrin 30 mg/kg BD for two weeks. This can reduce the duration of infection if administered within the first week of the illness. Mild sedatives to keep the child quiet should be given, for example, chloral hydrate or Phenobarbitone (heavy sedation must be avoided). Phenegram in a dose of 5 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the evening may reduce whooping and vomiting and ensure a good nights sleep. Antibiotics may be given to prevent secondary complications.</p>
                        <h5>Complications</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pneumonia which should be treated with antibiotics</li>
                            <li>Encephalopathy including convulsions which can be alleviated by performing a lumbar puncture to relieve intra-cranial pressure</li>
                            <li>Surgical emphysema (gaseous distension) escaping into the mediastinum and into subcutaneous tissues</li>
                            <li>Sub conjuctival haemorrhage</li>
                            <li>Bronchiectasis and lung collapse</li>
                            <li>Otitis media</li>
                            <li>Marasmus (malnutrition)</li>
                            <li>Epistaxis</li>
                            <li>Inguinal hernia and rectal prolapse</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Prevention</h5>
                        <p>The primary form of prevention is immunisation. The pentavalent vaccine is given in early childhood (infancy). Three injections are given at four week intervals. Good nutrition, especially breast feeding is also necessary. Children should be kept in well ventilated houses. Prevent contact between small babies and children who have pertussis whenever possible. Children who have household contacts should receive a course of erythromycin.</p>

                        <h4>Poliomyelitis</h4>
                        <p>Poliomyelitis is an acute infectious viral disease of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and sometimes of the lower part of the brain. It occurs sporadically or is epidemiological and usually affects children under five but more commonly children under three. It is characterised by varying degrees of paralysis.</p>
                        <p>In Kenya just like anywhere in Africa, the poliovirus which is of three types, was very common and infected almost all adults at one stage during their childhood. To develop immunity against each type of the poliovirus, a person has to have been infected or immunised against that particular type and this is one of the reasons why a child is given three doses of polio vaccine. Poliomyelitis is a complication of a viral infection which is usually confined to the pharynx and gastro-intestinal tract, but in some cases there are no symptoms at all.</p>
                        <p>In about 1% of the patients the virus gains entry into the nervous system and settles in the motor cells of the anterior horn of the spinal cord or in the medulla oblangata. Some factors, which contribute to the invasion of the nervous system include muscular exhaustion, tooth extraction, tonsillectomy, injections and damaged nerve endings. The invasion finally leads to paralysis.</p>
                        <h5>Pathophysiology</h5>
                        <p>The causative micro-organism is poliovirus. There are three types of viruses. Type one is known as Brunhilde, which is commonly associated with paralytic illness. Type two is called Lansing and Type three is known as Leon. The latter two are less commonly associated with paralysis. It has an incubation period of three to six days but can extend between three to 21 days. It has an infective period of three to 14 days. The virus spreads mainly through the oral route (gastrointestinal tract) and then spreads to the lymphatic system. It can also spread through droplets.</p>
                        <h5>Clinical Manifestations</h5>
                        <p>The infection manifests itself in several ways such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient presents with fever of 39-40 °C</li>
                            <li>General malaise</li>
                            <li>Vomiting and headache</li>
                            <li>Painful and tender muscles follow this a few days later</li>
                            <li>Paralysis of one or more limbs occurs as the muscles become weakened</li>
                            <li>The paralysis of the respiratory muscles follows without the child developing any other illness (this is referred to as flaccid paralysis)</li>
                            <li>Only the motor system is affected but without sensory loss</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are various types of poliomyelitis. <strong>Paralytic Type:</strong> This can be divided into spinal polio, where the virus attacks the anterior horn of the grey matter and bulbar polio, where the virus attacks the grey matter of the brain stem. <strong>Non-Paralytic Type:</strong> The patient experiences muscle pain and stiffness. This type of polio can also change to a paralytic type as a result of any kind of stress.</p>
                        <h5>Diagnostic Investigations</h5>
                        <p>A lumbar puncture should be performed to exclude the possibility of meningitis. Cerebral Spinal Fluid is usually clear in colour. Both lymphocytes and polymorphs may be present in the CSF.</p>
                        <h5>Management of Poliomyelitis</h5>
                        <p>This can be divided into supportive and preventive management.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient is strictly confined to bed</li>
                            <li>Activities in the first two weeks of the infection risk possible increased paralysis and should be avoided</li>
                            <li>The patient is to be nursed in isolation</li>
                            <li>Pain is controlled through the administration of analgesics, for example, paracetamol, valium or phenobarbitone</li>
                            <li>Regular respiratory suction and postural drainage should be performed</li>
                            <li>N.G tube feeding should be high calorie and include substantial amounts of protein</li>
                            <li>Change the patient's position every four hours to prevent bedsores</li>
                            <li>Surgical procedures should also be avoided</li>
                            <li>No injections are to be administered during this acute stage as they may precipitate paralysis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Immobilise the affected limbs during the acute stage of the illness, using splints to prevent flexion deformities and promote rest. After the acute stage has passed, begin gradual and gentle exercise of the affected limbs. Ensure proper disposal of faeces and urine to prevent spread of infection. Urinary catheterisation must be passed but principles of asepsis must be observed strictly. Maintain an intravenous infusion and fluid balance chart. Oxygen therapy may be used when necessary. A tracheotomy and use of a mechanical respirator may be used should the patient's condition deteriorate.</p>
                        <p>After being discharged, the child should return to the clinic at regular intervals to ensure flexion deformities do not occur. A plaster of Paris or back slab should be applied to the limbs if these deformities actually occur. Special shoes and callipers may help severely affected children. Prolonged rehabilitation will be required at a later date when the patient is fully recovered.</p>
                        <h5>Prevention</h5>
                        <p>If polio occurs in an area, the District Medical Officer of Health should be notified in writing immediately. Sabin oral vaccines are given to children to prevent them from getting poliomyelitis whenever there is an outbreak and routinely in MCH clinics. Parents should be encouraged to ensure their children are immunised.</p>

                        <h4>Chickenpox (Varicella)</h4>
                        <h5>Pathophysiology</h5>
                        <p>This is a mild viral infection, which is extremely contagious. Fever and a typical skin rash characterise it. The causative organism is Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV). It is spread in several ways. These include airborne droplet infection, direct or indirect contact, dry scabs and nut infections.</p>
                        <p>Droplets from the respiratory tract can transmit the Varicella Zoster Virus from one person to another. Even the wind is now known to transmit the virus particles from the skin of the infected person over a distance of meters to another person. Once infected, the disease leaves immunity against chicken pox but the virus remains within the body and may reappear later in adult life as the herpes zoster when the person's immunity is weakened, for example in AIDS, diabetes, leukaemia and old age.</p>
                        <p>It has an incubation period of ten to twenty one days. The period of communicability is about five days before the rash to six days after the appearance of the vesicles.</p>
                        <h5>Clinical Manifestation</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Slight fever and sore throat are the first to appear in older children while younger children are affected by a skin rash</li>
                            <li>Maculopapular rash, which becomes vesicular within a few hours, appears on the trunk and spreads to the face, armpits, scalp and sometimes the extremities, (distribution to palms and soles is seldom)</li>
                            <li>Vesicles are usually superficial on the skin and in the mouth following the sensory nerve, groups of new pocks of rash will appear over many days</li>
                            <li>Pustules may form but usually the vesicles collapse and dry up after three to four days leaving no scars</li>
                            <li>Anorexia and headache may be present</li>
                            <li>Skin irritation (itching) and Lymphadenopathy are sometimes present</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Nursing Care</h5>
                        <p>Confine the child to bed until the pyrexia settles down. Monitor the vital signs at regular intervals. The child requires plenty of fluids and a nourishing diet. The fingernails should be kept short and the child has to be restrained from scratching. General body cleanliness should be maintained. Soothing lotions such as Calamine, should be applied to the skin to soothe itching. Antibiotics are given prophylactically. Occasionally, the child may have to be sedated.</p>
                        <h5>Complications</h5>
                        <p>Complications include secondary infections of skin lesions. Pneumonia or encephalitis may also occur but are rare. Other possible complications may be thrombocytopenia, arthritis and nephritis.</p>
                        <h5>Prevention and Control</h5>
                        <p>As part of active immunisation the live varicella vaccine is used selectively for immune suppressed children. The varicella zoster immune globulin is used for high risk individuals.</p>

                        <h4>Measles</h4>
                        <p>This is an acute highly infectious disease. It is caused by the measles virus. Transmission is by droplet or direct contact with secretions from the nose and throat of infected persons. The child is most infectious to others during the prodromal phase, often before the diagnosis is made.</p>
                        <p><strong>Incubation Period:</strong> Measles has an incubation period of seven to 14 days but usually 10 to 12 days is sufficient.</p>
                        <p><strong>Isolation Period:</strong> The isolation period is five days after appearance of the rash.</p>
                        <h5>Clinical Manifestations</h5>
                        <p><strong>Prodromal phase:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This may last three to seven days</li>
                            <li>The first symptoms are runny nose, fever, conjunctivitis and coughing</li>
                            <li>There may be a faint rash which disappears quickly in the prodromal period</li>
                            <li>Koplik spots appear 24-48 hours before the main rash. Koplik spots are small white spots on a red base inside the cheeks, usually opposite the lower molars, but may occur on gums and inside lips as well</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Stage of advance:</strong> The maculopapular rash starts behind the ears and on the forehead and spreads downwards. It takes about three days to reach the feet, at which point it starts to fade. Fever is high and lasts for four to five days.</p>
                        <h5>Complications</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Otitis media</li>

                            <li>Pneumonia - This is usually a viral pneumonitis</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary TB</li>
                            <li>Kerato - conjunctivitis</li>
                            <li>Encephalitis is a serious complication often fatal or with residual brain damage</li>
                            <li>Gastroenteritis</li>
                            <li>Oral thrush and/or oral herpes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Nursing Care and Medical Management</h5>
                        <p>There is no specific treatment available other than supportive. Supportive treatment includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Antipyretics</li>
                            <li>Plenty of oral fluids</li>
                            <li>Eye and mouth hygiene</li>
                            <li>Vitamin A 200,000 units orally daily for two days</li>
                            <li>Check the child frequently for complication</li>
                            <li>Uncomplicated cases can be nursed at home but complicated cases, infants and malnourished children should be treated in a hospital with isolation facilities</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Prevention</h5>
                        <p>Measles can be prevented through active immunisation with attenuated live virus vaccine. All children should be vaccinated against measles as per the KEPI schedule of immunisation. The infection can be aborted if vaccine is given within 12 hours of exposure.</p>

                        <p>The incubation period varies from patient to patient but is on average between 14 and 21 days of infectivity after the onset of the parotid glands swelling.</p>
                        <h5>Clinical Manifestations</h5>
                        <p>All or some of the following symptoms may be present:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The salivary glands namely the parotid, sublingual and submaxillary glands may be infected by painful swelling, this may be one side or both sides</li>
                            <li>The child develops fever and complains of headache and malaise</li>
                            <li>There is dysphagia (painful swallowing)</li>
                            <li>The tongue is furred and mouth dry due to diminished saliva</li>
                            <li>Moderate lymphocytosis is noted on blood examination</li>
                            <li>The tenderness may last two to three days then gradually subside</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Nursing Care</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Isolate during period of communicability</li>
                            <li>Maintain bed rest in a warm room until swelling subsides</li>
                            <li>Give analgesics and antipyretics as required</li>
                            <li>Encourage fluids and soft bland foods</li>
                            <li>Avoid foods which contain acid and which require chewing because they may increase pain</li>
                            <li>Apply heat or cold compress to neck whichever is more comfortable</li>
                            <li>Observe the child's vital signs of temperature, pulse and respiration and record them every four hours</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Prevention</h5>
                        <p>Since the condition is caused by a virus, there is no specific drug treatment. However the active immunity of a live attenuated vaccine is available for those who are not already infected. The mumps virus vaccine is best given before puberty.</p>
                        <h5>Complications</h5>
                        <p>Complications after infections with the mumps virus are rare but you should be on the lookout for the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The child may develop deafness</li>
                            <li>Inflammations of genital organs, such as the ovaries called oophoritis in girls and testes - orchitis in boys may occur, in both cases this may result in sterility in adulthood</li>
                            <li>Meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the meninges and brain)</li>
                            <li>Pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Hepatitis</h4>
                        <p>This is the inflammation of the liver, most commonly caused by various types of viruses, namely A, B, C, D and E. In this subsection, you shall briefly look at Hepatitis A, B and C as they are related to paediatric illnesses.</p>
                        <h5>Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Infectious Hepatitis</h5>
                        <p>This virus usually occurs in epidemic form. It spreads from person to person by the faecaloral route and ingestion of contaminated material. The virus is excreted in stools and urine from three weeks before to one week after the onset of clinical symptoms. The incubation period is about three weeks.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Manifestations</h6>
                        <p>All or some of the following symptoms may be present:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gastro-intestinal upset (loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting)</li>
                            <li>Fever, headache, joint pains, tiredness</li>
                            <li>Jaundice</li>
                            <li>Clay-coloured stools, dark-brown urine</li>
                            <li>Enlarged and tender liver</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Investigations</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Serum bilirubin (increase of mainly direct bilirubin)</li>
                            <li>Liver function tests (abnormal)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The disease is usually milder in children than in adults. Many cases of infectious hepatitis take a sub-clinical course, without jaundice there may be only mild symptoms such as slight fever and loss of appetite for a few days. Very occasionally, the disease is severe and may cause death due to acute liver failure.</p>
                        <h6>The Management of Hepatitis A</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most cases get better without treatment</li>
                            <li>Bed rest is usually recommended while jaundice is obvious</li>
                            <li>Hygienic disposal of stool and urine</li>
                            <li>Hand washing after contact with the patient</li>
                            <li>Free diet (but fatty foods are likely to be refused)</li>
                            <li>Refer patients to hospital if jaundice is very severe, vomiting persists and/or if confusion, coma or bleeding tendency occur</li>
                            <li>A vaccine is now available for contacts</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Hepatitis B (HBV) - Serum Hepatitis</h5>
                        <p>Although a common infection on a global scale, it is more prevalent in sub-sahara Africa because of the high perinatal transmission rate and close contact between toddlers. It can also be spread through other routes. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The virus consists of a capsule and 'o' core, which contains DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and DNA polymerase enzymes. The virus circulates in the bloodstream. It can infect people of any age group.</p>
                        <p>The incubation period tends to be longer than that of other viruses, which affect the liver but usually in the range of 40 to 180 days. The communicability period is just a few days to one month during which period the individual has become a carrier. In many countries the carrier number is as high as 5-20%.</p>
                        <h6>Routes of transmission</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Trans-placental route, from mother to foetus through the placenta (vertical)</li>
                            <li>Blood transfusion, if the donor blood was not properly screened</li>
                            <li>Contact with other body fluids and secretions</li>
                            <li>Haemodialysis, especially children</li>
                            <li>Through injections with contaminated needles and broken skin surface</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Diagnostic Investigations</h6>
                        <p>Diagnostic investigations include the examination of venous blood specimen in the laboratory when hepatitis B antigen/antibodies are found to be positive. Blood should be examined for bilirubin and alkaline phosphates but tests are not always conclusive. A liver function test may also be carried out but should be avoided in children.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Features of Hepatitis B</h6>
                        <p>The clinical manifestations occur very slowly. These may begin with mild fever, anorexia, general malaise, nausea and vomiting. As the condition progresses, the patient will complain of abdominal discomfort. Occasionally mild jaundice may be present. Bile in the urine and a low white blood count may be noticed.</p>
                        <h6>Nursing Care</h6>
                        <p>When nursing a child admitted to your ward with this condition, you should allow them to regulate their own activities. The diet should be high protein, high calorie, and high carbohydrate but low fat. Vomiting, which may be persistent ought to be managed by intravenous administration of fluids.</p>
                        <p>A fluid balance chart is maintained during this period. Precautionary measures, which include wearing gloves, when carrying out intimate procedures should be observed. There is no specific drug treatment but certain antibiotics may be administered when there is an onset of complications.</p>
                        <h6>Prevention of Hepatitis B</h6>
                        <p>In order to prevent spread of infections, you should make every effort to ensure that your hands are thoroughly washed after handling the patient, as well as all the articles, including linen used by the patient. The toilets should be cleaned with disinfectants.</p>
                        <h6>Complications</h6>
                        <p>Complications may emerge much later and may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute fulminating hepatitis characterised by rapidly rising bilirubin</li>
                            <li>Encephalopathy, which is a degenerative process of the brain</li>
                            <li>Oedema and ascites will always be present in the advanced stage</li>
                            <li>Hepatic coma-unconsciousness due to liver failure, chronic active hepatitis with hepatic dysfunction plus cirrhosis of the liver</li>
                            <li>In some cases cirrhosis of the liver may undergo malignant changes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nowadays, active immunisation with a hepatitis B vaccine is available. This is given in three doses. The first is followed by a second four weeks later. The third is administered six weeks thereafter.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Hepatitis C</h5>
                        <p>This type of virus has Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) in its nucleus. It causes hepatitis in a similar way to hepatitis B, although the risk to health care workers and sexual transmission is less marked. The main difference however, is its high rate of persistent infection, which increases the likelihood of the patient developing chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver.</p>
                        <p>It has an incubation period of approximately two to 26 weeks from the initial entry of the virus. It is transmitted in the same way as hepatitis B except that both sexual and vertical transmission are quite uncommon. There is no specific mode of prevention. Nursing care is the same as for hepatitis B.</p>

                        <h4 id="tb-malaria-heading">Tuberculosis</h4>
                        <p>Tuberculosis is an infectious respiratory disease, which affects the lungs and is spread by the droplet method. The infection is due to a rod-shaped micro-organism called tubercle bacillus. In some cases the infection may involve other body systems such as the genito-urinary, skeletal, gastro-intestinal or nervous system. Pathologically, it is characterised by an acute or chronic inflammatory process. Many factors predispose to the development of tuberculosis. Children under the age of two years are more susceptible than older ones.</p>
                        <p>Tuberculosis is caused by tubercle bacillus. There are two distinct strains of the tubercle bacillus pathogenic to humans, namely the pulmonary tuberculosis which affects the lungs and the bovine type acquired through the drinking of infected animal milk.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_24_44f5a37382462bcf0be8g-267-1.jpg" alt="A chest X-ray showing signs of pulmonary tuberculosis." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>The pulmonary type of infection makes up to 90% of the total number of patients suffering from tuberculosis. The remaining 10% are extra-pulmonary and this condition affects other body organs as you have seen earlier. Usually for children the most common approach to diagnostic investigations is history-taking, physical examination, including general health status and chest x-ray. A sputum specimen for AFB (acid fast bacilli) may be taken from older children. This is usually done three times. In very young patients, gastric aspirates are examined.</p>
                        <h5>Clinical Features</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>General malaise</li>
                            <li>Prolonged fever</li>
                            <li>Anorexia</li>
                            <li>Weight loss and local signs of infection</li>
                            <li>Chest x-ray film may show radiological changes</li>
                            <li>In some patients, pleural effusion may be present also to include lymphatic nodes enlargement</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Nursing Management</h5>
                        <p>When the diagnosis is confirmed, the parents should be consulted by the nurse and doctor to see whether admission to the ward is necessary or whether the child can be treated as an outpatient. If admitted, the mother should be encouraged to stay and help with the child's care. Nursing care should aim for infection control, bed rest and high protein diet with oral fluid intake. The patient's personal body hygiene should be maintained at all times.</p>
                        <p>If primary drug resistance is suspected, quadruple therapy should be given as initial treatment. Usually the child will be prescribed daily anti-tuberculous drugs, which you should administer continuously for a minimum of six months with at least two drugs. The drugs regimen can be selected from the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rifampicin 10-20 mgs/kg</li>
                            <li>Isoniazid 10 mgs/kg</li>
                            <li>Ethambutal 25 mgs/kg</li>
                            <li>Pyrazinamide 20-35 mgs/kg</li>
                            <li>Streptomycin sulphate 30 mgs/kg</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The dose will be determined according to the child's age and weight. The drugs have to be administered daily in combination to prevent bacterial drug resistance to one particular drug. The drugs are very toxic and so the child should be observed very closely.</p>
                        <h5>Preventive Measures</h5>
                        <p>You should make every effort to prevent the spread of infections, primarily by ensuring that all children have received their BCG vaccination. You should also give health education to members of the community so that the parents may bring their children to the clinic when infection is suspected and also avoid conditions that favour the disease.</p>

                        <h4>Malaria</h4>
                        <p>Malaria is the most common disease in the equatorial regions (tropical and sub-tropical). In some parts of Kenya, malaria is continuously endemic and young children are more susceptible than adults because of lack of resistance.</p>
                        <p>The infection is caused by a parasite called plasmodium and is transmitted from the infected person to an uninfected individual by the female anopheles mosquito bite. The male mosquito does not cause infection. The mosquito bites the infected person, draws blood into its stomach and when it bites the uninfected person it transfers the parasite contained in the blood to the victim.</p>
                        <p>There are four main types of parasites known in medical practice.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Plasmodium Falciparum:</strong> Malignant tertian malaria, which is sometimes referred to as Asian form of malaria</li>
                            <li><strong>Plasmodium Malariae:</strong> Is the species which causes quartan malaria where fever usually occurs within 72 hours after an individual is infected.</li>
                            <li><strong>Plasmodium Ovale:</strong> Which is a species, found predominantly in East and Central Africa.</li>
                            <li><strong>Plasmodium Vivax:</strong> The species causing vivax malaria. This may be found in the Horn of Africa</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All species of plasmodia have the same life cycle.</p>
                        <h5>Life Cycle Within the Human Body</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sporozoites present in the mosquito salivary glands, are injected into the human body, they very quickly circulate to the liver and remain in blood circulation for as long as 30 minutes or so.</li>
                            <li>During the liver or hepatic stage the sporozoite is taken up by the Kupffer cells of the liver then through the liver cells (hepatocyte). Here it develops into Liver Schizont where thousands of merozoites are released into the general blood circulation. This period takes approximately nine to 14 days.</li>
                            <li>In the Erythrocytic (RBC) stage the merozoites released from the liver attack individual Red Blood Cells (RBCs) and there develop inside them from the rings into Schizonts. RBCs are then ruptured by the schizonts releasing merozoites, which then invade the new RBCs. At this stage clinical signs of ill health are manifested.</li>
                            <li>Gametocytes develop at an unknown stage or time in the RBC cycle. The sexual forms, which develop are responsible for the survival and transmission of the parasite. These male and female gametocytes circulate for a few weeks and are taken up by the feeding mosquito.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Life Cycle of the Mosquito</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The male and female gametocytes develop into gametes and then fuse in the stomach of the mosquito to form zygote. These then develop into a mobile ookinete which migrates through the wall of the stomach to form an oocyst.</li>
                            <li>The oocyst matures and later ruptures to release sporozoites.</li>
                            <li>Sporozoites migrate to the salivary glands ready to be injected into the host bloodstream when the mosquito is ready for its next meal.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some people develop immunity to malaria, which occurs as a result of frequent exposure to malarial infections. The immunity may be partial.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Risk Groups</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Children who are under five years of age who have no or little immunity</li>
                            <li>Pregnant women are at risk because the malarial parasites flourish well in their placenta causing abortion or low birth weight and occasionally death of the foetus</li>
                            <li>Those children suffering from sickle cell anaemia may go into sickle cell crisis</li>
                            <li>Travellers or tourists from countries that do not have malaria because they have no immunity</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Clinical Features</h5>
                        <p>Although in adults the symptoms can easily be more specific, in children they are not specific and the infection can be mistaken for other diseases. The following symptoms are acknowledged in most patients:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The child complains of fever and being cold at the same time</li>
                            <li>The body temperature is high while shivering and sweating may be present</li>
                            <li>Nausea, vomiting and headache are common</li>
                            <li>The patient complains of painful joints, backache and general malaise</li>
                            <li>As the red blood cells are broken down, the child becomes anaemic and dizzy and splenomegaly and hepatomegaly may be present</li>
                            <li>The child generally looks sick, mentally disorientated and may display signs of pulmonary and/or cardiovascular symptoms</li>
                            <li>In some cases convulsions, drowsiness and even coma may occur</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Diagnostic Investigation</h5>
                        <p>As a matter of routine, proper and accurate history taking and physical examinations (to include vital signs observation) should make you consider the possibility of malaria. You should take blood slides to the laboratory for malarial parasite analysis. Where facilities for laboratory examinations are lacking, consider starting the child on anti-malarial therapy even if there is no fever.</p>
                        <h5>Nursing Management</h5>
                        <p>It is important that any child presenting with fever and other suspicious symptoms should be admitted into a ward for observation and treatment. Keep the child on bed rest in a well ventilated room then cover with a light cotton bed sheet. The patient's vital signs are taken and recorded two to four hourly. Where the temperature does not respond to anti-malarial therapy, the child should be started on a Dextrose 5% solution alternating with Darrow's solution which may be administered intravenously. In many cases anti-malarial drugs are added into IV infusion. You should attend to the child's personal hygiene, paying special attention to skin and mouth care. A fluid balance chart should be strictly maintained as the child may become dehydrated if not given adequate fluids. As soon as vomiting has ceased, the patient should be given a light, well-balanced diet gradually increasing the amount as their strength returns.</p>
                        <h5>Medical Management</h5>
                        <p>This will vary according to whether the child comes from an endemic area. The use of chloroquine in Kenya has been discouraged because of parasitic resistance to this type of medication. The most favoured drugs now are quinine sulphate, which is administered in a dose of 10 mgs/kg every eight hours orally till the blood is free of the parasites. This is followed by a single dose of sulfadoxine combined with pyrimethamine. Doses of these drugs are calculated according to the child's weight. In severe cases quinine is initially added into the infusion fluid every eight hours. When the child's condition improves, it is then given orally, as syrup.</p>
                        <h5>Possible Complications</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Severe anaemia due to the destruction of red blood cells</li>
                            <li>Dehydration as a result of diarrhoea and/or vomiting</li>
                            <li>Convulsions caused by uncontrolled fever</li>
                            <li>Cerebral dysfunction, which may cause mental disorientation and comatose</li>
                            <li>Renal failure and heart failure</li>
                            <li>Hypoglycaemia</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary oedema</li>
                            <li>Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are many problems that can affect young children. These may either be deliberately or accidentally inflicted by self or others. Whatever the case, you have to be conversant with their management.</p>
                        <h4>Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)</h4>
                        <p>If you find a child that has just collapsed, start resuscitation immediately using the 'ABC' approach.</p>
                        <h5>Sequence of Actions</h5>
                        <p>Before starting this procedure ensure both your safety and the child's. If a child is unresponsive, call for help.</p>
                        <p><strong>A - Airway</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Position the child with head back and hold jaw forward to open the airway. If neck injury is suspected use the jaw thrust method of opening the airway</li>
                            <li>Clear the airway of mucus or vomit with gloved fingers or suction machine if available</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>B - Breathing</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Keeping the airway open, look, listen and feel for breathing, putting your face close to the child's face and looking at the chest of the child</li>
                            <li>If a child is not breathing provide positive pressure ventilation with a bag valve mask with 100% oxygen</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>C - Circulation</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After five ventilations, if no central pulse is felt, start cardiac massage (compression) in infants, use both hands to encircle the chest, thumbs compress the sternum towards backbone about 100 times a minute</li>
                            <li>In older children, use the heel of one hand to press the lower half of the sternum toward the backbone about 100 times a minute with child lying on a firm surface.</li>
                            <li>Combine lung inflation and chest compression at a ratio of 1:5</li>
                            <li>The force of compression should depress the chest by one third of the anterior posterior diameter</li>
                            <li>Continue resuscitation until child shows signs of life or help arrives</li>
                            <li>When more staff arrive to help, the most experienced should lead the team, and the less experienced assist</li>
                            <li>Try to define the cause and treat as appropriate</li>

                        <h4>Acute Convulsions</h4>
                        <p>A convulsion is a spasmodic contraction of muscles. It is a very common problem among children, mostly seen in clinics and outpatient departments.</p>
                        <h5>The Most Common Causes</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Infections such as meningitis</li>
                            <li>Brain abscess</li>
                            <li>Malaria and other febrile conditions, which lead to infections, unrelated to the central nervous system (about 10% of children in the tropics who are seen in hospitals suffer from febrile convulsions)</li>
                            <li>Encephalitis</li>
                            <li>Otitis media</li>
                            <li>Congenital malformation of the central nervous system, especially hydrocephalus as well as encephalopathy post immunisation or acute infectious diseases</li>
                            <li>Metabolic problems such as hypocalcaemia or hypoglycaemia</li>
                            <li>Hypomagnesaemia</li>
                            <li>Water and electrolyte imbalance</li>
                            <li>Toxins which lead to tetanus</li>
                            <li>Inherited metabolic disorders such as phenylketonuria</li>
                            <li>Space occupying lesions like brain abscess, sub-dural haemorrhage/haematoma and brain tumour</li>
                            <li>Post traumatic convulsions which occur several weeks, months or even years following brain injuries</li>
                            <li>Systemic infections like renal diseases</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Diagnostic Investigations</h5>
                        <p>History taking from the mother will ascertain when the convulsion started, the duration of fits and whether it is generalised or localised. A lumbar puncture should be taken to obtain CSF to find out the causative micro-organisms, if any. Blood chemistry tests should be performed to check the electrolyte levels and blood glucose level. Take a brain scan to check for any cerebral lesions. Skull x-rays should also be taken to check for any previous head injury, especially with older children. Blood should be tested for malarial parasites and other micro-organisms in case of septicaemia. Electroencephalography may be ordered in some cases, especially in the case of uncontrollable convulsions. Blood and urine examinations should be conducted to determine ammonia level.</p>
                        <h5>Nursing Management</h5>
                        <p>The child is admitted into a cubicle or side ward in a quiet environment and placed on the bed in a semi-prone position to facilitate the drainage of respiratory secretion and vomiting. Ensure that the airway is clear and the patient is breathing properly. The suction machine should be used whenever necessary. When the respiration becomes irregular, blood gases should be measured and monitored from time to time. The child should be given oxygen whenever they are cyanosed. Should the blood gases persistently be unsatisfactory, the doctor may decide to intubate and connect the patient to intermittent positive pressure ventilator. This is a mechanical method of helping the patient to breathe.</p>
                        <p>Any child with acute convulsions should be regularly observed with the vital signs recorded two hourly initially and gradually phased to four hourly as the condition improves. Due to pyrexia and the resultant sweating, they should be given a nourishing liquid diet and plenty of fluids at regular intervals.</p>
                        <p>A fluid balance chart should be maintained, paying specific attention to the urinary output. Where the patient is unable to take fluids orally, a naso-gastric tube may be inserted and used for feeding. To this end, mouth care is attended to every four hours. In order to prevent pressure sores, you should make every effort to carry out a two hourly change of position in bed. In general, daily skin care is carried out.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Keep a regular record of convulsions, as a means of determining the nature, frequency and duration of attacks. This is a good way of assessing whether the patient's condition is improving or not.</p>

                        <h4>Burns</h4>
                        <p>Small children are quite likely to get burned or scalded, as they often play close to fires and cooking pots and have not learned through experience or are yet to have the wisdom that one should not play with fire. If the burn is widespread, it not only may cause a local problem but systemic complications can occur as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Large amounts of fluids are lost from the burned surface</li>
                            <li>Pain can also contribute to a state of shock</li>
                            <li>Anaemia is caused by blood loss and other causes, and secondary infection can occur</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Clinical Features and Diagnostic Approach</h5>
                        <h6>History Taking</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What caused the burn?</li>
                            <li>When did it occur?</li>
                            <li>Record the date and time when the incident happened</li>
                            <li>Is the child epileptic?</li>
                            <li>What treatment has the child been given?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>A General Examination</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are they shocked?</li>
                            <li>Check the skin on their nose and fingers. If in shock, they will feel cold and will have a weak, thready pulse</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>An Examination of the Burn</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How widespread is the burn? This is done using the diagram showing the different body parts and the percentage given to a burn in a specific area.</li>
                            <li>How deep is the burn? A blister is usually a sign of a superficial burn. Black, charred skin means a deep burn that will need grafting; so does hard skin that feels like leather. Then you must examine for signs of infection (temperature, obvious pus around the burn area).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <h6>First Aid in the Home</h6>
                        <p>If anyone gets a scald from a hot liquid or a burn from a hot object in the home the resulting damage can be minimised if the skin is cooled immediately by dipping in clean, cold water. If this is done a few seconds after the accident, it may be possible to prevent a deep burn developing. But after 10 minutes or more, it is too late. The only thing that can be done is to cover the area with a clean cloth and take the child to the nearest health centre. Do not encourage putting on local medicine, gentian violet, sugar, fat, sodium bicarbonate or anything else. Remember also that if burnt clothes are still in place, they are the best temporary sterile dressing and should not be removed until formal burn dressing is done.</p>
                        <h6>Pain Relief</h6>
                        <p>All patients in pain need pain relief quickly. Give IM pethidine 1 mg/kg p.r.n. or morphine 0.25 mg/kg p.r.n 6-hourly. Paracetamol may be sufficient in mild burns.</p>
                        <h6>Restoration of Fluid Loss</h6>
                        <p>All patients need extra fluid because fluid is lost from the burnt area. Just as in diarrhoeal disease, you may have to give an extra amount on top of the daily fluid requirements. The fluid may be given by mouth or by intravenous drip.</p>
                        <p>You can calculate the total fluid requirements as follows: For children below 10 kg, calculate using 150 ml/kg body weight with a maximum of 1,000 ml less than one year. Breast milk is preferred and if this is known to be sufficient you do not have to calculate at all.</p>
                        <p>If a child is above 10kg, calculate as follows: - For a child between 11 and 20kg: 1,000ml  (50 ml/kg for every kg above 10 kg). For a child above 20kg: 1,500ml plus 20 ml/kg for every kg above 20kg.</p>
                        <p>20 ml/kg has to be added for every 10% of body surface or part burned.</p>

                        <h6>Local Treatment</h6>
                        <p>While the pethidine or morphine is working, gently wash the burned area with warm soapy water, remove any dirt or dead skin and gently dry. For burns of the body, limbs, genitals, face and neck, you want the air to get to the area to dry it out, so use no dressings or medicines. This is called exposure treatment. A bed cradle keeps the bedclothes off the area.</p>
                        <p>For burns of the hands and feet, closed treatment is better. This means that after washing, you put on white petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or Vaseline gauze if you have it, then bandage the limb in a functional position and elevate it on pillows or in a sling. Each finger should be bandaged separately. The burns are soaked in warm, soapy water every day.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Antibacterial Treatment</h6>
                        <p>Although sterile techniques are essential, you cannot prevent the burn from becoming infected, even if broad-spectrum antibiotics are given. You can, however, prevent streptococcal infection which may result in erysipelas, glomerulonephritis or rheumatic fever by giving penicillin (PPF 400,000 units daily). Tetanus prophylaxis is indicated. If not vaccinated, give ATS 1,500 units after testing and start tetanus immunisation. If vaccinated more than two years ago, boost with tetanus toxoid 0.5 ml stat IM.</p>
                        <h6>Treatment of Anaemia</h6>
                        <p>Keep a check once weekly on the haemoglobin. Give a blood transfusion if it falls below 7 g/dl in the first week. Give a course of ferrous sulphate for less severe anaemia.</p>
                        <h6>Transfer to Hospital</h6>
                        <p>Transfer all severe burns to centres with experienced staff and special facilities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Severe Burns</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Extensive burns (more than 25% of body area)</li>
                            <li>Deep burns or burns that have not healed in 14-17 days</li>
                            <li>Flame burns to the face and eyelids</li>
                            <li>Contractures following untreated burns</li>

                        <h4>Poisoning</h4>
                        <p>There are different types of poisoning. Ingested poisoning includes the ingestion of alcohol, organophosphates, kerosene and common drugs, for example, aspirin. Inhaled poisoning may include the inhalation of carbon monoxide, ethanol and organophosphates.</p>
                        <p>Identification of poisoning includes taking a detailed history which includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Examining the drugs available at home or noting drug containers/bottles found nearby</li>
                            <li>Recording the place where ingestion or inhalation took place</li>
                            <li>Analysing any vomitus or urine saved</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Poisons create different effects on the body, which range from symptomatic changes to clinical changes then metabolic changes. These effects include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vomiting and haematemesis</li>
                            <li>Convulsions or involuntary movement</li>
                            <li>Oculogyric spasms</li>
                            <li>Hallucinations and agitation</li>
                            <li>Pupils either dilated or constricted</li>
                            <li>Renal failure</li>
                            <li>Respiratory failure</li>
                            <li>Cardiac failure</li>
                            <li>Hypoglycaemia</li>
                            <li>Metabolic acidosis</li>
                            <li>Stupor/coma</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Management</h5>
                        <p>This will depend on the type of poison taken by the child, the time span since it was taken and the route of intake. Some poisons have antidotes and some do not. Some of the general actions, which can be taken in the management of poisons, include the removal of poisons from the body if these are known. This involves provoking vomiting (emesis) with the fingers for non-corrosive and non-inhalant ingested poisons. Ipecacuanha syrup may be used instead of the above. This is given as a dose of 15 mls stat orally, followed by 200 mls of water. Wait for 15-20 minutes for the patient to vomit. If there is no vomiting, repeat with a dose of 15 mls orally and wait for 20 minutes. If the patient still has not vomited, perform gastric lavage.</p>
                        <p>The blood should be tested for the poisonous substance taken by the child if known and an intravenous infusion using Darrow's solution of 50% Dextrose may be given to correct hypoglycaemia. Oxygen therapy can be administered where necessary. The child should be given oral alkaline fluids to neutralise the acid and vice versa. Urinary catheterisation is indicated in order to monitor urinary output when renal failure is suspected.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Kerosene (Paraffin) Poisoning</h5>
                        <p>Young children often drink kerosene by accident. It is kept in the houses as fuel for lamps or primus stoves and is often kept in an old juice, soda or beer bottle. A child will usually not drink more than a mouthful because of the unpleasant taste.</p>
                        <h6>Clinical Features</h6>
                        <p>The main danger lies in aspiration into the lungs, causing bronchopneumonia. For this reason, vomiting is dangerous and should never be induced. The kerosene also can cause acute pulmonary oedema. Another immediate effect may be coma due to narcotic effect of kerosene.</p>
                        <h6>Management</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not induce vomiting and do not wash out the stomach</li>
                            <li>Give 5 ml of milk of magnesia as a laxative instead</li>
                            <li>Pneumonia is such a common complication that it pays to start pneumonia treatment immediately</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Insecticide Poisoning (Parathion, Malathion)</h5>
                        <p>Contact with these poisons causes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tremors of the muscles</li>
                            <li>Sweating</li>
                            <li>Copious secretion of the saliva</li>
                            <li>Pinpoint pupils</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the later stages it causes: Convulsions, Coma and/or paralysis.</p>
                        <p>The pinpoint pupils can help you make this diagnosis and guide you in the treatment. The treatment consists of first washing the child with soap and water, if there has been skin exposure, then giving them very large doses of atropine intramuscularly - in children under five, 0.5 mg and in older children 1 mg atropine sulphate IM every 15-30 minutes, until the pupils become wide.</p>
                        <aside class="callout warning">
                            <p>Note that these dangerously high doses of atropine are indicated only in a serious case of confirmed insecticide poisoning. Referral may then be done if appears necessary.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h5>Preventive Measures</h5>
                        <p>Children at the age of five years and below should always be protected from injuries or accidental poisoning wherever they may be. After the age of five years they are educated to distinguish between what is right and wrong and dangerous. Adults, especially parents, should not experiment the use of certain substances in the presence of children because children are bound to try and imitate them. You should find out from the parents how the accidental poisoning occurred in order to give the correct and effective health education on the topic. All petroleum products should be kept safely locked and in their correct containers. All drugs in the home should be securely locked away out of children's reach. Parents should always be given health education on preventive measures, the dangers of poisoning and first aid measures to be taken in case of poisoning for their children.</p>

                        <h4>Child Abuse/Neglect</h4>
                        <p>Health care workers especially doctors, nurses and social workers must be on the lookout at all times during their clinical practice for signs of child abuse or neglect. Although these problems are known to exist in the world, incidence has increased in terms of numbers and frequency. Additionally, societies have become more open and it is now easier to expose cases of child abuse than ever before. The media have been increasingly vocal in pointing out incidents of child abuse.</p>
                        <h5>Basic Children's Rights</h5>
                        <p>The United Nations has come up with a list of basic children's rights, which should be observed and protected, by all world member countries. They are summarised as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The right to live</li>
                            <li>The right to acquire a name and nationality</li>
                            <li>The right to enjoy parental care</li>
                            <li>The right to proper food and health care</li>
                            <li>The right to education</li>
                            <li>The right to be protected from all kinds of harm</li>
                            <li>The right to moral upbringing</li>
                            <li>The right to a culture</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h5>Types of Child Abuse and Neglect</h5>
                        <p>There are different types of child abuse and neglect, including physical abuse, neglect and abandonment, sexual abuse, emotional and psychological abuse. Nutritional abuse can well be incorporated within one of the first four. These abuses may occur singly or in combination.</p>
                        <h6>Physical Abuse (battered baby syndrome or battered child syndrome)</h6>
                        <p>This is the most common form of child abuse, which is easily recognised by health care workers and lay persons alike. The child displays non-accidental injuries on their body. The majority of victims in this group are infants or pre-school children. About 60-70% are below three years old in Europe and America, while in Africa the age goes up to five years. The child's behaviour is abnormal, demanding too much attention, behaving aggressively or withdrawn. The child may have a chronic illness or be physically disabled. Some of these children may belong to single mothers who had unwanted or unplanned pregnancies and are unable to cope with the strains of motherhood.</p>
                        <p>Various types of injuries may be observed. These include burns, cigarette burns, cuts, bruises, lacerations, fractures and bites. Some of these injuries may be in the healing stage while others may be fresh. This is an indication of repeatedly inflicted injuries. Injuries are predominantly seen in the genital areas, buttocks, back, limbs, face. Ruptured internal abdominal organs and fractured skull may also be identified.</p>
                        <p>Once child abuse is detected or suspected, the child should be removed to a safer environment and involve the health care worker and children's departments. The child needs to be hospitalised in order to undergo a thorough physical and mental assessment to detect other previous injuries that may have been sustained. This detection is necessary in case of legal action being taken against the person who inflicted the injuries on the child.</p>
                        <p>When a child is admitted to hospital, an x-ray, physical examination, medical or surgical treatment should be carried out as appropriate. The parents or guardians will require counselling especially if they are the ones causing injury to the child. The child's nutritional status should be improved before being transferred to a children's home or a foster home. These transfers are usually undertaken with the approval of the court of law, the Children's Department and Probation Office.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h6>Child Neglect and Abandonment</h6>
                        <p>In African societies, this problem was unheard of until a few decades ago. This problem has been brought about by social changes, which have led to the gradual erosion of extended family ties. Children who are abandoned are usually malnourished and may have other diseases as a result of low resistance to infection.</p>
                        <p>A great number of factors have contributed to this social problem in developing countries. Often both parents are economically unable to meet their basic needs due to poverty. Additionally, some children are brought up by single parents, who may not be able to earn enough to support their family. Perhaps the problem originates from the death of a spouse or a divorce, which leaves the remaining partner unable to provide for the family.</p>
                        <p>The children of physically and mentally handicapped mothers may be abandoned if they are unable to cope with the demands of motherhood. In certain conditions, a child may be separated from the mother for a prolonged period as a result of imprisonment. Similar problems may also be noted when a mother is an alcoholic.</p>
                        <h6>Management of Neglected and Abandoned Children</h6>
                        <p>A child needs love, accommodation and food. You should make an effort to provide these in the health care facility while arrangements are being made to provide a suitable home for the child outside the hospital environment. Apart from these, medical treatment is provided as appropriate.</p>
