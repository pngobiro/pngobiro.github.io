                        <p>In this unit you will cover the basic concepts of research, which will include definition, purpose, and contribution of research in the nursing profession. You will also look at the research process, which includes the identification of a researchable topic and developing appropriate research objectives, hypothesis and questions as well as a review of literature that is relevant to your research topic and the research methodology. It also includes data collection, analysis and writing the research report. You will also look at how to develop and implement a research proposal.</p>
                        <h3>This unit is composed of four sections and an assignment:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Section One: Concepts and Contribution of Research.</li>

                        <p>Research is an essential part of the nursing profession. This is because you will not only use it in the planning, implementation and evaluation of your patient's care, but also in the organisation and improvement of the entire health care service countrywide. After covering this unit you will be in a better position to appreciate the significance of research in nursing.</p>
                        <h3>Unit Objectives</h3>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>In this section you will acquire the basic concepts of research in general, and with specific reference to the nursing profession. The section will cover the definition of research, nursing research, why nurses need to do research and the significance of research in the nursing profession. You will learn how to develop a research topic. It will also cover the ethical and legal issues to consider when carrying out research.</p>
                        <h4>Objectives</h4>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Define the terms 'research' and 'nursing research'.</li>
                            <li>Identify the scope of research in nursing.</li>
                            <li>Explain the significance of research to the nursing profession.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Definition of Research</h3>
                        <p>There are several ways to define the word 'research'. For instance, Treece and Treece (1982, cited in Cormack) define research in its broadest sense as an attempt to gain solutions to problems.</p>
                        <p>More precisely, it is the collection of data in a rigorously controlled situation for the purpose of prediction or explanation. Some writers argue that this definition is not adequate since not all researchers will be finding solutions to problems. Neither does all research need to be carried out in a rigorously controlled situation such as in a laboratory. This is just an indication for you to appreciate how difficult it is to get one single definition of the word 'research'.</p>
                        <h4>Scientific Definition of Research</h4>
                        <p>According to Burns and Grove (1999: 3), the word 'research' means 'to search again' or 'to examine carefully'. More specifically, research is diligent, systematic inquiry or study to validate and refine existing knowledge and develop new knowledge. This definition indicates some of the functions of research. It further explains the word 'research' in its literal use and its scientific use at the same time. Take for instance, the terms 'search again' or 'examine carefully'. This means the researcher (the person carrying out the research) has to search for the facts over and over again. They have to re-examine all facts at hand carefully.</p>
                        <p>Similarly as Burns and Grove (1999) indicate 'diligence' and 'systematic study' will include certain activities, such as planning, organisation and persistence. Research is meant to validate, that is, prove or disprove existing knowledge or information. For instance, if a certain nursing practice is to be evaluated, then a researcher will need to investigate it and see whether the specific practice is still relevant or needs modification. It is also important to note that in research 'the systematic study' must use the scientific process.</p>
                        <h4>Definition of Nursing Research</h4>
                        <p>Having covered and defined the term 'research', it is now important for you to define 'nursing research'. As with the definition of research, there is no single definition for nursing research, either. However, for the purposes of this unit, you will use the following definition by Cormark (1991:5), which states that nursing research is defined as research into those aspects of professional activity, which are predominantly and appropriately the concern and responsibility of nurses.</p>
                        <p>As indicated here, research can be nursing research only when it addresses issues that are relevant to the nursing profession. If the topic is not going to have an impact on the nursing practice, it is not nursing research. Thus, it is important to understand that in order to define your research as nursing research; your study must be geared towards improving certain aspects of the nursing practice, education and administration.</p>
                        <p>However, this does not mean that nurses cannot venture into other non-nursing research. Nurses can undertake any type of research but if they would like to carry out nursing research, then the study should be relevant to the nursing profession.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Nature and Scope of Research in Nursing</h3>
                        <p>Now that you have identified a general definition of research and a specific definition of nursing research, your next step is to find out what nursing research entails and whether nurses really need to do research.</p>
                        <p>In module one, you covered professionalism in nursing. You learnt that for a profession to be recognised, it must have its own knowledge base. You might have also learnt that a large portion of knowledge in nursing is either borrowed from other professions or is based on traditions, beliefs and instincts that, for the most part, have not been validated by empirical studies.</p>
                        <p>In order for the nursing profession to have its own body of knowledge, its professional practice must be based on a sound knowledge developed through scientific research. The knowledge base should come from the various aspects of nursing education, nursing management, nursing practice or from general nursing experience. Nursing research is not an old subject even though nurses have made tremendous achievements in the area in the last few decades.</p>
                        <p>Initially, nursing research in the early part of the $20^{th}$ century concentrated on nursing education and the role of nursing and nurses. However, as nurses became aware and acquainted themselves with the importance of research, there has been an increased number of studies targeted at clinical nursing problems (Burns & Grove, 1999). This started in the 1970s and to-date clinical oriented research problems continue to be the main focus of research for nurses. The importance of nurses' involvement in research is that it enhances the development of the knowledge base of the nursing profession. Research findings aim to develop and refine scientific knowledge for use in practice (Burns & Grove, 1999). Thus, while nursing research is mainly concerned with investigating areas of significance to the nursing profession, it is nonetheless, limited to nursing and nurses although they are at liberty to engage in research on non-nursing areas.</p>

                        <h3>Significance and Contribution of Nursing Research</h3>
                        <p>You have already learnt some of the benefits of nursing research in the previous sections. A brief description of the purposes of nursing research has been outlined by Cormack (1992:7) among others.</p>
                        <p>The purposes of nursing research include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developing scientific, evidence based reasons for nursing activities.</li>
                            <li>Finding ways of increasing the cost-effectiveness of nursing activities.</li>
                            <li>Providing a basis for standards setting and quality assurance.</li>
                            <li>Providing evidence in support of demands for resources in nursing.</li>
                            <li>Barring and defending a professional status for nursing.</li>
                            <li>Focusing on priority problems that affect the nursing profession.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The points in the previous page elaborate the purposes of nursing research, but lead you to ask why research is such an important component of the nursing profession. In answering this question, you can look at some suggestions offered by some nursing researchers. A good example is Burns & Grove (1999), who state that nursing research helps in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describing certain nursing observations (phenomenon).</li>
                            <li>Explaining certain nursing practices, for instance, the relationship between specific variables (characteristics or attributes).</li>
                            <li>Predicting the outcome of nursing activities undertaken by nurses and other health workers.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p>When describing types of research, researchers use several methods of classification. According to UNISA (2000: 83), research can be classified as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Categories, that is, what the study is to be used for.</li>
                            <li>Methodological approaches, which includes the research approaches that the researcher intends to adapt in the course of the study.</li>
                            <li>Aims of the study, including what the study aims at achieving.</li>
                            <li>The time dimension referring to the time factor of the study, that is, is the study a 'one off' case or one that will take months or even years.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In broad terms, research can be classified into qualitative and quantitative researchapproaches.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe the qualitative research approach</li>
                            <li>Describe the quantitative research approach</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Qualitative Methods</h3>
                        <p>According to Burns and Grove (1999:338), qualitative research is 'a systematic, subjective approach used to describe life experiences and give them meaning'. It focuses on the whole issue under investigation, which is in line with the holistic approach the nursing profession advocates for in patient care. As you will see in the table below, there are major distinguishing features between qualitative and quantitative research types. Qualitative research is a type of research where the data collected is in the form of words rather than numbers. The data collected from this type of research is then grouped into categories, themes and patterns (Maalim, 1999).</p>

                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Incorporates logistic, deductive reasoning.</td>
                                        <td>Inductive and dialectic reasoning are predominant.</td>
                                    </tr>
                                </tbody>
                            </table>
                        </div>
                        <p>The data from qualitative research is usually collected through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Observation, that is, a participant observer or a non participant observer.</li>
                            <li>Focus group discussions.</li>
                            <li>Face to face interviews.</li>
                            <li>Posted or self administered questionnaires.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Qualitative research can further be sub divided into several categories including historical, case studies, observations, and rapid rural appraisal (which is a more recent innovative approach used in participatory research).</p>
                        <p>You will now look at each of these categories in more detail.</p>
                        <h4>Historical Research</h4>
                        <p>This is a type of qualitative research that attempts to describe and learn from the past. This type of research is mainly used by social scientists. Historical research is a descriptive type of research where the investigator attempts to record and describe, in a sequential manner, the events under investigation. The findings are then presented in the fullest possible picture. A good example is where a nurse may investigate the historical development of nursing in Kenya and show the events and trends associated with the profession in Kenya.</p>
                        <p>Historical research has the advantage of teaching us about the past so as to put the problems of today into their proper context. However, when doing historical research, it is important that the researcher plans properly, laying out clear objectives to ensure that they are not overwhelmed by the large amount of materials, losing track of the study. In the recent past, many nurse researchers have ventured into this type of research and produced important results.</p>
                        <h4>Case Study</h4>
                        <p>Another type of a qualitative research method is the case study. A case study is defined as 'an in-depth investigation of an individual, group, institution or phenomena' (Mugenda & Mugenda, 1999: 173). According to Moore (1988) case studies are used when narrowing the research focus into fewer units or increasing the range of units within the study.</p>
                        <p>Case studies are commonly used when the investigator is attempting to understand complex phenomena, or the various causes and effects of a certain phenomenon. This is one of the most common research methods used by nurses. Case studies have the advantage of requiring minimal resources when compared with other types of research. Case studies also provide a means of looking in depth at complex situations. At the same time, there are certain limitations associated with case studies, which researchers need to be aware of. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Results from case studies cannot be statistically validated because no sampling strategy is involved.</li>
                            <li>Case studies can be time consuming, particularly when looking into complex long term issues or phenomena.</li>
                            <li>Case studies are more susceptible to the 'Hawthorne effect', where the research process influences the study outcome.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA)</h4>
                        <p>A third type of qualitative research is referred to as Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA). This is an innovative research method used for collecting data in participatory research. This approach emphasises the need for the researcher to acknowledge and appreciate that local research respondents have the knowledge and skills to be partners in the research process (Maalim, 1999). In RRA, both the researcher and the respondents collaborate and learn from each other, getting possible solutions for the research questions (Rifkin, 1996). RRA is important for generating data from the local community such as disease patterns which they (community members) are quite familiar with. There are many RRA tools and techniques for data collection but the following are some of the more common ones.</p>
                        <h5>Mapping</h5>
                        <p>This is drawing of sketch maps by the research respondents to identify the comparative location and importance of different resources within the research area. This may include health facilities, social amenities and infrastructure like roads, transport and means of communication (Maalim, 1999).</p>
                        <h5>Daily Schedules</h5>
                        <p>This involves outlining the daily activities of community members. Daily schedules are used to identify daily labour patterns and other activities (Jones, 1996:2). This tool enables the researcher to identify and discuss the daily workloads of the community members according to individuals, gender and seasons.</p>
                        <h5>Venn Diagrams</h5>
                        <p>This is the use of circles to indicate the relationships, importance and interactions between individuals and institutions within the research areas. Usually the respondents draw circles of varying sizes. The size of the circle and the distance from the centre indicate the importance of the institution, for example a health centre, to the respondent.</p>
                        <h5>Seasonal Calendars</h5>
                        <p>As the name suggests, this tool is used for gaining information from the research respondents concerning seasonal variations in patterns concerning certain issues of interest. This tool could, for example, enable the researcher to gather data on disease patterns according to the seasons.</p>

                        <h3>Quantitative Methods</h3>
                        <p>Having covered qualitative research as one of the major research types, you will now look at quantitative research. Burns & Grove (1999:23) defined quantitative research as a 'formal, objective, rigorous, systematic process for generating information about the world', with respect to populations' dynamics, characteristics and phenomenon.</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that, for many years, the quantitative research method has been the preferred method by nurse researchers. This was primarily because, in the early days, quantitative research was seen as the only recognised research or, as it was then called, 'the scientific method'. However, this no longer is the case as researchers have now understood that qualitative research is as important as, and complementary to, quantitative research methods. Researchers now appreciate that the selection of either quantitative or qualitative research types depends on many factors, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The issue (phenomenon) under investigation.</li>
                            <li>The aims and objectives of the research.</li>
                            <li>The state of existing knowledge.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>At the same time, many researchers now acknowledge that 'although qualitative research and quantitative research do differ, they can also, in specific areas, complement each other' (Grobbelaar 2000: 91).</p>
                        <p>Quantitative research is also subdivided into several types, which you will now cover in detail.</p>
                        <h4>Descriptive Research</h4>
                        <p>Descriptive research is 'the exploration and description of a phenomenon in real-life situations' (Burns & Grove 1999: 24). It involves the systematic collection and presentation of data to give a clear picture of a particular situation. A good example of descriptive study is a survey. Descriptive research also involves the systematic collection of information and aims to explore and describe new facts about a situation, people, activities or events. Descriptive research is important in nursing for the following reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assists in the development of new knowledge.</li>
                            <li>Forms the basis for future research.</li>
                            <li>Generates questions and hypotheses for further experimental study.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In descriptive research, the main focus is the investigation of existing practices, beliefs and attitudes held by people or investigating current trends of nursing</p>
                        <h4>Experimental Research</h4>
                        <p>This is one of the most complex and important research types. It is also commonly used in clinical settings because of its accuracy and reliability. Experimental research has, for several decades, been referred to as the true or scientific research because of its strict adherence to the three major characteristics of control, manipulation and randomisation.</p>
                        <p>A major difference between experimental and non experimental research types that you as a research student need to note is that, in experimental research, the researcher is the active agent rather than remaining a passive observer (Polit and Hungler, 1999). According to Burnard and Morrison (1990: 30), the major distinction between experimental and descriptive research types include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Descriptive research merely describes something, whereas experimental research tests a hypothesis.</li>
                            <li>Researchers can control variables in experimental research but cannot do this with descriptive research.</li>
                            <li>Descriptive research may not have control of the study subjects but experimental research has full control of the subjects under study.</li>
                            <li>Experimental research can lead to predictions but descriptive research may not.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Many times, experimental research is subdivided into 'true experimental' and quasi-experimental'. The true experimental definition refers to the method you have just covered. You will now look at quasi-experimental research.</p>
                        <h4>Quasi-experimental Research</h4>
                        <p>This is a type of quantitative research whose purpose is to examine causal relationships or to determine the effects of one variable on another (Burns & Grove, 1999). Quasi-experimental studies involve implementing a specific treatment and then later examining the effects of this treatment using selected methods of measurement. Quasi-experimental study is a type of intervention study.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of quasi-experimental study is to examine causality. Quasi-experimental designs are developed in order to provide alternative means of examining causality in situations not conducive to experimental control.</p>

                        <h3>Classification of Research</h3>
                        <p>Research can be classified based on duration of study. There are two main types of research studies, these are longitudinal and cross sectional studies.</p>
                        <h4>Longitudinal Studies</h4>
                        <p>These are the types of studies that are conducted over a long duration of time. A good example is the cohort study where individuals having a characteristic of interest (exposure) are followed over a duration of time. During the time of study the subjects are observed to see if they develop an outcome of interest.</p>
                        <h4>Cross Sectional Studies</h4>
                        <p>These are the studies that are conducted over a short duration of time, for example, a few weeks. Unlike the longitudinal studies they tend to be relatively cheaper. They are initiated where results are required as a matter of urgency.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>In this section, you will learn about the 'research process'; a very important and significant section of research, and indeed the kingpin of the whole research topic. Included in this section, is a study of 'the steps' involved in the research process.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <h3>The Research Process</h3>
                        <p>It is important to appreciate that the various steps of the research process are not delineated from each other as such, but indeed cyclical in nature, whereby one step leads to the other for its effectiveness. Likewise, it is important to note that researchers have greatly differed in their estimate of the number of steps the research process should consist of. Most researchers have given steps ranging in number from between ten to sixteen.</p>
                        <p>Despite the large difference in the number of steps that should constitute the research process, the majority of researchers do agree on four general phases of the research process. Brink (1996:56) listed the following four phases as being key to the research process</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The conceptual phase, also called the thinking or planning phase.</li>
                            <li>The empirical phase, also called the doing phase.</li>
                            <li>The interpretive phase, or the phase where the researcher looks at the meaning of it all.</li>
                            <li>The communication phase or the phase of writing and disseminating the research report.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You will now further sub-divide these phases into ten steps for the purpose of your study and look at each step in detail.</p>
                        <h4>Step One: Identification of a Research Topic</h4>
                        <p>Having identified some of the characteristics of good nursing research, you need also to learn how to identify a researchable topic. For a researcher to identify a good research topic they will require first to list down some of the topics or problems that need to be investigated. It is important to put this in order of priority and then analyse each topic or problem individually.</p>
                        <p>A research problem is an issue that requires a solution. It could, for instance, involve looking at why certain things are done the way they are done and not the other way round. In actual fact, a research problem endeavours to answer or address a specific problem or situation. In nursing research the issue that needs to be addressed should be one related to the nursing profession.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_17_3583984e402c7f81e884g-082-1.jpg" alt="A flowchart diagram of the research process, starting with 'Identification of a Research Topic' and proceeding through the various steps like formulation, literature review, methodology, data collection, analysis, and reporting." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>The Research Process</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>You will note that your research starts with the identification of a research problem, which you feel is serious and important enough for you to spend your time researching. This research problem then becomes your research topic and will become the title of your research paper.</p>
                        <h5>What are some of the criteria you should look for when identifying a research topic?</h5>
                        <p>There are certain characteristics or criteria that a good research topic in nursing should possess to ensure that the study is relevant not only to the nursing practice but also to the entire health care delivery system.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improve nursing services by contributing to more knowledge and better skills.</li>
                            <li>Enhance existing knowledge by filling in gaps that exist.</li>
                            <li>Encourage more research on already existing nursing theories.</li>
                            <li>Address current concerns or priority areas in nursing.</li>
                            <li>Pay more attention to ethical issues (this will be discussed in detail later).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition to this, the researcher undertaking the study should have the necessary knowledge and skills. They should also be accorded the necessary resources such as money, manpower, materials and access to the research subjects.</p>
                        <p>These characteristics are of great significance to the researcher because when adhered to, they ensure that the study is well defined and hence feasible to undertake. It is important to point out that this list is not exhaustive and, as you progress with your research readings, you will learn to identify other important characteristics that a good research topic should have.</p>
                        <h5>How can you identify an appropriate research topic?</h5>
                        <p>Interestingly, among all researchers there is no way to find a researchable topic without having experienced the problem or read about it. It is obvious that, one way or the other, there must be a need/problem that the researcher has experienced and hence feels the need to seek a solution to. It is also possible that research topics are usually derived from problems, but at times, point the way towards making certain changes or modifications from an existing situation.</p>
                        <p>According to Collins et al (2000), there are three major possible areas that researchers may draw on for their research topics. A researcher may draw research topics from:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Existing professional knowledge and experience. It is highly possible that in the course of your work, you have faced several questions that you would like to find answers for. This is indeed the most common source of an appropriate research topic.</li>
                            <li>Socially significant issues, that is, the research topic has practical relevance and significance to the society. Here, you as the researcher have to identify the implications of the study to the society. For instance, the study could be in a position to solve an existing and pressing social problem. You as the nurse in-charge of a health centre might have realised that since the introduction of cost-sharing exercises, not many of the low income members of the community are coming for treatment to the health centre. You may decide to find out why and propose a solution to the problem.</li>
                            <li>The study must have scientific relevance and significance as well. It is important to show that the research will, at the end, have academic and/or scientific relevance. This could be used for improving or modifying patients' care.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Therefore, when identifying a possible research topic, look at some of the above factors or others that you think are important for the relevance of your study.</p>
                        <h4>Step Two: Formulation of Research Objectives, Hypothesis and Questions</h4>
                        <p>In this step, you shall learn how to formulate research objectives and research questions. So far you have learnt how to identify a researchable topic. You have also learnt about the different methods of research and their divisions. In this section of the research process you are aiming to 'describe the formulation of research objectives and research questions'.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_17_3583984e402c7f81e884g-083-1.jpg" alt="A diagram highlighting 'Formulation of Research Objectives, Hypothesis and Questions' as the second step in the research process flowchart." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <h5>What is a research objective?</h5>
                        <p>A research objective is a clear, concise, declarative, statement expressed to direct a study. It focuses on identification and description of variables and/or determination of the relationships among variables. Research objectives and questions are important for several reasons. Research objectives help to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bridge the gap between the research purpose and the study design.</li>
                            <li>Guide on planning for data collection and analysis.</li>
                            <li>Summarise what is to be achieved by the study.</li>
                            <li>Build a close link with the statement of the problem.</li>
                            <li>Keep the researcher within the scope of study by defining the area of focus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Research objectives are sub-divided into broad and specific objectives. When formulating good research objectives, the objectives should have the following characteristics, using the acronym 'SMART'.</p>
                        <h5>What do you understand by the acronym 'SMART'?</h5>
                        <p>The acronym SMART stands for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>S</strong> - Specific</li>
                            <li><strong>M</strong> - Measurable</li>
                            <li><strong>A</strong> - Achievable</li>
                            <li><strong>R</strong> - Realistic</li>
                            <li><strong>T</strong> - Time bound</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Example of a SMART Objective</strong></p>
                        <p>To establish the number of children born at home within the last two years in Ganga village.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Specific - Establishing prevalence of home deliveries in Ganga village</li>
                            <li>Measurable - Number of children</li>
                            <li>Achievable - The task is achievable</li>
                            <li>Realistic - The task is realistic</li>
                            <li>Time bound - In the last two years</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Example of a Non SMART Objective</strong></p>
                        <p>To find out the level of home deliveries.</p>
                        <p>The objective is neither specific, measurable, achievable nor realistic. It has also not set out the time frame.</p>
                        <p>This means the research objective should be specific, in that, it clearly identifies the item at hand for investigation. The objective should also be 'measurable' by being quantifiable. A good objective should be 'achievable' and 'realistic' so that the researcher is able to acquire the set objectives on time (time bound) in form of human, financial and material resources.</p>
                        <p>Once the researcher has formulated appropriate objectives, the next move is to formulate relevant research question(s). It is important to understand that without a clearly and well-defined research question, it will be difficult to complete the research process. Sometimes inexperienced researchers find it difficult to formulate questions. Questions can be derived from:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your working experience (professional experience).</li>
                            <li>Literature search you are undertaking.</li>
                            <li>Theoretical frameworks on nursing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is important to ensure that the research questions are 'good research questions'. One way of doing this is to use the acronym 'FINER'. The acronym 'FINER' stands for the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>F</strong> - Feasible, allowing one to appreciate the practical limitations.</li>
                            <li><strong>I</strong> - Interesting, sustaining the research process.</li>
                            <li><strong>N</strong> - Novel, able to provide new findings</li>
                            <li><strong>E</strong> - Ethical.</li>
                            <li><strong>R</strong> - Relevant, advancing science or influencing clinical care, health care policy among others.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Example of a FINER Research Question</strong></p>
                        <p>Do nurses in Kalala hospital practice the hand washing procedure as stipulated by the hospital infection control handbook?</p>
                        <p><strong>Example of a non FINER Research Question</strong></p>
                        <p>Are nurses washing hands?</p>
                        <p>In general, the formulation of a research question assists the researcher to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Focus on the study by narrowing it down to the essentials</li>
                            <li>Avoid collection of data that are not necessary</li>
                            <li>Organise the study in clearly defined parts or phases</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Hypothesis of the Study</h5>
                        <p>Having defined and understood the research objectives and research questions, the other concept that you may need to develop during your research is the research hypothesis because not all research is tenable to hypothesis testing, hence some research may include hypotheses while others will not.</p>
                        <p>Most of the descriptive studies do not have a hypothesis to test but they generate hypothesis. Experimental studies have hypothesis to test.</p>
                        <h6>What is a hypothesis?</h6>
                        <p>Brink (1996:91) defines a hypothesis as 'the formulation of the expected relationship between two or more variables in a specific population'. It is the researcher's prediction or explanation of the relationships between two variables. For example:</p>
                        <blockquote>Persons with Type II diabetes mellitus who have greater knowledge of their diseases will have a higher rate of adherence to treatment regimen than those with less knowledge.</blockquote>
                        <p>In the example given, the predicted relationship is between 'knowledge' and 'adherence to treatment regimen'. Hypotheses are applied in quantitative studies in order to guide the study, for example, quasi-experimental and experimental studies. A hypothesis is usually tested and, subsequently either rejected or fail to be rejected by the researcher. The hypothesis helps the study in suggesting prediction, explaining outcome and in guiding the investigation to provide a focus.</p>
                        <h6>What are some of the types of hypotheses?</h6>
                        <p>There are various types of hypotheses.</p>
                        <p><strong>Directional Hypothesis</strong></p>
                        <p>A directional hypothesis predicts an outcome in a specific direction. One example is the hypothesis given, which stated that: Persons with Type II diabetes mellitus and have greater knowledge of their diseases will have a higher rate of adherence to treatment regimen than those with less knowledge.</p>
                        <p><strong>Non Directional Hypothesis</strong></p>
                        <p>This indicates there is a difference or correlation but does not specify which. For example: Persons with Type II diabetes mellitus who follow a structured programme on their condition have a higher rate of adherence to treatment. This does not indicate a directional relationship.</p>
                        <p><strong>Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Null hypothesis (denoted as H<sub>0</sub>) The null (statistical) hypothesis is used for statistical testing and interpretation. It states no difference exists between groups or no correlations between variables.</li>
                            <li>Alternative hypothesis (denoted as H<sub>1</sub>) This is the alternate hypothesis. It states that there is a difference or correlation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>Variables</h5>
                        <h6>What is a variable?</h6>
                        <p>As you may have observed, when looking at the research questions and research hypothesis, reference was made several times to the term 'variables'. You, therefore, need to define what a variable is. Variables are defined as quality, properties or characteristics of persons, things or situation that change or vary. For example: sex (male and female) age (20-25, 26-30 years) academic success, stress and pain. There are four main types of variables that you may come across as a research student.</p>
                        <p><strong>Independent Variable (Treatment or Experimental Variable)</strong></p>
                        <p>This is a variable that influences other variables. It is perceived as contributing to or enabling a particular outcome. It is the intervention or treatment that the researcher performs to see the resulting change in the dependant variable. It is also referred to as the input.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dependent Variable</strong></p>
                        <p>This is the outcome variable. It reflects the effects (outcome) or response to the independent variable. The dependent variable is the variable that appears, disappears, diminishes or increases. For example, to determine the effects of salt intake on hypertension, the blood pressure is the dependant variable and salt intake is the independent variable.</p>
                        <p><strong>Extraneous Variables</strong></p>
                        <p>These are uncontrolled variables that influence the findings of the research study. They influence both the dependent and independent variables. These are called threats to internal and external validity of the study and may bias the selection, the time factor, and the instrument used.</p>
                        <p><strong>Demographic Variables</strong></p>
                        <p>As the name suggests these are demographic attributes. They are variables that cannot be manipulated or influenced by the researcher, for example, age, sex religious beliefs or educational level.</p>
                        <h4>Step Three: Rationale or Justification of the Research Problem</h4>
                        <p>The words 'rationale' and 'justification' are commonly used interchangeably. This is the section of the study that outlines reasons for carrying out the study. Justifications of the study should address some of the following questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What gaps in knowledge will the study address?</li>
                            <li>Why is the study important?</li>
                            <li>What will the study contribute to the society?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_17_3583984e402c7f81e884g-086-1.jpg" alt="A diagram highlighting 'Rationale or Justification of the Research Problem' as the third step in the research process flowchart." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>The Research Process</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the significance of the study addresses questions like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How will the results be used?</li>
                            <li>Who will benefit from the results?</li>
                            <li>Is the study worth it?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is important to state the justification convincingly so as to rationalise the utilisation of resources such as time, money materials and manpower. The rationale of the study should describe the utility and importance of the problem in health care services in general and the nursing profession in particular.</p>
                        <h4>Step Four: Literature Review</h4>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_17_3583984e402c7f81e884g-086-2.jpg" alt="A diagram highlighting 'Literature Review' as the fourth step in the research process flowchart." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>The Research Process</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <h5>What do you understand by the term 'literature review'?</h5>
                        <p>According to by Burns and Grove (1999: 469), 'literature review is a summary of theoretical and empirical sources to generate a picture of what is known and not known about a particular problem'.</p>
                        <p>Literature review involves more than reading through articles in a journal or research paper. As Mugenda and Mugenda (1999) state, it entails the systematic identification, location and analysis of documents containing information related to the research problem being investigated. In fact, the process of literature review should start with identifying and locating the library, identifying sources and locating the sources.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_17_3583984e402c7f81e884g-087-1.jpg" alt="A photo of a person conducting research in a library, surrounded by books and journals, illustrating the process of literature review." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>The main purposes of literature review should be to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Determine what has been done already as regards the research problem under investigation.</li>
                            <li>Identify strategies, procedures and measuring instruments that have been found useful in the investigation of the research problem.</li>
                            <li>Help make the researcher familiar with previous studies and thus facilitate the interpretation of the study.</li>
                            <li>Help the researcher to narrow the research topic.</li>
                            <li>Help determine new approaches and stimulate new ideas.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When reviewing any literature, the researcher needs to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of past work on the subject</li>
                            <li>Report any inconsistent findings</li>
                            <li>Identify gaps in the knowledge</li>
                            <li>Determine the contribution of proposed study</li>
                            <li>Consider the possibility of unintentional duplication</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the search for literature, there are two major sources of information where the investigator can get relevant literature. These are known as primary and secondary sources. You shall cover each of these sources individually.</p>
                        <h5>Primary Source</h5>
                        <p>This is the work written by the person who is actually involved in, or is responsible for, the generation of the idea published. It can also be information from a person who actually observed or witnessed the occurrence under investigation. The person who conducts empirical research and publishes it in a journal is usually regarded as the primary source of information. When searching for literature, it is important to rely more on primary sources as these give first hand information.</p>
                        <h5>Secondary Source</h5>
                        <p>A secondary source involves summaries or quoted content from a primary source. This type of work is usually a paraphrase of the primary source. Often, it does not give the correct interpretation of the primary sources. It is usually information given by someone who was not a direct observer or participant of the events described.</p>
                        <p>When conducting a literature search, the researcher has to be aware that there are certain sources where relevant information on a research topic could be found.</p>
                        <h5>Scholarly Journals</h5>
                        <p>These are very crucial documents and are available in all libraries. However, some are more recent than others. At the same time, there are more scholarly journals on the internet (web), which researchers can access.</p>
                        <h5>Theses and Dissertations</h5>
                        <p>These are research projects written by Masters and PhD students. They are quite important, as they are valuable primary sources of information. They are also the original work of the authors.</p>
                        <h5>Government Documents</h5>
                        <p>These include policy papers, research reports owned by the government, annual reports of hospitals and government ministries and so on.</p>
                        <h5>Papers Presented at Conferences</h5>
                        <p>These are research papers presented at conferences and symposia and are a good source of primary literature.</p>
                        <h5>Books</h5>
                        <p>These are available in most libraries and most researchers or even non-researchers are quite familiar with them. Where the investigator is unable to locate the required textbook, it is important to seek the assistance of the librarian.</p>
                        <h5>Computers</h5>
                        <p>With current technological advances, researchers doing a literature search can access recent information through the internet. Many of the world's refereed journals are online and investigators can always access these, provided they have access to computers and are able to download information. Computers also have databases prepared for literature search. Examples of such databases are MEDLINE or INDEX MEDICUS as well as Pub Med, which nurses can easily access and search for information the internet.</p>
                        <p>These are some of the sources of information that nurses doing a literature search need to be aware of. It is important to mention that the above sources of information are not only useful to those undertaking research but also to non-researchers aiming to update their professional knowledge and skills.</p>
                        <h4>Step Five: Highlighting Research Methodology</h4>
                        <p>Research methodology is the fifth step of the research process.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_17_3583984e402c7f81e884g-088-1.jpg" alt="A diagram highlighting 'Highlighting Research Methodology' as the fifth step in the research process flowchart." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>The Research Process</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Every researcher has to identify an appropriate research design for use in the study. However, the selection or identification of a specific study design will depend on several factors. These, according to Harden et al (1995), include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Available information (state of knowledge) about the problem.</li>
                            <li>The nature of the problem and its environment.</li>
                            <li>The availability of resources for the study.</li>
                            <li>The skills and creativity of the researchers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is, therefore, the responsibility of the researcher to make the appropriate research design choice, paying particular attention to its suitability to your research and the available budget for the study. There are several types of common research designs that you may come across.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Experimental Design: Experimental and Quasi-experimental.</li>
                            <li>Survey Design: Comparative and Correlation.</li>
                            <li>Descriptive Design: Descriptive and Explorative.</li>
                            <li>Case Study Design.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Experimental Research Design</h5>
                        <p>This is one of the most complex and important research designs. It is also commonly used in clinical settings because of its accuracy and reliability. Experimental research design could be subdivided into true experimental and quasi-experimental.</p>
                        <p>Experimental research designs are concerned with testing hypotheses and establishing causality. This design tests the hypothesis of relationships, that is, attempts to make predictions of future outcomes based on a causal model implementing strategies to control the predicted outcome. If 'X' occurs 'Y' follows and so on.</p>
                        <p>Experimental designs try to establish causal links between several factors, for example the effectiveness of a particular drug such as paracetamol in relieving moderate pain.</p>
                        <p>In an experimental research design, the researcher controls or manipulates the action of the independent or causal variable(s) and observes and measures the action or outcome on the dependant variable. This is the major difference between experimental and non-experimental designs where no control or manipulation is required.</p>
                        <p>Experimental nursing research is the most logically applicable to clinical nursing practice (Brink, 1996).</p>
                        <h6>What are some of the characteristics of an experimental research design?</h6>
                        <p>An experimental design has certain important characteristics, which you as a research student should be aware of.</p>
                        <p><strong>Manipulation</strong></p>
                        <p>This is where the researcher controls the independent variable, which can be an event, intervention or treatment that is expected to have some effect on the dependant variable.</p>
                        <p><strong>Control</strong></p>
                        <p>The researcher exercises control over the experimental situation by eliminating the actions of other possible variables beyond the independent variable. This is achieved through manipulating, randomising and careful preparations of experimental protocols and the use of control groups.</p>
                        <p><strong>Randomising</strong></p>
                        <p>This is where every subject is given an equal chance to participate in the study. The researcher assigns the subjects to the experimental or control groups on a random basis. To achieve randomisation, you have to first identify the respondents and then place them into groups using random tables, coin tossing or other techniques.</p>
                        <p>In a quasi-experimental design, some of the above rules are relaxed. For example, there might be no need for having a control group or at times randomisation may not be included. The quasi-experimental design enables the search for knowledge and examination of causality in situations where complete control is not possible.</p>
                        <p>It is important to appreciate that while experimental research designs are quite useful and commonly used in clinical settings, such as clinical nursing practice, there are certain strengths and weaknesses associated with the design.</p>
                        <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most powerful design for testing the hypothesis of cause-effect relationships between variables.</li>
                            <li>It is practical, feasible and can be generalised to some extent. This type of design introduces some control over certain extraneous variables.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In most real situations, it is difficult to conduct a true experimental design, since some of the variables cannot be manipulated or controlled.</li>
                            <li>At times it becomes quite difficult to get randomised research subjects or even a control group. This is to some extent why nurse researchers are not very interested in experimental research designs.</li>
                            <li>As a result of the need for randomisation, control and manipulation with the aim of establishing cause-effect relationships, the design becomes very expensive, both in terms of time and money.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Survey Research Design</h5>
                        <p>The second common research design that you may come across is the survey research design. Survey research design is 'the systematic gathering of information' (Bernard and Morrison, 1992:35). Survey studies are concerned with gathering information from a sample of population.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the study is usually to identify general trends or patterns in the collected data, for example, 'nurses attitudes towards smoking'. A survey is designed to obtain information from the population regarding the prevalence, distribution, and interrelations of variables within those populations, for example, using a census, political opinion polls, immunisation sample surveys and so on.</p>
                        <p>Survey studies primarily yield quantitative data. They are mainly cross sectional in design. They mainly deal with (investigate) what people do, for example, how or what they eat, how they meet their health needs, what kind of family planning behaviour they engage in and so on.</p>
                        <p>Survey data is collected in number of ways.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Questionnaires, which are mainly self-administered.</li>
                            <li>Telephone interviews, which involves phoning people and seeking their opinions.</li>
                            <li>Personal interviews, also known as face-to-face interviews, where the interviewers meet with the interviewee to seek certain information.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are several advantages to the survey design. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is flexible and broad in scope</li>
                            <li>It can be applied to many people</li>
                            <li>It can focus on wide range of topics</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Information generated by the survey method is often superficial as the survey rarely probes deeply. The survey design is better suited for extensive rather than intensive analysis of a situation. It is usually descriptive and specific based on the situation that needs intervention, for planning purposes, monitoring and evaluation of services. An example of a survey is the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) carried out every five years.</p>
                        <p>In a survey the researcher designs the phenomenon and study but does not manipulate any variables nor do they make any efforts to determine the relationships between variables. However, a comparative descriptive survey is designed to be a comparison between two or more groups to see how they differ on some variables.</p>
                        <p>In the correlation survey meanwhile, the researcher attempts to determine and describe what relationship exists between variables. For example, the study of the relationship between maternal 'age' and reports of nausea would then be determined statistically through the use of a statistical test known as the correlation coefficient (Brink 1996: 110). One independent variable is correlated with one or more dependent variables. Then statistical methods are applied to describe if the variables relate at all and what kind of relationship they have, that is, positive correlation or, negative correlation.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When there is a positive correlation is an indication that the more the exposure the high the outcome of interest, for example smoking exposure and lung disease, which is the outcome.</li>
                            <li>When there is no correlation one would conclude that the exposure is not related to the outcome, for example teething and diarrhoeal episodes.</li>
                            <li>When there is a negative correlation it means that the more the exposure the less the outcome, for example tetanus vaccination and tetanus infection.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Descriptive or Explorative Research Design</h5>
                        <p>According to Harden et al (1999), a descriptive study is the systematic collection and presentation of data to give clear picture of a particular situation. Cormack (1982:178) defines descriptive research as research, which involves the systematic collection of information and aims to discover and describe new facts about a situation, people, activities, or events.</p>
                        <p>The descriptive research design is grouped as a non-experimental research design. Its main purposes include observing, describing and documenting all aspects of a situation as it naturally occurs. At times, descriptive deigns are used as a starting point for hypothesis generation or theory testing. The descriptive study attempts 'to obtain complete and accurate information about a phenomenon through observation, description and classification'. Examples of questions in this line of study include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How prevalent is the measles disease in this district?</li>
                            <li>What are the characteristics of the district's population?</li>
                            <li>When are measles outbreaks experienced?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the exploratory descriptive design, the main purpose is to explore the dimensions of a phenomenon (problem) as well as the major characteristics or facts that influence the phenomenon. Questions to be asked include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the nature of the problem?</li>
                            <li>What factors are related to the problem?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A descriptive study is designed to gain more information about characteristics within a particular field of study. It aims to provide a picture of a situation as it naturally happens. Descriptive study design may be used for developing a theory, identifying problems within the current practice, justifying current practices or making judgments determining what others in similar situations are doing.</p>
                        <p>In descriptive design, no manipulation of variables is involved as opposed to experimental design. Similarly, no dependent or independent variables are used within a descriptive study design because no attempt is made to establish causality. The overall purpose of descriptive research is to provide a picture of a phenomenon as it naturally occurs, as opposed to studying the impacts of the phenomenon or intervention.</p>
                        <p>Descriptive research designs vary in their level of complexity. Some contain only two variables while others may include multiple variables. A variety of labels are used to describe descriptive research design. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Explanatory</strong> when the researcher's focus is to generate ideas and work on a field of inquiry that is relatively unknown.</li>
                            <li><strong>Epidemiologic,</strong> which is a form of descriptive research that is designed to provide information on the independence, prevalence, incidence and correlates of a disease or medical condition in a population, for instance, incidence or prevalence of AIDS in specific high risk populations, for example commercial sex workers in Nairobi's Majengo estate, or truck drivers along the Nairobi-Mombasa high way).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The emphasis of a descriptive research design is on maximising the study's credibility, usefulness and feasibility. Comparatively, descriptive studies are relatively cheaper than randomised experimental designs. However, certain types of descriptive studies can be very expensive, both in terms of money and time, for example large scale studies. A descriptive research design could be divided into the following categories:</p>
                        <h6>Explorative Descriptive Design</h6>
                        <p>In the explorative descriptive design, the researcher explores a particular problem to discover what is there and if it could be solved. The study focuses on new events, evidence, or practices.</p>
                        <h6>Simple Design</h6>
                        <p>The simple design is mainly a follow up of an exploratory design. The variable of interest has already been identified. This design is used when the researcher intends to examine only a single problem.</p>
                        <h6>Comparative Descriptive Design</h6>
                        <p>The comparative descriptive design is mainly used when the researcher intends to examine and describe particular variables in two or more groups. The concept here is to compare the groups and how they differ or how similar they are in relation to the variable of interest.</p>
                        <h6>Time Dimensional Designs</h6>
                        <p>Time dimensional designs are used in epidemiological studies and are further subdivided into longitudinal that is when it examines changes in a group for a long period and it is cross-sectional where the data is collected at one point in time.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_10_17_3583984e402c7f81e884g-092-1.jpg" alt="A timeline showing the difference between retrospective studies (looking back), cross-sectional studies (a snapshot in time), and prospective studies (looking forward)." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <h6>Retrospective Study Design</h6>
                        <p>The retrospective study design is also known as 'export facts'. It is a study design aimed at a looking back in order to link the present with the past or what happened in the past. People having an outcome of interest, for example skin disease, are interviewed to establish whether or not they have had contact with an exposure of interest in the past, for example spraying of agrochemicals.</p>
                        <h6>Prospective Study Design</h6>
                        <p>The prospective study design is similar to the longitudinal study as it starts from the present and ends by looking into the future. It is further divided into two categories: descriptive and explanatory. The subjects for the study are recruited based on presence or absence of an exposure of interest (workers in x-ray department) and followed up over many years to establish if they will develop outcomes of interest, for example cancer of the skin or reproductive health complications.</p>
                        <p>There are very few features that can be used to differentiate the various types of descriptive research designs. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Representativeness of the study data sources, for example, whether random, stratified, non probability.</li>
                            <li>Time frame of measurement, that is, whether short, cross sectional or longitudinal.</li>
                            <li>Whether the study involves any comparisons, for example, with another group.</li>
                            <li>Whether the design is focused on a simple descriptive question or more complex, correlative questions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Descriptive research designs are commonly used when the researcher is attempting to answer 'what is' or 'what was' questions, normative questions and/or correlative questions.</p>

                        </div>
                        <h5>Case Study Research Design</h5>
                        <p>The other common type of research design is the case study design. A case study is 'an in depth study of one individual, a group of individuals or an institution' (Brink 1996:116). It is a detailed account of a particular experience event or situation. It is meant to provide a description of people's thoughts, feelings and perceptions. A case study research design does not aim at providing a causal relationship. Neither does it attempt to test a hypothesis.</p>
                        <p>Case studies describe the characteristics of one or a limited number of cases extensively. The subject of the case study could be a patient, health centre, a village or a specific disease condition.</p>
                        <p>An example of a case study that a nurse researcher would like to investigate could be a mother with a bad obstetric history to determine their knowledge, feelings and perceptions of their condition (situation), or a case study on why in a certain health centres mothers are not coming in for their antenatal services. Such studies could provide significant insight into why things happen as they do.</p>
                        <p>While the case study design gives significant information, it has certain limitations, which you should be aware of as a researcher.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They require plenty of time.</li>
                            <li>They are costly.</li>
                            <li>Have high possibility of subject drop out.</li>
                            <li>Data analysis also calls for skills and experience, particularly if the study is carried over a long period of time.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In a case study design, the number of subjects might be very few but the study should be able to address all the interest variables.</p>
                        <h6>When are case study designs used?</h6>
                        <p>Case study designs are used when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is a need to demonstrate the effectiveness of a specific therapeutic technique</li>
                            <li>Generating and testing hypotheses</li>
                            <li>There is need to generate knowledge on a particular issue or situation that has not been adequately researched on</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Sampling Strategies</h5>
                        <p>The process of identifying the appropriate sampling techniques is very important in the research process. However, it is impossible to collect data from the whole population that a researcher may be interested in or intends to investigate. Since the essence of any research is to investigate a particular population, the selection of a representative sample from the specific population is vital. The type of sampling method a researcher uses will depend mainly on the type of research one intends to undertake, the methodology to be applied and the time available for the tasks. Sampling pertains to the identification of the study subjects from the general population a researcher is interested in. A researcher uses a specific sampling strategy because it is the most 'feasible and logical way of making a statement about a larger group' (Rensburg 2000:149).</p>
                        <p>According to Brink (1996) and Rensburg (2000) state, before discussing the type of sampling strategies available, one needs to define certain important terms that are associated with sampling methods.</p>
                        <h6>Population</h6>
                        <p>Population is defined as 'the entire group of persons or set of objects and events the researcher wants to study' (Rensburg 2000:147). It is also referred to as all the possible entities or individuals that have the characteristic(s) of interest to the study. The most important aspect is that the population must posses all the characteristics the researcher is interested in.</p>
                        <h6>Sample</h6>
                        <p>A sample is a group of people, or records or a number of observations from a larger population. It is a representative group of individuals selected form a population. A sample aids the researcher to get access to the general population. A sample that is selected appropriately generates data that reflects the true status of the population in relation to the characteristic(s) or variables under study.</p>
                        <h6>Sampling Frame</h6>
                        <p>Sampling frame is a comprehensive list of all the sampling elements in the target population, for example, the list of nurses working in a particular district, the number of under five children in a village or all the households in a village. An important point to note is that it is not always possible to get a sampling frame. In this case it becomes incumbent on the researcher to prepare their own sampling frame.</p>
                        <h6>Representative Sample</h6>
                        <p>A representative sample means that the sample resembles the population from which it is drawn in all aspects. It should possess all the variables a researcher is interested in, for example, educational level, socioeconomic factors, exposure to certain illness and so on.</p>
                        <h6>Sampling Bias</h6>
                        <p>Sampling bias occurs when the researcher has not carefully selected the samples that are expected to represent the general target population. It is usually the fault of the researcher and can have a negative impact on the entire findings of the research (Rensburg, 2000 and Brink, 1996). Causes of sampling bias could arise from the data collection process, for example, what time of the day the data was collected, languages of communication or how the data was collected.</p>
                        <h6>Sampling Error</h6>
                        <p>According to Rensburg (2000:151) sampling error refers to the difference between population parameters (for example, the average age of the population) and the sample statistics (for example, the average age of the sample group). It is the degree of deviation of the sample from the population from which it was drawn.</p>
                        <h6>Sampling Techniques</h6>
                        <p>There are two basic sampling techniques:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Probability or random sampling</li>
                            <li>Non probability sampling</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Probability Sampling</strong></p>
                        <p>Probability sampling allows for a much more a representative sample of the population and enables the estimation of sampling error. It also enables the calculation of differential statistics and allows the study to be generalised to other areas. Random sampling should take into account knowledge of every element of the population and the availability of a list of all those eligible to make a random selection. Probability sampling involves a random selection procedure to ensure that each unit of the sample is chosen on the basis of chance. All units of the study population have an equal or at least a known chance of being included in the sample from list provided (Hardon et al., 1995).</p>
                        <p>The following include some of the commonly used probability sampling techniques.</p>
                        <p><strong>Simple Random Sampling</strong></p>
                        <p>Simple Random Sampling is one of the commonest and the simplest methods of sampling. In simple random sampling, each unit (subject) has the chance to be selected. It involves one stage selection. It also allows the researcher access to the study population. Various ways of selecting the subjects exist among which are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identifying the specific target population.</li>
                            <li>Formulating an appropriate sampling frame.</li>
                            <li>Determining the sample size for the study.</li>
                            <li>Adapting a consecutive identification number for each unit in the sampling frame.</li>
                            <li>Selecting the desired subjects using a randomised technique.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are several ways of selecting a random sample using this technique. These include, the lottery method, use of random tables, or tossing a coin to help you decide where and how to start.</p>
                        <p>For example, if you need to select 30 subjects from a sampling frame of 100, you get 100 pieces of papers and write 'Yes' on 30 of them and 'No' on the rest. You then ask all the 100 subjects to pick a piece of paper each. Those who pick 'Yes' are included in the study.</p>
                        <p><strong>Systematic or Interval Sampling</strong></p>
                        <p>Systematic sampling is the selection of every n<sup>th</sup> element from a sampling frame, where n, the sampling interval, is calculated as:</p>
                        <p>n = number in population or number in sample</p>
                        <p>Using this procedure each element in the population has a known and equal probability of selection. This makes systematic sampling functionally similar to simple random sampling. It is however, much more efficient and much less expensive to do.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Sampling Techniques Example</h4>
                            <p>For example, suppose you intend to interview 200 KRCHN in-service students out of a total of 2000. To get the sampling interval you would divide the total number of students with the desired sample size, that is, 2000/200=10. Your sampling interval is 10, that is, in a list of 2000 students you will pick every 10<sup>th</sup> student.</p>
                            <p>The next step is to decide your starting point. You may use simple random method to do this by writing the numbers 1 to 10 on 10 different pieces of paper. Ask someone to pick any of the pieces and the number that is picked will be your starting point. If 8 becomes the 1<sup>st</sup> person, then every 10<sup>th</sup> person, that is, 18<sup>th</sup>, 28<sup>th</sup>, 38<sup>th</sup> and so on is picked for the study.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p><strong>Stratified Random Sampling</strong></p>
                        <p>When sub-populations vary considerably, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently. Stratification is the process of grouping members of the population into relatively homogeneous subgroups, for example, by education level, socioeconomic structure and so on before sampling. The strata should be mutually exclusive, that is, every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. The strata should also be collectively exhaustive, that is, no population element can be excluded. Random sampling is then applied within each stratum. This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error.</p>
                        <p>For example, you may wish to conduct a study on contraceptive use in a community and you realise you need to stratify the subjects based on their religious beliefs, being a significant characteristic or variable in decision on usage of contraceptives. This calls for you to divide your desired sample into strata on religious lines, for example, Christians Protestants, Christian Catholics, Christians others, Muslims, Hindu and Buddhists just to mention a few. Each strata is then apportioned a sample size based on the proportion of the number of the people from that religious affiliation in the population. If Protestants are 40%, Catholics 30%, others 5%, Muslims 20% and so on, the samples are apportioned based on those percents.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cluster Sampling</strong></p>
                        <p>Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when 'natural' groupings are evident in the population. The total population is divided into these groups (or clusters), and a sample of the groups is selected. The required information is then collected from the elements within each selected group. This may be done for every element in these groups, or a subsample of elements may be selected within each of these groups.</p>
                        <p>Elements within a cluster should ideally be as homogeneous as possible. However, there should be heterogeneity between clusters. Each cluster should be a small scale version of the total population. The clusters should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. A random sampling technique is then used on any relevant clusters to choose which clusters to include in the study.</p>
                        <p><strong>Non Probability Sampling</strong></p>
                        <p>There are two principle methods of non probability sampling. These are known as purposive or judgmental sampling and quota sampling.</p>
                        <p><strong>Purposive or Judgmental Sampling</strong></p>
                        <p>Purposive or judgmental sampling is where the researcher selects a particular group or groups based on certain criteria (Wilson, 1993:179). In this method the researcher determines who should be included in the study. It is, in fact, the researcher's opinion that the sample is representative of the target population.</p>
                        <p>Purposive sampling is commonly used in qualitative studies. The main advantage of this method of sampling is that it gives the researcher a free hand to respond according to their judgment. Disadvantages include sampling biases, the possibility of unrepresentative samples and lack of generalisations of the study findings.</p>
                        <p><strong>Quota Sampling</strong></p>
                        <p>In quota sampling, the population is first segmented into mutually exclusive sub-groups, just as in stratified sampling. Then judgement is used to select the subjects or units from each segment based on a specified proportion. For example, an interviewer may be told to sample 200 females and 300 males between the age of 45 and 60.</p>
                        <p><strong>Convenience or Accidental Sampling</strong></p>
                        <p>Convenience sampling is also referred to as accidental or availability sampling. In convenience sampling the researcher is unable to control bias at all. This is a method in which, for convenience sake, the study units that happen to be available at the time of data collection are selected and used as a sample (Hardson et al 1995:207).</p>
                        <p>This type of sampling allows the utilisation of any available target population. For example, if you need to assess the blood pressure of females using depo provera who are above 40 years of age, you will need to check the blood pressure of any female patient above this age irrespective of her parity or other characteristics. In such circumstances there is no sample representation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Snow Ball Sampling</strong></p>
                        <p>In social science research, snowball sampling is a technique for developing a research sample where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances. Thus the sample group appears to grow like a rolling snowball. This sampling technique is often used in hidden populations which are difficult for researchers to access. Example populations include drug users and commercial sex workers. Sample members are not selected from a sampling frame, therefore, snowball samples are subject to numerous biases. For example, people who have many friends are more likely to be recruited into the sample.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, you have now learnt the definitions of common terminologies associated with samples and sampling. You have also learnt the two major sampling strategies, which are probability sampling and non-probability sampling. In addition, you described in detail examples of each of these two techniques which include: simple random sampling, systematic sampling, cluster sampling (probability sampling) and quota sampling, convenience or accidental sampling, snowball sampling and purposive sampling (non-probability sampling).</p>
                        <h5>Access to Research Population</h5>
                        <p>In order to gain access to a research population, there is need to specify how you as the researcher achieved this goal. You need to describe how the research areas were identified, the selection process involved, the type of sampling method used and how you managed to gain access to the specific research participants. You will also have to specify some of the ethical considerations involved and how these are professionally managed before the respondents take part in the study.</p>
                        <p>Prior to commencing the study, you as the researcher should make a formal application to the government of Kenya for permission to conduct the research. This should include two or more copies of the research proposal, accompanied by a recommendation letter from the supervisor(s) as required by the Kenyan authorities. Similarly, if your institution is authorised to conduct research, there may be a 'Research and Ethics Committee'. Such a committee is usually vested with the authority of granting research permits, which you could use. Once the authority to conduct the study in the form of a 'Research Clearance Permit' has been granted, the researcher then reports to the 'District Commissioner (DC) of the area'. The DC will then instruct you to report to the District Officer (DO) of your research area. The DO may further require you to report to the area local chief and assistant chiefs. When the above administrative requirement is completed, the researcher then approaches the village leader to grant further access to the respective villagers.</p>
                        <p>As a requirement, each research respondent should be requested to accept in writing and sign or affix a thumb print. In cases where a respondent can neither read nor write, a consent form should be completed and duly signed after you have clearly explained the purpose of the research.</p>
                        <aside class="callout warning">
                            <p>Always attach a copy of this consent in the appendix section!</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>You should inform the respondents that their participation is absolutely voluntary and they may pull out of the study whenever they so wish. As part of the contract, you should guarantee the respondents absolute confidentiality during and after the study.</p>
                        <p>The process described above may vary depending on the type and area of study. For example if you want to conduct a study specific to your hospital or a few hospitals in your catchment area you may need authority from the hospital administrator and heads of departments that are going to be involved.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>In this section you will learn how to write a research proposal, or a research protocol as some researchers prefer to call it, either for funding or for academic purposes.</p>
                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>

                        <h3>Research Proposal</h3>
                        <h4>What is a research proposal?</h4>
                        <p>It is important to be able to define what a research proposal is before you learn how to develop it. A research proposal has several definitions. However, you will only look at one of them. According to Bernard and Morrison (1990: 15), 'A research proposal is a detailed statement of what you intend to do, why you want to do it and how you will go about it'.</p>
                        <p>This definition shows that a research proposal is a statement that outlines the what, why and how of your study. It gives an indication of whether you are able to implement the research following the intended research design and methods you selected.</p>
                        <h4>Why develop a research proposal?</h4>
                        <p>A research proposal helps the researcher:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To sharpen their thoughts and the research methodology.</li>
                            <li>To allow others to examine the research project and its methods.</li>
                            <li>To get clearance and authority from the government and ethics committee to carry out the research.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Despite the important role played by a research proposal, at times it is a difficult hurdle to overcome, particularly to new researchers. When developing a research proposal, you need to be patient as you might be required to re-write the proposal several times. This is a very common occurrence with all researches and you, as a student researcher, should not feel discouraged. It should, instead, give you the motivation to clarify and refine your thoughts and ideas. Your peers provide a good resource in such circumstances so you should ask them to read through your proposal and give you their comments.</p>
                        <h4>What should a research proposal contain?</h4>
                        <p>The content of a research proposal varies a lot. This is due to the fact that each institution, for example a college, hospital or an ethics committee, has its own guidelines to be followed by those seeking its approval. Even sponsors of research projects have their own approaches. Therefore, you as a researcher will need to be aware of such variations and abide by them.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Project title.</li>
                            <li>Your name and index number.</li>
                            <li>Name, titles and designations of your supervisor, tutor or lecturer.</li>
                            <li>Name of the department, and college or university.</li>
                            <li>Statement of the research problem.</li>
                            <li>Rationale or justification of research.</li>
                            <li>Brief relevant literature review.</li>
                            <li>Research methodology or design.</li>
                            <li>Methods of data analysis.</li>
                            <li>Ethical considerations taken into account.</li>
                            <li>Preparation of study report.</li>
                            <li>Timeline of the study.</li>
                            <li>Study budget.</li>
                            <li>Appendices.</li>
                            <li>Your Curriculum Vitae (CV) where applicable. You as an upgrading nurse have several years of work experience that you should include in your CV.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In conclusion, a research proposal is a very important part of the research process. It is a detailed statement outlining the major components of the research process. It is what you intend to do in your research, why you want to do it and how you will go about it in achieving your set research objectives.</p>

                        <h3>Time Line or Time Schedule</h3>
                        <p>One of the items you will need to include in your proposal is a schedule for your study. The activities you intend to undertake during the process of your study are summarised in a table format. The time lines, activity schedule or Ghent chart are some of the names used to refer to this kind of a table. It has the activities on the first column and on the first row is the duration of time that is required to complete the tasks. The researcher should clearly write the details of the activities which will then be summarised in the time line or Ghent chart.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Factors such as the inherent weakness in the sampling method, faulty designs and controls, weaknesses in the methods used to collect data and so on.</li>
