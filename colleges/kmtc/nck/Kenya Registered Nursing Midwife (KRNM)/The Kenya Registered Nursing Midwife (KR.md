The Kenya Registered Nursing Midwife (KRNM) syllabus for 2026 is currently in a transition phase. While existing students follow a modular diploma curriculum, the Nursing Council of Kenya (NCK) has mandated that all training institutions cease new admissions into this specific program by September 1, 2026, as part of a move toward a harmonized nursing curriculum. 
Core Syllabus Modules (Current Curriculum)
The existing KRNM diploma typically spans three years and is divided into several blocks or semesters: 

    Introductory & Clinical Sciences: Anatomy and physiology, microbiology, immunology, parasitology, and pharmacology (I & II).
    Fundamentals of Nursing: Professionalism, ethics, communication skills, critical thinking, and nursing foundations.
    Midwifery & Reproductive Health:
        Midwifery I, II, & III: Focused on pregnancy, labor, postnatal care, and neonatal health.
        Reproductive Health: Family planning, contraception technology, gynecology, and STIs/HIV/AIDS management.
    Medical-Surgical Nursing: Management of respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal (GIT), endocrine, and genital-urinary disorders, as well as burns, scalds, and trauma.
    Community & Mental Health: Introduction to community and environmental health, primary health care (PHC), epidemiology, and mental health nursing.
