# Content Integration Report: ABG Analysis
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Project:** BScN Degree Notes Integration
**Scope:** Integration of "Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Analysis" (6 Modules) into Paper 1.

## Executive Summary
Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) interpretation is a specialized critical care skill. Currently, the project lacks a dedicated section for ABGs, with only brief mentions possible in Respiratory or Critical Care topics. Your 6-module curriculum provides a deep dive into interpretation and clinical application.

## 1. Mapping & Gap Analysis
| New Module | Existing Coverage | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mod 1: Intro to ABG** | Missing | **Create.** Fundamentals of gas sampling/values. |
| **Mod 2: How to Interpret**| Missing | **Create.** Step-by-step logic (pH, CO2, HCO3). |
| **Mod 3: Respiratory Acidosis/Alkalosis** | Missing | **Create.** Deep dive into respiratory causes. |
| **Mod 4: Metabolic Acidosis/Alkalosis** | Missing | **Create.** Deep dive into metabolic causes. |
| **Mod 5: Compensation** | Missing | **Create.** Complex mixed-disorder logic. |
| **Mod 6: Clinical Apps** | Missing | **Create.** Case studies and nursing management. |

## 2. Integration Strategy
Given that ABGs are highly technical and distinct from general Critical Care concepts, I recommend a **Dedicated Sub-Unit** within Paper 1.

**Location:** `BScN_Paper1/Unit_5B_ABG_Analysis/`

This structure mirrors our approach for Pharmacology (`Unit 2B`) and ensures that these advanced concepts don't clutter the more general "Critical Care & Theatre" (Unit 5) or "Respiratory" (Unit 3) topics.

## 3. Implementation Plan
1.  **Create Directory:** `BScN_Paper1/Unit_5B_ABG_Analysis/`
2.  **Scaffold Topics:** Create 6 topic files based on your modules.
3.  **Create Dashboard:** A main `index.html` with a specialized "ABG Interpretation Guide" look.
4.  **Create Quiz Hub:** Specifically for ABG interpretation practice.

**Next Step:** Proceed with scaffolding the 6 ABG topics.
