# Content Integration Report: ECG Interpretation
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Project:** BScN Degree Notes Integration
**Scope:** Integration of "ECG Interpretation Notes" (8 Modules) into Paper 1.

## Executive Summary
ECG interpretation is a critical skill for nursing, especially in critical care. Current notes (Unit 3 Circulatory & Unit 5 Procedures) likely mention ECGs but lack the depth required for interpretation (e.g., identifying heart blocks, ventricular arrhythmias, electrolyte effects).

## 1. Gap Analysis
| Module | Existing Coverage | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mod 1: Basics** | Brief mention in Unit 3/5. | **Create.** Electrophysiology fundamentals. |
| **Mod 2: The Strip** | Missing detail. | **Create.** P-QRS-T complex analysis. |
| **Mod 3: Sinus Rhythms** | Missing. | **Create.** Normal vs Brady/Tachy. |
| **Mod 4: Atrial Arrhythmias**| Missing. | **Create.** AFib, AFlutter. |
| **Mod 5: Ventricular** | Missing. | **Create.** VTach, VFib, Asystole. |
| **Mod 6: Heart Blocks** | Missing. | **Create.** 1st, 2nd, 3rd degree blocks. |
| **Mod 7: Electrical Tx** | Mentioned in Unit 5 (Defib). | **Create.** Cardioversion/Pacing deep dive. |
| **Mod 9: Electrolytes** | Mentioned in Unit 3/5. | **Create.** Hyper/Hypokalemia ECG changes. |

## 2. Integration Strategy
Similar to ABG Analysis, ECG Interpretation warrants its own specialized sub-unit within the Critical Care domain of Paper 1.

**Location:** `BScN_Paper1/Unit_5C_ECG_Interpretation/`

This provides a clear, focused area for students to master cardiac rhythms without getting lost in general critical care notes.

## 3. Implementation Plan
1.  **Create Directory:** `BScN_Paper1/Unit_5C_ECG_Interpretation/`
2.  **Scaffold Topics:** Create 8 topic files corresponding to your modules.
3.  **Create Dashboard:** A main `index.html`.
4.  **Quiz Hub:** Dedicated to ECG strip practice.

**Next Step:** Proceed with scaffolding the 8 ECG topics.
