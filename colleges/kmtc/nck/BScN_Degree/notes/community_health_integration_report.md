# Content Integration Report: Community Health Nursing
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Project:** BScN Degree Notes Integration
**Scope:** Integration of "Community Health Notes and Practice Questions" (11 Modules) into Paper 3.

## Executive Summary
The existing Paper 3 is divided into 7 distinct units (`Unit_1` to `Unit_7`), covering everything from Introduction to Home Based Care. While comprehensive, the structure is fragmented. Your proposed 11-module curriculum provides a more logical, integrated flow (Foundations -> Determinants -> Disease -> Strategy -> Planning).

## 1. Mapping & Gap Analysis
| New Module | Existing Equivalent | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mod 1: Foundations** | `Unit 1 / topic-01, 02` | **Merge.** Combine concepts and principles. |
| **Mod 2: Determinants** | Missing as dedicated topic. | **Create.** New topic emphasizing social determinants. |
| **Mod 3: Diseases** | `Unit 4` (Communicable) | **Expand.** Merge communicable with non-communicable (NCDs are currently less prominent). |
| **Mod 4: Prevention/Control** | Scattered in `Unit 4` | **Consolidate.** Create a dedicated prevention topic (Levels of prevention). |
| **Mod 5: Comm Diagnosis** | `Unit 5` (Diagnosis) | **Refine.** Use existing Unit 5 content but structure as Module 5. |
| **Mod 6: Comm Strategy** | `Unit 1 / topic-04` (Org) | **Update.** Focus specifically on the Kenyan Community Health Strategy (Level 1 care). |
| **Mod 7: Environmental** | `Unit 3` (Env Health) | **Migrate.** Unit 3 is very detailed; condense or link to it as Module 7. |
| **Mod 8: PHC** | `Unit 2` (PHC) | **Migrate.** Unit 2 covers this well. |
| **Mod 9: MCH** | Scattered/Paper 2 | **Create.** A specific community view of MCH (distinct from clinical midwifery). |
| **Mod 10: Nutrition** | Scattered | **Create.** Dedicated community nutrition module. |
| **Mod 11: Planning/Eval** | `Unit 5 / topic-04` | **Expand.** Project management cycle (Assessment -> Eval). |

## 2. Integration Strategy
Similar to Midwifery and Paediatrics, the best approach is to create a **Unified Directory** to house this modern 11-module curriculum.

**Location:** `PAPER 3/Community_Health_Integrated/`

**Module Mapping:**
1.  **Foundations:** `topic-01.html`
2.  **Determinants:** `topic-02.html`
3.  **Diseases (CD/NCD):** `topic-03.html`
4.  **Prevention:** `topic-04.html`
5.  **Diagnosis:** `topic-05.html`
6.  **Strategy:** `topic-06.html`
7.  **Environmental:** `topic-07.html`
8.  **PHC:** `topic-08.html`
9.  **MCH:** `topic-09.html`
10. **Nutrition:** `topic-10.html`
11. **Planning:** `topic-11.html`

## 3. Implementation Plan
1.  **Create Directory:** `PAPER 3/Community_Health_Integrated/`
2.  **Scaffold Topics:** Create 11 topic files.
3.  **Create Dashboard:** A main `index.html`.
4.  **Link:** Update the main Paper 3 PDF/Index to point here.

This provides a "One Stop Shop" for Community Health revision.
