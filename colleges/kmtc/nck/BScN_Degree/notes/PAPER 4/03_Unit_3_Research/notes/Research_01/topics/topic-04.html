                            <h3 class="card-title">What do you understand by the term 'literature review'?</h3>
                            <p>According to by Burns and Grove (1999: 469), 'literature review is a summary of theoretical and empirical sources to generate a picture of what is known and not known about a particular problem'.</p>
                            
                            <p>Literature review involves more than reading through articles in a journal or research paper. As Mugenda and Mugenda (1999) state, it entails the systematic identification, location and analysis of documents containing information related to the research problem being investigated. In fact, the process of literature review should start with identifying and locating the library, identifying sources and locating the sources.</p>

                            <figure class="content-figure">

                            <p>The main purposes of literature review should be to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Determine what has been done already as regards the research problem under investigation.</li>
                                <li>Identify strategies, procedures and measuring instruments that have been found useful in the investigation of the research problem.</li>
                                <li>Help make the researcher familiar with previous studies and thus facilitate the interpretation of the study.</li>
                                <li>Help the researcher to narrow the research topic.</li>
                                <li>Help determine new approaches and stimulate new ideas.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>When reviewing any literature, the researcher needs to:</p>

                            <p>In the search for literature, there are two major sources of information where the investigator can get relevant literature. These are known as primary and secondary sources. You shall cover each of these sources individually.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list bordered">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Primary Source</strong>
                                    <p>This is the work written by the person who is actually involved in, or is responsible for, the generation of the idea published. It can also be information from a person who actually observed or witnessed the occurrence under investigation. The person who conducts empirical research and publishes it in a journal is usually regarded as the primary source of information. When searching for literature, it is important to rely more on primary sources as these give first hand information.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Secondary Source</strong>
                                    <p>A secondary source involves summaries or quoted content from a primary source. This type of work is usually a paraphrase of the primary source. Often, it does not give the correct interpretation of the primary sources. It is usually information given by someone who was not a direct observer or participant of the events described.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>When conducting a literature search, the researcher has to be aware that there are certain sources where relevant information on a research topic could be found.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Scholarly Journals</strong>
                                    <p>These are very crucial documents and are available in all libraries. However, some are more recent than others. At the same time, there are more scholarly journals on the internet (web), which researchers can access.</p>

                                    <strong>Theses and Dissertations</strong>
                                    <p>These are research projects written by Masters and PhD students. They are quite important, as they are valuable primary sources of information. They are also the original work of the authors.</p>

                                    <p>These are research papers presented at conferences and symposia and are a good source of primary literature.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Books</strong>
                                    <p>These are available in most libraries and most researchers or even non-researchers are quite familiar with them. Where the investigator is unable to locate the required textbook, it is important to seek the assistance of the librarian.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Computers</strong>
                                    <p>With current technological advances, researchers doing a literature search can access recent information through the internet. Many of the world's refereed journals are online and investigators can always access these, provided they have access to computers and are able to download information. Computers also have databases prepared for literature search. Examples of such databases are MEDLINE or INDEX MEDICUS as well as Pub Med, which nurses can easily access and search for information on the internet.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These are some of the sources of information that nurses doing a literature search need to be aware of. It is important to mention that the above sources of information are not only useful to those undertaking research but also to non-researchers aiming to update their professional knowledge and skills.</p>

                            <p>Every researcher has to identify an appropriate research design for use in the study. However, the selection or identification of a specific study design will depend on several factors. These, according to Harden et al (1995), include the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Available information (state of knowledge) about the problem.</li>

                            <p>It is, therefore, the responsibility of the researcher to make the appropriate research design choice, paying particular attention to its suitability to your research and the available budget for the study.</p>
                            
                            <p>There are several types of common research designs that you may come across.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">

                            <h3 class="card-title">Experimental Research Design</h3>
                            <p>This is one of the most complex and important research designs. It is also commonly used in clinical settings because of its accuracy and reliability. Experimental research design could be subdivided into true experimental and quasi-experimental.</p>
                            
                            <p>Experimental research designs are concerned with testing hypotheses and establishing causality. This design tests the hypothesis of relationships, that is, attempts to make predictions of future outcomes based on a causal model implementing strategies to control the predicted outcome. If 'X' occurs 'Y' follows and so on.</p>
                            
                            <p>Experimental designs try to establish causal links between several factors, for example the effectiveness of a particular drug such as paracetamol in relieving moderate pain.</p>
                            
                            <p>In an experimental research design, the researcher controls or manipulates the action of the independent or causal variable(s) and observes and measures the action or outcome on the dependant variable. This is the major difference between experimental and non-experimental designs where no control or manipulation is required.</p>
                            
                            <p>Experimental nursing research is the most logically applicable to clinical nursing practice (Brink, 1996).</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="card-title" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">What are some of the characteristics of an experimental research design?</h4>
                            <p>An experimental design has certain important characteristics, which you as a research student should be aware of.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Manipulation</strong>
                                    <p>This is where the researcher controls the independent variable, which can be an event, intervention or treatment that is expected to have some effect on the dependant variable.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Control</strong>
                                    <p>The researcher exercises control over the experimental situation by eliminating the actions of other possible variables beyond the independent variable. This is achieved through manipulating, randomising and careful preparations of experimental protocols and the use of control groups.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Randomising</strong>
                                    <p>This is where every subject is given an equal chance to participate in the study. The researcher assigns the subjects to the experimental or control groups on a random basis. To achieve randomisation, you have to first identify the respondents and then place them into groups using random tables, coin tossing or other techniques.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>In a quasi-experimental design, some of the above rules are relaxed. For example, there might be no need for having a control group or at times randomisation may not be included. The quasi-experimental design enables the search for knowledge and examination of causality in situations where complete control is not possible.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is important to appreciate that while experimental research designs are quite useful and commonly used in clinical settings, such as clinical nursing practice, there are certain strengths and weaknesses associated with the design.</p>

                            <p>The second common research design that you may come across is the survey research design. Survey research design is 'the systematic gathering of information' (Bernard and Morrison, 1992:35). Survey studies are concerned with gathering information from a sample of population.</p>
                            
                            <p>The purpose of the study is usually to identify general trends or patterns in the collected data, for example, 'nurses attitudes towards smoking'. A survey is designed to obtain information from the population regarding the prevalence, distribution, and interrelations of variables within those populations, for example, using a census, political opinion polls, immunisation sample surveys and so on.</p>
                            
                            <p>Survey studies primarily yield quantitative data. They are mainly cross sectional in design. They mainly deal with (investigate) what people do, for example, how or what they eat, how they meet their health needs, what kind of family planning behaviour they engage in and so on.</p>
                            
                            <p>Survey data is collected in number of ways.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Questionnaires, which are mainly self-administered.</li>
                                <li>Telephone interviews, which involves phoning people and seeking their opinions.</li>
                                <li>Personal interviews, also known as face-to-face interviews, where the interviewers meet with the interviewee to seek certain information.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>There are several advantages to the survey design. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>It is flexible and broad in scope</li>
                                <li>It can be applied to many people</li>
                                <li>It can focus on wide range of topics</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Information generated by the survey method is often superficial as the survey rarely probes deeply. The survey design is better suited for extensive rather than intensive analysis of a situation. It is usually descriptive and specific based on the situation that needs intervention, for planning purposes, monitoring and evaluation of services.</p>
                            
                            <p>An example of a survey is the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) carried out every five years.</p>
                            
                            <p>In a survey the researcher designs the phenomenon and study but does not manipulate any variables nor do they make any efforts to determine the relationships between variables. However, a comparative descriptive survey is designed to be a comparison between two or more groups to see how they differ on some variables.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the correlation survey meanwhile, the researcher attempts to determine and describe what relationship exists between variables. For example, the study of the relationship between maternal 'age' and reports of nausea would then be determined statistically through the use of a statistical test known as the correlation coefficient (Brink 1996: 110). One independent variable is correlated with one or more dependent variables. Then statistical methods are applied to describe if the variables relate at all and what kind of relationship they have, that is, positive correlation or, negative correlation.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Descriptive or Explorative Research Design</h3>
                            <p>According to Harden et al (1999), a descriptive study is the systematic collection and presentation of data to give clear picture of a particular situation. Cormack (1982:178) defines descriptive research as research, which involves the systematic collection of information and aims to discover and describe new facts about a situation, people, activities, or events.</p>
                            
                            <p>The descriptive research design is grouped as a non-experimental research design. Its main purposes include observing, describing and documenting all aspects of a situation as it naturally occurs. At times, descriptive designs are used as a starting point for hypothesis generation or theory testing. The descriptive study attempts 'to obtain complete and accurate information about a phenomenon through observation, description and classification'. Examples of questions in this line of study include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>How prevalent is the measles disease in this district?</li>
                                <li>What are the characteristics of the district's population?</li>
                                <li>When are measles outbreaks experienced?</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>In the exploratory descriptive design, the main purpose is to explore the dimensions of a phenomenon (problem) as well as the major characteristics or facts that influence the phenomenon. Questions to be asked include:</p>
                            <p>What is the nature of the problem? What factors are related to the problem?</p>
                            
                            <p>A descriptive study is designed to gain more information about characteristics within a particular field of study. It aims to provide a picture of a situation as it naturally happens. Descriptive study design may be used for developing a theory, identifying problems within the current practice, justifying current practices or making judgments determining what others in similar situations are doing.</p>
                            
                            <p>In descriptive design, no manipulation of variables is involved as opposed to experimental design. Similarly, no dependent or independent variables are used within a descriptive study design because no attempt is made to establish causality. The overall purpose of descriptive research is to provide a picture of a phenomenon as it naturally occurs, as opposed to studying the impacts of the phenomenon or intervention.</p>
                            
                            <p>Descriptive research designs vary in their level of complexity. Some contain only two variables while others may include multiple variables. A variety of labels are used to describe descriptive research design. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Explanatory</strong> when the researcher's focus is to generate ideas and work on a field of inquiry that is relatively unknown.</li>
                                <li><strong>Epidemiologic</strong>, which is a form of descriptive research that is designed to provide information on the independence, prevalence, incidence and correlates of a disease or medical condition in a population, for instance, incidence or prevalence of AIDS in specific high risk populations, for example commercial sex workers in Nairobi's Majengo estate, or truck drivers along the Nairobi-Mombasa highway).</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>The emphasis of a descriptive research design is on maximising the study's credibility, usefulness and feasibility. Comparatively, descriptive studies are relatively cheaper than randomised experimental designs. However, certain types of descriptive studies can be very expensive, both in terms of money and time, for example large scale studies. A descriptive research design could be divided into the following categories:</p>

                                    <p>In the explorative descriptive design, the researcher explores a particular problem to discover what is there and if it could be solved. The study focuses on new events, evidence, or practices.</p>

                                    <p>The simple design is mainly a follow up of an exploratory design. The variable of interest has already been identified. This design is used when the researcher intends to examine only a single problem.</p>

                                    <strong>Retrospective Study Design</strong>
                                    <p>The retrospective study design is also known as 'export facts'. It is a study design aimed at a looking back in order to link the present with the past or what happened in the past. People having an outcome of interest, for example skin disease, are interviewed to establish whether or not they have had contact with an exposure of interest in the past, for example spraying of agrochemicals.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Prospective Study Design</strong>
                                    <p>The prospective study design is similar to the longitudinal study as it starts from the present and ends by looking into the future. It is further divided into two categories: descriptive and explanatory. The subjects for the study are recruited based on presence or absence of an exposure of interest (workers in x-ray department) and followed up over many years to establish if they will develop outcomes of interest, for example cancer of the skin or reproductive health complications.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>There are very few features that can be used to differentiate the various types of descriptive research designs. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Representativeness of the study data sources, for example, whether random, stratified, non probability.</li>
                                <li>Time frame of measurement, that is, whether short, cross sectional or longitudinal.</li>
                                <li>Whether the study involves any comparisons, for example, with another group.</li>
                                <li>Whether the design is focused on a simple descriptive question or more complex, correlative questions.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Descriptive research designs are commonly used when the researcher is attempting to answer 'what is' or 'what was' questions, normative questions and/or correlative questions.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Case Study Research Design</h3>
                            <p>The other common type of research design is the case study design. A case study is 'an in depth study of one individual, a group of individuals or an institution' (Brink 1996:116). It is a detailed account of a particular experience event or situation. It is meant to provide a description of people's thoughts, feelings and perceptions. A case study research design does not aim at providing a causal relationship. Neither does it attempt to test a hypothesis.</p>
                            
                            <p>Case studies describe the characteristics of one or a limited number of cases extensively. The subject of the case study could be a patient, health centre, a village or a specific disease condition.</p>
                            
                            <p>An example of a case study that a nurse researcher would like to investigate could be a mother with a bad obstetric history to determine their knowledge, feelings and perceptions of their condition (situation), or a case study on why in a certain health centres mothers are not coming in for their antenatal services. Such studies could provide significant insight into why things happen as they do.</p>
                            
                            <p>While the case study design gives significant information, it has certain limitations, which you should be aware of as a researcher.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list warning-list">
                                <li>They require plenty of time.</li>
                                <li>They are costly.</li>
                                <li>Have high possibility of subject drop out.</li>
                                <li>Data analysis also calls for skills and experience, particularly if the study is carried over a long period of time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>In a case study design, the number of subjects might be very few but the study should be able to address all the interest variables.</p>
