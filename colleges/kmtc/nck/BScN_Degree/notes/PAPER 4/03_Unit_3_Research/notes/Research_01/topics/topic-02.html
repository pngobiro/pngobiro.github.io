                            <p>When describing types of research, researchers use several methods of classification. According to UNISA (2000: 83), research can be classified as follows:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Categories</strong>, that is, what the study is to be used for.</li>
                                <li><strong>Methodological approaches</strong>, which includes the research approaches that the researcher intends to adapt in the course of the study.</li>
                                <li><strong>Aims of the study</strong>, including what the study aims at achieving.</li>
                                <li><strong>The time dimension</strong> referring to the time factor of the study, that is, is the study a 'one off' case or one that will take months or even years.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In broad terms, research can be classified into qualitative and quantitative research approaches.</p>

                            <p>According to Burns and Grove (1999:338), qualitative research is 'a systematic, subjective approach used to describe life experiences and give them meaning'. It focuses on the whole issue under investigation, which is in line with the holistic approach the nursing profession advocates for in patient care. As you will see in the table below, there are major distinguishing features between qualitative and quantitative research types. Qualitative research is a type of research where the data collected is in the form of words rather than numbers. The data collected from this type of research is then grouped into categories, themes and patterns (Maalim, 1999).</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Historical Research</h3>
                            <p>This is a type of qualitative research that attempts to describe and learn from the past. This type of research is mainly used by social scientists. Historical research is a descriptive type of research where the investigator attempts to record and describe, in a sequential manner, the events under investigation. The findings are then presented in the fullest possible picture. A good example is where a nurse may investigate the historical development of nursing in Kenya and show the events and trends associated with the profession in Kenya.</p>
                            <p>Historical research has the advantage of teaching us about the past so as to put the problems of today into their proper context. However, when doing historical research, it is important that the researcher plans properly, laying out clear objectives to ensure that they are not overwhelmed by the large amount of materials, losing track of the study. In the recent past, many nurse researchers have ventured into this type of research and produced important results.</p>

                            <p>Another type of a qualitative research method is the case study. A case study is defined as 'an in-depth investigation of an individual, group, institution or phenomena' (Mugenda & Mugenda, 1999: 173). According to Moore (1988) case studies are used when narrowing the research focus into fewer units or increasing the range of units within the study.</p>
                            
                            <p>Case studies are commonly used when the investigator is attempting to understand complex phenomena, or the various causes and effects of a certain phenomenon. This is one of the most common research methods used by nurses. Case studies have the advantage of requiring minimal resources when compared with other types of research. Case studies also provide a means of looking in depth at complex situations. At the same time, there are certain limitations associated with case studies, which researchers need to be aware of. These include:</p>

                                <li>Results from case studies cannot be statistically validated because no sampling strategy is involved.</li>
                                <li>Case studies can be time consuming, particularly when looking into complex long term issues or phenomena.</li>
                                <li>Case studies are more susceptible to the 'Hawthorne effect', where the research process influences the study outcome.</li>

                            <p>A third type of qualitative research is referred to as Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA). This is an innovative research method used for collecting data in participatory research. This approach emphasises the need for the researcher to acknowledge and appreciate that local research respondents have the knowledge and skills to be partners in the research process (Maalim, 1999). In RRA, both the researcher and the respondents collaborate and learn from each other, getting possible solutions for the research questions (Rifkin, 1996). RRA is important for generating data from the local community such as disease patterns which they (community members) are quite familiar with. There are many RRA tools and techniques for data collection but the following are some of the more common ones.</p>

                                    <p>This is drawing of sketch maps by the research respondents to identify the comparative location and importance of different resources within the research area. This may include health facilities, social amenities and infrastructure like roads, transport and means of communication (Maalim, 1999).</p>

Daily schedules are used to identify daily labour patterns and other activities (Jones, 1996:2).

Usually the respondents draw circles of varying sizes. The size of the circle and the distance from the centre indicate the importance of the institution, for example a health centre, to the respondent.</p>

                            <p>Having covered qualitative research as one of the major research types, you will now look at quantitative research. Burns & Grove (1999:23) defined quantitative research as a 'formal, objective, rigorous, systematic process for generating information about the world', with respect to populations' dynamics, characteristics and phenomenon.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is important to note that, for many years, the quantitative research method has been the preferred method by nurse researchers. This was primarily because, in the early days, quantitative research was seen as the only recognised research or, as it was then called, 'the scientific method'. However, this no longer is the case as researchers have now understood that qualitative research is as important as, and complementary to, quantitative research methods. Researchers now appreciate that the selection of either quantitative or qualitative research types depends on many factors, including:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The issue (phenomenon) under investigation.</li>
                                <li>The aims and objectives of the research.</li>
                                <li>The state of existing knowledge.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>At the same time, many researchers now acknowledge that 'although qualitative research and quantitative research do differ, they can also, in specific areas, complement each other' (Grobbelaar 2000: 91).</p>
                            
                            <p>Quantitative research is also subdivided into several types, which you will now cover in detail.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Descriptive Research</h3>
                            <p>Descriptive research is 'the exploration and description of a phenomenon in real-life situations' (Burns & Grove 1999: 24). It involves the systematic collection and presentation of data to give a clear picture of a particular situation. A good example of descriptive study is a survey. Descriptive research also involves the systematic collection of information and aims to explore and describe new facts about a situation, people, activities or events.</p>
                            
                            <p>Descriptive research is important in nursing for the following reasons:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Assists in the development of new knowledge.</li>
                                <li>Forms the basis for future research.</li>
                                <li>Generates questions and hypotheses for further experimental study.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In descriptive research, the main focus is the investigation of existing practices, beliefs and attitudes held by people or investigating current trends of nursing</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Experimental Research</h3>
                            <p>This is one of the most complex and important research types. It is also commonly used in clinical settings because of its accuracy and reliability. Experimental research has, for several decades, been referred to as the true or scientific research because of its strict adherence to the three major characteristics of control, manipulation and randomisation.</p>
                            <p>A major difference between experimental and non experimental research types that you as a research student need to note is that, in experimental research, the researcher is the active agent rather than remaining a passive observer (Polit and Hungler, 1999). According to Burnard and Morrison (1990: 30), the major distinction between experimental and descriptive research types include the following:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list comparison-list">
                                <li>Descriptive research merely describes something, whereas experimental research tests a hypothesis.</li>
                                <li>Researchers can control variables in experimental research but cannot do this with descriptive research.</li>
                                <li>Descriptive research may not have control of the study subjects but experimental research has full control of the subjects under study.</li>
                                <li>Experimental research can lead to predictions but descriptive research may not.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Many times, experimental research is subdivided into 'true experimental' and quasi-experimental. The true experimental definition refers to the method you have just covered. You will now look at quasi-experimental research.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Quasi-experimental Research</h3>
                            <p>This is a type of quantitative research whose purpose is to examine causal relationships or to determine the effects of one variable on another (Burns & Grove, 1999). Quasi-experimental studies involve implementing a specific treatment and then later examining the effects of this treatment using selected methods of measurement. Quasi-experimental study is a type of intervention study.</p>
