                            <h3 class="card-title">What is a research proposal?</h3>
                            <p>It is important to be able to define what a research proposal is before you learn how to develop it. A research proposal has several definitions.</p>
                            <p>However, you will only look at one of them. According to Bernard and Morrison (1990: 15), 'A research proposal is a detailed statement of what you intend to do, why you want to do it and how you will go about it'.</p>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--note">
                                <p>This definition shows that a research proposal is a statement that outlines the what, why and how of your study. It gives an indication of whether you are able to implement the research following the intended research design and methods you selected.</p>
                            </div>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Why develop a research proposal?</h3>
                            <p>A research proposal helps the researcher:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>To sharpen their thoughts and the research methodology.</li>
                                <li>To allow others to examine the research project and its methods.</li>
                                <li>To get clearance and authority from the government and ethics committee to carry out the research.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Despite the important role played by a research proposal, at times it is a difficult hurdle to overcome, particularly to new researchers. When developing a research proposal, you need to be patient as you might be required to re-write the proposal several times. This is a very common occurrence with all researches and you, as a student researcher, should not feel discouraged. It should, instead, give you the motivation to clarify and refine your thoughts and ideas. Your peers provide a good resource in such circumstances so you should ask them to read through your proposal and give you their comments.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">What should a research proposal contain?</h3>
                            <p>The content of a research proposal varies a lot. This is due to the fact that each institution, for example a college, hospital or an ethics committee, has its own guidelines to be followed by those seeking its approval. Even sponsors of research projects have their own approaches. Therefore, you as a researcher will need to be aware of such variations and abide by them.</p>

                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>In conclusion, a research proposal is a very important part of the research process. It is a detailed statement outlining the major components of the research process. It is what you intend to do in your research, why you want to do it and how you will go about it in achieving your set research objectives.</p>

The time lines, activity schedule or Ghent chart are some of the names used to refer to this kind of a table. It has the activities on the first column and on the first row is the duration of time that is required to complete the tasks. The researcher should clearly write the details of the activities which will then be summarised in the time line or Ghent chart.</p>

                                <li>Factors such as the inherent weakness in the sampling method, faulty designs and controls, weaknesses in the methods used to collect data and so on.</li>
                                <li>Time factor due to pressure of work.</li>
                                <li>Expenses involved if grant is not secured.</li>
                                <li>Possibility that some of the respondents may not agree to participate in the study.</li>
                                <li>Diverse spread of the target population, which may hinder easy access to respondents.</li>

                            <p>For this assignment you will put into practice the various aspects of the research process that you have covered in the previous sections of this unit. The skills and knowledge you have gained are now to be put into practice in the field.</p>
                            
                            <p>Therefore, your next step is to identify a research topic, and following the research process you have learnt, to conduct a research field study. You will do this with the guidance of your research project supervisor.</p>
