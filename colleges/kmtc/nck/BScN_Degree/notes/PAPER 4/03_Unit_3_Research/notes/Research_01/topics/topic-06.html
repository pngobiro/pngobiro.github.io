                            <p>Data collection is one of the major steps of the research process. It is the data collection process that will determine the findings of the entire research study. It, therefore, calls for more attention and consideration. There are various data collection methods. However, the approach will depend on the type of study you are undertaking, the study objectives, the design, and above all, the available resources for the study in the form of money, time and the technical skills of the research team.</p>
                            
                            <p>Burns and Grove (1999: 43) define data collection as 'the precise, systematic gathering of information relevant to the research purpose or the specific objectives, questions or hypotheses of a study'.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Data Collection Plan</h3>
                            <p>Before you begin the data collection process, you need to draw up a data collection plan. A data collection can be developed using the following steps:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>List the tasks that have to be carried out and the people responsible for those tasks.</li>
                                <li>Make a rough estimate of the time needed for different parts of the study.</li>
                                <li>Identify the most appropriate period in which to carry out the research.</li>
                                <li>Schedule the different activities that have to be carried out each week in a work plan.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>A plan for data collection should be developed in order to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Have a clear overview of what tasks have to be carried out, who should perform them and the duration of these tasks.</li>
                                <li>Organise both human and material resources for data collection in the most efficient way and minimise errors and delays that may result from lack of planning.</li>
                                <li>Identify problems, for example, limited manpower, that will require modifications to the proposal. Such modification might include adjustment of the sample size or extension of the data collection period.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>There are three main stages in the data collection process:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Stage One - Permission to Proceed</li>
                                <li>Stage Two - Data Collection</li>
                                <li>Stage Three - Data Handling</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card content-card--accent">
                            <h3 class="card-title">Stage One: Permission to Proceed</h3>
                            <p>Consent must be obtained from the relevant authorities, individuals, and the community in which the project is to be carried out. This may involve organising meetings at national, provincial, district or village level. For clinical studies, this may involve obtaining written informed consent.</p>
                            <p>The principal investigator is likely to be the one responsible for obtaining permission to proceed at the various levels. The health research unit in the Ministry of Health or the institution organising the research may assist in obtaining permission from the national level. In many countries, research proposals have to be screened for scientific and ethical integrity by national research control centres.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Stage Two: Data Collection</h3>
                            <p>When collecting data, you have to consider the logistics. This entails identifying who will collect what, when and with what resources and quality control.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Who will collect what data?</h4>
                            <p>When allocating tasks for data collection, it is recommended that you first list the tasks. You can then identify who could best implement each of the tasks. If it is clear beforehand that your research team will not be able to carry out the entire study by itself, you may look for research assistants to assist in relatively simple but time consuming tasks.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">How long does it take to collect the data for each component of the study?</h4>
                            <p>In order to answer this question, you should consider the following points:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The time required to reach the study area(s).</li>
                                <li>The time required to 'walk around', and build rapport in the community.</li>
                                <li>The time required to locate the study units (persons, groups, and records). If you have to search for specific informants, for example, users or defaulters of a specific service, it might take more time to locate informants than to interview them.</li>
                                <li>The number of visits required per study unit. For some studies, it may be necessary to visit informants a number of times, for instance, if the information needed is sensitive and can only be collected after informants are comfortable with the researcher.</li>
                                <li>The time it takes to verify the quality of data collected in order to establish its validity.</li>
                                <li>The time required for taking field notes on the research process.</li>
                                <li>The time required for preliminary analysis of the data.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The data collection plan can be drawn up as follows:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>Calculate the number of interviews that can be carried out each day, for example, four per team member.</li>
                                <li>Calculate the number of days needed to carry out the interviews. For example, if you need to do 200 interviews, your research team of five people can do \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) interviews per day. You will therefore need 10 (200 ÷ 20) days for the interviews.</li>
                                <li>Calculate the time needed for the other methods used in the study, for instance, five days for familiarisation and rapport building, five days for focus group discussions, three days for participant observation and so on.</li>
                                <li>Determine how much time the research team can devote to the fieldwork.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <div class="callout callout--warning">
                                <p>If the time required according to calculation is more than the time available, it may be necessary to recruit assistants for certain components of the study, for example for conducting interviews.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>Recruiting research assistants for data collection may ease the task of the research team, but it must be remembered that the training and supervision of research assistants requires time. Time decisions have to be carefully determined on the basis of an analysis of the pros and cons of the study and its team members. If none of the team has previous research experience, they might prefer a study that they can carry out themselves without, or with only minimum, assistance.</p>
                            <p>If research assistants are required, consider to what extent local health workers can be used. They often have the advantage of being acquainted with the local situations. However, they should never be involved in conducting interviews to evaluate the performance of their own health facility or in studies on people's self care practices in their own catchment areas. Local staff from related services, for example, teachers, community development officers or students could also help with data collection. Occasionally, members or community members can collect certain parts of the village health data.</p>
                            <p>It is advisable to slightly overestimate the period needed for data collection to allow for unforeseen delays. In fact, it is often difficult to implement the fieldwork strictly according to plan, as you may encounter unforeseen problems, for example, adverse weather conditions or transport breakdown. Your philosophy of fieldwork planning should be flexible.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">In what sequence should data be collected?</h4>
                            <p>Generally, it is advisable to start with available data. This is essential if the sample of respondents is to be selected from records. Another rule of thumb is that qualitative research techniques, for example, focus group discussions, which are devised to focus the content of questionnaires, should be carried out before the finalisation of the questionnaire. If the focus group discussions are to provide feedback on issues raised in larger surveys, however, they should be conducted after preliminary analysis of the questionnaire.</p>
                            <p>To use time and transport efficiently, data that is to be collected from different sources in one locality should be collected at the same time, for example, interviews with staff in a health centre, observation of the equipment in the centre, and interviews with mothers living nearby should be scheduled together.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">When should the data be collected?</h4>
                            <p>The type of data to be collected and the demands of the project will determine the actual period of data collection. The following should be considered:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The availability of research team members and research assistants.</li>
                                <li>The appropriate season(s) to conduct the fieldwork (if the problem is season related or if data collection will be difficult in certain periods).</li>
                                <li>The accessibility and availability of the sample population.</li>
                                <li>Public holidays and vacation periods.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Ensuring Quality</h4>
                            <p>It is important that the data collected is of good quality, that is, reliable and valid. Otherwise, you may come out with false or misleading conclusions. Therefore, the possible sources of data distortion (bias) should be addressed. Biases you should try to prevent include deviations from the sampling procedures set out in the proposal, variability and bias in observations or measurements made because:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The subject being studied changes their behaviour as a consequence of the research. For example, a subject may act more positively while being observed.</li>
                                <li>The researcher may use non-standard measuring scales, imprecise or no guidelines for interviewing.</li>
                                <li>Researchers themselves vary in what they observe or measure, that is, observer variability. For example, researchers may be selective in their observations, that is, observer bias and measure, question, or note down answers with varying accuracy or follow different interview approaches, with one researcher being more open, friendly and probing than the other.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>As a researcher you should avoid variations in both the measurement criteria and the criteria for categorising answers especially in the course of conducting research. Any changes should have been dealt with prior to conducting the research.</p>
                            <p>There are a number of measures to be taken to prevent or partly correct such distortions, but remember prevention is better than cure. Cure implies surgery. You may have to cut down parts of your data or at best, devise crutches.</p>
                            <p>There are several ways of ensuring data quality. Prepare a fieldwork manual for the research team as a whole. The manual should include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Guidelines on sampling procedures and what to do if respondents are not available or refuse to cooperate.</li>
                                <li>A clear explanation of the purpose and procedures of the study. This should be used as an introduction before each interview.</li>
                                <li>Instruction sheets on how to ask certain questions and how to record the answers.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Ensure that you select your research assistants, if required, with care. Choose assistants who are of the same educational level, familiar with the topic and the local conditions, but are not the subject of study themselves and are not biased concerning the topic.</p>
                            <p>You should train research assistants carefully in all topics covered in the fieldwork manual as well as in interview techniques. Make sure all members of the research team master techniques such as:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Asking questions in a neutral manner.</li>
                                <li>Not showing, by words or expressions, what answers one expects to hear.</li>
                                <li>Not showing agreement, disagreement or surprise.</li>
                                <li>Recording answers precisely as they are provided, without sifting through them or interpreting them.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You should also pre-test research instruments and research procedures with the whole research team, including research assistants. Take care that research assistants are not placed under too much stress, for example, too many interviews a day.</p>
                            <p>Arrange for ongoing supervision of research assistants. If you are carrying out a substantially large survey, special supervisors may have to be appointed with supervisory guidelines.</p>
                            <p>It is also important to devise methods to ensure that the data collected by all members of the research team is of quality. You can do this by:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Having interviewers check whether the questionnaire is filled in completely before finishing each interview.</li>
                                <li>Asking the supervisors to check at the end of each day during the data collection period whether the questionnaires are filled in completely and whether the recorded information makes sense.</li>
                                <li>Having the researchers review the data during the data analysis stage to check whether data is complete and consistent.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Stage Three: Data Handling</h3>
                            <p>Once the data has been collected, a clear procedure should be developed for handling and storing it. The following should act as guidelines:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Check that the data gathered is complete and accurate.</li>
                                <li>At some stage questionnaires will have to be numbered. Decide if this should be done at the time of the interview or when the questionnaires are stored.</li>
                                <li>Identify the person responsible for storing data and the place where it will be stored.</li>
                                <li>Decide how data should be stored. Record forms should be kept in the sequence in which they have been numbered.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Data Entry</h4>
                            <p>There are several factors you need to consider when entering your data. First, you will need to decide on a format, that is, the way you will organise the data in a file. Next, you will need to design a code, that is, the rules by which the respondents' answers will be assigned values that can be processed by the computer.</p>
                            <p>After this you then do the actual coding, that is, turn the responses into the standard categories you developed in your coding system. Data entry is the next step, which is keying the data into the computer so that you can process it. Finally, data cleaning is the final check you make on the data file for accuracy, completeness, and consistency prior to the onset of analysis.</p>

                            <div class="callout callout--tip">
                                <p>You should always ensure that your data collection process is ethical in all respects.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>In order to ensure that your data collection process is ethical, you should consider the following points:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>How have you planned to obtain informed consent from your informants?</li>
                                <li>Are there any categories of informants that need special consideration because of their vulnerable status, for example, children, sick persons, and mentally disabled individuals?</li>
                                <li>Are certain parts of the research focussed on sensitive issues?</li>
                                <li>How will you handle problems that may arise?</li>
                                <li>Do certain parts of your research require extra attention to assure confidentiality?</li>
                                <li>How will you handle this issue?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Once you have answered all these questions you are well on your way to ensuring that high ethical standards are maintained throughout the course of your research project.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Training of Interviewers</h3>
                            <p>During the fieldwork, interviews or research assistants may work independently or with one of the researchers. If research assistants are to go out into the field independently, they may have to carry out the following tasks:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Do sampling in the field, for example, sampling households.</li>
                                <li>Give clear introductions to the interviewee concerning the purpose and procedures of the interview.</li>
                                <li>Perform the interview. It is important to give interviewers a standard questionnaire to administer. However, it is not wise to assign difficult tasks, like Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), to research assistants.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It is, therefore, imperative that you properly train interviewers so that they can carry out their tasks accurately and correctly, according to the procedures you have developed. They should never be left to develop their own procedures as this could potentially lead to bias. The training of interviewers may take 2-3 days. The first day should be devoted to theory, followed by one or two days of practical training, depending on the local circumstances and the nature of the study.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Theoretical Training</h4>
                            <p>Research assistants or interviewers must be thoroughly familiar with the research objectives and the methodology. They should, therefore, be provided with a copy of the research protocol. You, as the principle researcher, should discuss important sections of the protocol with them.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Statement of the problem</li>
                                <li>Objectives</li>
                                <li>Data collection tools to be used</li>

                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Practical Training</h4>
                            <p>Practical training in interviewing is very important. This may be provided in two stages. First, a role play can be performed during which one of the trainees assumes the role of an interviewer and the other plays the interviewee. Second, a field test should be conducted which will serve two purposes: the training of interviewers and as a test of the data collection tools.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Supervision of Interviewers</h4>
                            <p>If interviewers are used, the responsibility for the research remains with the principle researcher. To guarantee the quality of the data collected:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>It is important to supervise the performance of the interviewers, especially at the beginning of the data collection period.</li>
                                <li>If they are to go out into the field independently, plans should be made to visit them on different occasions.</li>
                                <li>As a further quality check, it is important that each questionnaire carries the name or initials of the interviewer, so that it is possible to ask for clarification if certain information is not clear.</li>

In section two of this unit, you covered the major types of research, which you broadly classified as qualitative and quantitative. You also identified the specific characteristics of each type. In this part of the research process, you will look at how data from either type are presented and analysed.</p>

                            <p>The data presentation and analysis of qualitative research is quite different from that of presenting data collected when using the quantitative research method. This is because qualitative research uses words while quantitative uses numbers (numerical).</p>
                            
                            <p>However, the principles are the same for both types. In both cases the researcher has to do the following:</p>

                                    <strong>Organising the Data</strong>
                                    <p>The data collected through qualitative techniques is usually quite large, therefore, the researcher will need to put all this information in a simple format that can be understood. This is known as 'cleaning' the data.</p>

                                    <strong>Creating Categories, Themes and Patterns</strong>
                                    <p>Since the notes from interviews and focus group discussions are not well organised and tend to be fragmented, there is need to put them into categories, themes and patterns. The researcher needs to be very familiar with the data so as to establish relationships among these categories. One way to achieve this is using the research questions or discussion topics. The researcher may need to put this into matrix form on which the data can be displayed.</p>

                                    <strong>Analysing and Interpreting the Data</strong>
                                    <p>Once themes, categories and patterns have been identified, the researcher then evaluates the data to determine its usefulness and accuracy. It is important to note that there are nowadays computer programs that can be used to generate themes and categories. You have to follow the set research objectives when analysing and evaluating the data.</p>

                                    <p>It is important to appreciate that unlike the quantitative research where the report writing is done after analysing the data, in qualitative research techniques, the writing and the analysis go hand in hand.</p>

                            <p>So far you have seen how qualitative data is analysed and presented in a research report. You will now look at how to analyse and present quantitative data. You will note that here the raw data you collect will usually be in the form of numbers. The process of organising, summarising and visualising quantitative data is referred to as 'descriptive statistics' (Eden, 2003: 211).</p>
                            <p>The purpose of descriptive statistics is to help the researcher to visualise and identify the patterns that may emerge from the data collected. This will, in turn, assist the researcher in making meaningful conclusions from the results of the study. The main types of descriptive statistics are mode, median, mean and measures of central tendency among others. Refer to module three where these types have already been covered.</p>
                            <p>In presenting quantitative data, it is very important that you use what is referred to as dummy tables. A dummy table contains all the characteristics of a table but the cells are left empty. Dummy tables are usually constructed during the planning stage of data collection. This helps the researcher visualise how to organise the data and put it in a summarised format. Dummy tables can be used for depicting simple data as well as complex data that could be used for cross tabulation.</p>
                            
                            <p>In presenting data you can use some of the following methods detailed on the next page in order to make sense of what the results mean.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Tabular Method</h4>
                            <p>As the name suggests, this is where data is presented in tables. Depending on your skills in research and the type of study you have carried out, there are various tabular methods that you could use.</p>

                            <h5>Simple Table</h5>
                            <p>This is usually a single line of characters explaining a few columns of information.</p>

                                <li>You give correct consecutive numbers to the tables and indicate the title of the table at the top.</li>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Graphic Method</h4>
                            <p>Another format for presenting research data is the graphic method. In this method graphs are used to organise and describe data. This enables the reader to see at a glance the trend of distribution of the data. Graphs have two axes: vertical and horizontal. Scores are usually presented along the horizontal axis, while the frequency is placed along the vertical axis. It is important to note that the intersection point between the vertical and horizontal axes is usually represented by a zero (0). Graphs should be well labelled both along the vertical axis and the horizontal. There are three common graphic methods that you may use for presenting your data.</p>
                            
                            <p>These are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Bar Charts</li>
                                <li>Histograms</li>
                                <li>Frequency Polygons</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>Bar Charts</h5>
                            <p>Bar charts are used when the data being presented is discrete or when the scale is nominal. Bar charts are quite similar to histograms with the exception that there are spaces in bar charts.</p>

                            <p>Frequency polygons are drawn based on the frequencies of the observations along the vertical axis against the group or class midpoints. They form a polygon shape hence the name.</p>

                            <p>The significance of conducting research is to communicate and share the research findings. If you do not disseminate the findings of your study, then nobody will know what the outcome of the study was. There are various ways of communicating the research findings. They include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>A written report for academic purposes, for example, a dissertation or a thesis, which are a requirement in the obtaining of a certain academic level.</li>
                                <li>A written report prepared for managers and policy implementers (some of whom have no knowledge of research methodology). In such reports you need to have a very clear and succinct report without the academic jargons.</li>
                                <li>A written report sent as an article for publication in refereed journals.</li>
                                <li>Presentations of the research findings in workshops, seminars and conferences.</li>
                            </ul>

                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Abstract</h4>
                            <p>The abstract is a very brief summary of the study that includes the purpose of the study, methodology and the major research findings. It should not be longer than one page.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Introduction</h4>
                            <p>In the introduction you need to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Introduce the reader to the problem to be dealt with.</li>
                                <li>Briefly, but clearly, explain the purpose of the study.</li>
                                <li>Emphasise the importance of the study.</li>

                                <li>State clearly the hypothesis as well as the objectives or research questions of the study.</li>
                                <li>Describe the nature of the research study and the context within which the study has been carried out.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Background Information</h4>
                            <p>Here you have to explain where the study took place and expound on any special circumstances of the study and study area.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Literature Review</h4>
                            <p>The literature review provides an overview of current knowledge of the problem under research. The researcher should be able to show a grasp of the theory applications and apply the knowledge to the research.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">The Methodology</h4>
                            <p>Here, you provide information on how the research was carried out. Include enough details to enable another researcher to replicate your research. The methods section incorporates the following aspects:</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>(i) Subjects, respondents or participants</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>(ii) The task and the material or instruments used. This should include:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Description of all types of activities that the participants were asked to perform, for example, filling in a questionnaire, participating in a focus group discussion.</li>
                                <li>A list of materials and/or instruments used. Give the main characteristics of the questionnaire, for example open-ended, closed questions and so on.</li>
                                <li>Description of the considerations, which led to this choice and how validity and reliability were ensured.</li>
                                <li>All questionnaires or interview schedules should be included in an appendix.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(iii) The research design and strategy. Here you have to:</strong></p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Specify the chosen design.</li>
                                <li>Outline and explain choices which lay behind strategy decisions.</li>
                                <li>Analyse the data obtained.</li>
                                <li>Give an account of the methods used to analyse data.</li>
                                <li>If a statistical design was used, discuss the statistical tests applied to the obtained data to test the various hypotheses.</li>
                                <li>Explain procedures for handling missing data.</li>
                                <li>Justify the validity and reliability of the scores.</li>
                                <li>Outline the reasons why specific statistical tests were used.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Results</h4>
                            <p>The results section presents the findings and involves the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The main results from the data analysis.</li>
                                <li>If a quantitative study was done, tables, graphs and diagrams and the outcomes of statistical tests. In a qualitative study, findings are usually presented in terms of the themes, which emerged from the data and, by way of substantiation and illustration, examples of raw data will be given. For example, direct quotes from an interview transcription, or accounts of observation.</li>
                                <li>In quantitative studies you must also give the name of any statistical test used as well as the value of the calculated statistics and its significance. Accuracy and conciseness must be adhered to throughout.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Discussion</h4>
                            <p>According to Brink (1996) the discussion of the study incorporates the following elements:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>An interpretation of the findings, with specific reference to validity and reliability. A well developed discussion makes sense of the research results, and must be presented in precise and concise language. In the discussion section, you have to re-state the research questions and hypotheses, and discuss the results with reference to these questions or hypotheses in the order they were posed.</li>
                                <li>Conclusions related to questions raised in the introduction of the study.</li>
                                <li>Study limitations. Here the limitations of the study should be identified and you should defend the validity of the findings in the light of these limitations. Limitations include factors such as the inherent weakness in the sampling method, faulty designs and controls, weaknesses in the methods used to collect data and so forth. Here you have the opportunity to recommend ways to minimise or eliminate the limitations of the current study and to offer alternative methodology or improvements of the methods of the study presented.</li>
                                <li>Generalisations of the research findings. Indicate whether you found what you had expected and how the present results relate to previous research. Connect the findings with similar studies. If any unexpected, inconclusive or contradictory results were obtained, discuss possible reasons for such outcomes.</li>
                                <li>Suggestions and recommendations. Here you have to relate your findings to the questions raised in the introduction. In addition, if you came up with any recommendations as a result of your study, this is the place to state them. You may also give some suggestions concerning further research.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="card-title">References and Bibliography</h4>
                            <p>Present your references and bibliography in the standard manner.</p>
                            <p>You can follow the way these are given in your student handbook, or follow any other format specific to your institution. Whatever format you are using, however, you need to remember that all your entries should be made in a consistent manner. Check that the names of authors included in your reference list, are actually mentioned within the text.</p>
