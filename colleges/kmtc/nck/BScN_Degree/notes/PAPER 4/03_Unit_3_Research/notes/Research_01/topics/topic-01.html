                            <p>In this unit you will cover the basic concepts of research, which will include definition, purpose, and contribution of research in the nursing profession. You will also look at the research process, which includes the identification of a researchable topic and developing appropriate research objectives, hypothesis and questions as well as a review of literature that is relevant to your research topic and the research methodology. It also includes data collection, analysis and writing the research report. You will also look at how to develop and implement a research proposal.</p>
                            
                            <p>This unit is composed of four sections and an assignment:</p>

This is because you will not only use it in the planning, implementation and evaluation of your patient's care, but also in the organisation and improvement of the entire health care service countrywide.

                            <p>There are several ways to define the word 'research'. For instance, Treece and Treece (1982, cited in Cormack) define research in its broadest sense as an attempt to gain solutions to problems. More precisely, it is the collection of data in a rigorously controlled situation for the purpose of prediction or explanation. Some writers argue that this definition is not adequate since not all researchers will be finding solutions to problems. Neither does all research need to be carried out in a rigorously controlled situation such as in a laboratory. This is just an indication for you to appreciate how difficult it is to get one single definition of the word 'research'.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Scientific Definition of Research</h3>
                            <p>According to Burns and Grove (1999: 3), the word 'research' means 'to search again' or 'to examine carefully'. More specifically, research is diligent, systematic inquiry or study to validate and refine existing knowledge and develop new knowledge. This definition indicates some of the functions of research. It further explains the word 'research' in its literal use and its scientific use at the same time. Take for instance, the terms 'search again' or 'examine carefully'. This means the researcher (the person carrying out the research) has to search for the facts over and over again. They have to re-examine all facts at hand carefully.</p>
                            
                            <p>Similarly as Burns and Grove (1999) indicate 'diligence' and 'systematic study' will include certain activities, such as planning, organisation and persistence. Research is meant to validate, that is, prove or disprove existing knowledge or information. For instance, if a certain nursing practice is to be evaluated, then a researcher will need to investigate it and see whether the specific practice is still relevant or needs modification. It is also important to note that in research 'the systematic study' must use the scientific process.</p>

                            <p>Having covered and defined the term 'research', it is now important for you to define 'nursing research'. As with the definition of research, there is no single definition for nursing research, either. However, for the purposes of this unit, you will use the following definition by Cormark (1991:5), which states that nursing research is defined as research into those aspects of professional activity, which are predominantly and appropriately the concern and responsibility of nurses.</p>

                                    <p>As indicated here, research can be nursing research only when it addresses issues that are relevant to the nursing profession. If the topic is not going to have an impact on the nursing practice, it is not nursing research. Thus, it is important to understand that in order to define your research as nursing research; your study must be geared towards improving certain aspects of the nursing practice, education and administration.</p>

                            <p>However, this does not mean that nurses cannot venture into other non-nursing research. Nurses can undertake any type of research but if they would like to carry out nursing research, then the study should be relevant to the nursing profession.</p>

                            <p>Now that you have identified a general definition of research and a specific definition of nursing research, your next step is to find out what nursing research entails and whether nurses really need to do research.</p>
                            
                            <p>In module one, you covered professionalism in nursing. You learnt that for a profession to be recognised, it must have its own knowledge base. You might have also learnt that a large portion of knowledge in nursing is either borrowed from other professions or is based on traditions, beliefs and instincts that, for the most part, have not been validated by empirical studies.</p>
                            
                            <p>In order for the nursing profession to have its own body of knowledge, its professional practice must be based on a sound knowledge developed through scientific research. The knowledge base should come from the various aspects of nursing education, nursing management, nursing practice or from general nursing experience.</p>
                            
                            <p>Nursing research is not an old subject even though nurses have made tremendous achievements in the area in the last few decades.</p>
                            
                            <p>Initially, nursing research in the early part of the 20th century concentrated on nursing education and the role of nursing and nurses. However, as nurses became aware and acquainted themselves with the importance of research, there has been an increased number of studies targeted at clinical nursing problems (Burns & Grove, 1999).</p>
                            
                            <p>This started in the 1970s and to-date clinical oriented research problems continue to be the main focus of research for nurses. The importance of nurses' involvement in research is that it enhances the development of the knowledge base of the nursing profession. Research findings aim to develop and refine scientific knowledge for use in practice (Burns & Grove, 1999). Thus, while nursing research is mainly concerned with investigating areas of significance to the nursing profession, it is nonetheless, limited to nursing and nurses although they are at liberty to engage in research on non-nursing areas.</p>

In answering this question, you can look at some suggestions offered by some nursing researchers. A good example is Burns & Grove (1999), who state that nursing research helps in:</p>

                                <li><strong>Explaining</strong> certain nursing practices, for instance, the relationship between specific variables (characteristics or attributes).</li>
                                <li><strong>Predicting</strong> the outcome of nursing activities undertaken by nurses and other health workers.</li>
