                            <p>It is important to appreciate that the various steps of the research process are not delineated from each other as such, but indeed cyclical in nature, whereby one step leads to the other for its effectiveness. Likewise, it is important to note that researchers have greatly differed in their estimate of the number of steps the research process should consist of. Most researchers have given steps ranging in number from between ten to sixteen.</p>
                            
                            <p>Despite the large difference in the number of steps that should constitute the research process, the majority of researchers do agree on four general phases of the research process. Brink (1996:56) listed the following four phases as being key to the research process</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>The conceptual phase, also called the thinking or planning phase.</li>
                                <li>The empirical phase, also called the doing phase.</li>
                                <li>The interpretive phase, or the phase where the researcher looks at the meaning of it all.</li>
                                <li>The communication phase or the phase of writing and disseminating the research report.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>You will now further sub-divide these phases into ten steps for the purpose of your study and look at each step in detail.</p>

                            <p>Having identified some of the characteristics of good nursing research, you need also to learn how to identify a researchable topic. For a researcher to identify a good research topic they will require first to list down some of the topics or problems that need to be investigated. It is important to put this in order of priority and then analyse each topic or problem individually.</p>
                            
                            <p>A research problem is an issue that requires a solution. It could, for instance, involve looking at why certain things are done the way they are done and not the other way round. In actual fact, a research problem endeavours to answer or address a specific problem or situation. In nursing research the issue that needs to be addressed should be one related to the nursing profession.</p>

                            <p>You will note that your research starts with the identification of a research problem, which you feel is serious and important enough for you to spend your time researching. This research problem then becomes your research topic and will become the title of your research paper.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">What are some of the criteria you should look for when identifying a research topic?</h3>
                            <p>There are certain characteristics or criteria that a good research topic in nursing should possess to ensure that the study is relevant not only to the nursing practice but also to the entire health care delivery system.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>Improve nursing services by contributing to more knowledge and better skills.</li>
                                <li>Enhance existing knowledge by filling in gaps that exist.</li>
                                <li>Encourage more research on already existing nursing theories.</li>
                                <li>Address current concerns or priority areas in nursing.</li>
                                <li>Pay more attention to ethical issues (this will be discussed in detail later).</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>In addition to this, the researcher undertaking the study should have the necessary knowledge and skills. They should also be accorded the necessary resources such as money, manpower, materials and access to the research subjects.</p>
                            <p>These characteristics are of great significance to the researcher because when adhered to, they ensure that the study is well defined and hence feasible to undertake. It is important to point out that this list is not exhaustive and, as you progress with your research readings, you will learn to identify other important characteristics that a good research topic should have.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">How can you identify an appropriate research topic?</h3>
                            <p>Interestingly, among all researchers there is no way to find a researchable topic without having experienced the problem or read about it. It is obvious that, one way or the other, there must be a need/problem that the researcher has experienced and hence feels the need to seek a solution to. It is also possible that research topics are usually derived from problems, but at times, point the way towards making certain changes or modifications from an existing situation.</p>
                            
                            <p>According to Collins et al (2000), there are three major possible areas that researchers may draw on for their research topics.</p>
                            <p>A researcher may draw research topics from:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Existing professional knowledge and experience.</strong> It is highly possible that in the course of your work, you have faced several questions that you would like to find answers for. This is indeed the most common source of an appropriate research topic.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Socially significant issues</strong>, that is, the research topic has practical relevance and significance to the society. Here, you as the researcher have to identify the implications of the study to the society. For instance, the study could be in a position to solve an existing and pressing social problem. You as the nurse in-charge of a health centre might have realised that since the introduction of cost-sharing exercises, not many of the low income members of the community are coming for treatment to the health centre. You may decide to find out why and propose a solution to the problem.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>The study must have scientific relevance and significance as well.</strong> It is important to show that the research will, at the end, have academic and/or scientific relevance. This could be used for improving or modifying patients' care.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Therefore, when identifying a possible research topic, look at some of the above factors or others that you think are important for the relevance of your study.</p>

                            <p>It focuses on identification and description of variables and/or determination of the relationships among variables. Research objectives and questions are important for several reasons.</p>
                            
                            <p>Research objectives help to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                <li>Build a close link with the statement of the problem.</li>
                                <li>Keep the researcher within the scope of study by defining the area of focus.</li>

                            <p>Once the researcher has formulated appropriate objectives, the next move is to formulate relevant research question(s). It is important to understand that without a clearly and well-defined research question, it will be difficult to complete the research process. Sometimes inexperienced researchers find it difficult to formulate questions. Questions can be derived from:</p>

                            <p>Having defined and understood the research objectives and research questions, the other concept that you may need to develop during your research is the research hypothesis because not all research is tenable to hypothesis testing, hence some research may include hypotheses while others will not.</p>
                            <p>Most of the descriptive studies do not have a hypothesis to test but they generate hypothesis. Experimental studies have hypothesis to test.</p>

                            <p>Brink (1996:91) defines a hypothesis as ‘the formulation of the expected relationship between two or more variables in a specific population’. It is the researcher’s prediction or explanation of the relationships between two variables. For example:</p>
                            <div class="callout callout--note">
                                <p>Persons with Type II diabetes mellitus who have greater knowledge of their diseases will have a higher rate of adherence to treatment regimen than those with less knowledge.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>In the example given, the predicted relationship is between ‘knowledge’ and ‘adherence to treatment regimen’. Hypotheses are applied in quantitative studies in order to guide the study, for example, quasi-experimental and experimental studies. A hypothesis is usually tested and, subsequently either rejected or fail to be rejected by the researcher. The hypothesis helps the study in suggesting prediction, explaining outcome and in guiding the investigation to provide a focus.</p>

                            <p>As you may have observed, when looking at the research questions and research hypothesis, reference was made several times to the term ‘variables’. You, therefore, need to define what a variable is. Variables are defined as quality, properties or characteristics of persons, things or situation that change or vary. For example: sex (male and female) age (20–25, 26–30 years) academic success, stress and pain. There are four main types of variables that you may come across as a research student.</p>
