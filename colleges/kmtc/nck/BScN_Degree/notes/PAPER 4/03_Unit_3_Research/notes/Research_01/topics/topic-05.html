                            <p>The process of identifying the appropriate sampling techniques is very important in the research process. However, it is impossible to collect data from the whole population that a researcher may be interested in or intends to investigate. Since the essence of any research is to investigate a particular population, the selection of a representative sample from the specific population is vital. The type of sampling method a researcher uses will depend mainly on the type of research one intends to undertake, the methodology to be applied and the time available for the tasks. Sampling pertains to the identification of the study subjects from the general population a researcher is interested in. A researcher uses a specific sampling strategy because it is the most 'feasible and logical way of making a statement about a larger group' (Rensburg 2000:149).</p>
                            
                            <p>According to Brink (1996) and Rensburg (2000) state, before discussing the type of sampling strategies available, one needs to define certain important terms that are associated with sampling methods.</p>

                                    <strong>Population</strong><br>
                                    Population is defined as 'the entire group of persons or set of objects and events the researcher wants to study' (Rensburg 2000:147). It is also referred to as all the possible entities or individuals that have the characteristic(s) of interest to the study. The most important aspect is that the population must possess all the characteristics the researcher is interested in.

                                    <strong>Sample</strong><br>
                                    A sample is a group of people, or records or a number of observations from a larger population. It is a representative group of individuals selected form a population. A sample aids the researcher to get access to the general population. A sample that is selected appropriately generates data that reflects the true status of the population in relation to the characteristic(s) or variables under study.

                                    <strong>Sampling Frame</strong><br>
                                    Sampling frame is a comprehensive list of all the sampling elements in the target population, for example, the list of nurses working in a particular district, the number of under five children in a village or all the households in a village. An important point to note is that it is not always possible to get a sampling frame. In this case it becomes incumbent on the researcher to prepare their own sampling frame.

                                    <strong>Representative Sample</strong><br>
                                    A representative sample means that the sample resembles the population from which it is drawn in all aspects. It should possess all the variables a researcher is interested in, for example, educational level, socioeconomic factors, exposure to certain illness and so on.

                                    <strong>Sampling Bias</strong><br>
                                    Sampling bias occurs when the researcher has not carefully selected the samples that are expected to represent the general target population. It is usually the fault of the researcher and can have a negative impact on the entire findings of the research (Rensburg, 2000 and Brink, 1996). Causes of sampling bias could arise from the data collection process, for example, what time of the day the data was collected, languages of communication or how the data was collected.

                                    According to Rensburg (2000:151) sampling error refers to the difference between population parameters (for example, the average age of the population) and the sample statistics (for example, the average age of the sample group). It is the degree of deviation of the sample from the population from which it was drawn.

                            <p>There are two basic sampling techniques:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Probability or random sampling</li>

                            </ul>

                            <h4 class="card-title" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Probability Sampling</h4>
                            <p>Probability sampling allows for a much more representative sample of the population and enables the estimation of sampling error. It also enables the calculation of differential statistics and allows the study to be generalised to other areas.</p>
                            <p>Random sampling should take into account knowledge of every element of the population and the availability of a list of all those eligible to make a random selection.</p>
                            <p>Probability sampling involves a random selection procedure to ensure that each unit of the sample is chosen on the basis of chance. All units of the study population have an equal or at least a known chance of being included in the sample from list provided (Hardon et al., 1995).</p>
                            <p>The following include some of the commonly used probability sampling techniques.</p>

                                    <strong>Simple Random Sampling</strong>
                                    <p>Simple Random Sampling is one of the commonest and the simplest methods of sampling. In simple random sampling, each unit (subject) has the chance to be selected. It involves one stage selection. It also allows the researcher access to the study population. Various ways of selecting the subjects exist among which are:</p>
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li>Identifying the specific target population.</li>
                                        <li>Formulating an appropriate sampling frame.</li>
                                        <li>Determining the sample size for the study.</li>
                                        <li>Adapting a consecutive identification number for each unit in the sampling frame.</li>
                                        <li>Selecting the desired subjects using a randomised technique.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>There are several ways of selecting a random sample using this technique. These include, the lottery method, use of random tables, or tossing a coin to help you decide where and how to start.</p>
                                    <p>For example, if you need to select 30 subjects from a sampling frame of 100, you get 100 pieces of papers and write 'Yes' on 30 of them and 'No' on the rest. You then ask all the 100 subjects to pick a piece of paper each. Those who pick 'Yes' are included in the study.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Systematic or Interval Sampling</strong>
                                    <p>Systematic sampling is the selection of every \( n^{\text{th}} \) element from a sampling frame, where \( n \), the sampling interval, is calculated as:</p>
                                    <p>\[ n = \text{number in population or number in sample} \]</p>
                                    <p>Using this procedure each element in the population has a known and equal probability of selection. This makes systematic sampling functionally similar to simple random sampling. It is however, much more efficient and much less expensive to do.</p>
                                    <div class="callout callout--note">
                                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> For example, suppose you intend to interview 200 KRCHN in-service students out of a total of 2000. To get the sampling interval you would divide the total number of students with the desired sample size, that is, \( 2000 / 200 = 10 \). Your sampling interval is 10, that is, in a list of 2000 students you will pick every \( 10^{\text{th}} \) student.</p>
                                        <p>The next step is to decide your starting point. You may use simple random method to do this by writing the numbers 1 to 10 on 10 different pieces of paper. Ask someone to pick any of the pieces and the number that is picked will be your starting point. If 8 becomes the \( 1^{\text{st}} \) person, then every \( 10^{\text{th}} \) person, that is, \( 18^{\text{th}}, 28^{\text{th}}, 38^{\text{th}} \) and so on is picked for the study.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Stratified Random Sampling</strong>
                                    <p>When sub-populations vary considerably, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently. Stratification is the process of grouping members of the population into relatively homogeneous subgroups, for example, by education level, socioeconomic structure and so on before sampling. The strata should be mutually exclusive, that is, every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. The strata should also be collectively exhaustive, that is, no population element can be excluded. Random sampling is then applied within each stratum. This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error.</p>
                                    <p>For example, you may wish to conduct a study on contraceptive use in a community and you realise you need to stratify the subjects based on their religious beliefs, being a significant characteristic or variable in decision on usage of contraceptives. This calls for you to divide your desired sample into strata on religious lines, for example, Christians Protestants, Christian Catholics, Christians others, Muslims, Hindu and Buddhists just to mention a few. Each strata is then apportioned a sample size based on the proportion of the number of the people from that religious affiliation in the population. If Protestants are 40%, Catholics 30%, others 5%, Muslims 20% and so on, the samples are apportioned based on those percents.</p>

                                    <strong>Cluster Sampling</strong>
                                    <p>Cluster sampling is a sampling technique used when 'natural' groupings are evident in the population. The total population is divided into these groups (or clusters), and a sample of the groups is selected. The required information is then collected from the elements within each selected group. This may be done for every element in these groups, or a subsample of elements may be selected within each of these groups.</p>
                                    <p>Elements within a cluster should ideally be as homogeneous as possible. However, there should be heterogeneity between clusters. Each cluster should be a small scale version of the total population. The clusters should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. A random sampling technique is then used on any relevant clusters to choose which clusters to include in the study.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Non Probability Sampling</h4>
                            <p>There are two principle methods of non probability sampling. These are known as purposive or judgmental sampling and quota sampling.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Purposive or Judgmental Sampling</strong>
                                    <p>Purposive or judgmental sampling is where the researcher selects a particular group or groups based on certain criteria (Wilson, 1993:179). In this method the researcher determines who should be included in the study. It is, in fact, the researcher's opinion that the sample is representative of the target population.</p>
                                    <p>Purposive sampling is commonly used in qualitative studies. The main advantage of this method of sampling is that it gives the researcher a free hand to respond according to their judgment. Disadvantages include sampling biases, the possibility of unrepresentative samples and lack of generalisations of the study findings.</p>

                                    <strong>Quota Sampling</strong>
                                    <p>In quota sampling, the population is first segmented into mutually exclusive sub-groups, just as in stratified sampling. Then judgement is used to select the subjects or units from each segment based on a specified proportion. For example, an interviewer may be told to sample 200 females and 300 males between the age of 45 and 60.</p>

                                    <strong>Convenience or Accidental Sampling</strong>
                                    <p>Convenience sampling is also referred to as accidental or availability sampling. In convenience sampling the researcher is unable to control bias at all. This is a method in which, for convenience sake, the study units that happen to be available at the time of data collection are selected and used as a sample (Hardson et al 1995:207).</p>
                                    <p>This type of sampling allows the utilisation of any available target population. For example, if you need to assess the blood pressure of females using depo provera who are above 40 years of age, you will need to check the blood pressure of any female patient above this age irrespective of her parity or other characteristics. In such circumstances there is no sample representation.</p>

                                    <strong>Snow Ball Sampling</strong>
                                    <p>In social science research, snowball sampling is a technique for developing a research sample where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances. Thus the sample group appears to grow like a rolling snowball. This sampling technique is often used in hidden populations which are difficult for researchers to access. Example populations include drug users and commercial sex workers. Sample members are not selected from a sampling frame, therefore, snowball samples are subject to numerous biases. For example, people who have many friends are more likely to be recruited into the sample.</p>

                            <p>In order to gain access to a research population, there is need to specify how you as the researcher achieved this goal. You need to describe how the research areas were identified, the selection process involved, the type of sampling method used and how you managed to gain access to the specific research participants. You will also have to specify some of the ethical considerations involved and how these are professionally managed before the respondents take part in the study.</p>
                            
                            <p>Prior to commencing the study, you as the researcher should make a formal application to the government of Kenya for permission to conduct the research. This should include two or more copies of the research proposal, accompanied by a recommendation letter from the supervisor(s) as required by the Kenyan authorities. Similarly, if your institution is authorised to conduct research, there may be a 'Research and Ethics Committee'. Such a committee is usually vested with the authority of granting research permits, which you could use. Once the authority to conduct the study in the form of a 'Research Clearance Permit' has been granted, the researcher then reports to the 'District Commissioner (DC) of the area'. The DC will then instruct you to report to the District Officer (DO) of your research area. The DO may further require you to report to the area local chief and assistant chiefs. When the above administrative requirement is completed, the researcher then approaches the village leader to grant further access to the respective villagers.</p>
                            
                            <p>As a requirement, each research respondent should be requested to accept in writing and sign or affix a thumb print.

                            <h4 class="card-title">What are some of the advantages of reviewing existing data?</h4>
                            <p>The review of existing records has several advantages. Data collection in any study entails heavy costs in terms of time and money. By reviewing existing data, you should be able to save time and money (Treece and Treece, 1986). For example, if you were to carry out a large scale field survey to determine the national immunisation coverage in Kenya. You would not only require an immense amount of funds but also adequate time to undertake the survey. By reviewing existing data, you the researcher, saves both time and money.</p>
                            <p>Every researcher endeavours to limit respondent bias. Existing data utilises records, which are unbiased, as the person who collected the data had no knowledge of the future use to which it would be put. Additionally, existing records cover a long period of time, which is particularly useful to the researcher who can only dedicate a short time to their research.</p>
                            <p>Existing records also save the researcher from the worries and concerns of seeking the cooperation of the respondents. When you set out to collect data from a respondent for a study, you have to obtain informed consent from the respondent or guardian, where the respondent is a minor or mentally incapable of making decisions. When reviewing existing records, all that you require is the authority to access relevant records, since the data has already been collected.</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="card-title">What are the disadvantages of existing records or data?</h4>
                            <p>Pre-existing data also has its share of shortcomings. Most notably, since the researcher is not responsible for the collection and recording of the data, limiting biases and even ascertaining the authenticity of the data would be difficult. This can often result in doubts about the validity of the data.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Structured Interview Schedule</h3>
                            <p>A structured interview schedule is a formal and written document where questions are asked orally in either face-to-face or telephone interviews.</p>
                            <p>The responses are then recorded by the researcher (Bogdan and Biklen, 1992; Oppenheim, 1993). The main advantage of a highly structured questionnaire is that it provides comparability of responses and facilitates analysis (Polit and Hungler, 1993). Highly structured instruments are quite common in quantitative research methods where the application of statistical tests is used to predict the reliability and validity of the data.</p>
                            <p>The interview schedule is one of the structured instruments used by researchers for collecting data. It is commonly used in telephone interviews but is also applicable to a special category of respondents, such as children, the elderly and the illiterate who may not be able to read and write (Oppenheim, 1993). The instrument is expected to have a high response rate, since the researcher administers it personally. An interview schedule also has the advantage of capturing the respondent's own words.</p>
                            <p>Despite the aforementioned advantages, the instrument has several limitations that the researcher should be aware of. The instrument demands a much longer time to complete than other instruments, such as questionnaires. In addition, due to the presence of the researcher, respondents may withhold certain vital information or even change information to please the researcher.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Focus Group Discussions</h3>
                            <p>According to Polit and Hungler, (1993:202) 'Focus group interviews are interviews with groups of 5-15 people whose opinions and experiences are solicited simultaneously. The advantage of a focus group discussion is that it is efficient and can generate dialogue. Focus group discussions have the ability to generate information from the group members. The composition of the group is usually limited to those with similar characteristics, such as socio economic status, so that the members feel free in contributing to the issue at hand. The instrument allows the members to share their views, experiences and opinions. The interpersonal interactions create a free and enjoyable environment.</p>
                            <p>Krueger (1994:6) notes that 'the discussion is comfortable and often enjoyable for the participants as they share their ideas and perceptions'. Group members influence each other by responding to the ideas and comments in the discussion.</p>
                            <p>Several advantages accrue from such an instrument. The instrument allows a large number of respondents to be interviewed at one go, which saves time and money. However, one major shortcoming is that the method, because of the number of respondents involved, calls for diligence and skill in ensuring that the process runs smoothly and yields the desired information.</p>
                            <p>Novice researchers often find this very difficult as the researcher is expected to exercise great care in ensuring that the discussion remains within context while at the same time limiting disruption of the discussion process.</p>

                            <p>The researcher can also utilise face-to-face in-depth interviews using semi-structured questionnaires for key informants. Key informant interviews are defined as interviews with people who have special positions in the community and whose opinions and experiences are seen as representative of a whole group. They often see the problems of a group rather than of an individual, making them a very useful group of people to interview.</p>
                            <p>Semi-structured questionnaires possess a flexibility that allows the researcher to gather in depth information. The instrument enables the participants to give responses in a narrative form and is quite useful in qualitative research (Polit and Hungler, 1993). The respondent takes the lead and determines the flow of the conversation, which is of great importance when new areas are to be investigated (Polit and Hungler, 1993). Key informant interviews provide valuable and independent information about the research population within a short span of time and save time and money. However, Polit and Hungler (1993) suggest that the main weakness of the instrument is that it requires the researcher to be very articulate.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Non Participatory Structured Observation</h3>
                            <p>Another instrument that can be used for data collection is non participatory, semi-structured observation. Non participatory observation is observing a given situation from the outside. The observer declares their intention to observe and goes ahead to watch the activities being carried out without asking questions or interfering in any way. As the activities to be observed progress, the observer remains in the background, keenly observing and noting down events without comment.</p>
                            <p>Polit and Hungler (1993: 220), with reference to the relevance of the observational method as a tool for generating data, state that: 'Observational methods have an intrinsic appeal with respect to their ability to capture a record of behaviours and events.'</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, there is virtually no other data collection method that can provide the depth and variety of information as observation. With this approach, the observers are used as measuring instruments and provide a uniquely sensitive and intelligent tool.</p>
                            
                            <p>Once you have generated the data, it is important to follow a structured method of data processing and entry. The following steps, adapted from Floyd and Fowler (1993:123), provide a useful guideline:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>Decide on a format, that is, the way the data will be organised in a file.</li>
                                <li>Design the code, that is, identify the rules by which respondent's answers will be assigned values that can be processed by a computer.</li>
                                <li>Code the data. This refers to the process of turning responses into standard categories.</li>
                                <li>Input data into the computer if you are going to use analytic software.</li>
                                <li>Completeness and consistency before analysis.</li>

                            <p>Before you carry out the full scale data collection process, it is important to conduct a trial to see whether the instruments that you will use for data collection are actually appropriate for the study and whether you are collecting the information you need. To achieve this, you have to carry out a pilot study or pre-test.</p>
                            <p>Researchers have given various definitions to these two terms.</p>
                            <p>A pilot study may be defined as 'a small version of a proposed study conducted to refine the methodology.' It is developed and conducted in a manner similar to the proposed study, using similar research respondents and the same setting. A pilot study may also be defined as 'the process of carrying out a preliminary study going through the entire research procedure with a small sample'.</p>
                            <p>A pre-test usually refers to a small scale trial of a particular research component. The above definitions illustrate why the two terms are used interchangeably.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Why do you need to carry out a pre-test?</h3>
                            <p>The following are some of the purposes of a pre-test or pilot study:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>To determine whether the proposed study is feasible</li>
                                <li>Identify any problems with the research design</li>
                                <li>To ensure that items in the data collection instrument are stated clearly and have the same meaning to all research respondents</li>
                                <li>To assess the time taken to administer the research instrument</li>
                                <li>Determine whether the sample is representative of the population</li>
                                <li>To determine the effectiveness of the sampling technique used</li>
                                <li>Give the researcher the real experience in the field</li>
                                <li>Determine the human and financial resources requirement for the study</li>
                                <li>Determine the effectiveness of the training given to research assistants where necessary</li>
                                <li>Evaluate the procedure for data processing and analysis</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 class="card-title">When is the appropriate time to conduct a pre-test?</h3>
                            <p>Ideally, a pre-test of data collection and data analysis procedures should be made before the actual full scale study. The advantages of conducting the pre-test before you finalise your proposal is that you can draft the work plan and budget based on realistic estimates, as well as revise the data collection tools before you submit your proposal for approval. The pre-test of the data collection instruments could be done either before training your research assistants or immediately after.</p>
                            <p>However, if this is not possible, for example, if the proposal is drafted far from the field, and there are no similar research settings available close to the drafting site, the field test may be done after finishing the proposal. However, it should be carried out long enough before the actual field work to allow for a thorough revision of data collection tools and procedures.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Using the Pre-Test Findings</h3>
                            <p>It is important that you, as a researcher, utilise appropriately the lessons learnt from the pre-test or pilot study. For instance:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Identify any sensitive or irrelevant items in the instruments and rectify them.</li>
                                <li>If there was any question that the interviewers had to repeat and explain several times for the respondents, this needs to be rectified.</li>
                                <li>Analyse the results of the pre-test or pilot study as it helps to develop dummy tables.</li>

                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>As you may have noted in the research process diagram, there is no specific step for 'Ethical Issues in Research'. This is because ethical issues cut across the whole research process.</p>
                            <p>Ethical considerations start right from the beginning when you are identifying your research problem and continue all the way to the dissemination of the research findings. However, for convenience and academic purposes, you will now look at ethical issues in research at this point</p>
                            <p>Mugenda and Mugenda (2003:190) describe ethics 'as that branch of philosophy which deals with one's conduct and serves as a guide to one's behaviour'. It is important to note that most professions, including nursing, have a code of conduct to which all members of the profession have to adhere. Similarly, Plooy (2003:118) describes ethics in research as 'that which is morally justifiable'. Research ethics fundamentally consists of collecting, analysing and interpreting data in a way that respects the rights of your participants and respondents.</p>
                            
                            <p>According to Brink (1996: 39), there are three basic ethical principles that guide researchers including nurse researchers. These are:</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Principle of Respect for Persons</strong>
                                    <p>This principle involves two main convictions:</p>
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li>Individuals are autonomous, that is, they have the right to self-determination and this right should be respected. This means the research respondents have the right to:
                                            <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 0.25rem;">
                                                <li>a) Accept or decline to participate in the study without punishment or prejudice</li>
                                                <li>b) Withdraw from the study at any stage</li>
                                                <li>c) Withhold information</li>
                                                <li>d) Seek clarification concerning the purpose of the study</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Individuals with diminished autonomy require protection. This group includes children, the mentally impaired, unconscious patients and institutionalised persons. For this group of persons, you will need to seek the consent of their legal guardian.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Principle of Justice</strong>
                                    <p>This includes the subjects' right to fair selection and treatment and their right to privacy:</p>
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li><strong>Right to Privacy:</strong> This is the freedom of an individual to determine the time, extent and the circumstances under which private information will be shared with or withheld from others. The privacy of the subject is considered to be protected if the subject is informed and consents to participate in a study and voluntarily shares private information with a researcher. An invasion of privacy occurs when private information is shared without the respondent's knowledge or against their will.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Right to Anonymity and Confidentiality:</strong> The research respondents have the right to anonymity and the right to assume that the data collected shall be kept confidential. Complete anonymity exists when the respondents' identity is not revealed and the information collected is not linked to the respondent. Confidentiality refers to the researcher's responsibility to protect all data gathered within the scope of the project from being divulged or made available to any other person, which means the research data should never be shared with outsiders. A breach of confidentiality can occur when a researcher allows an unauthorised person(s) to gain access to the raw data of a study or when the researcher accidentally reveals the identity of the research respondents.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Principle of Beneficence</strong>
                                    <p>This principle involves an effort to secure the well being of persons. It is the right to protect respondents from discomfort and harm. This principle states that one should do what is good and above all should do no harm. Discomfort and harm can be physical, emotional, spiritual, economic, social or legal.</p>
                                </li>

                            <h3 class="card-title">The Major Content of an Informed Consent</h3>
                            <p>Patients undergoing any operation are required to give informed consent. You may need to obtain informed consent from research respondents who take part in your research project. According Brink (1996:42), informed consent revolves around the following three major elements:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The type of information you need to obtain from the research subjects.</li>
                                <li>The degree of understanding required of the subject in order to give consent.</li>
                                <li>The fact that the subject has a free choice in giving consent.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Mugenda and Mugenda (2003:192) state that informed consent should be based on the following factors:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>The purpose of the research study</li>
