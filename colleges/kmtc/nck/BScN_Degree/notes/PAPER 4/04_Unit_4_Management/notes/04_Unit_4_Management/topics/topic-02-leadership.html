                            <p>The word leadership is an intriguing one and brings up images of all kinds of people. Some names that come to mind include former leaders like President Julius Nyerere, President Jomo Kenyatta and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. In nursing, Florence Nightingale may be considered an example of a leader in the profession.</p>
                            <p>You may also think of a relative or a nurse who has had notable leadership skills.</p>
                            <p>A leader is anyone who uses interpersonal skills to influence others to accomplish a specific goal. A leader can also be defined as a person who exerts influence by using certain personal behaviours and strategies or a person given authority by the statutes of an organisation to lead a group of people.</p>
                            <p>Leadership can be defined as 'the use of one's skills to influence others to perform to the best of their ability towards the achievement of goals' (Douglas, 1996). It is the art of getting others to want to do what one deems as important.</p>
                            <p>Leadership is not a fixed position. It is a process which changes on a situational basis. A manager leads by personally and actively working with subordinates for two main reasons:</p>

                                        <li>Managers think incrementally while leaders think radically</li>

                            <h3>Theories of Leadership</h3>
                            <p>Various writers have attempted to explain the theoretical basis for leaders and leadership. You will look at the two following theories in detail:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Trait Theory of Leadership</li>
                                <li>Situational or Contingency Theory of Leadership</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Trait Theory of Leadership</h4>
                            <p>This was the first theory to emerge and was studied from approximately 1900 to 1950. This theory states that leaders possess a set of physical and emotional characteristics that are important for inspiring others towards a common goal.</p>
                            <p>Some theorists who subscribe to this theory believe that leaders are born with certain qualities that determine leadership ability and success.</p>
                            <p>The leader is seen as gifted or develops certain characteristics including:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Physique, that is, weight, height.</li>
                                <li>Intellect, that is, knowledge, judgement.</li>
                                <li>Personality, that is, aggressiveness, dominance and authoritarianism.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>According to this theory, the leader behaves according to the role expectations of the group.</p>

                            <h4>Situational or Contingency Theory of Leadership</h4>
                            <p>This theory states that the effectiveness of leadership depends on the relationship among the leaders and the task at hand, interpersonal skills and the favourability of the work situation.</p>
                            <p>However, there are critical factors that must be considered in the above relationships, these include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The degree of trust and respect between the leader and follower</li>
                                <li>The clarity of goals to be accomplished</li>
                                <li>The ability of the leader to reward followers and exert influence</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>As a result of all the above, leaders were viewed as able to adapt their style according to the situation. For example, if one is faced with a specific situation, they consider the challenges and encourage an adaptive leadership style to understand the issue being faced. The implication here is that you, as a nurse manager, must assess each situation and determine appropriate action, based on the people involved.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Leadership Styles -->
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Leadership Styles</h3>
                            <p>The styles of leadership used by managers vary from organisation to organisation and are tailored to fit their needs and individual behaviour. There are too many kinds of leaders, personnel, tasks, organisations and environments for any one leadership style to apply.</p>
                            <p>There are three main styles of leadership, namely:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Authoritarian or Autocratic</strong>
                                    <p>In this leadership style, the leader assumes full responsibility for all decisions and actions. This style of leadership may be counter productive. It may cause employees to lose interest and initiative and stop thinking for themselves because there is no need for independent thought. It may also lead to loss of motivation, especially where employees find it necessary to adopt an attitude of obedience to an autocratic leader. Due to lack of motivation, the employee may perform dismally. As a result, less than optimal goals are achieved because the resources utilised are the manager's only.</p>
                                    <p>Some forms of authoritarian leadership are applicable to nursing. It is particularly suitable in crisis situations, when clear directions are of highest priority. It may also apply in situations where the people being led are inexperienced.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Democratic or Participative Leadership</strong>
                                    <p>Democratic leadership refers to a situation where people are free to express themselves. In contrast to the autocratic style of leadership, the manager here is 'people oriented' and focuses attention on human aspects as well as on building effective work groups.</p>
                                    <p>A collaborative spirit or joint effort exists which allows for group participation in decision making. The leader assumes that employees are eager to perform their jobs and are capable of doing so. The group is seen as having responsibility for goal determination and achievement. Democratic leadership encourages enthusiasm, high morale and increased satisfaction.</p>
                                    <p>Research has shown that this style of leadership leads to high productivity and is the most desirable form in a wide variety of work situations.</p>

                                <li>
                                    <strong>Laissez-faire or Permissive Leadership</strong>
                                    <p>Laissez-faire leadership is at the opposite end of the continuum from authoritarian leadership. In this style, the leader lets people do what they want. The leader plays down their role in the group's activity and exercises minimum direction or control. The leader wants everyone to feel good about what they are doing and often avoids responsibility by relinquishing power to followers and permitting them to engage in managerial activities, for example, decision making, planning, setting goals, structuring and controlling the organisation.</p>
                                    <p>This style is often evident when a manager is too weak or feels too threatened to exercise the function of leadership. It is also visible where the manager has a great need for approval and does not want to offend anybody. In this leadership style, the following can be observed:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li>Little or no visible leadership</li>
                                        <li>The manager's tend to be preoccupied with their own work</li>
                                        <li>There is no communication and direction to the employee</li>
                                        <li>There is very little teamwork and employees do as they wish</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>It should be noted, however, that this style could be highly effective in motivated professional groups, for example, in research projects in which independent thinking is rewarded.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Qualities of Effective Leadership</h3>
                            <p>For leaders to be effective in influencing others to perform, they should possess the following qualities:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Empathy, that is, an ability to look at things from another person's point of view.</li>
                                <li>Respect, that is, an effective leader should respect others as unique individuals.</li>
                                <li>Objectivity, that is, no bias or prejudice.</li>
                                <li>Self awareness, that is, self knowledge, being aware of the impact you have on others and being aware of your ability to make decisions or involve yourself with specific problems.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A nurse manager uses all the leadership styles separately or together depending on their flexibility and the circumstances inherent in each situation. There are many similarities and differences in the behaviour, attitude and conditions present in the various leadership styles. Not all of the behaviours are evident at any one time.</p>

                            <h3>Levels of Leadership</h3>
                            <p>Your success as a leader may also depend on your level of leadership. John C. Maxwell lists the five levels of leadership as:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Position</strong>
                                    <p>This is the lowest level of leadership and is based solely on title and position.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Permission</strong>
                                    <p>As relationships are developed with others, they give permission to the leader to lead beyond the limits of their job description.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Production</strong>
                                    <p>As the group becomes more productive together, leadership is advanced.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>People Development</strong>
                                    <p>This level of leadership involves developing people and assisting them to reach their potential.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>You have previously seen that for a leader to be effective in influencing others to perform, they need to possess certain qualities as well as the ability to use different management styles depending on the situation. You have been exploring the various principles of nursing. You will now look at the management principles that a nurse requires to function effectively and efficiently as a leader.</p>
                            <p>In section one, you looked at the development of management theories and how they influenced management practice. The principles you are now going to cover were identified by Henri Fayol.</p>
                            <p>He came up with fourteen principles, which might apply to nurses as they perform their duties.</p>
                            <p>You will look at the most important ones that apply in your day to day work. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The Division of Labour.</li>
                                <li>Responsibility, Accountability and Authority.</li>
                                <li>Unity of Command.</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>You should bear in mind the theories covered in section one.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Division of Labour -->
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Division of Labour</h3>
                            <p>This is one of the basic principles applied in nursing practice to a large extent. It is a way of determining who is responsible for what. In an organisation, no single person can do everything. In order to achieve organisational goals, people must be assigned tasks according to their skills. The objective of division of work is to produce more and better work with the same effort. The tasks that individuals perform must be related to each other and integrated. This calls for an adequate definition of duties to be duly communicated to all the people concerned.</p>
                            <p>The idea of division of labour in an organisation makes it possible for work to proceed quickly and smoothly. For example, in a hospital, there is a chief nurse, senior nursing officers and nursing officers. Each of these people have a specific job to perform in order to ensure the success of the organisation. Each person has the responsibility to perform their task in coordination with other people's duties.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Responsibility, Accountability, Authority -->
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Responsibility, Accountability and Authority</h3>
                            <p>Once the employees have been given different tasks to perform, the leader is responsible for the work to be done. Similarly, employees are responsible for the completion of their specific tasks. Both the leader and the employees are accountable for their tasks and responsibilities. Appropriate authority to perform certain functions is also necessary.</p>
                            <p>You will now examine the three terms and see how the nurse manager applies them in nursing practice.</p>

                            <dl class="enhanced-list">
                                <dt class="term-definition" data-definition="A duty or assignment related to a job.">Responsibility</dt>
                                <dd>This is a duty or assignment related to a job. It also refers to each person's obligation to perform at an acceptable level. For example, one responsibility common to a nurse in charge is establishing the patient care assignment for a specific area of work. Nurse managers should always be assigned responsibilities with accompanying authority because, if the latter is not given, role confusion occurs for all individuals involved. For example, a nurse manager may have the responsibility for maintaining high professional standards, but if they are not given the authority to discipline employees as needed, this responsibility may be difficult or impossible to implement.</dd>

                                <dt class="term-definition" data-definition="Being able to explain actions and results or accept ownership for results.">Accountability</dt>
                                <dd>This means that someone must be able to explain actions and results or accept ownership for the results or lack thereof. For example, a qualified registered nurse is accountable for nursing care given to a patient or client.</dd>

                                <dt class="term-definition" data-definition="Legal or rightful power, a right to command or act.">Authority</dt>
                                <dd>Authority has its base in responsibility. Dictionaries define authority as 'legal or rightful power, a right to command or act, domination, jurisdiction'. Authority defines which position will be superior and which will be subordinate.
                                <p>The various levels of divisional activities in health organisations are a direct result of the size and complexity of modern institutions. For example, in a hospital, at the top level is the operating authority, that is, the chief nurse who takes the place of employer in the superior versus subordinate relationship. Policy and decisions are made at this level. They delegate responsibility to a group of nurse managers who exercise the delegated authority in supervising the work of others. This is formal authority. On the other hand, responsibility can be delegated for performance of specific functions. This functional authority is based on technical knowledge and personal skills. Both forms of authority are necessary for achieving goals and satisfying individual needs.</p>
                                </dd>
                            </dl>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Unity of Command -->
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Unity of Command</h3>
                            <p>This is another important principle of management. The concept of unity of command is described as 'one person to one boss' or 'one person to one supervisor'. Each individual has one manager to whom they report and to whom they are responsible. This concept is illustrated in the diagram next.</p>
                            <p>This makes the manager-employee relationship as simple as possible and puts a limit to confusion, mistakes, excuses and delays in the daily performance of duties. For example, in a hospital, the nurses in various wards are responsible to those in charge of the departments or wards, who in turn, are responsible to the chief nurse. All problems are channelled through this unity of command.</p>

                            <h3>Teamwork</h3>
                            <p>In many areas of your work, you are required to work with others in a smooth and efficient manner in order to achieve your objectives. Teamwork has been defined as 'coordinated action by a group of individuals in regular contact wherein members contribute toward task achievement' (Sikula and McKenna 1994). A health care team includes nurses, doctors, allied health professionals and support staff who have to work together in order to deliver quality services to the patients.</p>
                            <p>A team usually has a leader. Leadership is an important part of efficient teams. Group members support one another and their leader because they are all mutually responsible for the objectives and subsequent action. Openness and acceptance are the prime characteristics of an ideal team situation. The nurse manager is tasked with building an effective team in order to accomplish their objectives.</p>

                        <!-- Centralisation & Decentralisation -->
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Centralisation and Decentralisation</h3>
                            <p>Centralisation and Decentralisation is frequently applied in health care systems. It refers to the extent to which decision making is concentrated or dispersed within the health care unit. You will now cover each one of them and see how they differ.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Centralisation</h4>
                            <p>This is the systematic retention of power and responsibility at higher levels of the organisation. Organisations vary greatly in their degree of centralisation. The degree may differ for different tasks and responsibilities. The Chief Nurse is responsible for centralised departments where major decision making and responsibility for key functions is centralised at the top level. Thus, for example, the Chief Nurse would be responsible for budgeting, staffing and quality assurance.</p>

                            <h4>Decentralisation</h4>
                            <p>Decentralisation is where decision making and responsibility for key functions is delegated to the lowest possible managerial level in the department. Thus, a decentralised nursing department places most decision making at the head nurse level with each individual head nurse running their unit independently.</p>

                            <p>Centralisation and Decentralisation has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

                            <h3>Discipline</h3>
                            <p>The last principle of management to be covered is discipline. You should be familiar with the term because you may have been involved in disciplining someone, for example, your child or a sibling. On the other hand, you may have been disciplined or punished after violating rules and regulations either at home or in the work place. The word 'discipline' originates from the latin term 'disciplina', which means teaching or learning. As it was put forward by Fayol, discipline is 'respect for agreements which are directed at achieving obedience, application, energy and the outward marks of respect'. The primary emphasis in discipline is in assisting employees to behave in a manner that allows them to be self directed in meeting organisational goals. Punishment may be applied for improper behaviour in constructive discipline. This should be carried out in a supportive, corrective manner.</p>
                            
                            <p>Management usually disciplines an employee for:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Not meeting laid down standards of performance.</li>
                                <li>Violating the rules and policies.</li>
                                <li>Insubordination, that is, lack of respect for authority.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The highest level and most effective form of discipline is self discipline because the roles are internalised and become part of the individual's personality (Curtin, 1996). The manager plays a vital role in this. There are several factors that must be present to foster a climate of self discipline. You will cover the factors cited by Health Care Education Associates (1987). They include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Employee awareness and understanding of rules and regulations that govern behaviour. These must be clearly written and communicated to subordinates.</li>
                                <li>An atmosphere of mutual trust should exist. The manager must believe that employees are capable of actively seeking self discipline. Conversely, the employees must perceive the manager as honest and trustworthy.</li>
                                <li>Employees should identify with the goals of the organisation. When this happens, they are more likely to accept the standards of conduct deemed acceptable by the organisation.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Discipline, therefore, is important for the smooth running of the organisation. It should be used as a means of helping the employees grow but not as a punitive measure.</p>

                            <h4>Disciplinary Process</h4>
                            <p>The following is a guideline on the steps in the disciplinary process that can be applied to an employee who has violated rules or regulations.</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Preliminary investigation and caution to the employee about the problem.</li>
                                <li>A cordial discussion with the offender and a brief warning as to why further violations will not be tolerated.</li>
                                <li>A stronger verbal warning after a further violation of regulation.</li>
                                <li>A formal written warning.</li>
                                <li>A written warning accompanied by suspension from the job for a prescribed number of days.</li>
                                <li>Suspension from the job for a longer period of time.</li>
                                <li>Discharge with opportunity to appeal.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>This process provides an opportunity to make amends for violations of the rules and regulations.</p>
                            <p>Administering discipline is one of the most difficult and resented tasks, but as a manager, this is your final responsibility. Your main concern should be to provide staff that can give safe care to patients and to help employees grow as individual human beings.</p>

                            <h3>Line Authority</h3>
                            <p>Authority is the formal and legitimate right of a manager to make decisions, issue orders, and allocate resources to achieve organisational goals. Line authority is a manager's right to direct the work of their employees and make decisions without consulting others.</p>
