                            <p>It can be regarded as:</p>

The different approaches used by managers have gone through an evolutionary process. In practice, no single approach will be sufficient. Most managers use a combination of approaches to create effectiveness within the organisation. The four main classifications are:</p>

                            <h3>Classical Theories</h3>
                            <p>Classical theories, also known as the scientific approach to management started in the later part of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The approach relied on systematic information collection, analysis and identification of causes and effects, followed by effective organisation of management structure. The objective was to develop basic principles that could guide the design, creation and maintenance of organisations. The emphasis was on efficiency and effectiveness. Some of the prominent figures that may be identified with the classical school of thought are:</p>

                            <p>Frederic W. Taylor, an engineer, was instrumental in conducting research on methods of training workers for increased production. He believed in the principle 'best management is a true science'.</p>
                            <p>According to Taylor the objective of management is to secure the maximum prosperity for the employer, as well as each employee. Taylor's system for work improvement consisted of the following steps:</p>

                                <li>Observing the workers' performance through time and motion to determine the best way to carry out each task.</li>

                            <p>Most of the views expressed by Taylor can be, and are, applied in nursing, where our aim is to recruit the best qualified workers, train them and appoint them to precise specialised positions.</p>

                            <h4>Henri Fayol</h4>
                            <p>Henri Fayol came up with the functions of a manager, which he identified as planning, organising, coordinating and controlling. He also identified a set of fourteen principles which managers might apply as they perform their duties. Some of these include the division of labour and specialisation, chain of command, centralisation and responsibility.</p>

                            <h4>Max Weber</h4>
                            <p>Max Weber advocated bureaucracy as the ideal form of organisation for a complex institution. He described bureaucracy as having a well defined hierarchy of authority, pyramidal in shape, division of labour based on specialisation and highly specific rules governing employers' duties and rights. He claimed that bureaucracy was superior because it provided stability and reliability in controlling employees.</p>
                            <p>Although Weber meant well, the term bureaucracy implies slowness and inefficiency in today's society. Bureaucracies are often seen as too rigid to respond to current and rapid changes in the society.</p>

                            <h3>Human Relations or Behavioural Approach Theories</h3>
                            <p>This is the second set of management theories. These differ from scientific theories in that they focus on the use of people as a support service to machines. They also see economic forces as motivators of human performance. The behavioural approach focuses on the manner in which managers interact with subordinates. It is based on an analysis of the relationship between human factors and productivity. Besides meeting the economic goals of the organisation, the managers must try to improve the social and psychological needs of workers, which in turn improve productivity. The following is a brief overview of four of these theories which may be applied in health care institutions.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Abraham Maslow's Theory</h4>
                            <p>According to Maslow's theory, every human being has basic needs. People are motivated by the desire to satisfy these needs. Once a need is satisfied it ceases to be a motivator. As one need is satisfied, another appears and takes its place, and the individual is then motivated to satisfy the new need. The theory also assumes that a person can satisfy one need at a time. Maslow, a psychologist, developed the hierarchy of needs with the physiological needs at the bottom, which the individuals must satisfy before realising higher level needs. Maslow visualised needs as arranged in hierarchical order starting with basic needs, progressing to higher needs depending on the individual. There are more people at the base of the triangle still trying to satisfy the basic needs and fewer people were on the higher subsequent levels. Only a small percentage of people can reach the top of the hierarchy.</p>
                            
                            <p>The various needs can be further defined as follows:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Physiological needs are those needs that are required for survival. These include food, oxygen and sleep, sex and rest.</li>
                                <li>Safety needs refer to the need for job security, shelter and a stable environment.</li>
                                <li>Love and belonging indicate a need for affectionate relations with others as well as the need to belong to a group.</li>
                                <li>Self esteem refers to the need for self respect and recognition. At this stage people strive for power, achievement and status.</li>
                                <li>Self actualisation is a need for self fulfilment and is the culmination of all other needs.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>People at work experience a variety of needs. Managers should identify ways in which to meet group or individual needs in order to motivate them to work. It is the responsibility of the manager to enable employees to fulfil their needs.</p>

                            <h4>Douglas McGregor: Theory X and Theory Y</h4>
                            <p>McGregor's theory 'X' and 'Y' are a set of management assumptions about the behaviour of subordinates. He noted that most managers make these assumptions about their employees.</p>

                            <p>Theory 'X' and Theory 'Y' concern the attitudes management has towards the employee. The manager holding Theory X assumptions tends to be tough, authoritarian and supports tight controls with punishments. As a result, they tend to supervise workers very closely.</p>
                            <p>On the other hand, the manager using Theory Y believes in self control, is democratic, and consults staff. They encourage participation in decision making by subordinates.</p>
                            <p>Generally a blend between 'Theory X' and 'Theory Y' is more likely to provide effective management although this also depends on the prevailing environmental conditions.</p>

                            <h4>Vroom's Expectancy Theory</h4>
                            <p>This theory of motivation was put forward by Victor Vroom. It examines motivation from the perspective of why people choose to follow a particular course of action.</p>
                            <p>Vroom introduces three variables. These are:</p>
                            
                            <dl class="enhanced-list">
                                <dt class="term-definition" data-definition="The importance that the individual places upon the expected outcome of a situation.">Valence</dt>
                                <dd>This is the importance that the individual places upon the expected outcome of a situation.</dd>
                                
                                <dt class="term-definition" data-definition="The belief that output from the individual and the success of the situation are linked.">Expectancy</dt>
                                <dd>This is the belief that output from the individual and the success of the situation are linked, for example, if I work harder then the outcome will be better.</dd>
                                
                                <dt class="term-definition" data-definition="The belief that the success of the situation is linked to the expected outcome of the situation.">Instrumentality</dt>
                                <dd>This is the belief that the success of the situation is linked to the expected outcome of the situation, for example, it's gone really well, so I'd expect praise.</dd>
                            </dl>

                            <p>At first glance, this theory would seem most applicable to a traditional attitude work situation where the level of motivation depends on whether the employee wants the reward on offer for doing a good job and whether they believe more effort will lead to that reward.</p>
                            <p>However, it could equally apply to any situation where someone does something because they expect a certain outcome. For example, I recycle paper because I think it is important to conserve resources and take a stand on environmental issues (valence), I think that the more effort I put into recycling, the more paper I will recycle (expectancy) and I think that the more paper I recycle, the less resources will be used (instrumentality).</p>

                            <h4>Fredrick Herzberg's Two Factor Theory</h4>
                            <p>Frederick Herzberg proposed a theory of motivation based on the idea that some factors motivate and some demotivate. He called this theory the 'Two Factor Theory'. According to Frederick Herzberg, these factors fall into two categories. These are:</p>

                            <p>According to Herzberg, merging the hygiene and motivation factors results in four scenarios:</p>

                                    <p>This is the ideal scenario where employees are highly motivated and have few complaints.</p>
                                </li>

                            <h3>Systems Theory</h3>
                            <p>The third management theory is known as the systems theory.</p>
                            <p>Unlike the previous theories you have covered, this theory places an emphasis on organisations as cooperative systems. A system is defined as 'a set of arrangements of things so related or connected as to form a unit or organic whole'. The organisation is, therefore, defined as 'a system of consciously coordinated personal activities or forces'(Basawanthappa, 2000). The systems theory explains that organisations come into existence when there are persons able to communicate with each other who will each contribute an action to accomplish a purpose.</p>
                            <p>For cooperation to be effective the following must be present:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Place where work is done</li>
                                <li>Time when work is done</li>
                                <li>Person with whom work is done</li>
                                <li>Things upon which work is done</li>
                                <li>Method or process by which work is done</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This helps in understanding the organisation in a better way.</p>

                            <h3>Contingency Theory</h3>
                            <p>The contingency theory asserts that when managers make a decision, they must take into account all aspects of the current situation and act on those aspects that are key to the situation at hand. The continuing effort to identify the best leadership or management style might now conclude that the best style depends on the situation. If one is leading troops in the Persian Gulf, an autocratic style is probably best (of course, many might argue here, too). If one is leading a hospital or university, a more participative and facilitative leadership style is probably best.</p>
