                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Health care organisations make up the health care system, which provides all the services offered by all health disciplines. Today, many types of health care organisations exist. These differ in terms of ownership, role or services offered, and activity and size.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Ownership</h3>
                            <p>Health care organisations have various designations. Private organisations are directed and supported by private citizens. They are usually owned by corporations, associations or religious groups, for example, private or mission hospitals. They can further be divided into two categories:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Non-profit category:</strong> Ploughs back all profits to its operation or the community</li>
                                <li><strong>Commercial category:</strong> Distributes profits to investors or shareholders</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Meanwhile, government health care organisations are government or state owned. The majority of organisations in Kenya fall under this category.</p>

                            <h3>Role or Services Offered</h3>
                            <p>These range from specialty institutions, which provide for a specific disease or section of the population, for example, psychiatric or children's needs, to those referred to as general, which provide a full range of services for the whole population. These services may include acute care, ambulatory and rehabilitative services.</p>

                            <h3>Activity and Size</h3>
                            <p>These mainly refer to teaching institutions, which have both a general hospital and a teaching hospital, for example, the Kenyatta National Hospital.</p>
                            <p>In section four, you covered what an organisation is and how organisations are structured. You will now look at health care organisations. Nurses practice in many different types of health care organisations where they provide direct and indirect care services to patients.</p>

                            <h3>Types of Health Care Organisations</h3>
                            <p>There are four main types of health care organisations:</p>
                            
                            <h4>1. Hospitals</h4>
                            <p>These are institutions whose purpose is to serve the whole community, sick or well. Hospitals play a significant role and provide preventive, curative, rehabilitative and health promotion services as well as education and research.</p>
                            <p>Hospitals are classified into acute care facilities, where the average length of stay is less than thirty days and chronic or long term hospitals, which are designated to care for patients whose average length of stay is longer than thirty days.</p>
                            <p>The services provided by hospitals include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li><strong>Medical care:</strong> The care given by doctors to meet the needs of patients, for example, surgical</li>
                                <li><strong>Nursing services:</strong> The care given by the nurses in coordination with other health care team members</li>
                                <li><strong>Emergency care:</strong> Care given at any time of need for people requiring emergency measures, for instance, acute trauma accident cases, intoxication or poisoning</li>
                                <li><strong>Diagnostic services:</strong> Which include radiological and pathological services</li>
                                <li><strong>Drug therapy:</strong> Most hospitals should have a good pharmacy with the drugs required for the care of patients</li>
                                <li><strong>Dietary services:</strong> Which are important for the nutrition of patients</li>
                                <li><strong>Rehabilitative and recreational services:</strong> Which contribute to the well being of patients and are therefore, therapeutic</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>2. Ambulatory Based Organisations</h4>
                            <p>Many health services are provided on an ambulatory basis. This refers to the care given by private physicians or in hospitals as outpatient care. The goal is to focus on outpatient preventive care and patient follow up care. This serves to reduce the cost of expensive acute hospital care.</p>

                            <h4>3. Health Managed Organisation (HMO)</h4>
                            <p>This is a new concept in Kenya, which is catching up quickly. This is where an organisation gets people to enrol and pay a fixed periodic fee to the organisation, which determines the kind of services used. The HMO offers hospital and out patient services. Examples of these include insurance companies who cover medical expenses.</p>

                            <h4>4. Home Health Care Organisation</h4>
                            <p>The last type of health care organisation is home based. The services in this case are offered at home. Professional nurses provide care. They assess the patients' ability to take care of themselves and identify the resources needed to overcome problems and meet patients' needs. These include patients' requiring palliative care, chronically ill patients, the disabled or the elderly.</p>

                            <p>The changes in these modalities or systems are a response to ever changing needs. These methods may be used separately or to complement one another.</p>

                            <h3>Case Assignment Method</h3>
                            <p>This was the first method to be identified in nursing care delivery. It was popular in the 1920's. Each patient is assigned to a nurse for total patient care while the nurse is on duty. If they go off duty, the work is handed over promptly to another nurse. This means that the patient has a different nurse each shift. Assignment is made according to the severity of illness and tends to be mostly for acutely ill patients, for example, in the intensive care unit (ICU).</p>

                            <h3>Functional Nursing</h3>
                            <p>The second method is known as the functional nursing method. It was the first major deviation from case method. It began in the early 1950's when there were few registered nurses and more practical nurses available. Nurse aides provided most of the patient care.</p>
                            <p>This method emphasises the division of labour according to specific tasks. It is 'task or thing oriented' and is determined by the technical aspects of the job to be done. Each nurse has a clearly defined set of tasks determined by complexity, including skills, knowledge and experience in certain nursing techniques, for example, drug administration, wound dressing, bed baths and so on.</p>
                            <p>In this approach, the nurse in charge must have experience and exceptional knowledge in nursing. The nurse must know the skill level of their workers in order to make accurate assignments. The nurse in charge establishes rigid routines, structures and time schedules.</p>

                            <h3>Team Nursing</h3>
                            <p>Team nursing was introduced in the late 1950's to improve nursing services by utilising the knowledge and skills of professional nurses and to supervise the increasing number of auxiliary staff. The philosophy supports achieving goals through group action or team spirit.</p>
                            
                            <p>Team nursing can be organised in the following manner:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>A group or team of nurses with different levels of skills are assigned to a group of patients. The size and composition of the team is dependent upon the setting.</li>
                                <li>The team works together to accomplish a goal.</li>
                                <li>They focus on patient centred as opposed to task oriented assignments. These are based on patient needs and the knowledge, skills and experiences of team members.</li>
                                <li>A member of the work group is assigned as a leader. In the original concept, the team was led by a registered nurse.</li>
                                <li>The leadership role may be permanent or rotated.</li>
                                <li>The team works together with each member performing the tasks for which they are best prepared.</li>
                                <li>Team members report to the team leader who reports to the head nurse.</li>
                                <li>Success is dependent upon effective communication.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>As an individualised care approach, it is often more satisfying to patients. The patients are cared for by a limited number of nurses who know them better.

                            <h3>Primary Nursing</h3>
                            <p>This is a newer approach to the delivery of nursing services. The concept was developed in the early 1970s and is used by many institutions in the developed world. People are becoming more aware of it in this country and some institutions have begun to incorporate it.</p>

                                <li>A professional nurse, usually a registered nurse, is assigned to a patient for their total hospital stay or to a small group of patients, not more than four or five.</li>
                                <li>This nurse assumes responsibility for twenty four hours a day for the duration of the patient's stay in hospital.</li>
                                <li>The primary nurse assesses plans and executes the plan or may delegate to a secondary or associate nurse to execute the plan during her absence.</li>
                                <li>Every nurse serves as the primary nurse for a few patients and as an associate nurse for other patients on other shifts.</li>
                                <li>The primary nurse communicates with the physician and coordinates care with other health workers.</li>
                                <li>The chief nurse functions as a coordinator of the unit and is a resource person for the primary nurses.</li>

                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>You have examined the different types of health care organisations and the responsibilities of the nurse manager in the management of nursing services within these organisations. As the manager works and supervises the work of employees, they must be knowledgeable and conversant with the laws and ethics that govern nursing practice.</p>
                            <p>In module one, you covered legal and ethical issues in nursing. In this section, you will examine the role of the manager in this area. The manager has a responsibility to apply legal and ethical principles in their work and monitor the practice of employees under their supervision.</p>

                            <h3>Legal Issues</h3>
                            <p>The legal responsibility refers to the obligation upon nurses to obey the law in professional activities. The professional nurse should understand their legal responsibility when taking care of patients and be aware of their limitations. Patients have a right to expect professionals to live up to certain safety standards and to demonstrate responsibility and accountability.</p>
                            <p>The scope of nursing practice is defined and guided by the nursing practice act and the common law. The nursing practice act provides legal regulation for licensure, while common law is derived from legal doctrine and consists of both broad and comprehensive principles based on justice, reason and common sense. The two are responsible for educational and examination requirements, providing licensing for those who meet professional requirements and defining the functions of each category, for example, registered nurse or enrolled nurse.</p>
                            <p>Nursing practice should not leave room for negligence or malpractice because this can lead to litigation. Litigation is being taken to a court of law by a patient who makes a claim for damages or compensation.</p>

                            <h3>Ethical Issues</h3>
                            <p>Ethics have always been an integral part of nursing. Throughout your nursing practice you have applied the nursing code of ethics. The ethics provide the standards for professional behaviour in terms of what is expected of nurses. They are based on the principles of what is right or wrong. The nurses' code of ethics serves as a self regulatory mechanism and a source of guidelines for individual behaviour and responsibility.</p>
                            <p>As mentioned earlier, the nurse manager plays a significant role to ensure that the law and ethics are applied appropriately in nursing practice. The following are some of the roles and functions expected of them:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>Serves as a role model by providing care that meets and exceeds accepted standard of care.</li>
                                <li>Ensures that their conduct is as per the nursing code of ethics.</li>
                                <li>Makes sure that their staff confine themselves to the scope of nursing practice according to registration, licensure and enrolment.</li>
                                <li>Delegates to subordinates wisely.</li>
                                <li>Provides educational and training opportunities for staff on legal issues.</li>
                                <li>Is aware and makes staff aware about their own values and basic beliefs about the rights of human beings.</li>
                                <li>Advocates for clients, subordinates and the profession.</li>
