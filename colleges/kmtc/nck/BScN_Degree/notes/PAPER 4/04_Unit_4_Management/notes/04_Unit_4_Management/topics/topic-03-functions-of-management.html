                            <p>This is the first function of management. In module one, you learnt about the nursing process and the various stages involved. Planning is also a continuous process, it involves going through similar stages. You live in an era of change and therefore, you need to plan your activities.</p>
                            <p>Planning is a never ending process. It is the beginning of management. Planning is simply defined as deciding in advance what will and will not be done in the next minute, hour, day, month or year. Planning is advance thinking as a basis for action. It involves what needs to be done, how it will be done and mechanisms of evaluating work done. Planning, therefore, is having a specific objective or purpose and mapping out a method before hand. When planning, you should consider the seen and unseen factors, and keep in mind that all factors influence one another.</p>

                            <h4>Purpose of Planning</h4>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Unleash and capitalise on creativity that resides in people</li>
                                <li>Provide enabling mechanism to question the assumptions on which previous decisions were made.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>The Planning Process</h4>
                            <p>The planning process includes a series of activities that the nurse manager sets out to do. The process is subject to change as new facts become available. If plans are fixed and unchangeable, then they may fail.</p>
                            <p>The activities involved in planning include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>Gathering information.</li>
                                <li>Setting goals and objectives, that is, what you want to achieve.</li>
                                <li>Policy formulation, that is, guiding statements in decision making.</li>
                                <li>Developing strategic plans, that is, long term plans designed to achieve goals and objectives.</li>
                                <li>Developing tactical plans.</li>
                                <li>Developing procedures.</li>
                                <li>Budgeting or resource allocation.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The nurse plans and develops specific goals and objectives for their area of responsibility. The process of planning includes:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>Assessment</li>
                                <li>Setting goals</li>
                                <li>Implementation</li>
                                <li>Evaluation</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>Assessment</h5>
                            <p>This is the first stage in the process. It involves identifying and clarifying or diagnosing the problem. A good diagnosis pinpoints what is wrong. It may identify a particular situation that needs improvement, for example, the standards of nursing care.</p>
                            <p>The main questions you should ask are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Where is the problem?</li>
                                <li>What are the obstacles that are preventing achievement?</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>Setting Goals</h5>
                            <p>The next stage of the planning process is establishing goals to be achieved. These goals determine the direction of activities and serve as a guide for action. This stage also involves developing a set of actions for achieving the objectives and selecting promising solutions from the alternatives. One should be concerned with what can be done to overcome the problems identified. This requires imagination and originality. Alternatives must be analysed, compared and costed. The alternatives can range from doing nothing or finding a means around the problem, for example, dismissing a member of staff or discharging a patient.</p>

                            <h5>Implementation</h5>
                            <p>This is the third stage, it is very important because if plans are not implemented, they remain theoretical. Some of the principles of management covered in section two, for example, the division of labour, responsibility and accountability are put into practice. Implementation involves decision making, which is the core of planning. These decisions deal with the following issues:</p>

                                <li>Activities, that is, noting whether they are carried out as planned and whether services are delivered as intended.</li>
                                <li>Manpower should be adequate, at the right place and right time to perform the activities.</li>
                                <li>Resources, that is, the physical, financial and information resources needed to perform the activities.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>Evaluation</h5>
                            <p>This is the last stage in the planning process. It involves determining the extent to which objectives have been achieved. The main concern for the nurse is to find out the effectiveness of the results, as well as the efficiency in the performance of activities and the economic use of resources. You should ask the following questions:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Are the results as intended?</li>
                                <li>Are the results of value?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If the answer to both questions is 'yes', then the decision would most likely be to carry on as planned. If the answer is in the negative, then a decision will have to be made on whether to re-examine the objectives, activities or both.</p>

                            <h3>Staffing Process</h3>
                            <p>Staffing involves hiring and retaining staff in an organisation.</p>
                            <p>The staffing process involves a situation analysis, looking into what you want and whom you can get. It includes:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Recruitment</li>
                                <li>Selection</li>
                                <li>Induction</li>
                                <li>Scheduling</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Recruitment</h4>
                            <p>This is the first part of the process and it involves filling a vacancy. It includes the examination of the vacancy and consideration of sources of suitable candidates. The sources could be internal, that is, from within the organisation, or external.</p>

                            <h4>Selection</h4>
                            <p>This is the next stage, it includes assessing the candidate by various means, for example, interviewing and making a choice between candidates to be followed by an offer of employment. If no suitable candidates are found, the post is advertised again with a wider scope or catchment area. This may include advertising abroad.</p>
                            <p>During selection, at least the three best candidates are chosen. In case the best candidate is not in a position to take the job, then the second best is approached until the vacancy is filled.</p>

                            <h4>Scheduling (Duty Roster)</h4>
                            <p>After the orientation is done, the employee is assigned tasks to be performed. Work schedules and time off should meet organisational goals with fairness and equity among personnel. A schedule should adhere to the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Policies, standards and practices of the organisation on the hours worked by professional and support staff.</li>
                                <li>Appropriate ratio or balance between professional and support staff.</li>
                                <li>Continuity of nursing services and twenty four hour coverage.</li>
                                <li>Approved budget.</li>
                                <li>Consideration of vacations.</li>
                                <li>Allowance of adjustment in case of illness, emergencies or changes in patient care needs.</li>
                                <li>Individual needs of staff.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Staff members should be informed of their work schedules at least one to two weeks in advance. The schedules may be either centralised or decentralised.</p>
                            <p>A centralised schedule is controlled by the chief nurse, matron or a designate who develops a master plan for nursing personnel in the hospital. One of the advantages of this method is that it provides an overall picture of the staffing situation in the organisation. However, it denies the manager the right to make scheduling decisions based on workers' abilities and needs. In the decentralised schedule, the middle and lower levels of management determine scheduling, for example, ward in charges. The manager is, therefore, more accountable at their level and has a greater control of activities.</p>

                            <h4>Factors Affecting Staffing</h4>
                            <p>There are many variables that may affect staff numbers and placement. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The need to provide nursing services coverage.</li>
                                <li>Staff factors, for example, job descriptions, education level of staff, experience and expectations from the organisation.</li>
                                <li>Patient factors, including variety of patient conditions, length of stay, the patient population, care needs and fluctuation in numbers.</li>
                                <li>Health care organisation factors, including policies and procedures, financial resources available, number of beds per unit, staffing norms, issues of professional coverage and nursing assignment systems.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Since each setting is unique, there is no guide that can stipulate the correct number of personnel needed to provide quality care. However, systems have been developed for guidance, for example, the patient classification system which is a method of grouping patients according to the amount and complexity of their nursing care requirements. In this case, patients are grouped according to the nursing time, effort and ability required to provide care.</p>

                            <p>Nurses work in organisations. Nurse managers are expected to organise their work activities based on the staffing patterns. Organising is the process of grouping the necessary responsibilities and activities into workable units, determining the lines of authority, communication, developing patterns of coordination and giving feedback. By organising, you are attempting to answer the question:</p>
                            
                            <h4>How will the work be divided and accomplished?</h4>
                            <p>To answer the question, the manager must define groups and assign duties. There are certain basic issues to consider:</p>

                                <li>Set up structure, that is, the structured aspects of the organisation that must be set up to indicate activities to be performed and lines of responsibility and authority.</li>
                                <li>Develop procedures and policies.</li>
                                <li>Determine requirements and decide how duties will be performed.</li>

                            <p>Organisation refers to the structure that is designed to support organisational processes.

                            <p>In organising, the emphasis should be placed on interrelating activities, practices and resources into a systematic and practicable pattern. In this case, the following are necessary:</p>

                            <p>In units one and two of module one, you covered the various principles of communication. Please refer to your notes on this topic, as they will be useful for the following topic. In this section, you will specifically focus on organisational communication. There is no organisation that can exist without communication.</p>
                            <p>Communication is referred to as the lifeblood of any organisation. Communication refers to the need to create common understanding. It is, therefore, the process of transmitting ideas and information from one person, the sender, to another or group of people, receivers.</p>
                            <p>Organisational communication is the exchange of information within the organisation. While employee communication is the responsibility of the manager, the manager's work may be supplemented through some already established means of communication within an organisation. The manager is charged with the responsibility of passing information through various channels.</p>

                            <h4>Formal and Informal Communication</h4>
                            <p>The formal communication system is mainly used. It is based on a chain of command from the top of the organisation to the bottom. This is used for all official messages including directives, procedures, policies, job instructions and so on. An informal communication system can also be used. This is usually oral and not crucial to the functioning of the organisation. It originates from informal groupings, for example, associations or welfare groups. In most cases, messages are transmitted through the 'grapevine' (also known as rumours) and sometimes the communication is distorted or groundless. Such types of communication can cause fear and anxiety among staff and the manager should be aware of its existence and reinforce stability using more formal methods of communication.</p>
                            <p>You will now look at some of the different types of formal organisational communication.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Vertical Flow</strong><br>
                                    The manager is responsible for passing information through vertical channels of communication, which includes both a downward and an upward flow of communication. A two way exchange of information is essential in organisations and managers must ensure that there is feedback at all levels.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Downward Communication</strong><br>
                                    Most information within organisations moves from the top downward, that is, from the top levels of management to employees. This may be through face to face communication or written materials, for example, memos or circulars. The purpose of this form of communication is mainly to inform employees of their responsibilities, commitment to the objectives of the organisation and any other relevant information. Barriers to this form of communication may include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The manager may withhold information</li>
                                        <li>The employee may fail to understand the message</li>
                                        <li>The employee may get information but this may not be relevant to their needs</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Upward Communication</strong><br>
                                    This is the flow of information from the bottom up or from the subordinates to the supervisor. Ideally information should pass freely up the chain of command so that management gets the feedback needed to evaluate results and initiate improvements. Barriers to upward communication may include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If employees feel management is not interested in their ideas, they will not offer them.</li>
                                        <li>At times, bad news gets blocked and is not communicated to the top management.</li>
                                        <li>Delays in relaying messages.</li>
                                    </ul>

                            <p>Once you are responsible and accountable for patient care activities, you will find that there are times when a job gets too big and part of it must be entrusted to someone else.</p>
                            <p>Delegation is the process through which responsibility and authority for performing a task, function, activity or decision is transferred to another individual who accepts that authority and responsibility (Sullivan and Decker 1992: 216).</p>
                            <p>Although the delegator remains accountable for the task, the delegate is also accountable to the delegator for responsibilities assumed. Delegation is a dynamic process, which involves three factors:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Responsibility for work delegated, that is, willingness to do the assigned work or an obligation to accomplish a task.</li>
                                <li>Accountability or the obligation to carry out the responsibility or authority or act of accepting ownership for the results or lack thereof.</li>
                                <li>Authority, that is, the right to act or empower.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You can delegate only those tasks for which you are responsible.</p>
                            <p>In delegation, responsibility and authority are transferred, while accountability is shared.</p>
                            
                            <p>To clearly understand who is responsible for certain tasks, it is important to look at:</p>

                                        <li>The manager and immediate subordinate must have a good interpersonal relationship.</li>
                                        <li>The manager must have good administrative skills to be able to delegate.</li>
                                        <li>The assigned duties should be well understood, well defined and well written to both of them.</li>
                                        <li>The person to whom work is to be delegated must be assisted to become self sufficient.</li>

                            <p>Every activity you perform has some benefits to the people involved as well as the organisation. The delegator benefits as they are able to devote more time to those tasks that cannot be delegated and with more time available can develop new skills and abilities.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, the delegate benefits because they gain new skills and abilities that can facilitate upward mobility and build self esteem and confidence resulting in job motivation and satisfaction. They also have the freedom to exercise initiative and learn how to make decisions independently.</p>
                            <p>The organisation benefits in that teamwork improves and the organisation achieves its goals more efficiently. Finally, the patient benefits as the quality of care improves leading to increased patient satisfaction.</p>

                            <p>The process of delegation involves the following steps:</p>

                                    <strong>Defining the Task</strong>
                                    <p>This involves determining what can and should be delegated, for example, routine tasks, tasks for which you do not have time and tasks that have moved down in priority. It also includes problem solving and staff development.</p>

                                    <strong>Evaluating the Task</strong>
                                    <p>You should analyse whether the task involves technical skill or cognitive abilities, for example, the performance of specific procedures and the knowledge level needed to carry out certain tasks.</p>

                                    <strong>Determining Who Should Perform the Task</strong>
                                    <p>You should be able to match the tasks to the individual. To do this, you should analyse individual skills and capabilities, experiences and individual characteristics, for example, initiative, enthusiasm and knowledge.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Providing Clear Communication About Expectations Regarding the Task</strong>
                                    <p>You should plan your meeting with the delegate. Describe the task and give reasons for the task. Inform the delegate by what standards the task will be evaluated and identify any constraints to completing the tasks.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Reaching Agreement</strong>
                                    <p>Seek agreement from the delegate that they are accepting responsibility and authority for the task.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Monitoring Performance and Providing Feedback</strong>
                                    <p>Analyse performance according to established goals. Monitoring provides a mechanism for feedback and control and ensures that delegated tasks are carried out as agreed.</p>

                            </ul>

                            <p>Delegation is good because it enables the manager to concentrate on the most important tasks. However, there are some problems which may affect both the delegator and delegate.</p>

Controlling involves the regulation of activities so that some targeted element of performance remains within acceptable limits. It also guides activities and assures certain minimum standards.</p>
                            <p>The nurse manager needs to take into account both external and internal environments because they will influence the way they exercise control.</p>

                            <h4>Importance of Control</h4>
                            <p>Control is important for several reasons including the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>To ensure work is done according to the objectives set and activities are carried out as planned, within the allocated time and with the resources provided.</li>
                                <li>To enable supervisors to recognise gaps in the knowledge and understanding of the staff, and arrange for appropriate training.</li>
                                <li>To enable management to ensure that the resources provided for work are adequate and are being properly used.</li>
                                <li>To enable management to identify the cause of work deficiencies.</li>
                                <li>To facilitate the recognition and reward for good work done and recognise suitable staff.</li>
                                <li>To identify mistakes before they become critical, bearing in mind that prevention is better than cure.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Elements of Control</h4>
                            <p>The nurse manager must ensure that all staff members are conversant with the elements of control. You will now cover each of these elements individually.</p>

                                    <strong>Establishing the Standards</strong>
                                    <p>The first step involves formulating standards. Standards are yardsticks against which nurse managers devise controls. They are a way to measure and evaluate quality and quantity of performance. They are closely related to organisational goals but are more specific. People must understand the results desired to avoid confusion. Standards may be classified as:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Tangible and Objective</strong>: Tangible standards are physical standards, which pertain to actual operation of the department. They can be quantitative or qualitative, for example, the number of nurses to cover the duty per shift and quality of care expected, for instance, every patient will have a nursing care plan twelve hours after admission.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Intangible and Subjective</strong>: Intangible standards may include the reputation of the hospital based on good or bad publicity. They can also refer to the morale of employees, attitudes and relationships between employees and complaints. These are difficult to measure but can be assessed with a degree of confidence.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Actual Performance</strong>
                                    <p>After setting standards, they must be measured to identify their achievement. This can be done by direct observation and checking on employees. Observations for control should attempt to identify:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Inadequate output or improperly performed jobs.</li>
                                        <li>Deviations from expected standards. Assuming a questioning rather than confrontational attitude.</li>
                                        <li>Comparisons between actual performances with the laid down standards.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>It is important to correctly interpret reasons for deviations from standards. Some deviations may be due to temporary circumstances, for example, patients may not have had bed baths due to fewer nurses on duty rather than due to poor performance.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Corrective Action</strong>
                                    <p>If performance falls short of standards, then analysis indicates that corrective action is required. Supervisors must decide what remedial action is necessary to get improved results in the near future. These corrections may require:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A revision of standards</li>
                                        <li>A simple discussion with those responsible for taking corrective action</li>
                                        <li>Verbal reprimand</li>
                                        <li>At times disciplinary action may be taken where rules and policies are involved</li>
                                        <li>Better selection and training of staff to enable them to be more effective and efficient</li>
                                        <li>Reinforcement of strengths by the manager so that the staff are motivated</li>
