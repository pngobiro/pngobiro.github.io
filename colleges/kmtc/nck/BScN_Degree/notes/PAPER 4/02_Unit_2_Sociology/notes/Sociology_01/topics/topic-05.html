                            <p>In this section, you will use your knowledge on culture and experiences of the effects of cultural beliefs and practices on health. Everyone comes from a family with a cultural background. As you learnt in section one, culture derives from all that members of a society teach one another. It is dynamic because it keeps changing and it is passed on from parents to children. Therefore, the way in which each society relates with its surroundings and its culture may affect the community's health. For example, in communities where foodstuffs like honey and wine are gathered or tapped high up in the trees, many may suffer falls leading to fractures of limbs and spinal cords. Therefore, as you carry out community health service, you should always keep in mind the cultural behaviour of your patients.</p>

                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Culture is defined as the totality of socially transmitted behaviour patterns, arts, beliefs, institutions, and all other products of human work and thought. According to Coxa and Maed (1975), culture is defined as a group of learned values or acquired beliefs that a person copies from other persons with whom they interact.</p>
                            
                            <p>It may also be defined as all that members of a societal group teach one another. Kroeber and Kluckhorn (1952) identified 164 definitions of culture. In summary culture can be defined as socially transmitted behaviour patterns, arts, institutions, as well as the values and beliefs that a person copies from other persons with whom they interact.</p>
                            
                            <p>Culture is also knowledge, some of it conscious and made into coded or traditional forms, such as myths and rules, some of it quite unconscious and automatic, such as the rules and structures that allow language speakers to understand each other. This knowledge is learned both formally and unconsciously within human groups and is heavily dependent upon language as a medium for transmission. Culture is shared between generations and within generations, but this sharing is neither completely uniform, nor without error. There are esoteric (or specialist) compartments of culture in all societies, and various factors affect the accuracy with which culture is reproduced as it passes between individuals.</p>
                            
                            <p>Humans, as individuals and as members of groups, use cultural assumptions to make sense of the world around them as they live out their lives. They also use culture to create strategies with respect to their group and individual interactions.</p>

                            <p>The two components of culture are:</p>

                            <p>There are four various forms of non-material culture, they are listed below.</p>

                            <h4 id="language">Language</h4>
                            <p>Language refers to the pattern of spoken or written words used by a particular society in order to communicate. The mother tongue refers to the language of one's parents. You may notice that each one of us learnt a mother tongue that also reflects on our cultural group. For example, the table below illustrates the relationship between the cultural group and the language used.</p>

                            </div>

                            <h4 id="mores">Mores</h4>
                            <p>Mores are explained as social norms, which emphasise the expected moral behaviour for societal members. If an individual breaks the mores, the individual receives severe punishments. Some examples of mores are: do not lie, do not steal or destroy other's property and so on. All society members are expected to obey the mores or else they receive punishment. Therefore, it can be said that mores refer to all things that each one of us would like others to do to us. Where mores are written down, they are referred to as laws.</p>

                            <h4 id="norms">Norms</h4>
                            <p>Norms are defined as socially accepted patterns of behaviour. You should note that norms differ from society to society. They may include children respecting parents and older people in society, as demonstrated by a young person offering an older person a seat in a bus and so on. Another example is that both the young and the old are expected to dress properly according to the occasion. All are expected to observe certain table manners while eating. In some communities, children should be served first, followed by the men and lastly the women. All these norms aim to maintain order. Norms can be further subdivided into two categories, that is, mores and laws.</p>

                            <h4 id="laws">Laws</h4>
                            <p>Laws are written, socially confirmed rules and regulations of conduct, which if violated, are punishable. Laws are enforced by a socially identified agency. For an example of medically related laws, refer to module four, unit one, section two on the mental health act.</p>

                            <h3 id="material-culture">Material Culture</h3>
                            <p>According to Akinsola (1983) material culture is defined as the part of culture that includes physical things in any society. Examples of material culture include the type of clothing used, ornaments such as necklaces, bangles, and earrings, kitchenware, type of houses and many more. Akinsola also explains that the importance of identifying material culture relates to how these items are used by individuals in the society. For example, among the Agikuyu people, women and girls learnt to use pots for cooking and gourds for serving food and storing liquids such as milk.</p>
                            
                            <p>In modern days, nurses are expected to learn how to use computers, new types of blood pressure machines, digital thermometers and others in order to improve the health care they provide. In addition, they are expected to provide nursing care to persons of varying cultural ethnic background. For further details refer to the module one, unit one on professionalism.</p>

                                Cultural Beliefs and Health
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>A cultural belief is a personal conviction and disposition to retain and abandon actions taking into account values of one's own culture. Cultural beliefs may pertain to child rearing or housing.</p>
                            
                            <p>Several studies have noted that, besides inadequate availability of health care services in many areas, especially the less developed countries, certain disease specific and non-disease specific cultural beliefs may influence people's health seeking behaviour. It has even been noted that health services may be underutilised and health and child care instructions may be ineffective or ignored in traditional and transitional societies where people's ideas and behavioural patterns conflict with the knowledge being passed to them (Feyisetan and Adeokun 1992; Feyisetan 1992).</p>
                            
                            <p>Feyisetan and Adeokun (1992) argue that non-adoption of modern preventive and curative measures cannot be attributed to poverty alone since the costs of some of these measures are not exorbitant in several of these societies. Rather, they suggest that the gap between awareness of modern health measures and health seeking behaviour must be sought in the social and cultural determinants of behaviour in such matters as childcare and disease management, since, for most mothers, perceptions of the aetiology of the childhood diseases are rooted in cultural beliefs.</p>
                            
                            <p>You will now cover a brief review of disease specific cultural beliefs.</p>

                            <h3 id="food-taboos">Food Taboos</h3>
                            <p>Outbreaks of malnutrition among children in this country may not only be associated with lack of food but also with culture patterns affecting food. For example, in some parts of Kenya, children and women are not given eggs in the belief that the child will learn to be a thief when grown up or that a mother feeding on eggs may harm her unborn baby. Instead, the eggs are reserved for the men to eat or to be sold at the market. In many homes that keep poultry, these eggs could serve as source of protein for young ones, were it not for these cultural beliefs.</p>

                            <h3 id="overcrowding">Overcrowding</h3>
                            <p>When several family members live in congested homes with a low standard of hygiene, this may contribute to poor health. This mainly occurs in urban centres, where a family may rent one room, which serves as the kitchen, bedroom and dining room. There may be communal water but often there is none, and in such cases the family has to buy water or fetch it from a stream. Under such living conditions children suffer from diarrhoea, intestinal worms and sometimes malnutrition.</p>
                            
                            <p>Due to the increased expenses associated with hospital care, parents may decide to take their child to traditional medicine men. Often traditional healers are more easily accessible and services can be paid for later when the parent earns some money and so on. The child will only be brought to hospital much later, if their condition fails to improve.</p>

                            <p>Having had an overview of the cultural beliefs, you shall now look at some examples of effects of cultural beliefs and how they affect the way of living among people.</p>

                            <h3 id="somali-diet">An Example of the Effects of Cultural Beliefs on the Diet of the Somalis</h3>
                            <p>'Fat and healthy' is how parents prefer their kids to be, even to be overweight or obese by western standards. Increased interest by Somali parents in the use of high calorie nutrition supplements for their children to boost weight gain has been observed. This practice is leading to feeding mismanagement. Other effects of culture on their diet are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Camel milk is believed to be the best of all milks.</li>
                                <li>Eating chicken injected with hormones is believed to be bad for the human heart and to contribute toward being fat.</li>
                                <li>Breastfeeding women believe that tea increases milk production and therefore they increase their consumption of tea, which is usually very much sweetened with sugar. Women in the educated groups have reported not liking the idea of pumping breast milk, for fear of disfigurement.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="infant-nutrition">Infant Nutrition</h3>
                            <p>Most Somali mothers living in Mogadishu prefer to give birth in a hospital. Somali women who choose to give birth at home use a midwife, who is usually a hospital worker with some western medical training who is paid privately for assisting in the home birth. Whether giving birth in the hospital or at home, a woman relies on the help of midwives and will rarely see a doctor unless birthing complications arise. Somali mothers receive information about how to feed and care for their babies from their mothers and other relatives, and from those who deliver their child.</p>

                            <h4 id="breastfeeding">Breastfeeding</h4>
                            <p>It is culturally important for Somali mothers to breastfeed their babies. Not doing so is seen as a sign of poor mothering. Somali children are breastfed until they are two years old, or until the mother becomes pregnant again. Children raised in Mogadishu are fed breast milk supplemented with goat's milk at six months. Nomadic Somali mothers feed their child cow's milk mixed with water at three months. Few Somali mothers use canned formula milk because it is expensive and is believed to cause stomach problems.</p>
                            
                            <p>In addition to breast milk, children of urban Somalis are fed soft foods such as bananas and rice at eight months. Children of nomadic Somalis are not fed any solid food until they are one year old. Most Somali children are fed normal solid foods at eighteen months. Normal adult food mainly consists of carbohydrate such as rice, bananas and meat; such foods are cooked until they are soft enough for the child to chew.</p>

                            <h4 id="bottle-feeding">Bottle Feeding</h4>
                            <p>In both urban and rural areas, when babies are one year old, most drink from a glass or cup without their parent's help. Bottles are difficult to keep clean and are not usually used. Children who are born outside of the city are given their milk in a traditional hand-made wooden cup. If their children have stomach sickness and the mothers were bottle feeding them, they will stop feeding bottled milk and give them sugar water for three or four days. Children are also fed breast milk during this time. If the symptoms do not abate, the child is taken to a hospital or medication is sought.</p>

                            <h4 id="teething">Teething</h4>
                            <p>Somalis associate teething with diarrhoea, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Children usually begin teething when they are between nine months and one year old, although it can occur as early as four months. Those who get their teeth earlier are thought to have more difficulties. A soothing oil is sometimes placed on the gums to calm teething children, but pacifiers are not used.</p>

                                Case Study: HIV/AIDS in Muslim Communities
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Another example relating to the effects of cultural beliefs and practices on health standards relates to the Muslim community. A report published by the National Bureau of Asian Research, based in the U.S.A., authored by Kelley and Eberstadt, examines the growing HIV/AIDS crisis in the Muslim world. This is a largely unexplored problem and one that is beginning to pose potentially serious dangers at the national, regional and international levels. One of the main factors contributing to lack of action against HIV/AIDS in the region is the belief that premarital sex, adultery, commercial sex work, sex between people of the same gender and injection drug use either do not exist or happen very infrequently in the Muslim world. However, the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that nearly one million people in North Africa, the Middle East and predominantly Muslim countries in Asia are HIV-positive. It should be noted that these figures are probably 'severely understated' because UNAIDS figures rely on surveillance data, and a lack of data can be interpreted as a lack of HIV cases, according to the report. The report praises the predominately Muslim nations of Iran and Bangladesh for implementing effective HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. This is another example of the effects of culture on the health of a community.</p>
