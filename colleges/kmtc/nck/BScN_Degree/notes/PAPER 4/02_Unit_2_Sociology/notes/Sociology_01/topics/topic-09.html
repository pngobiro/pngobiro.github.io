                            <p>Over time, sociologists and anthropologists have deepened our knowledge of the influence and interactions of such variables as social class, race, age, cultural and social contexts in determining health status on individuals and communities. They have provided a body of rich data and have posited different conceptual schemes and hypotheses to explain some of the epidemiological findings on social factors and health.</p>
                            
                            <p>The importance of social factors in the etiology of health cannot be over emphasised. Studies have directed attention on the importance of social science (including sociology and anthropology) concepts and methods in the study of health and illness. For example, the health status of an individual, including life expectancy and prevalence of chronic disease and disability, is related to marital status, social supports, as well as simple health habits such as hours of sleep and physical activities.</p>
                            
                            <p>Although social and behavioural scientists have long stressed the importance of cultural factors in people's health behaviour in perceiving symptoms, seeking health care, adhering to medical regimens and responding to health promotion programs – they are now directing attention to the role of cultural factors in determining health status. This forms rationale for community based public health interventions. Different disciplines are now contributing to the growing body of knowledge of the relationship between society and health.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is useful for nurses to study sociology and anthropology because it enables them to appreciate that individuals behave in a unique way. It is important to understand that every patient will react in a different manner when under stress. The nurse should recognise this and specifically tailor the nursing process to the individual patient, in order to assess, plan and implement nursing care that will suit the particular needs of the patient. Additionally, the nurse should always remember that individuals are part of a wider community, and try to involve all significant members of the family in the management of the patient.</p>

                            <p>In the process of interacting with patients, the application of sociological concepts and knowledge facilitates delivery of professional skills of nurses, as they will acknowledge the influences and interactions of such variables as social background and cultural contexts. During this contact period, you should use your observation skills to assess the patient's style of dressing, use of language, age and accompanying relatives. All these observations will provide additional background information for the patient's history.</p>
                            
                            <p>As you take a detailed history from the patient, you will be in a position to inquire about specific points unique to them. For example, a Somali girl is brought to your ward accompanied by her parents and older brother. Start by greeting the parents, then the patient. If you are familiar with the language use it when greeting them, make them comfortable by offering chairs and explaining that you need to take detailed history then continue. By doing this, the family and the patient feel accepted and welcomed, and this may make it easier for you to gather all necessary details and record them for sharing information.</p>

                            <p>Equipped with sociological and anthropological knowledge nurses should remember that humans are social beings whose physical environment plays an important role. You should be aware of the patient's surroundings, type of housing, ventilation systems, the availability of water and sanitation. You should also be aware of their social background, for example, relationships with the family and spiritual group members and psychological factors, for example if they are grieving, coping with the spouse and/or work. All these factors will influence the health of your patient. These facts should be confirmed with a significant family member or guardian where possible. The information you collect during this process will help the health team in planning immediate and follow-up care. In addition, it will enable you to provide care that centres on the patient and family members, and in so doing you will be in a position to positively influence the patient's health seeking behaviour.</p>

This whole process is referred to as professional socialisation, that is, you learnt to behave and function as a nurse.</p>

You have also had to maintain the rules and regulations governing nursing practices as recorded by the Nursing Council of Kenya. You joined the 'family' of the nursing profession. Studying sociology and anthropology helps you understand how to fit in with this family in order to meet the health needs of all humans.</p>
