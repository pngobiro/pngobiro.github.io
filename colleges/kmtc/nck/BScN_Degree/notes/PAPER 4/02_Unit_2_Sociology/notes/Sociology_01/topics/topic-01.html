                            <p>According to Perry (1996) sociology is not concerned with teaching us about new things but with teaching us about new ways of looking at common things. Thus, for example, when you study common agents of socialisation like the family, you will find that there are other contemporary agents, like the media, which also strongly impact on the process of socialisation. Each one of us should, therefore, keep abreast with changes occurring around us that involve human relationships and the ways of doing things.</p>
                            
                            <p>You will also study culture and its effects on the health of people. This is also referred to as medical anthropology (McElroy Townsend 1996). You should be able to contribute a lot to this section by drawing from your life and field experiences. You will also cover social institutions, such as religious, educational, and political organisations that provide associational services to society (Akinsola 1983). Finally, you will cover human rights, drawing on the knowledge you gained through reference to professionalism and trends in nursing.</p>
                            
                            <p>In this section you will start by defining some terms in sociology and anthropology before you move on to study the concept of sociology.</p>

                            <p>The term 'sociology' can be traced to Auguste Comte in 1837. He combined the Latin word for society (socio) with the Greek word for science (logy) thus identifying an area of study that pertained to the science of society. Sociology is the study of social life, social change, and the social causes and consequences of human behaviour. Sociologists investigate the structure of groups, organisations, and societies, and how people interact within these contexts. Since all human behaviour is social, the subject matter of sociology ranges from the intimate family to the hostile mob; from organised crime to religious cults; from the divisions of race, gender, and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture; and from the sociology of work to the sociology of sports.</p>
                            
                            <h3 id="what-is-sociology">What is Sociology?</h3>
                            <p>Sociology is about people. It is about how people interact and why they behave as they do. Whether you look at a family, a business, or a sporting event, you are looking at something that sociology is involved with. No matter what you do in your personal and professional life or where you go, you can use sociology. Sociological research contributes to our understanding of individuals, groups, organisations, communities and societies. Practising sociologists conduct or assist in problem solving interventions on all of these levels.</p>
                            
                            <p>Auguste Comte (1837) defined sociology as dealings with all aspects of human activities and relationships, their outcomes, rules and regulations. On such a base, society is organised and controlled. Peil (1977) explained how relationships between individuals or groups function, and how changing circumstances and relationships influence these. For example, a school child is as much a part of a family as a grown up of 18 years who after college, is employed and may marry thus forming a new family unit.</p>
                            
                            <p>According to Akinsola (1983) sociology is explained as a social science that deals with the organisation of societies, people's patterns of behaviour within the social structure, and how these social structures are arranged in the society.</p>

                            <p>Anthropology is the classification and analysis of humans and their society, descriptively, culturally, historically, and physically. Its unique contribution to studying the bonds of human social relations has been the distinctive concept of culture. It has also differed from other sciences concerned with human social behaviour (especially sociology) in its emphasis on data from non-literate peoples and archaeological exploration.</p>
                            
                            <p>Emerging as an independent science in the mid-19th century, anthropology was associated from the beginning with various other emergent sciences, notably biology, geology, linguistics, psychology and archaeology. Its development is also linked with the philosophical speculations of the Enlightenment about the origins of human society and the sources of myth. A unifying science, anthropology has not lost its connections with any of these branches, but has incorporated all or part of them and often employs their techniques.</p>

                            <p>Anthropology is divided primarily into physical anthropology and cultural anthropology.</p>

                            <h4 id="physical-anthropology">Physical Anthropology</h4>
                            <p>Physical anthropology focuses on the problems of human evolution, including human palaeontology and the study of race and of body build features or constitution (somatology). It uses the methods of anthropometry, as well as those of genetics, physiology and ecology.</p>

                            <h4 id="cultural-anthropology">Cultural Anthropology includes:</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Archaeology</strong>, which studies the material remains of prehistoric and extinct cultures.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ethnography</strong>, which is the descriptive study of living cultures.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ethnology</strong>, which utilises the data furnished by ethnography, the recording of living cultures, and archaeology, to analyse and compare the various cultures of humanity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Social anthropology</strong>, which deals with human culture and society.</li>
                                <li><strong>Linguistics</strong>, the science of language.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Applied anthropology is the practical application of anthropological techniques to areas such as industrial relations and minority group problems. In Europe the term anthropology usually refers to physical anthropology alone.</p>
                            
                            <p>Anthropology's diverse subject matter - being human beings in all times and places - reflects the discipline's interest in:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>The human culture dating from the Palaeolithic past to contemporary time.</li>
                                <li>The exotic, distant societies and the myriad subcultures of the western world.</li>
                                <li>The biological bases of human behaviour and our most elaborate cultural creations.</li>
                                <li>The interaction of diverse peoples in colonial and modern contexts.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Anthropological methods, grounded in the practical realities of daily life and direct ethnographic research, are applicable cross-culturally. Perhaps its greatest strength, however, is the perspective anthropology seeks to promote: an understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity, human universals, and the dynamic potential of human culture.</p>

                                <li><strong>Role</strong> - this is defined as an expected behaviour attached to social status.</li>
                                <li><strong>Status</strong> - this refers to one's position in a society or social group.</li>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Concepts are ideas, they are expressed through certain words, which are understood to have a particular meaning that defines an underlying reality. Many specific cases are grouped together and a word is used which expresses what representatives of this group or category have in common.</p>

                            <h3 id="culture-and-civilisation">Culture and Civilisation</h3>
                            <p>The general public often thinks of culture as the aesthetic code of society: art, music, drama and literature. In their definition of culture, social scientists include everything passed down by human society except its biology. This consists of language and technology, laws and customs, beliefs and moral standards. The child is born into a society and learns its culture in the process of growing up. For each individual, there is a specific culture that is the social heritage of a particular society at a given time. The sense of time is an example. Africans are culturally and socially conditioned to divide days and years into regularised patterns. Even with many of us now owning watches there are still marked differences between 'African time' and 'European time'. Punctuality has not yet acquired a cultural value for many Africans.</p>
                            
                            <p>There is sometimes also considerable cultural diversity within a society and if boundaries can be drawn around certain groups, they may be referred to as subcultures. The subculture would incorporate sets of beliefs, norms and customs among others. For example, in Tanzania most people speak Kiswahili in addition to their local language but there are other differences like some being Christians while others are Muslims. This brings about cultural diversity.</p>
                            
                            <p>Language is also especially important to culture because it allows human beings to express their symbols and meanings in a way, which can be understood by others. Language must be learned. A child growing up with animals would have no language just as it would have no other culture. It is the main means of passing on the cultural heritage. It allows the development of abstract principles in science and morality, which would be impossible without it.</p>
                            
                            <p>Civilisation was originally identified with the city because the growth of cities ushered in improvements in man's standard of living, which raised him from the 'primitive' subsistence state. The word comes from civis, the Latin word for citizen, which can be contrasted with the pagani, residents of country districts. A notable component for being identified as 'civilised' in English-speaking African countries is being educated.</p>

                            <p>A society can be seen as a system of roles, each of which involves relationships between people, patterns of behaviour and rights and duties associated with a particular position. Everyone has more than one role. For example, you may be a son or a daughter, a student, a friend, a citizen, and so on. You also have other kinship, economic, political, religious and recreational roles.</p>
                            
                            <p>The social structure of a society includes all of its roles and social organisations. An individual's behaviour in society is structured by the roles that they fulfil and the organisations they belong to. Role relationships may be specific or diffuse, broad or narrow or generic or proper. They also differ from one culture to another. All the relationships involved in a particular role can be summarised as the role-set.</p>
                            
                            <p>Role conflict and role strain may arise if a person cannot meet all the demands of their various roles. An African woman, for example, is expected to hold a full-time job as well as care for a household and several children. In addition to conflict between roles, which are wholly or partly incompatible, there may be psychological strain in carrying out a single role satisfactorily because various members of the role-set make conflicting demands.</p>

                            <p>Kluckhohn defines value as 'a conception, explicit or implicit, distinctive of an individual or characteristic of a group which influences the selection from available modes, means and ends of action.'</p>

                            <h3 id="values">Values</h3>
                            <p>Values are usually inferred from observed behaviour. If a person regularly associates with certain people, it can be assumed that they value this relationship. It would be more correct though, to treat values as either dependent variables, that is, the values of a person are the result of their experiences and the society in which they live or intervening variables, that is, given certain causes or pressures, the result will vary according to the person's values rather than as independent variables, which refers to values that directly cause people to act in certain ways.</p>

                            <h3 id="norms">Norms</h3>
                            <p>Norms are the standards that govern behaviour in roles. They are societal expectations of what is normal. Sometimes, they have been formalised as law, but most norms are less formal. However, many people do not follow norms exactly in their daily lives because they may think it is impossible or just inconvenient. Therefore, a distinction should always be made between behaviour and norms. Often, for example, when you are conducting a study, people do not tell you about societal norms but refer mostly to what it is that they actually do.</p>
                            
                            <p>Sumner, an early sociologist, divided norms into folkways, mores and laws or stateways:</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Folkways</strong><br>
                                    Folkways are customary practices that are considered appropriate behaviour but are not rigidly enforced. For example, if one builds their house in a somewhat different shape from the others, they may be considered eccentric or an individualist but people will not be particularly bothered by their behaviour.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Mores</strong><br>
                                    Mores are subject to strong sanctions because they are considered much more important to the welfare of the society. For instance, wives should be faithful to their husbands and not commit adultery. Mores also include taboos, for example, certain communities are not allowed to eat certain animals.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Laws or Stateways</strong><br>
                                    Laws on the other hand, may be customary or enacted. When the chiefs or elders hold court to deal with disputes over land or wives, they are enforcing customary law based on tradition and public opinion about norms. Large societies often cannot rely solely on customary laws because they comprise a mixed group of people. Consequently, written rules are needed to deal quickly with a changing situation and to make clear to everyone what is expected of them. Thus, the political system gradually develops enacted law, known as stateways. Mores may be embodied in the laws.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="institution">Institution</h3>
                            <p>An institution may be defined as an enduring complex of norms, roles, values and sanctions embracing a distinct segment of human life. When certain patterns of behaviour have become a well-established part of the social structure, it can be said they are institutionalised. The family and kinship institutions are basic to social relations as they give every member of the society a place at birth and are essential for the continuance of the society. The word institution is sometimes used when organisation or association would be better, for a specific group of individuals pursuing a common goal, for example, a university. These provide a focus for research on the political, religious and educational institutions of the society, in which they are found, for instance, studying the effect of participation in the university community on placement in the stratification system after graduation.</p>

                            <p>The study of social groups is fundamental to sociology because patterns of interpersonal behaviour are often structured by membership in one or more groups. The word group may refer to a categorical group, that is, any set of people that the speaker wants to treat as a unit. On the other hand, it is also used for corporate groups, that is, people who interact over a period of time and who have some form of organisation, a sense of solidarity and common values, norms and goals which allow them to undertake joint action. A study of the relations between individuals within the group provides information on factors affecting role performance and the way power, authority and influence are exercised. We may also analyse the relations between groups, the role of social groups in forcing institutional change or change in personal behaviour, or the way various social groups together form the building blocks of the society.</p>
                            
                            <p>The word community usually implies some idea of locale, frequent social interaction and close ties between members of a group. These ties may be based on kinship, common occupation and so on, as long as they are sufficiently important to provide the members of the community with common interest and goals.</p>
                            
                            <p>Wolpe notes three characteristics of the communal group: a common identity and culture; male and female representatives of all age groups; and differentiation by power, status and wealth.</p>

                            <h3 id="function-and-dysfunction">Function and Dysfunction</h3>
                            <p>Sociologists are concerned with how a society works as a whole and with how each of the parts fit together. As such, they study the functions of norms, roles and institutions. It is easy to assume that any patterns one finds are functional, that is, that they help a society to reach its goals. However, frequently one finds patterns which give rise to conflict and seem to work contrary to what the participants intend. Activities that are detrimental to the system are termed dysfunctions. You should note, however, that behaviour that is functional in certain circumstances may be dysfunctional for other goals or individuals.</p>
