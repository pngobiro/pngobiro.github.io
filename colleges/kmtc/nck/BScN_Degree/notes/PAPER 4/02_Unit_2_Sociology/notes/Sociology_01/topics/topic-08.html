                            <p>In this section you will study conflict resolution and the negotiation process. As you have already noted, the society assigns different status to individuals according to their roles. Following these differences in status, there is bound to be tension between persons with high status and those with lower status.</p>
                            
                            <p>For example, there may be a conflict between a matron in charge of a ward and a group of nurses over the allocation of various duties in the ward. Some nurses may feel that some of their colleagues always get lighter duties in the shift such as drug administration and conducting rounds, while they are left to do the rest of the work like bed making, distributing bedpans and such like duties. The group that feels discriminated against may even threaten to take their complaints to the Hospital's Chief Nurse if they are not addressed. The matron then has to come up with a quick solution to this conflict before it reaches the Chief Nurse. One option for the Matron would be to call a meeting of all the nurses in order to come up with an agreement that both sides are happy with. Once an agreement is reached, it should be written down and signed by all present.</p>
                            
                            <p>A general principle of resolving conflict is acknowledging the needs of each group and reaching a compromise for both. Remember that conflicts will always occur where there are power relationships, for example, employee/employer, student nurse/nursing officer in charge, parents/children and many more. This may be because of different roles and needs (see section three on social stratification).</p>

                            <p>Conflict is a person's struggle with him/herself, another person, or a thing. It is a problem or disagreement and results in a situation that needs resolution. Conflict is present in every person's life. According to Powler, conflict is defined as a fight, a struggle with others or groups, also as a collision or clashing of opposed principles. It is inescapable. However, conflict can be dealt with creatively, if a person has the right tools.</p>

                            <p>Conflict resolution is the process of finding a way to manage or solve a problem. There are several methods of conflict resolution. Some result in win-lose solutions, while others can be win-win. Through programs like peer mediation, children learn to go for the win-win solution!</p>

                                    <strong>Appointing a Commission</strong><br>
                                    A commission is a group of people, usually professionals in a certain field who are selected to look into a problem more keenly, so as to come up with a solution. One example is if the prices of basic items continue rising, the government may establish a commission to look into the effect of this increase on workers' wages. The commission/committee is given the mandate to suggest ways to improve the workers' wages, actual remuneration, perhaps to suggest possible sources of funding and ways of handling future government/workers conflict.

                                    <strong>Elections to Change the Leaders</strong><br>
                                    On some occasions due to strained relationships between the current government and populace, an election may be called. In this case the population may elect a new government with new political leaders of their choice. When this happens, the masses feel that they have picked their choice of leaders, thereby averting conflict.

                                    <strong>Meeting with Concerned Persons</strong><br>
                                    At times in the work place, conflict may arise between the in-charge persons and other staff members. One of the ways to avert this misunderstanding is to call a meeting where all stakeholders are invited. This provides for an opportunity to speak out, discuss and agree on solutions to be effected by all. Mediators may also be chosen to represent one of the parties. In this way, harmony in the work place is restored.

                                    <strong>The Information Phase</strong><br>
                                    During this phase, you should collect and evaluate information on all factors that will have an effect on the negotiation. Work out a defensive plan to protect sensitive information that the opposition is likely to inquire about. Decide whether the negotiations will be carried out by yourself or an agent.

                                    The bargaining begins during this phase. You should decide who should go first on particular issues. Support your position on an appropriate rationale and actively manage the concession process.

                                    <strong>The Cooperative Phase</strong><br>
                                    It is important to understand that, ultimately, cooperation is a worthy and necessary stage in the negotiation process. While acknowledging that negotiations are inherently competitive, it helps to remember the following:
