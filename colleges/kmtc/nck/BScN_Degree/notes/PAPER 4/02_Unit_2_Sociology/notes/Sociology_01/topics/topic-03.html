                            <p>In this section, you will cover how societies are differentiated. In every society, there are those who take the lead, for example, the elders, chiefs, successful farmers, teachers, lecturers, managers, business tycoons and so on. The difference between those who lead and those who are led may result from factors relating to gender, age and social roles. For example, in some cultures older men are viewed with higher regard than young men, women and children in that order. This is the traditional type of differentiation common in Africa (Peil 1977). In addition, in every society some people are identified as senior and others junior. In the nursing profession, there are similar relationships, for example, the matron and staff nurse. Each is assigned special roles and obligations according to their respective authority.</p>

                            <p>The basic idea of social stratification is a series of layers, rather as one bolt of cloth might be piled on top of another. It was developed in European society to explain clashes between the old aristocracy of landed wealth, the new industrial capitalists and the workers, over political and economic power and cultural dominance. Stratification is the organisation of society resulting in some members having more and others having less. Social stratification is thus defined as a process ranking members of society according to wealth, prestige and power. This definition mainly applies in European communities where defined explanation is acceptable. In African societies, members are ranked according to sex, age, ethnic origin and occupation (Peil 1977).</p>

                            <p>Other definitions of social stratification include the arranging of members of a society into a pattern of superior and inferior ranks, which is perhaps determined by their birth, wealth, power, education, and so on. It can also be said to be the way societies are organised, for example, into clans, castes, chiefdoms, or states within a society.</p>
                            
                            <p>Systems of social inequity exist in all human societies. This assertion emphasises two features that are basic for analysis of social inequalities and equalities.</p>
                            
                            <p>Firstly, the inequalities, no matter what their origin, appear in a social context. Biological differences, real or presumed, may be used as a basis for social stratification, but biology alone does not make a social difference. It is more likely that biology is invoked as a rationale to support established social inequalities. When social definitions with respect to equality change, so do the biological justifications that are used.</p>
                            
                            <p>Secondly the equalities are systematic. They are organised into patterns that are recognised and accepted by most, but not all, members of the society. Social differences are interlaced in the dominant values of a society; the inequalities are justified by the very beliefs that regulate a society and give it continuity.</p>
                            
                            <p>A stratification system has both a moral/cultural base and a structural base. Each culture has some view of an admirable person against which individuals may measure their own and others' conduct, an ideal that people try to live up to. This may be generalised or specified as behaviour that is expected of holders of certain roles, for example, a father. Stratification arises from the division of labour, whereby certain roles are admired more than others. Members of the society are valued according to the roles they fill and also according to the way the role is carried out.</p>
                            
                            <p>Much more attention is usually paid to the structural aspect of stratification (the processes for allocating people to roles and the societal structure which results) than to the cultural aspect (beliefs about how and why people are allocated and the justice or injustice of the process). Some roles are held to be important, but are in fact given to less able people or are poorly rewarded.</p>

                            <h3 id="functional-theory">The Functional Theory of Stratification</h3>
                            <p>The functional theory of stratification holds that a society, through its members, makes certain decisions about the allocation of desirable roles. Choice is limited by the number of these roles and the number of people available to perform them. The rewards attached to various roles (wealth, prestige or power) are justified by the service to society involved (especially to societal survival) and the rarity of the abilities needed to fill them.</p>

                            <h3 id="conflict-theory">The Conflict Theory of Stratification</h3>
                            <p>The conflict theory of stratification draws largely on the writings of Karl Marx, though adjustments have been necessary to adapt in the changing nature of twentieth century capitalism. Marx saw society as divided into two major groups (capitalists and proletarians or workers) who are inevitably in conflict. Whereas Marx was particularly concerned only with the economic or market hierarchy, which he termed class, Max Weber suggested that people are also stratified according to status (prestige or lifestyle) and power. These three hierarchies may be closely related, but this is not necessarily so. Marx assumed that those with a high economic position would also have power, but rich businessmen often have less power than higher civil servants on moderate salaries; clergymen and teachers usually have higher status than either wealth or power - though this was more likely some time back.</p>

                            <p>Another way of ranking society members is according to their status. Status can be defined as any position within the stratification system. This definition says nothing about the basis for status in a stratification system. Thus a particular status or position can be high or low on the basis of the property, prestige or power (or all three) associated with that position. There are two types of status.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Ascribed Status</strong><br>
                                    This is explained as grouping individuals according to their social position, for example, by virtue of one's age, sex or position of birth (indicates that the holder of this position was born within or inherited a given status in society). Ascribed status is a position based on who you are not what you can do.
                                    <br><br>
                                    A good example of ascribed status can be found in India, where the caste system is practised. Members of the upper caste do not in any way interact with those of the lower caste or the untouchables. Members of the upper caste are usually well educated, while those of the lower caste are poor with limited opportunities and are usually manual workers. These two caste level societies do not intermarry (Joseph 1986). This system is also known as a closed system of social stratification.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Therefore, when a society uses ascriptive status rules, people are placed in status positions because of certain traits beyond their control such as family background, race, sex or place of birth.

                                    <strong>Achieved/Acquired Status</strong><br>
                                    Achieved status is a position gained on the basis of merit or achievement. This is defined as the position in society earned through the individual's efforts or choice, for example, being a father, mother, nurse or a teacher.
