                                Factors Influencing the Development of a Curriculum
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>There are several factors that influence curriculum development.</p>

                            <h3>Academic Factors</h3>
                            <p>The teachers who teach the main subjects of a discipline often borrow from their past experiences and merge them with the current trends of the discipline. For example, you now have more nurse graduates who are prepared in advanced nursing practices and you can introduce content that was not included before. Thus, theories of nursing, trends, research and so on that were only taught in higher nursing programmes at university level previously are now incorporated into your curriculum. The new content is designed to make you a more effective practitioner in the provision of quality health care.</p>

                            <h3>Social Factors</h3>
                            <p>What is taught has to reflect what is current within the contemporary society. This means it has to be relevant to the needs of the local people socially and culturally. For example, with the advent of AIDS, this new topic has had to be included in the content. The topic bears a lot of importance to human existence and is emphasised in all branches of health care and development.</p>

                            <h3>Economic Factors</h3>
                            <p>The cost of implementation of a curriculum can determine the type of health worker trained by a given country. In developing countries, staff are often trained at a lower level of education in skills that are usually taught to university graduates in highly industrialised countries. This is because in developing countries, university education adds a cost burden to the limited resources. Thus, for example, midwives in developing countries carry out life saving measures that are left for experts in industrialised countries.</p>

                            <h3>Political Factors</h3>
                            <p>Politicians or political investors can influence the numbers to be trained and even the level of training. For instance, the introduction of the quota system in the Kenyan basic education system was politically motivated with the aim that all ethnic groups might receive equal attention.</p>
                            
                            <p>This, therefore, implies that an individual does not develop a curriculum. It is a cooperative process in which many interested parties contribute.</p>
                            
                            <p>Consultations must be made where possible from all people who might be involved in the development of your health curriculum. These are the people who, in one way or another, exert influence directly or indirectly or decide what activities should be involved, including the style of implementation of the curriculum. These people fall into two categories: internal and external participants. You will now look at the first category.</p>

                            <h3>Internal Participants in Curriculum Development</h3>
                            <p>Internal participants in curriculum development include individuals from professional associations, ministries of health and education, boards of examinations, administrators of the training institutions, teachers and students. This group of participants is, therefore, called internal because they are directly involved in the curriculum and so have a greater impact on its development. They develop the curriculum, teach it and evaluate the curriculum and the students.</p>

                            <h3>External Participants in Curriculum Development</h3>
                            <p>The external participants constitute the second category. Although are not directly involved in curriculum development, they are either beneficiaries of the product, service or provide resources to facilitate its implementation or may liaise within the institution in various ways. As such, they can easily influence decisions made by the internal group. This group comprises the community, business, industry and non governmental organisations. When consulted properly, these two groups ought to produce a curriculum that enables the desired change in health care services.</p>

                                Major Approaches to Curriculum Development
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>There are several approaches to curriculum development.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Subject-centred Approach</strong><br>
                                    This is carried out by subject specialists, who determine the subdivision of content and the methods and timing of instruction.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Integrated Approach</strong><br>
                                    This approach attempts to integrate or combine in a meaningful way, disciplined knowledge to impact wholesome learning for student application.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Competency-based Approach</strong><br>
                                    It aims at identifying professional competencies required and the teaching required to achieve these competencies.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>These approaches, as outlined by Ngatia (Afya Journal 1986) have advantages and disadvantages. The subject-centred approach, for instance, emphasises the acquisition of disciplined knowledge rather than its application. In the integrated approach, knowledge can be wholesome and meaningful but integration can fall short of adequate vertical and horizontal integration. The competency-based approach is preferred for professional training by most curriculum developers.</p>

                            <h3>Typical features of a competency-based approach</h3>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The curriculum is organized around the functions of a health worker in a specified setting.</li>
                                <li>The "output" of training is a health worker who can practice at a defined level of proficiency in accordance with local conditions.</li>
                                <li>It is assumed that the majority of individuals can master the required level of proficiency—given appropriate instruction &amp; sufficient time.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--note">
                                <div class="callout-header">
                                    <span class="callout-icon">ℹ️</span>
                                    <h4 class="callout-title">Note</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>The approach emphasizes that the setting within which the health worker will be expected to operate is an extremely important determinant of the required level &amp; type of competence</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <h3>Disadvantages of Competency-based approach</h3>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The dynamic nature of jobs—when jobs change, health workers may be stranded unless continuing education is provided &amp; this may be costly.</li>
                                <li>Lists of tasks to be mastered—normally, this list is long &amp; demands that the duration of training be prolonged. This can also turn out to be costly.</li>
                                <li>It focuses on tasks which health workers perform (operative competencies). This is a major handicap when the health worker is exposed to situations which demand initiative &amp; independent thinking eg. when drugs/equipment change, the health worker cannot adopt.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Throughout modules one and three and particularly in units one and two of module three, you looked at the community health profile needed to identify community health needs. The steps included conducting a survey or community diagnosis to specify the community's priority needs. After data collection, the next step was to organise the information into a report to give feedback to relevant groups for a follow up health action in response to the identified needs.</p>
                            <p>Your next task is to describe what activities the graduates of the programme will perform with respect to meeting the required health needs. This should be summarised in a job description.</p>
                            <p>The next step is to determine what knowledge, attitude and skills graduates will need to acquire to enable them perform those tasks. This is known as task analysis.</p>
                            
                            <p>Very briefly, a curriculum, therefore, must contain the following components:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Objectives</li>

                                <li>Teaching methods</li>
                                <li>Assessments</li>
                                <li>Entry requirements</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>What other components would you add to the above list?</p>
                            
                            <p>Mutema, Kangethe and Naweya (1999) outlined a simple ten-step method of developing a competency-based curriculum that has been found useful in the development of any curriculum.</p>
