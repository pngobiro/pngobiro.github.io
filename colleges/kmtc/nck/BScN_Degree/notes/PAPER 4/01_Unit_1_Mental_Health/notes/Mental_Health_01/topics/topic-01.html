                            <p>According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), mental health is a state of emotional well-being which enables one to function comfortably within society and to be satisfied with one's own achievements.</p>

                                                Latent phase, where there is no sexual interest, this divides boys and girls into different groups.

                                    <strong>Id</strong><br>
                                    The id is the most primitive and is driven by impulses. It demands immediate gratification of the needs.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Super Ego</strong><br>
                                    The super ego, whose main function is to oppose the id. It contains values, legal, moral regulations, and social expectations.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    The ego, which unlike the id, is in contact with reality. It is able to delay the satisfaction of a need until an appropriate time, place, or object is available. It mediates between the id and the super ego.

                            <p>Erikson postulated eight human developmental stages which one has to go through in normal life. He called them psychosocial stages. Each stage is characterised by tasks or ego qualities, which one has to develop in normal life. You will now examine one stage at a time.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Trust versus Mistrust</strong><br>
                                    This is attained during infancy. Trust is developed when the mother breastfeeds the infant as well as meeting other needs of the infant such as changing wet diapers. The approximate age at which the individual goes through this stage is 0 - 18 months.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Autonomy versus Shame and Doubt</strong><br>
                                    During this period the child wants some independence from the mother. This happens approximately at the age of 18 months to 3 years and this period is referred to as toddlerhood.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Initiative versus Guilt</strong><br>
                                    This occurs at approximately 3 to 6 years, otherwise known as the pre-school years. The child is able to initiate action on its own in an effort to manipulate the environment.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Industry versus Inferiority</strong><br>
                                    This takes place during school years between the ages of 6 to 12 years. The child is able to acquire skills in sports, calculate in figures and language skills are well developed.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Identity versus Role Confusion</strong><br>
                                    This occurs around the age of 12 to 20 years and is referred to as adolescence. During this time an individual acquires an identity as a male or female corresponding to specific roles in the society.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Intimacy versus Isolation</strong><br>
                                    This occurs at an approximate age of between 20 to 40 years. Here, one has productive work and has satisfactory sexual relations with an intimate member of the opposite sex.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Generativity versus Stagnation</strong><br>
                                    This usually occurs between the ages of 45 to 65 years. During this period, one is involved in establishing and guiding the next generation. Productivity and creativity is at its peak.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Integrity versus Despair</strong><br>
                                    This refers to the phase from around the age of 65 till death. During this time one develops new and different love for one's parents. One also develops emotional integration and is able to defend the dignity of one's own life-style against threat. The individual is capable of fellowship and will often take leadership responsibilities in the community.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>It is worth noting that, it is only after satisfactory completion of one stage that one is ready to move to the next. Any person who is unable to go through one stage successfully would experience difficulties in subsequent stages of human development.

                            <p>You will now look at the components of psychiatric nursing, starting with the factors of mental illness.</p>
                            <p>The causes of mental illness can be classified into three categories:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">

                                    <strong>Predisposing Factors</strong><br>
                                    These factors determine the likelihood of one getting a mental illness. Usually they are adverse experiences one undergoes in early life. They include physical, psychological and social factors in infancy and early childhood.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Precipitating Factors</strong><br>
                                    These are events that take place shortly before the onset of a disorder. Physical precipitants include cerebral tumours, malaria or drug abuse. Social and psychological precipitants include misfortunes such as loss of a job, losing a loved person, or sudden change in routine activities.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Perpetuating Factors</strong><br>
                                    Once the disorder has been triggered, these factors do prolong the course of the disease. They are secondary in nature since they may appear long after the original predisposing factors have been treated. Examples include secondary demoralisation and withdrawal from social activities.

                            <p>The main aims of the ICD 10 working party, when they drew up the classification system, were that they would create a system that:</p>

                                <li>Was suitable for international communication on statistics of morbidity and mortality</li>

                            <p>To achieve these aims, the classification also had to be acceptable to a wide range of users in different cultures. It had to be practical in that it would be simple to use and easy to translate into different languages.</p>

                            <p>Having outlined the classification of mental illness, you will now turn your attention to the factors that influence attitudes towards mental health and mental illness. In this section, you are going to look at just a few examples.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">

                                    <strong>Culture</strong><br>
                                    The way people think, behave or feel is shaped by their culture. Culture also determines the features of insanity, for example, who is labelled as insane and under what circumstances. What is considered insane in one culture may be considered perfectly normal in another. Culture also gives guidelines on the nature of treatment and the identity of the helper.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Education</strong><br>
                                    The level of education also influences attitudes towards mental health and mental illness. An educated person has a better understanding of health and mental illness, thus making their attitude more positive.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Health Beliefs</strong><br>
                                    These will determine whether the individual's attitude is positive or negative. It will depend on how the patient explains the illness to themselves, that is, whether they believe in germ theory, evil spirits or an imbalance of some kind.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Religion</strong><br>
                                    A patient's reaction to mental illness will often depend on whether or not the patient believes in God or a particular religion, for example, some religions believe that ill health is caused by evil spirits. Usually, religion encourages the followers to be empathetic to sick people.

                            <p>Having looked at the factors that influence attitudes towards mental health and mental illness, you will now look at the principles of psychiatric nursing and various ways of assisting the patient to overcome the prevailing problems.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Respect for the Patient</strong><br>
                                    This is achieved by accepting the patient as they are. The therapist should take time to listen to the patient and provide privacy for all conversations. Minimise situations and experiences that might humiliate the patient and be honest in providing information on medicines, privileges, length of management and stays in hospital if indicated.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Availability</strong><br>
                                    The nurse must be constantly available to assist the patient to attain their basic needs and alleviate suffering.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Spontaneity</strong><br>
                                    You should avoid being overly formal. Instead, you should be comfortable with yourself, be flexible and aware of the therapeutic goals.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Acceptance</strong><br>
                                    Even if the patient behaves in a way that does not please the nurse, they should be accepted as they are, but taking care not to reinforce their behaviour.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Sensitivity</strong><br>
                                    You should do your best to show genuine interest and concern. You should be persistent and patient even if no observable improvement is made.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Accountability</strong><br>
                                    Since mentally ill patients are vulnerable due to their distorted thinking and behaviour, accountability is required more in a psychiatric setting than any other type of health care (Peplau, cited by Wilson and Kneisl, 1988). You are also accountable to yourself as well as professional colleagues and peers.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Empathy</strong><br>
                                    This is the process of putting yourself in another's shoes and remaining emotionally detached. The nurse should strive to understand the patient's perspective, and work toward mutually developed goals. The most important function of empathy is that it enables you to give the patient the feeling of being understood and cared about.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Self-understanding</strong><br>
                                    This involves recognition and acceptance of your own behaviour and how it affects your relationship with other people. This will inevitably help you, as a therapist, to understand other peoples' behaviour, needs and problems.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Permissiveness and Firmness</strong><br>
                                    Although you have been told to accept the patient as they are, this does not mean that you are in a position to allow them to do whatever they like. The therapist is expected to set limits and to be firm in implementing them.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Skill in Observation</strong><br>
                                    It is important for a psychiatric nurse to be alert and observant at all times of the patient's behaviour, attitudes and how they react to staff, relatives and fellow patients.

                            <p>Psychiatric nursing, and the understanding of mental illness, with which it associates, has developed in several epochs through the centuries. You will now look at each of those epochs in more detail.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                    <strong>Demonological Period</strong>
                                    <p>The earliest records of a person believed to have suffered from mental illness relate to king Nebuchadnezzar, who ate grass believing that he was an ox. Another example is Ajax, who impaled himself on a sword believing that he was tormented by demons.</p>
                                    <p>During that time people believed that the cause of mental illness was demons. The treatment was quite harsh, degrading and dehumanising and involved beating, chaining, locking the individual up in a dark room and throwing the individual into rivers and ponds.</p>
                                    <p>Those patients who escaped this harsh treatment survived on stealing food or eating wild fruits. Wild animals ate up those who inadvertently wandered into the forest.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Political Period</strong>
                                    <p>This period is associated with King Edward II of England.</p>
                                    <p>During that time, a law was passed in the parliament to protect the property of the mentally sick. In the year 1403, the Sisters of the Order of Saint Mary managed to start a facility to care for the mentally sick at Bedlam. The facility was able to accommodate six patients only. Thereafter, other hospitals followed the example.</p>
                                    <p>The cause of mental illness, however, was still thought to be demons. The treatment, therefore, remained more or less as in the demonological period. Facilities were often dark, humid and infested with lice. They were also overcrowded, leading to mass deaths during outbreaks of disease such as the plague.</p>
                                    <p>In the early 18th century, the first qualified nurse was appointed to look after the mentally ill by Edward Tyson. However, although qualified, the nurses appointed to look after the mentally sick were equally harsh to patients.</p>
                                    <p>Men and women were housed together and members of the public used to visit these facilities as a form of entertainment. It was at St. Luke's hospital in London where this form of entertainment was eventually banned. In order to enforce the policy, members of the public were only allowed to see the mentally ill in the presence of an attendant after being issued with a ticket.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Humanitarian Period</strong>
                                    <p>During this period, reforms of the patient care system for the mentally ill began in France, followed by Britain and later America.</p>
                                    <p>Reform in France started in 1793 at Bicetre Hospital in Paris.</p>
                                    <p>Dr. Philippe Pinel unchained a group of patients who had been in chains for 30 years. He advocated kindness for mentally sick persons, and as a result there was a marked improvement in mentally sick patients.</p>
                                    <p>William Tuke started reforms in Britain in 1796. He advocated humane treatment of the mentally sick. In addition, he introduced what we today call 'occupational therapy'. Men were involved in gardening while women were involved in sewing. Both men and women assisted attendants in their daily work activities. It is worth noting that so far, members of staff were not specifically trained to deal with mental health issues. In 1808, a bill was passed to regulate the treatment of mental health patients.</p>
                                    <p>In America, Dorothea Lynda Dix introduced reforms after visiting Britain and seeing how mentally sick persons were improving after getting reformed type of management. In 1841, she managed to have a bill passed in parliament to regulate the treatment of the mentally sick in America.</p>
                                    <p>In 1853, Dr. W.A.F Browne started giving informal mental health lectures to nurses so as to give quality care.</p>
                                    <p>By 1882, formal training on mental health had begun in America at McLean Hospital, Boston.</p>
                                    <p>In 1884, formal training in mental health was started in Germany and thereafter other countries followed that example.</p>

                                    <strong>The Scientific Period</strong>
                                    <p>The scientific period is associated with the 19th Century. During that period science was devoted to developing modern treatments that were based on scientific findings. Many forms of treatments were discovered and later abandoned like hydrotherapy, insulin therapy and leucotomy.</p>
                                    <p>The current forms of treatments include physical treatment like chemotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy.</p>
                                    <p>There are also various psychological treatments, which include:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li>Individual/group psychotherapy</li>
                                        <li>Behaviour therapy</li>
                                        <li>Occupational therapy</li>
                                        <li>Rehabilitation</li>

                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Some of these treatments will be covered in more detail in section two of this unit</p>
                                    <p>The scientific period witnessed the integration of mental health services with other health services. Trained manpower was developed to care for the mentally sick.</p>
                                    <p>Men and women were either managed separately or in the same wards, depending on the policy of the particular hospital.</p>
                                    <p>Children were managed in special wards. Where resources were available, different mental health conditions were managed in different units</p>

                            <p>The current Mathari hospital was started in July 1910 as a lunatic asylum. Before then, the facility served as a smallpox isolation centre. The asylum was renamed Mathari Mental Hospital in 1924. The care was mainly custodial, taking place in dark, gloomy and often damp conditions.</p>
                            <p>Europeans, Africans, and Asians were managed separately and the quality of mental health care provided depended on the individual's racial background.</p>
                            <p>Mathari was the only mental hospital until the 1962 Decentralisation of Mental Health Services Act. Other facilities began to spring up, including a 22 bed psychiatric unit in Nakuru in 1962, Machakos in 1963, Nyeri and Muranga in 1964 and Port Reitz and Kakamega in 1965.</p>
                            <p>Currently all provincial hospitals have operational psychiatric units. However, only some district hospitals have operational psychiatric units. Outpatient psychiatric clinics have been established in most of the district hospitals.</p>
                            <p>Mathari hospital is being redeveloped, and the future plan is to intensify community based psychiatric services all over the country. It is worth noting that community psychiatric services were established in Nairobi in 1983.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Training of Mental Health Workers</h4>
                            <p>The training of enrolled psychiatric nurses was started in 1961 and later changed to a post enrolled psychiatric nursing course. In 1963, the first two registered psychiatric nurses were trained overseas.</p>
                            <p>In 1979, a post basic diploma in psychiatric nursing was started in Kenya. Between 1972 and 1982 most psychiatrists received overseas training at the Institute of Psychiatry in England.</p>
                            <p>In 1982, the University of Nairobi started training psychiatrists.</p>
