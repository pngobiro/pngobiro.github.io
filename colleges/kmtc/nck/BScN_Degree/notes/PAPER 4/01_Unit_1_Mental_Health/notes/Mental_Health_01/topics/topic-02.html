                                    Here you ask for information pertaining to age, sex, marital status, occupation, residence and nationality.
                                </li>

                                    Ask the patient questions relating to their mode of delivery, as well as milestones in infancy and early childhood. You may ask the patient when they started school and their educational performance as well as about possible incidents of traumatic experience like falling or losing a parent.
                                </li>

                                    You should try to find out about the nature of the patient's occupation, how they relate to both sexes, whether they are outgoing or not, the number of friends the patient has of both sexes and whether or not the patient is involved in religious activities.
                                </li>

                                    In taking down this information, you are aiming to check the degree of sexual satisfaction with the marriage partner, male or female friend, frequency of sexual relationships and the patient's attitude to sex.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Family History</strong><br>
                                    Ask the patient about their parents, brothers and sisters. For each one of them you are trying to find out whether they are married, occupation etc. in an attempt to identify possible family behavioural patterns. If the patient is married, try and find out the sibling line up of the patient's spouse as well.
                                </li>

                                    By taking down the patient's medical history, you are in a position to find out about any medical conditions the patient has suffered, which may have affected their mental health. You should also try and find out if there have been any incidences of the patient being admitted into a mental unit/hospital and the outcome of the treatment.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>History of Presenting Illness</strong><br>
                                    Ask the patient about the onset of the illness, duration, any allegations that brought them to the mental hospital and the patient's pre-morbid history, that is, how they presented before they became mentally ill. <strong>Remember:</strong> In an outpatient clinic, this information is better taken first, since the patient or the informant would like to talk about it straight away.

                                    Try and evaluate whether the patient is manic, depressed, labile or flat. You should also try and establish the patient's judgment, by checking for signs of logical thinking. In addition, you should look into whether or not the patient has 'insight', that is, whether or not they are aware of their mental illness.
