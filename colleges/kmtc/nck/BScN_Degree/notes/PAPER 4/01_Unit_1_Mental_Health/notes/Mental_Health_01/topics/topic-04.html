                            <p>In this section you will be required to reflect on the classification of mental illness. This knowledge will assist you to better understand any of the conditions that might come under discussion. For each condition, efforts will be made to include definition, causes, psychopathology, clinical features, methods of diagnosis and management.</p>
                            <p>To avoid repetition, the content of psychopathology will be treated as a separate topic at the beginning. You will then be expected to apply the knowledge in all relevant mental health conditions.</p>
                            
                            <h3 id="psychopathology">Psychopathology</h3>
                            <p>Psychopathology is defined as the study of abnormal states of mind. There are many approaches to psychopathology but in this material, developmental psychopathology will be used. This approach examines different maladaptive behaviours displayed during childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Since personality development is a continuous process, behaviour in childhood and adolescence do overlap. It is important to note that emotional problems in childhood can surface later and plague a person in adulthood.</p>

                                    <p>Since children do not have realistic view of themselves and their world, they have less self-understanding and have not developed a stable sense of identity. Therefore, children have less developed coping mechanisms when it comes to dealing with stressful situations. Children tend to use unrealistic concepts to explain events since they have limited perspectives. For example, in an effort to join a dead parent, the child may commit suicide.</p>
                                    <p>Children are protected against stress by parents since they are dependent on them. However, if the parents ignore the child, they experience rejection, disappointment and failure. Since children lack experience in dealing with problems, ordinary hardships are magnified.</p>
                                    <p>Problems that look minor to adults easily hurt children causing psychological trauma. These series of traumatic experiences may surface later in life in the form of mental illness.</p>

                            <p>Schizophrenia is a group of mental disorders that presents with varied symptoms of disordered thinking and bizarre social behaviour. It affects approximately 1% of the total population, including adolescents and young adults. There is increased incidence in the lower social class. Patients with this condition occupy 50% of beds in mental hospitals.</p>

                                    <strong>Short-term Goals</strong><br>
                                    These are goals that can be accomplished in the shortest time interval and must be done before the patient can move on to accomplish other types of goals. For example, to ensure that the patient establishes contact with the nurse.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Intermediate Goals</strong><br>
                                    An intermediate goal might be for a patient to express their feelings in whatever mode they are able. This is not possible before the patient learns sufficient trust to share their painful and unacceptable thoughts. The patient must give up behaviours that hinder nurse-patient interaction in the working phase.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Long-term Goals</strong><br>
                                    To attain this objective, the patient needs to trust other people, and to communicate fully enough so that others become familiar with the patient's symbolic representations and characteristic modes of thought.
                                </li>

                                    Using tricyclic medication (e.g., imipramine). Build up to the effective dose over 7-10 days. Start with 25-50mg each night and build up to 100-150mg.<br>
                                    <strong>Antimanic drugs:</strong> If the patient displays excitement or disruptive behaviour, antipsychotic medication is needed initially, for example, haloperidol (1.5-4mg tid).<br>
                                    <strong>Lithium:</strong> Desired level is 0.4-0.8mmol/litre. Stop immediately if levels are >1.5mmol/litre or if diarrhoea/vomiting occurs.

                                    achieved through having sexual activity or through fantasy of such activity with pre-pubertal children. Treatment involves behavioural therapy and group treatment, which have, unfortunately, had little success.

                                    <strong>Fetishism</strong><br>
                                    This involves the use of an inanimate object as a means of attaining sexual excitement. It could also involve parts of the human body that are not related with sex act. It is not uncommon for men to be sexually excited by a part or clothing of a female. However, the behaviour becomes abnormal when it takes the precedence over usual sexual intercourse.

                                    <strong>Exhibitionism</strong><br>
                                    This is the repeated exposure of genitals to unprepared strangers in order to get sexual excitement but with no further effort to have sex with the stranger concerned. The average age is 20-40 years and the condition is usually found in men.

                                    <strong>Transsexualism (Gender Identity)</strong><br>
                                    People who are transsexual have a strong belief that they are of a gender opposite to that signified by their external genitalia. The person concerned has a strong urge to live like a member of the opposite sex.

                            <p>The first step in the assessment is to exclude mental illness since abnormal sexual preference, is commonly secondary to dementia, alcoholism, depressive disorders or mania. These illnesses are thought to release previous fantasies that had not been acted upon.</p>
