                            <p>Bellak (cited by Kalkman, 1967) says that the first phase of psychiatry as an independent science was witnessed at the end of the eighteenth century. This period is symbolised by the striking off of the chains of the mentally ill by Pinel at Bicetre Hospital in 1793.</p>
                            <p>Sigmund Freud brought about the second phase in the evolution of psychiatry when he introduced psychoanalysis.</p>
                            <p>The third phase was the advent of community psychiatry or community mental health. It should be noted that the two terms are not identical in meaning.</p>

In 1949, the National Institute of Mental Health was founded under this Act, under the direction of President Kennedy. The Congress enacted Public Law in October 31 1963, which required that mental retardation centres and mental health centres be constructed.</p>

                            <p>In 1964, the Community Mental Act specified the essential elements of comprehensive mental health services. Each centre was to have:</p>

                            <p>There are at least twelve directions and developments, which characterise mental health as contrasted with traditional psychiatry:</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">When a disease or a dysfunction causes permanent disability, tertiary prevention is used to limit the severity of the disability in the early stages of the disease. In those cases where residual damage is being experienced, disability is permanent and tertiary prevention takes the form of rehabilitation.</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                        <li>Retraining and education</li>

                            <p>Psychiatry has traditionally focused on secondary and tertiary prevention. Secondary prevention involves lowering the disability rate by shortening the average duration of nervous disturbances through early diagnosis and effective treatment. Tertiary prevention involves reduction of disability in individuals with long-standing and incurable psychiatric disorder. By contrast, primary prevention is total prevention.</p>

                                                <strong>Biological Measures</strong><br>
                                                This includes the development of adaptive life style, improvement of diet, having routine exercise, and overall good health habits.

                                                <strong>Psychosocial Measures</strong><br>
                                                Here opportunities to learn physical, intellectual, emotional and social competencies are provided. For example an individual is assisted to develop skills needed for effective problem solving, for expressing emotions constructively and for satisfying relationships with others. The person may also be helped to acquire an accurate frame of reference on which to build their own personality.

                                                <strong>Socio-cultural Measures</strong><br>
                                                These measures ensure a reciprocal relationship between an individual and their community. They also encourage social conditions that promote healthy development and functioning individuals, and incorporate services ranging from public education and social security to economic planning and social legislation directed at ensuring adequate health care for all citizens.

                            <h3 id="selective">Selective Intervention</h3>
                            <p>This model involves the establishment of programs that prevent the development of disorders, before people become so involved with certain behaviour patterns that future adjustments become difficult or impossible.</p>
                            <p>Examples of successful programs include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Education programs, which involve the provision of information to the groups at risk.</li>
                                <li>Intervention programs involving the identification of high-risk groups and taking the necessary measures.</li>
                                <li>Peer group influence programs, which help youngsters to overcome negative pressures from peers by being assertive.</li>
                                <li>Programs to increase self-esteem, which enable the individual to overcome pressure from more dominant peers.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="indicated">Indicated Intervention</h3>
                            <p>This program emphasises the early detection and prompt treatment of maladaptive behaviours in a person's family and community setting. For example, in a crisis after a disaster, immediate and relatively brief intervention is carried out to prevent any long-term consequences.</p>
