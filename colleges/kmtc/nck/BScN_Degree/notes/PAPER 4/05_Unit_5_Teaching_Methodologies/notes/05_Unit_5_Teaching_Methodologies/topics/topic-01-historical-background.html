                            <p>What do you know about the history of education in Kenya?</p>
                            <p>Education is as old as mankind and learning takes place in various ways. Individuals are at different levels of learning at any given time and education influences the way people behave in different circumstances. It is important for you to know the level of the learners' education so as to be able to select an appropriate teaching strategy.</p>
                            <p>Education has developed steadily since independence with specific commissions looking at education systems periodically and making recommendations for approval. These are the commissions that recommend changes in the education systems that you see today, like the 8-4-4 system and university education for nurses.</p>
                            <p>Before the coming of the Europeans to Kenya, most learning took place through the oral narration of events passed down from older generations. Formal learning in schools, including reading and writing, came with the arrival of the Europeans, especially the British, who also introduced the English language. Education was seen as a vehicle for development. Many African learners began to take formal education seriously and many children went to school to be able to learn and communicate effectively.</p>
                            
                            <h4 id="reports-commissions">Post-Independence Developments</h4>
                            <p>At independence, the need for educated Kenyans to take over from the colonial authorities became urgent. To provide direction, specific commissions were set up to investigate ways of improving education to fight ignorance, disease and poverty (Ominde Report: 1964). Several other reports were compiled including the Appleton (1995), Angwenyi (1995), and Lloyd and Blane (1996) reports.</p>
                            <p>There are generally more boys than girls accessing education in Kenya. The government has made concerted efforts to increase enrolment of girls in both primary and secondary schools. The restructuring of secondary schools is highlighted in a number of reports, including those by Mackay (1981), Mungai (1987) and Koech (1999). These reports are available for further reading in your library. Various commissions have also been set up to look into educational matters in relation to the government's vision for the country's socio-economic development.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Before independence, many people went to traditional healers and herbalists for treatment. The colonialists, through the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEA), from 1895-1901 were involved in the creation of a medical department. This department was meant to oversee the health care of the members of the colonial community, but eventually spread to encompass colonial employees and members of the wider community.</p>
                            
                            <h3>How have various education trends affected nursing education in Kenya?</h3>
                            <p>In 1927, a form of 'on the job training' in nursing for Africans was put in place. Trainees were taught reading, writing, arithmetic and hygiene (Ndirangu: 1992). Formal training of dressers started in 1929. Following this, several systems emerged. These included:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Nursing Council Ordinance (1949)</li>
                                <li>Kenya Registered Nursing (1952)</li>
                                <li>Kenya Enrolled Nursing (1959)</li>
                                <li>Kenya Registered Midwives (1965) in Ngara</li>
                                <li>The current Kenya Medical Training College in Nairobi</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Following the implementation of these courses, the government realised the need to develop a comprehensive and multipurpose nursing programme in order to address primary health care issues. This occurred long before the Alma Ata Declaration of Primary Healthcare in 1978.</p>

                                    <p>Several qualification courses emerged. These included the Kenya Enrolled Community Health Nurse (1966) and the Diploma in Advanced Nursing at Nairobi University (1968). The latter was the government's response to the need for skilled manpower in nursing to take over senior administrative positions after the colonialists had left (Musandu: 1989). Other courses included:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                        <li>Masters in Medical Education at the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC), Nairobi (1999) in conjunction with Dundee University.</li>
                                    </ul>

                            </div>
                            
                            <p>Dundee University and KMTC prepare nurses in Bachelors and Masters Degrees in nursing through distance learning.</p>
                            <p>These changes and developments in nursing education were brought by the improving trends of basic education, particularly for women in the country. Finally, continuing education enables health workers to keep abreast of the advancing technology and the thinking or expectations of people and communities.</p>
                            <p>Conversion courses for ECN/EN/EM to registered level have gone on for many years. With the increase in demand, it was deemed necessary to establish distance learning programmes to enable more people to continue their education while still providing services to their patients.</p>

                                    <p>At a Maternal and Child Health (MCH) clinic, mothers are taught the importance of immunisation. One mother had previously ignored this advice and lost a number of children due to measles, a preventable disease. She shared her loss with a nurse who encouraged her to attend a child welfare clinic regularly for advice on the care of her baby. A few years later, she was a proud mother of a five-year old enrolled in the preprimary unit. She was now in the frontline, advising others to get their children immunised.</p>

                            <p>Principles are rules, laws, truth or facts about something. Principles arise as a result of repeated experience, leading to a deeper understanding of ideas on the processes of teaching and learning. These situations and experiences have tested certain theories in the learning environment.</p>
                            <p>These theories, in turn, have an influence on the development of principles. These hypotheses or theories explain why and how people learn or don't learn.</p>
                            
                            <h3>What principles of learning do you know?</h3>
                            <p>There are four ingredients of particular importance in a learning situation. These include motivation, information, practice and feedback. These ingredients act as a lubricant for learning. It has also been pointed out that students learn using the following principles of learning:</p>

                            <h3>Characteristics of Learning</h3>
                            <p>Several important characteristics of learning can be observed in a teaching and learning situation. These revolve around a situation that:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Produces a behaviour change in the learner.</li>
                                <li>Leads to change that is gradual, adaptable and selective.</li>
                                <li>Results from repetitive practice and experience.</li>
                                <li>Is not directly observable, it is abstract.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This means that there are activities the learner must do in order to learn. For example, learners listen to somebody or to a sound. They talk to each other, observe activities, watch a practical example, perform under instructions and are able to repeat an action following a demonstration.</p>
                            <p>Other important characteristics, also referred to as conditions for learning include the following three as outlined below.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Feedback and Evaluation</strong><br>
                                    Learning is a consequence of experience from repetitive acts. People need to be able to check what they are learning, try it out for themselves and correct mistakes. This is related to motivation and it produces a sense of satisfaction from the lesson when the learner realises that they can also perform.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Practice and Repetition</strong><br>
                                    Learning evolves from competence through repetition. This applies both to skills and knowledge. Learning is something that people do or participate in doing. As the saying goes, 'practice makes perfect'.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Systematic Approach</strong><br>
                                    Learning is easier if it is organised systematically. It should start from the known to the unknown. As you teach, you should relate the new information to the old information that the learner already knows. The more the learner participates and feels involved, the more they learn. When learners cooperate and collaborate, they learn better and can help others to learn.

                            <p>There are three main schools of thought in the theory of learning.</p>
                            
                            <h3>1. Cognitive Theories</h3>
                            <p>These theories originated from a group of scholars who studied the ways in which knowledge is acquired, stored, correlated and retrieved. Cognitive theorists believe that knowing is a mental process that results in one being aware of a situation or project. You will now look at several of these theorists in turn.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>B. S. Bloom</strong><br>
                                    He proposed three domains of learning. These were:
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li>Affective domain, that is, concerned with attitudes.</li>
                                        <li>Cognitive domain, that is, concerned with knowledge.</li>
                                        <li>Psychomotor domain, that is, concerned with muscular and mental activities.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    According to Bloom, there are levels of learning that a learner must go through, starting from the basic existing knowledge to the highest level possible, that is, from simple to complex. The teacher should cater for the relevant levels of the learner. Learning skills involve a certain amount of knowledge and appropriate attitudes for their proper performance.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>D.P. Ausubel</strong><br>
                                    Ausubel emphasised that learning should start from the known to the unknown and from simple to complex. He noted that new information fits into existing knowledge like a key fits into a lock. For example, a child is taught how to cook ugali after learning how to make uji. The initial steps of this process include lighting a fire, measuring an amount of water in a cooking pot and bringing it to boil. This is followed by mixing an amount of flour into a thin paste, adding it to the boiling water and then stirring for a specified time until the uji is ready. In the case of ugali, the process starts in the same way, except that the flour is put directly into the boiling water and stirred constantly into a thick paste. Thus, once the child knows how to prepare uji, they will not need to learn the initial stages of how to bring the water to a boil, but will only need to learn what is different in the preparation of ugali, that is, that the flour is stirred in directly in the boiling water.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>J. Bruner</strong><br>
                                    Bruner recommended discovery learning. The teacher provides problems for the learners to solve on their own and the resources with which they must do so. The learner must have adequate information about the resources, that is, their functions and use. This is an innovative approach that reminds the learner they can learn if they want to, and that in problem solving, there are many ways to approach a situation.

                                    <em>What observations would you make from the scenario below?</em><br>
                                    'Catering students are given vegetables to chop up and a sharp knife. They are in a hurry and cut themselves with the knives. The next time they are given the same task and the same knives, they use them carefully and complete the task without cutting themselves'.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Some observations include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The learner is challenged to discover things for themselves</li>
                                        <li>The learner uses known knowledge to create new knowledge</li>
                                        <li>Getting the right solution motivates the learner</li>
                                        <li>The learner will be able to tackle issues for themselves</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>2. Behaviourist Theories</h3>
                            <p>Some of the main behaviourists of the 1920s included Thorndike, who looked at learning objectives to direct goal, Pavlov who studied the conditioning reflex, punishment and reinforcement and Watson who was interested in active participation, that is, learning by practice. You will now look at several other theorists in more detail.</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>B.F. Skinner</strong><br>
                                    According to Skinner's theory, it is possible to increase the probability that learning will occur and behaviour will be shaped in the direction the teacher wants, if the behaviour is rewarded. In order to maintain the strength of that behaviour, reinforcement by continued rewards is necessary. To be effective, the reinforcement must be immediate, and should be positive rather than aversive. Successive steps in the learning process should be as small as possible, each successful act being followed by a reward.
                                    <br>
                                    Skinner's research was based on a study of the behaviour of rats and pigeons. It has been mainly applied to young children and has not been very successful with adult learners. The process of programmed learning is based on this theory.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>R. M. Gagne</strong><br>
                                    Gagne categorised learning into different domains so that the different conditions for learning and assessment could be planned accordingly. The domains identified by Gagne are motor skills, verbal information, intellectual skills, cognitive strategies and attitudes.
                                    <br>
                                    Gagne's approach is a useful one as it helps in planning effective learning experiences. For example, skills cannot be imparted unless students are given the opportunity to practice under supervision and are given feedback on their performance. By identifying these areas, the teacher can plan content for knowledge, skills and attitudes and assess the learners appropriately.

                                    Gagne insisted that skills could not be learnt unless students were given opportunities to practice under supervision. He also added that students must be given feedback on their performance. His contributions are related to what is referred to as cognitive theory.

                                    <strong>Example 1:</strong> Think of a patient that has not been able to utilise their limbs to perform a specific function. As the patient's condition improves, you encourage them to move that limb. Each time they make progress, you reward them with praise. The patient feels encouraged to do more next time. They gain more courage.

                                    <strong>Example 2:</strong> When your supervisor says something nice about your action; you feel good and want to continue to perform well.

                                    <strong>Carl Rogers</strong><br>
                                    Rogers provided a learner-centred view of learning. His main propositions were that:
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li>All humans have a natural potential and desire to learn.</li>
                                        <li>Learning occurs when the student perceives relevance related to their own purposes.</li>
                                        <li>Significant learning is acquired through doing.</li>
                                        <li>Learning is more effective when the learner is responsible for choosing their direction, discovering resources and formulating problems.</li>
                                        <li>Most learning is self initiated and involves the whole person, including their feelings as well as intellect.</li>
                                        <li>Self evaluation is a basic skill that is necessary for effective mature learning.</li>
                                        <li>Learners should retain a continuing openness to change.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Rogers' approach significantly contributed to adult learning principles. The use of small groups' discussion, where the teacher is a guide and a friend, rather than leader, has become increasingly popular. It is based on Rogers' philosophy.

                                    <strong>Abraham Maslow</strong><br>
                                    Traditional teaching and learning has concentrated on force-feeding prescribed knowledge and has neglected to encourage the development of the student as a person with a role in society. According to Maslow, education should help students to look within themselves, and from this self knowledge, develop a set of values which will guide them in their working life. Maslow emphasises the importance of learning for self enhancement rather than simply for utility. This view is relevant to adult learners who decide to continue with their education out of interest, rather than in order to gain extra degrees or qualifications. Implicit in this approach is the importance of the individual in deciding what to learn and how to learn it.

                            <p>There are several principles of teaching.</p>

                                    <strong>Active Learning</strong><br>
                                    As a teacher, you should encourage learners to actively participate during teaching and learning sessions. You can do this in many ways:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Give students activities to perform.</li>
                                        <li>Ask questions.</li>
                                        <li>Set problems or projects.</li>
                                        <li>Give feedback. Tell learners how well they are doing. Show or tell them how they could have done better.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Clarity</strong><br>
                                    Make your teaching as clear as possible. You can do this by speaking audibly, writing neatly and selecting your visual aids carefully and appropriately to convey a meaning to the learner.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Mastery</strong><br>
                                    Ensure mastery by continuously assessing the learners as well as assessing them at the end of courses.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Individualise</strong><br>

                                    <p>Continuing education is vital for all health professionals because of the rapid increase in knowledge as well as the rapid changes in technology that characterise the world today. Learners perceive the teacher as a resource for information, skills and advice. Therefore, you as a teacher must stay informed through self education. This means that you should know the subject matter that is to be taught and where to find relevant information. You should also know the health care delivery systems and any other relevant resources that are locally available.</p>
                                    <p>The learners should be able to see you as a model for continuing learning.</p>

                            <p>As a teacher, you must seek to maintain a balance between theory and practice. This will help you to consider the total time available and how it is to be spent in the course. You need to give more time to learning rather than teaching. Skills are best learnt through practice. Practical sessions need more time to reinforce skill learning and application of theory to practice.</p>
                            <p>Ask yourself the following questions from time to time to chart your progress. How important is this skill to the learner? Is it too complex to be understood? Is it too complex to be mastered?</p>
