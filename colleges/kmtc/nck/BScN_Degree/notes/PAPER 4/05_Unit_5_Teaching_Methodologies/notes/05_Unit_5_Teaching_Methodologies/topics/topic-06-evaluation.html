                            <p>Performance assessment is a measure of assessment based on authentic tasks such as activities, exercises or problems that require students to show what they can do. The results of the assessment can then be used for comparison with those of other students. This is called evaluation and it can be measured.</p>

                        </div>

                            <p>There are two types of evaluations. You shall now look at each of these in detail.</p>
                            
                            <h3>1. Formative Evaluation</h3>
                            <p>When you were a student and had to learn how to perform a certain task, you were allowed to do it in small sessions. The ward in-charge would check to see whether you were on the right track and probably comment and show you the next step to take. This is similar to formative evaluation.</p>
                            <p>Formative evaluation is progressive, that is, the learner and learning are evaluated on a continuous basis. It provides feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the learner. It is performed frequently, that is, after small units of learning.</p>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--tip">
                                <div class="callout-header">
                                    <span class="callout-icon">❓</span>
                                    <h4 class="callout-title">Why do you think formative evaluation is useful?</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>It gives an early diagnosis of the learner's problems during the learning process, which enables corrective measures to be taken.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            
                            <p>There are several examples of formative evaluation. These include placement testing or pre-testing, which are conducted for the purpose of gauging to what extent the learner possesses the skills and abilities needed to begin instruction. This also helps to determine whether the student has already mastered some of the material that is set to be taught. This way, you can alter the content of the lesson.</p>
                            <p>You should place the learner at the appropriate level of the programme. At the end of a module, identify the learner's successes or failures and make the appropriate adjustments in instruction and learning. Use the placement test as a diagnostic test to identify severe learning problems.</p>
                            
                            <h3>2. Summative or Terminal Evaluation</h3>
                            <p>Summative or terminal evaluation is usually carried out at the end of a term, course or programme for several reasons. It enables you to award grades, certificates or licenses to the student for practice and/or select learners for a further educational programme.</p>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--note">

                                    <p>A good evaluation system should include both formative and summative evaluation. Formative evaluation gives diagnostic feedback to both the teacher and the learner, while summative evaluation reveals the student's ability to integrate and apply learning.</p>
                                    <p>The content evaluated is selected from the entire course work covered in the term or year with samples of all learning tasks. It should include:</p>

                            <p>Essays are easy to set. It is important to remember to make them valid, reliable and objective. They should ask the leaner to describe and analyse issues. Be very specific and describe exactly what the student should do. You should also prepare a marking scheme.</p>
                            <p>One of the main objectives of scoring is to award the correct marks for a given test, exam or evaluation. Two types of scoring are important for you to consider.</p>

                                    <strong>Analytical Scoring</strong><br>
                                    Analyse the correct response by making out a list of crucial points, which must appear in the answer in advance. You should then compare the student's answer to these points and award marks for them. You should also consider integration, coordination and organisation when awarding marks.

                                    <strong>Impression Scoring</strong><br>
                                    In impression scoring, you should first analyse the correct responses as is the case in analytical scoring, then read the script to get an impression for adequacy. You should then transfer the impression into a grade. The papers (scripts) may be sorted out by quality, that is, 25% low, 50% middle, 25% high to form the normal educational curve.
                                </li>

                            <h4>Rules to be Observed When Marking Essays</h4>
                            <p>Since you may have many scripts to mark, you need to organise yourself in order to be able to mark them fairly. The following points can help you achieve this:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Arrange for independent marking of papers or at least a sample of them if the class is too large.</li>
                                <li>Conceal the name of the student, that is, use numbers or letters.</li>
                                <li>Grade answers question by question and not student by student.</li>
                                <li>Discuss the answers with students to ensure learning, that is, provide feedback.</li>

                            <p>These are questions where four or five answers are given and the student has to choose the correct or best answer. A typical MCQ question has three parts, namely:</p>

                                <li>Questions should be simple, straightforward and should relate to what was taught.</li>
                                <li>The question should emphasise the aspects you want to teach.</li>
                                <li>Choose good distracters.</li>
                                <li>Do not make incorrect answers ridiculous.</li>
                                <li>Choose distracters from among the type of mistakes the students commonly make.</li>
                                <li>Do not make the correct answers obvious.</li>

                            <p>For both methods, candidates pass through a number of examination stations to answers or solve various problems.

                            <h3>Objective Structured Practical Examination (OSPE)</h3>
                            <p>Practical skills are very important components of training in all professions. Failure in practical tests is equivalent to failure in the whole examination. You should not allow excellence in theory to compensate for a failure in practicals.</p>
                            <p>OSPE examinations must be objective, valid and reliable. They should define the competencies a worker needs to develop in order for them to successfully perform the job. This ensures that all examiners have similar expectations.</p>
                            <p>Look for a correct diagram in a clinical case. Assess the student's skills using rating scales or a checklist. You should set short answers to practical problem solving skills questions to ensure objective assessment. In order to improve the validity of the test, you should increase the sample thus increasing the range of competencies to be tested. Draw up in advance a table of specifications to be tested on.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE)</h3>
                            <p>This is a comprehensive examination of a patient. The student spends 15 to 60 minutes with a patient and then discusses that patient with a panel of examiners (long case). The exam should be set up in the following manner:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Brief examination of a patient followed by oral questions (known as viva voce).</li>

                                Assessing Attitudes
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The student's attitude is an important ingredient in delivering a good service. By assessing this skill, a student will learn the importance of having a good attitude and will understand what is expected of them.</p>
                            <p>Attitudes can be assessed indirectly, that is, as the candidate performs a skill. This will have to be over a long period so that your assessment is based on repetition of the same attitude over time. Assessing of attitudes should be a continuous process to give a student the chance to internalise the specific attitude.</p>
                            
                            <h3>What do you use to assess attitudes?</h3>
                            <p>Pencil and paper test questions can be set for knowledge based tests. However, simulations, allowing the observation of gestures and actions, are a better way to see the actual display of attitude.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Types of Tools</h3>
                            <p>You can use a rating scale based on a table analysis (TA). There are two types of scales:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Scale of 5-1. This should remind you of the XY forms you had to have filled in by your ward in charge. A simple satisfactory to unsatisfactory scale is another example.</li>
                                <li>Semantic differential, that is, a scale on opposite characteristics. This can be used on attitudes alone. One example is given below.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>You can develop an assessment tool by following these basic steps:</p>

                                <li>List the objectives you wish to evaluate.</li>

                            <h3>Grading</h3>
                            <p>This refers to the awarding of marks, score or a value to the assignment performed. Some examples of grading include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Percentage of 0-100%.</li>
                                <li>Pass or fail, good, average, excellent.</li>
                                <li>Percentiles.</li>
                                <li>Letter grades, that is, A, B, C, D, E or F.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Valuation of student performance is important. This is mainly because it gauges the extent to which educational objectives have been achieved and guides the teacher in deciding what steps need to be planned next to facilitate learning for the students.</p>
