                            <p>You learn more effectively if you use more than one of your senses. The more senses you use, the more effective your learning becomes. The senses are:</p>

                            <p>These are powerful tools because they bring real situations close to the student. It is important that you obtain appropriate aids. However, it should be noted that they are expensive and can be difficult to maintain. Because the overhead projector is relatively cheap and easy to maintain, it is described here in detail to encourage its use in training institutions.</p>
                            
                            <h3>The Overhead Projector</h3>
                            <p>This is one of the most commonly used teaching aids.</p>
                            <p>The overhead projector (OHP) projects transparencies from a horizontal table via a prism or mirror and a lens. A bright image appears on a screen behind the teacher. The set up of the screen depends on the type of room and the size of the audience. There are two possibilities of projection. These are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Projection from behind.</li>
                                <li>Projection to the side (better viewing).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When lecturing, stand to the right or left of the projector so that you can easily point out the important areas that you want the learner to grasp. You can also view what the learner is seeing simultaneously. You are advised to expose only what you are discussing and not the whole transparency so that the learners can concentrate and take down important points. In this way, the rest of the presentation will not distract learners.</p>

                                        <li>Do not write too near the edge or you might lose half of the image. Leave at least an inch of margin all round.</li>
                                        <li>For more complex drawings, prepare a pencil sketch then lay the transparency over the sketch and copy onto the transparency. You can also copy a diagram from a book.</li>
                                        <li>Lettering should not be too small, about 4mm (an eighth of an inch).</li>
                                        <li>A transparency should convey one theme. Put as much information as necessary but as little as possible on a transparency. Ensure clarity and impact.</li>
                                        <li>Leave room for future alterations.</li>
                                        <li>Jot down your lecture notes on the frame of the (OHP).</li>
                                        <li>Keep the content down to ten lines with ten words per line.</li>
                                        <li>When masking, use thin paper. This ensures that the lecturer sees the whole transparency but the audience only the information that has been revealed.</li>
                                        <li>Overlays - do not use more than six buildings or brightness will be impaired.</li>
                                        <li>Store your transparencies with care. Avoid moisture and dirt.</li>

                                        <li>You are able to face the classroom and point out features appearing on the screen easily using a pointer.</li>

                                        <li>You are able to project a wide variety of materials.</li>
                                        <li>Transparencies can be used as an illuminated blackboard during the lesson. Alternatively, they can be put on top of each other showing stages of development of an idea or structure.</li>
                                        <li>You can easily trace diagrams and drawings if you require them.</li>
                                        <li>You increase your learner's curiosity by using multiple colours on the transparencies both permanent and temporary depending on the pens and ink used.</li>
                                        <li>An overhead projector, therefore, has endless possibilities in the hands of a resourceful teacher and can be used at all levels of education.</li>

                            <p>However, there are several disadvantages of using an OHP. The teacher must not stand in front of the image. The acetate sheets are expensive to obtain, but spoilt and cleaned x-ray film is a useful alternative. You should get a transparent, slightly bluish sheet that can be used in the same way as transparent acetate sheets.</p>
                            <p>Special felt pens are used for writing on the transparent sheets. If they are difficult to obtain, the glass pencils used in laboratories are a substitute. Erase with water or with spirit for semi-permanent ink.</p>

                                <li>After finishing a demonstration, do not remove the wire plug from the socket but switch off the lamp and keep the fan running until the bulb has cooled down (there is a thermostat fitted in most types of OHP).</li>
                                <li>Keep lenses and mirrors free of dirt.</li>

                            <h3>1. The Chalkboard</h3>
                            <p>The chalkboard is the most easily available, convenient and most popular teaching aid. As with all teaching aids, it requires planning in order to achieve effective learning. In planning how to use the board, ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Which parts of the lecture are important enough to be placed on the board?</li>
                                <li>Which aspects of the lecture are likely to be unclear?</li>
                                <li>Which diagrams and/or drawings can be used to explain difficult points?</li>
                                <li>Which are the main points or steps in the lecture?</li>
                                <li>Will the use of the chalkboard save lecture time? Do you need to use the chalkboard before the learners assemble or is it possible to use a less time consuming aid, for example, slides on the OHP?</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>To enhance learning while using the chalkboard, you are advised to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Write only the essential points and examples, like in your lesson plan outline. This helps the learner copy and fill in all other relevant information as you build up from introduction to conclusion.</li>
                                <li>Ensure your writing is large enough to be seen by all learners. Plan the board so that information develops from one stage to the next. Remember, the board is not a scrap paper.</li>
                                <li>Deliver the lecture to your audience and not to the board. If you have to write, lecture first, then write on the board. Stand next to the board at such an angle that you can see your learners frequently. Maintain eye contact with the class. You can make your chalkboard work more interesting for your learner by using several different techniques.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h4>Techniques for Chalkboard Use</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Templates</strong><br>
                                    You can cut out shapes of card or plywood to outline figures, which are often needed, for example, a triangle in mathematics, oval for eggs, round for oranges and many more. These can be cut out in advance and fixed on the boards as you explain them.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Bounce Pattern</strong><br>
                                    This is a thick tough paper in which a certain outline, for example, the map of a country with its regions has been punched out along the outline. Hold the paper against the blackboard and flicker a chalky cluster along the perforated line. When the paper is taken away, lines of dots appear which you can join to produce the desired drawing.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Semi Permanent Line</strong><br>
                                    Use soft chalk soaked in a sugar solution to draw on the board. The drawing can be wiped off with a damp cloth.
                                </li>

                            <h3>2. Pictures or Cartoons</h3>
                            <p>These can be in the form of slides, photographs, picture drawings, line drawings or cartoons. Good and appropriate pictures are sometimes difficult to obtain or prepare.</p>
                            <p>Hints on preparing good pictures, even for non artists, are described in Chapters 11 and 12 of 'Helping Health Workers Learn' by D. Werner and B. Bower (Hesperian Foundation).</p>

                        <!-- Flipcharts -->

                            <h3>3. Flipchart or Cards</h3>
                            <p>You will have used these before, for example, when preparing a demonstration for a nutrition lecture in a maternal child health (normally referred to as MCH) clinic. Flipcharts or cards are cheap and easy aids to prepare. They can be made from butcher paper, old calendars, paper boxes, manila paper and so on. The pictures can be drawn by somebody else or traced from a book. The pictures should be labelled in legible handwriting. When labelling remember:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>To use thick felt pens.</li>
                                <li>To use different colours for emphasis.</li>
                                <li>To write in lower (small) case letters, not capitals.</li>
                                <li>Not to write too much.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When making a presentation using flipcharts, do not read the chart as you talk. As you prepare the lesson or the materials for teaching, make notes at the back of the flipchart to guide your discussion. This way you can secretly read your notes as you teach and still face the audience.</p>

                            <h3>4. Posters</h3>
                            <p>Posters take longer to prepare than flipcharts. They may consist of words, pictures, or a mixture of both. Unlike flipcharts, posters are usually single leafed. Posters need a lot of planning and testing before use. They can be prepared for two types of viewers:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>For a mixed (heterogeneous) audience, for example, on a street for the general public.</li>
                                <li>For a captive audience, for example, in a class.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When a poster is being prepared for a heterogeneous audience, it should deliver the message at a glance. When preparing a poster, remember to make it simple, use simple language and avoid difficult words or slang and put as little as possible on the poster.</p>

                        <!-- Real Thing -->

                            <h3>5. The Real Thing or Object</h3>
                            <p>The best teaching aid is 'the real thing'. For instance, it is much better to teach mothers how to wash a baby by using a real baby rather than a doll. A live baby cries and kicks whereas a doll does not. The mothers need to see and learn how to handle an active, lively, small baby kicking and splashing in water. Each mother can then do a return demonstration with their own baby as you observe and reassuringly respond to their concerns. You will agree that this is a very good example of teaching the mother/learner how to wash a baby.</p>
                            <p>Try as much as possible to use 'the real thing' in your lessons. Your first thought should be, is it possible for you to demonstrate 'the real thing' to your class in this lesson? If this is not possible, you should then think of other teaching aids that are simulations of the real thing. The closer the simulation to the real thing, the better the teaching aid is. This is an important consideration in helping the learner to internalise and later transfer the impression they get to the real thing. It also helps the learner to acquire the right attitudes and find the right expressions to use from the start.</p>

                            <p>Can you remember asking for notes from your teacher? They are an example of a handout. Handouts are written papers given out by teachers to students. They act as guides for work to be done, or references to be looked up. They help remind students of the main points to remember from a learning experience. You should not use them as substitutes for manuals, texts and references. A handout is both a visual aid to learning and an addition to private study. The purpose of the handout is to help you to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Indicate objectives of the lesson exercise. Ask yourself what is it for? Who is it for? Is it needed?</li>
                                <li>Indicate the relevance and define the area to be covered.</li>
                                <li>Provide additional theoretical information.</li>
                                <li>Provide a stimulus to further thinking.</li>
                                <li>Give instructions for practical work. The instructions should be specific and complete.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Your handout, therefore, should:</p>

                                        <li>Your introduction should relate the new material to the learner's past experience.</li>
                                        <li>You need to summarise the major ideas.</li>
                                        <li>You should use major and minor headings.</li>

                            <p>All rural educators should know how to use it. It is based on the fact that materials with rough surfaces tend to adhere to each other. If flannel cloth is not available, alternatives can be found. The board is put in front of the class, sloping slightly backwards.</p>
                            <p>Cards with a rough surface, for example, sand paper can be placed on the board in the desired position.</p>
                            <p>The cards can be moved or taken down at will. Make cards in large print or written words, for instance, newspaper cuttings, photographs or dissected posters.</p>

                            <p>Good, durable teaching aids can be reused. Keep your teaching aids neatly in a resource learning kit (cupboard/store). Each item should be labelled clearly for easy access. Maintain an inventory of the various aids in stock. When you lend out items the borrower should sign for them. On their return, you should check the condition of the items first before storing them. This is to ensure that you keep readily usable items in your resource centre or cupboard</p>
                            
                            <h3>Storage of Specific Aids</h3>
                            <p>Maps and charts are stored while rolled up. To avoid long searches, their titles should be written on the back and then stored in a way that they can easily be seen.</p>
                            <p>Slides are best kept in hanging files with a list of contents on the filing cabinet.</p>
                            <p>Overhead transparencies and master copies of handouts are put in a master file together with other material on that particular unit.</p>
                            <p>The master copies are numbered corresponding to the number of the stencils and stored in or near the stencil room. These are filed in either alphabetical or numerical order.</p>
                            <p>When a handout is needed, the master copy is retrieved and the handout reproduced. Handouts need to be regularly updated with current information. Models, samples and specimens can be stored in the library permanently.</p>

                                    <strong>Selecting the Teaching Aid</strong><br>
                                    As the teacher, ask yourself the following questions:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Do you need an aid of any kind?</li>
                                        <li>Will an aid help you achieve your objective or make the lesson more effective?</li>
                                        <li>If the answer is yes, what kind of teaching aid is best suited to your purpose?</li>
                                        <li>Is the chosen aid available or does it have to be borrowed or constructed? What are the alternatives?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Previewing and Evaluating</strong><br>
                                    Preview your teaching aids before use to avoid unpleasant surprises. During your preview, plan for explanations or comments you may wish to make during the presentation of the lesson. Ask yourself:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Will the aid help achieve the objectives?</li>
                                        <li>Does the aid focus on one main idea?</li>
                                        <li>Is the aid depicting a real situation?</li>
                                        <li>Does it stimulate the imagination of the learner?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Planning</strong><br>
                                    Plan how and in what order you intend to use your teaching aids, you could number them in pencil. In your plan, you should:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Introduce the subject in a stimulating and interesting way to arouse curiosity.</li>
                                        <li>Describe the main body of the lesson. This is the chief vehicle for transferring information.</li>
                                        <li>Recapitulate, that is, restate or repeat the lesson in summary to assist in consolidation of knowledge.</li>
                                        <li>Having determined the role of the teaching aid, the learner's mind must be prepared to obtain the maximum benefit from the aid. Tell your learner what to look for as you explain and comment where necessary.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Presenting a Teaching Aid</strong><br>
                                    Your students see you as an expert. You should check the mechanical equipment to ensure that it is in working condition. If you are working with a community on a field trip, make sure you have obtained consent from the involved persons (see Community Diagnosis module).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Evaluating the Teaching Aid</strong><br>
                                    Evaluation refers to the process of looking back at what has been done to see whether the set out objectives have been met and to what extent. After presenting your teaching aid, answer the following questions:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Was the presentation successful?</li>
                                        <li>Did the aid achieve its purpose?</li>
                                        <li>Was the objective reached?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    You can find out the answers to these questions through:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Discussion with the learner</li>
                                        <li>Asking and answering questions from the learner</li>
                                        <li>Questionnaires and assignments to be completed by the learner</li>
                                        <li>Weekly test</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <p>Having considered all these factors, you are now in a position to use the aid.</p>
                            <p>It is the aim of the lesson that should dictate the type of aid to be used.</p>
