# Content Integration Report: Leadership & Management Nursing
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Project:** BScN Degree Notes Integration
**Scope:** Integration of "Leadership and Management Nursing" (7 Modules) into Paper 4.

## Executive Summary
The existing Unit 4 (`04_Unit_4_Management`) consists of 5 broad topics. Your new content provides a more granular 7-module structure, specifically adding "Principles of Management" and "Human Relations" as standalone topics. I recommend restructuring this unit to follow your 7-module curriculum.

## 1. Mapping & Gap Analysis
| New Module | Existing Equivalent | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mod 1: Concept & Theories** | `topic-01` | **Expand.** Enrich with more management theories. |
| **Mod 2: Leadership** | `topic-02` | **Refine.** Focus purely on leadership styles/traits. |
| **Mod 3: Principles** | Scattered in `topic-02` | **Create.** New dedicated topic for Fayol/Taylor principles. |
| **Mod 4: Functions** | `topic-03` | **Expand.** Detailed Planning, Organizing, Staffing, Leading, Controlling. |
| **Mod 5: Human Relations** | Missing as dedicated topic. | **Create.** New topic covering motivation and conflict management. |
| **Mod 6: Resource Mgmt** | `topic-04` | **Expand.** Financial, physical, and time management. |
| **Mod 7: Nursing Services** | `topic-05` | **Expand.** Patient care delivery models and quality assurance. |

## 2. Integration Strategy
I recommend creating a **Unified Directory** to house this 7-module curriculum to ensure linear study.

**Location:** `PAPER 4/Leadership_Management_Integrated/`

## 3. Implementation Plan
1.  **Create Directory:** `PAPER 4/Leadership_Management_Integrated/`
2.  **Scaffold Topics:** Create 7 topic files.
3.  **Create Dashboard:** A main `index.html`.
4.  **Quiz Hub:** Dedicated to management case studies and leadership theory.

**Next Step:** Proceed with scaffolding the 7 Leadership & Management topics.
