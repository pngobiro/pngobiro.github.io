                            <p>This is another important step in the process of community diagnosis. It requires just as much care as the planning stage. It involves going out to the field to collect information from the sample population you have selected. There are three stages involved in data collection.</p>
                            <p>These are:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>Interviewing the respondents</li>
                                <li>Data collection</li>
                                <li>Data handling</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>You will now look at these stages in turn.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Stage One: Interviewing the Respondents</h3>
                            <p>By the time you get to this stage, you have already developed the survey instruments, trained the interviewers on how to use these instruments and even pre-tested them. You do this in order to ensure that the correct standards are adhered to during the actual survey. Once the real survey begins, you should continue to work closely with the interviewers.</p>
                            <p>Your presence reassures them and they also get the opportunity to clarify issues that may arise. On your part, you get assured that the interviewers are continuing to follow the techniques you taught them.</p>
                            <p>When the interviewers approach a respondent, they should:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Introduce themselves by name</li>
                                <li>Show their identity cards for the activity</li>
                                <li>Show their letter of permission to carry out the exercise</li>
                                <li>Explain why they have come and the purpose of the survey</li>
                                <li>Establish rapport with the respondent/s so that they can feel at ease with each other</li>
                                <li>Ask if it is convenient to interview the person at that time</li>
                                <li>Should the person refuse to cooperate, the interviewers should do their best to persuade such a person to agree</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If it is convenient to interview the person at the time you have requested, give the client/family time to be comfortable and proceed. If not, ask for a more convenient time when this will be possible.</p>
                            <p>This must be within the prescribed period of the exercise as indicated in the permit. In which case the interviewer must return punctually as agreed upon with the family or individual.</p>
                            <p>If the person refuses to cooperate and remains adamant, the interviewers should politely thank the person for their time spent and proceed to the next interview. Sometimes people may refuse to respond to the question raised.</p>

                            <div class="callout callout--danger">
                                <div class="callout-header">
                                    <span class="callout-icon">⚖️</span>
                                    <h4 class="callout-title">Rights of the Individual</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>The respondent has the right to refuse to participate in an interview or experiment or medication.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>There are various reasons why people do not answer questions in a survey. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>If the people were not informed of the survey, its objectives and when it would be performed</li>
                                <li>If for some reason the person to be interviewed is temporarily away from home</li>
                                <li>Lack of interest in cooperating or active opposition to the survey</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In order to reduce the incidence of such opposition from your sample group, you should always make sure that the community is well informed about the study. If the target respondent is temporarily away from home, the interviewer should make arrangements to return when he or she is in. People who lack interest need a clearer explanation and persuasion so that they can see how they will benefit from the exercise. Activists can be difficult; if they remain adamant just politely thank them and let them free. They are just exercising their rights. If you find that a large number of people in your group are non-respondents, you will need to do a random selection from that group and re-approach them.</p>
                            <p>The results you get from the new sample will be representative of the entire non-respondent group. Compare the results with the original sample of all respondents and calculate the difference.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Stage Two: Data Collection</h3>
                            <p>Interviewers should be advised to use a pencil when filling out forms so that it is easier to make corrections. They should not erase a wrong response. If a mistake is made, the incorrect response should be crossed out and the correct response marked above it. Incorrect responses should not be erased because it is possible that if the erasure is incomplete, the response might not be legible or might be confused with a different response. The interviewer should fill in the responses at the time they are given. No response should be filled in afterwards because the interviewer may remember the response incorrectly.</p>
                            <p>Ensure that every interviewer has all the tools they need to collect data such as tools for anthropometric measurements and laboratory specimen containers.</p>
                            <p>You should avail a convenient carrier for these tools and check the packs daily to ensure that any specimens collected were handled correctly. It is good to remind the interviewers to recheck their measurements before they leave the client to avoid mistakes. They should also check the forms before they leave the respondent in order to be sure that all relevant information is satisfactory filled in the appropriate space provided.</p>
                            <p>If the survey involves the collection of laboratory specimens, then you should make arrangements for their safe storage before they are transported to the appropriate place for analysis. Laboratory specimens need special care especially when handling, storing and transporting them because one lapse could cause the loss of an entire day's specimens.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the day, all the forms should be checked thoroughly by someone other than the interviewer. If data is missing it may be necessary for the interviewer to return the next day to collect it. At this stage it may be possible to begin tallying the results so that when the analysis begins all you have to do is add up the tallies instead of going through all the forms since the first interview</p>
                            <p>The appropriate time for data collection was already covered in the sub section on how to plan a survey. Can you remember what you covered?</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>When the sample population will be available</li>
                                <li>When the team will be available</li>
                                <li>During an appropriate season when people are not too busy planting</li>
                                <li>On days other than public holidays and weekends when people are less likely to be at home</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>During data collection, it is very important to ensure that there is quality control so that you do not end up with false or misleading conclusions.</p>
                            <p>To ensure quality data you should:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Avoid bias when designing the questionnaire as explained earlier</li>
                                <li>Provide an instruction sheet on how to ask certain questions and how to record answers</li>
                                <li>Select interviewers with care</li>
                                <li>Select and train the assistants carefully in all the procedures together with interviewers</li>
                                <li>Involve them in the pre-testing phase</li>
                                <li>Limit the number of interviews that interviewers can conduct in a day so that they do not become too exhausted</li>
                                <li>Identify assistants to carry out quality checks everyday</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Stage Three: Data Handling</h3>
                            <p>This is the stage where you check data for completeness and organise it for analysis. The following guidelines will help you.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>Check to confirm that all the forms have been completed satisfactorily</li>
                                <li>Ensure that questionnaires are numbered</li>
                                <li>Identify one person to be responsible for storing data and specimens securely</li>
                                <li>Record forms should be sequenced and stored with clear labels</li>
                                <li>Make sure that all the information you need has been collected in a standard way</li>
                                <li>Develop an insight into the possible ways of analysing data</li>
                                <li>Ensure availability of any resources needed for analysis, such as a computer</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Once you have collected the data, it is completely meaningless unless you can extract meaning through analysis.</p>
                            <p>You will now look at how to analyse the data.</p>

                            <p>The data you obtain from the field is known as 'raw data'. In this state, it does not give much information and is therefore difficult to interpret. That is why it needs further work known as data analysis.</p>
                            <p>Data analysis is the separation and categorisation of numerical data into groups in order to understand its meaning. Statistical methods are used to do this because they:</p>

                                <li>Summarise the data.</li>
                                <li>Make inferences about the data. This means that data which has been gathered on a sample can be used to indicate what is probably happening to the entire population so as to make judgement about them.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The process of data analysis involves the following steps:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>Data cleaning</li>
                                <li>Sorting or tallying</li>
                                <li>Coding and entering data</li>
                                <li>Analysis of results</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These steps are covered in detail in module four unit three on Research in Nursing. You will now look briefly at them.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Data Cleaning</h3>
                            <p>Data cleaning was covered earlier in the subsection on data handling. Can you remember what was covered? In addition, you will also need to do the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Find 'missing data'. If one question is missing information in the majority of the questionnaires, then you can ignore it from the study.</li>
                                <li>Correct mistakes committed by interviewers after confirming with them, for example, putting a tick against smoker instead of non-smoker.</li>
                                <li>Exclude all inconsistent information if you can not verify its correctness.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Sorting and Tallying Data</h3>
                            <p>Once you have collected data from the field, you need to organise it in a systematic manner that facilitates analysis. You do this by sorting and tallying the data.</p>
                            <p>Sorting is arranging raw data in groups or in a particular order. You should select a system of sorting which facilitates data analysis. For example, if you are collecting data on users of family planning, you may decide to sort your data into two groups, that is, users and non-users of family planning. If your questionnaire is made up of closed-ended questions, such as the yes and no type, then you can assign numbers to these questions. For example, 1 to Yes and 0 to No, and sort them accordingly. On the other hand, if your questionnaire has open-ended questions, then you need to categorise all the responses given and assign numbers to them.</p>
                            <p>Data which has been sorted or arranged into some order according to magnitude is called an array. The following tables show examples of raw data and arrayed data.</p>

                            <p>Raw and arrayed data are ungrouped. To help you group data you use a tally sheet.</p>
                            <p>Tallying is one of the methods used to help you organise data before you analyse it. You will already familiar with the tally sheets you used in the outpatient or MCH/FP clinic.</p>
                            <p>Tallying is the setting up of classes or clusters which are tied by a slanting stroke. Usually four vertical strokes are made then a fifth stroke is drawn through them to represent the fifth item. Each cluster represents specific identifiable characteristics of the specified data. This data is then presented using a frequency distribution table.</p>

                            <p>You will now look at data coding.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Coding and Entering Data</h3>
                            <p>This involves the conversion of data into numerical codes which represent attributes or measurements of the variables. Coding eases the burden of calculation. Researchers recommend that the coding process should start with the preparation of a code book which describes in detail the codes assigned for each response category and item in the questionnaire. When coding data you should include as much information as you can. The use of computers has simplified the process of data coding and entry. Computers save time and increase the accuracy of results.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Analysis of Results</h3>
                            <p>Once you sort and code your data you are now ready to analyse it. There are two types of analysis that are carried out on data.</p>
                            <p>These are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Qualitative analysis</li>
                                <li>Quantitative analysis</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Qualitative analysis is usually applied on data which can be counted but can not be measured, such as, colour. It allows you to analyse the information in a systematic way in order to reach some useful conclusions and recommendations. Quantitative analysis on the other hand, is usually applied to data that can be given a numerical basis or can be measured, for example, age in years, weight in kilograms.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Graphical Presentation</h3>
                            <p>This type of presentation makes the data you have collected more easily understood at a glance. It emphasises any fluctuations which may be present and tries to make the material as attractive to look at as possible. Graphical presentations are also useful for purposes of forecasting the future magnitude of a series of figures given according to time.</p>
                            <p>There are various types of graphical presentations, these include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Histogram</li>
                                <li>Frequency polygon</li>
                                <li>Bar graph</li>
                                <li>Pie chart</li>
                                <li>Maps</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Graphs are a very familiar method of presenting information. They are more attractive to the eyes because even without looking at figures, you can easily see and appreciate the rise and fall in the figures presented and can tell when they are high or low. For example, the temperature chart that you maintain for inpatients is an example of a graphic presentation. Making graphs of monthly/weekly clinic attendees, epidemic diseases, hospital referrals or admissions is a useful practice that can help you to assess what you are doing and what needs to be done.</p>

                                    <p>You should have included that a straight horizontal line on a graph indicates that there has been no change in the aspect being measured. When the line goes up, it indicates that there has been an increase for example, more people attending your outpatient services, when the line goes down, it means that the quantity is decreasing, for example fewer people attending your outpatient services.</p>

                            <p>According to Plews and Onyango (1987), the construction of a good graph requires the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Clear, concise and unambiguous titles</li>
                                <li>Clear and concise statement of units in which the figures are measured</li>
                                <li>Correct vertical and horizontal scaling</li>
                                <li>Statement of units used on vertical and horizontal axis</li>
                                <li>A key/legend to explain the various features of a graph, if need be</li>
                                <li>Correct graphing according to the scales specified on the horizontal and vertical axes</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Some common types of graphs will now be described.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: var(--space-4); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Histogram</h4>
                            <p>This type of graph uses vertical blocks to represent class frequencies in a frequency distribution. You show the classes on the horizontal axis and the frequencies of the classes on the vertical axis. While the horizontal axis need not start from zero, the vertical axis must always start with zero. It is used to illustrate any data where the variable concerned changes with time.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: var(--space-4); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Frequency Polygon</h4>
                            <p>A polygon is a many-sided figure. A frequency polygon is derived from a histogram by joining the midpoints of the tops of the rectangles of the histogram in straight lines. The resultant figure does not have vertical bars but is made up of straight lines joining the different points on the graph. For comparison purposes, you can even draw two frequency polygons on the same graph paper.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: var(--space-4); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Bar Chart</h4>
                            <p>This is a graph which comprises a number of spaced rectangles whose length varies with the magnitude represented. The rectangles have the same width and may be vertical or horizontal. They are used to represent a large variety of statistical data, including data that can be represented in other ways. Bar charts can also be multiple, that is, representing two or more sets of comparable data.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: var(--space-4); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Pie Chart</h4>
                            <p>You will have already come across pie charts in textbooks. It is basically a circle divided into sectors or pieces. Each piece of a pie chart represents a total percentage of a specific group or cluster. A pie chart is especially useful for dealing with data where actual numerical quantities are not so important. For example, when you want to find out what percentage of your population has access to water rather than the actual number. It is therefore used for comparisons based on percentages. For a pie chart to give a good visual impression, you should make sure that the total data is not sub divided into too many separate components. Ideally, the sectors should not exceed seven.</p>
