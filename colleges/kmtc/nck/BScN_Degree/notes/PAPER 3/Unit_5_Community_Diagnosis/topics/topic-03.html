Before you embark on any procedure, you ensure that you have all the tools you need to do it effectively and that they are in the best possible condition. Similarly, before you embark on a community diagnosis survey you need to ensure that you have all the tools and instruments you need for measuring the community's health status. The tools used to measure a community's health status are:</p>

                            </h2>

                            <p>A questionnaire is a set of standardised questions designed to collect information about a specific aspect or issue in the community. It is therefore a tool for collecting information. Information from a questionnaire helps you to make plans for your health services and to evaluate them.</p>
                            <p>Before you design a questionnaire it is important for you to know what information you need to collect and how it will be used. It would help you to make a list of what you want to know. In other words, what do you really want to find out or achieve with the questionnaire?</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Qualities of a Good Questionnaire</h3>
                            <p>A good questionnaire has the following qualities:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Has simple and specific questions. Avoids wording that is above the vocabulary or reading skills of the respondents.</li>
                                <li>Has short and precise questions. The number of questions should not be too many or else they will put off the person being interviewed. In other words, keep it short and simple (KISS).</li>
                                <li>Avoids use of abbreviations or jargon.</li>
                                <li>Avoids questions that are too demanding and time consuming.</li>
                                <li>Avoids bias in questions. Biased questions influence people to answer in a way that does not accurately reflect their position. For example, a question like 'Do you agree with the majority of the people that health standards are falling?' implies that the respondent should agree.</li>
                                <li>Avoids making assumptions. Questions such as 'How many children do you have?' assume that the respondent has children. You should only ask this question after establishing the situation with the question 'Do you have children?'</li>
                                <li>Avoids double questions. For example, 'Did the MCH talk help to identify ways to improve the sanitation and nutrition of your children?' It is better to ask about sanitation and nutrition separately.</li>
                                <li>Has clear wording. Words such as majority, older people, regularly, might mean different things to different people and so should be avoided.</li>
                                <li>Questions ask about simple common happenings.</li>
                                <li>Questions range from known to unknown and from simple to complex.</li>
                                <li>All the questions should relate to the purpose of study. Eliminate 'nice' to know' questions, you may end up with 'information overload'.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Questions are acceptable to the people included in the survey. You should view the questions through the respondents eye and ask yourself the following:
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list compact" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li>Will the question be seen as reasonable?</li>
                                        <li>Will it infringe on the respondents privacy?</li>
                                        <li>Will the respondent be able and willing to answer the question?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Questions should not screen disease if no effective treatment can be offered for the cases found or if the condition is rare.</li>
                                <li>Type of question should either be open- or closed-ended.</li>
                                <li>Questionnaire must be pre-tested before executing the survey. This helps to identify and eliminate questions that are defective or may lead to wrong information. You may even need to rephrase the questionnaire so that it can elicit the correct responses.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Types of Information</h3>
                            <p>Questionnaires can help you collect four different types of information.</p>

                                    <p>Information about what people know or how well they understand something, that is, knowledge. For example, what is the major cause of accidental deaths among children in the home?</p>
                                </div>
                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Beliefs, Attitudes and Opinions</h4>
                                    <p>Information about people's beliefs, attitudes and opinions. Here you would be asking people to share with you their thoughts, feelings, ideas, judgment or their way of thinking. For example, in your opinion does positive self-esteem prevent drug abuse among adolescents?</p>
                                </div>
                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Behaviour</h4>
                                    <p>Information about people's behaviour. That is, what people have done in the past, present, and what they plan to do in the future. For example, have you ever attended an antenatal clinic?</p>
                                </div>
                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Attributes</h4>
                                    <p>Information about peoples attributes. That is, their personal or demographic characteristics.</p>
                                    <p>For example, age, education, occupation and income.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>When you design a questionnaire you should be very clear about the objectives and type of information you desire to collect. Otherwise you may end up collecting peoples opinions when in actual fact you wanted to document their behaviour.</p>

                            <p>An open-ended question is a type of question that allows the respondent to provide their own answer. It encourages the respondent to think and describe a situation in their own words. The respondent is not given any answers to select from. The answer given is best recorded in the respondent's own words. Although it is the easiest way to ask for information the responses are not easy to analyse. The answers are bound to be varied and so you need to categorise and summarise them.</p>
                            <p>Open-ended questions are useful because they give more information on:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Facts and details which the researcher may not be familiar with</li>
                                <li>Opinions, attitudes and suggestions</li>
                                <li>Sensitive issues</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The following are examples of open-ended questions:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>What did the traditional birth attendants do when your labour started?</li>
                                <li>What do you think are the reasons for the high dropout rate of health committee members?</li>
                                <li>What would you do if you noticed that your daughter (a schoolgirl) has a relationship with her teacher?</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>As you can see, these questions require deeper thinking and provoke the respondent to elaborate when responding.</p>

                            <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2); margin-top: var(--space-4);">Closed-ended Question</h4>
                            <p>These are questions that offer the respondents a list of possible answers to choose from. They are specific and useful when you are interested in certain aspects of an issue. Although they produce more uniform answers than open-ended questions, they depend upon our knowing and including all the relevant answers in the list.

                            <p>This is a group discussion that gathers together people from similar backgrounds or experiences to discuss a specific topic of interest to the researcher. The group of participants are guided by a moderator (or group facilitator), who introduces topics for discussion and helps the group to participate in a lively and natural discussion amongst themselves.</p>
                            <p>A focus group is not a group interview where a moderator asks the group questions and participants individually provide answers. The focus group relies on group discussion and is especially successful where the participants are able to talk to each other about the topic of interest. This is important as it allows the participants the opportunity to disagree or agree with each other. It can provide insight into how a group thinks about an issue, about the range of opinions and ideas, and the inconsistencies and variation that exist in a particular community in terms of beliefs and their experiences and practices.</p>
                            <p>The discussion is usually 'focused' on a particular area of interest. It does not usually cover a large range of issues, but allows you to explore one or two topics in greater detail.</p>

                            <p>Focus groups can be used in the following ways:</p>

                            <div class="enhanced-list card-list" style="padding-left: 0; list-style: none;">

                                    <p>Focus groups are a valuable method to explore a topic about which little is known, or little has been written in the past. For example, in order to set up a successful health education programme you need to understand people's traditional health beliefs. Focus groups can begin this process by providing the first in-depth descriptions of how the community sees the cause and treatment of certain illnesses. Focus groups can also be used to discover local terms used for signs and symptoms of illness, types of illness, and other concepts relating to health.</p>

                                    <p>In the planning phase of a new programme, it is possible to use focus group discussions to find out what the community feels about the new plan. You can use the method to see what the community identifies to be major problems or difficulties in existing programmes and incorporate their needs into the new programme. Focus groups can give you an understanding of how appropriate the new plan may be in terms of culture or technology.</p>

                                    <p>Sometimes programmes have been running for some time and do not appear to be having the expected impact. A focus group can be used to explore such issues and identify the problems that may be hindering the success of the programmes.</p>

                            <p>In order to conduct a successful focus group discussion you should adopt the following four steps:</p>

                                <div class="process-step">

                                        <h4 class="step-title">Step One: Preparation</h4>
                                        <p class="step-text">First you recruit participants. Focus groups are 'focused' because the participants usually share a common characteristic. This may be age, sex, educational background, religion or something directly related to the topic. This encourages the group to speak more freely about the subject without fear of being judged by others who are thought to be superior. For example, young women may not be as forthcoming in their ideas and opinions in the presence of their mothers or mothers-in-law. The participants should have prior knowledge so that they can come prepared.</p>

                                        <p class="step-text">It is good to make sitting arrangements that allow participants to see each other. Circular seating is the best as everybody can see each other. Avoid the traditional classroom type of sitting. Ensure the room is well lit and ventilated and has minimum or no disturbance so that the participants can concentrate on the discussion. The environment should promote talking and sharing.</p>

                                        <p class="step-text">You should prepare a set of questions that will help you to guide the discussion. These questions should also allow free flow from one aspect of the topic to the next in a relevant fashion. This helps the participants to think logically and build on the topic you are investigating. Have a mixture of general and more specific questions. If your questions are all general, you may not elicit detailed responses from the participants. On the other hand, if your questions are all specific, you may neglect to address and receive information on the 'bigger picture.'</p>
                                        <p class="step-text">Make sure you have a variety of follow up 'probes' for each of your questions in the event that you need to clarify questions or have participants elaborate on their responses.</p>

                                        <p class="step-text">Before you proceed you should identify among your team one facilitator and one recorder and introduce them to the group.</p>
                                        
                                        <h5 style="margin-top: var(--space-4); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Functions of the Facilitator</h5>
                                        <p>The functions of the facilitator are to stimulate and support the discussion by:</p>
                                        <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                            <li>Introducing the topic and all the other participants. Self introduction is better because it already sets in motion the tone of sharing for everybody.</li>
                                            <li>Reassuring them and explaining the purpose of the discussion and the type of information required. The participant also needs to know how and where the information will be used.</li>
                                            <li>Encouraging discussion by being enthusiastic, lively, humorous and showing interest in the group's ideas. The facilitator formulates and asks questions following the prepared guide. The facilitator should involve all the members but must remain neutral to all responses so that the participants can freely express their feelings, opinions and views.</li>
                                            <li>Encouraging involvement of all the members of the group.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>To encourage involvement of all members of the group the facilitator should ask open-ended questions. The facilitator should identify and manage individuals who dominate the discussion and deny others a chance to respond. One way of managing domineering members is to ignore them and instead give attention to the other members when they want to give an opinion. Maintain eye contact with the shy ones and prompt them to talk by calling them by name and posing questions directly to them. Build rapport and empathise as necessary. You should also watch their expressions, mannerism and non-verbal communication. Try to understand what they are saying, communicating or insinuating. If something is not clear ask for elaboration. Avoid being an expert.</p>
                                        <p>The members may ask for your opinion. Redirect the question back to them by asking for their opinion instead or what action they would take in respect of the question.</p>
                                        <p>After the session is over, you could share with them the information they were asking for. Control the discussion without blocking their freedom of expression and keep within the time allocated for this. At the end of the session you should thank them for sharing their time and ideas with you.</p>

                                        <h5 style="margin-top: var(--space-4); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">What the Recorder Records</h5>
                                        <p>The recorder records all key issues raised in the session and other factors that may influence the interpretation of information in as much detail as possible. This involves noting down the responses from the group and observing and documenting any non-verbal messages that could indicate how a group is feeling about the topic under discussion.</p>
                                        <p>The following must also be recorded:</p>

She or he may point out questions that are not well explored; questions missed, or suggest areas that could be investigated. The recorder should not be especially obvious to the group but should be able to communicate with the facilitator if required and help them resolve conflicting issues.</p>
                                        <p>At the end of the discussion, the facilitator should sit with the recorder and review the discussion and complete the notes and evaluate how the discussion went. They should then prepare a full report of the discussion using the participant's own words. It is necessary to list the key statements, ideas and attitudes expressed during each topic. These statements are usually coded and written on the left-hand margin while the comments are written on the right-hand side. It may be necessary to formulate additional questions at this stage for those issues that were not yet clear or controversial.</p>

                            <p>It is very important to pre-test all the instruments you intend to use before they are finally administered. It enables the interviewing team to discern, alter or delete questions which are being misinterpreted or are too sensitive to be asked without offending people. It also gives you the opportunity to discover if the various parts of the questionnaire flow in a logical order.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Points to Look for When Pre-testing a Questionnaire</h3>
                            <p>According to Salant and Dillman (1994), any pre-test aims to answer the following questions:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Does each question measure what it is intended to measure?</li>
                                <li>Do respondents understand all the words?</li>
                                <li>Are questions interpreted similarly by all respondents?</li>
                                <li>Does each closed ended question have an answer that applies to each respondent?</li>
                                <li>Does the questionnaire create a positive impression, one that motivates people to answer it?</li>
                                <li>Are the answers which respondents can choose from correct? Are some responses missing? Do some questions elicit uninterpretable answers?</li>
                                <li>Does any part of the questionnaire suggest bias on the part of the researcher?</li>
                                <li>Is the questionnaire too long?</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Procedure for Pre-testing</h3>
                            <p>During pre-testing, you examine individual questions as well as the whole questionnaire critically by:</p>

                            <div class="enhanced-list card-list" style="padding-left: 0; list-style: none;">

                                    <p>This helps you to identify if the questions are clear and whether they meet the study objectives.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Pre-testing the questionnaire on people who are very similar to your target group</h4>
                                    <p>It is also important to pre-test your instruments on a community that is very similar to the one in which the survey will be done.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">

                                    <p>If for instance you are going to administer a questionnaire, you should give each interviewer/interpreter a copy and ask them to administer it to the group. Each interviewer should pre-test at least one complete questionnaire.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">

                                    <p>Were any questions misunderstood? Were the directions clear? Was the questionnaire too long or too difficult? How long did it take to fill it out? Was there enough space for the responses? You should leave in each questionnaire more space for answers than is planned for the final one. This gives the interviewer more space to fill in responses to questions which had not been anticipated.</p>
