                            <p>Feedback means giving comments about how well or badly a person is doing in order to help them do better. It is a form of communication. You will recall that during the planning stage, it was said that the community will only cooperate if they perceive some beneficial results from their cooperation. So after your survey is done, those in the community who cooperated with you are entitled to receive some form of feedback. They want to know what you found.</p>
                            <p>When planning feedback you need to consider to whom it shall be given and in what form. This will help you to deliver the message effectively and in a way that it is well understood by the people concerned.</p>
                            <p>All individuals in the community who are concerned with the health of the people are entitled to feedback. The feedback table below gives a summary of the different types of feedback, who should receive it and when.</p>

                                    <p>The individuals who formed a part of your survey sample as well as those who provided you with specimens and tests deserve to be given feedback on your findings. You should tell them at the time of examination that they will be contacted later if anything abnormal is found. Those who you took specimens from or on whom you conducted tests should be told if anything abnormal was found. When giving such feedback you should be cautious not to arouse anxiety about harmless conditions.</p>
                                    <p>You should only give feedback on those conditions that require treatment. If you diagnose a condition that requires treatment, you should start it at once or refer the person to the nearest health facility for follow-up care. If during the survey you find specific notifiable diseases you should report to the relevant authorities, such as the medical officer in charge.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Preliminary Report</h4>
                                    <p>This goes to the community in which the diagnosis was conducted in order to thank them for their cooperation. It is given soon after the field work is completed by arranging meetings for the people and their leaders. This report covers your general impressions of the community's health status as well as preliminary survey findings. Do not give specific information on this day, since analysis will not be ready yet. Give them information on obvious points like disease outbreak, hygiene, sanitation, attitudes, nutrition, practices and utilisation of health services.</p>
                                    <p>You should promise them a more detailed report later. By giving them the findings of the report, you increase their awareness of their real health needs and how these can be solved.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Non-medical Reports</h4>
                                    <p>This report is less scientific and is usually produced for non-medical people. It comes out after full analysis has been done and conclusions and recommendations have been formulated. It is an important report because its message can influence social and political leaders to start doing something about improving the health of the population.</p>
                                    <p>According to Bennett F.J (1979), the contents of this report should cover the following aspects of the survey:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li>The reasons for doing the community diagnosis</li>
                                        <li>The findings which help to define the situation. Here you select only those characteristics which describe the real characteristics of the health situation in this population. Often it is sufficient to describe findings in words. However if you feel that tables would be indispensable then they should be short and easy to understand. You can also use the graphical forms which were described earlier. They have been found to be very helpful in conveying survey findings at a glance</li>
                                        <li>The conclusions and recommendations you make should be of practical significance. You should leave out those that are of scientific or academic interest to be documented in the medical report. This report is a social or political tool to shed light on the improvements that need to be done in the community's health services. So make your recommendations practical.</li>

                                    <p>Communities are made up of people with varying educational levels. Some are illiterate or are of low educational standards. Such people would benefit more from personal contact or a discussion type of feedback. That is why in our communities Barazas are commonly used to communicate matters to people. However, if you are dealing with a literate population you can disseminate the report through the mail or even the mass media that is newspapers, radio and television. Newspapers are a good medium because they have a wide coverage and people from elsewhere might also benefit from the report findings.</p>

                                                Use a title that is short and simple and yet informative. The title of your survey report is important because at a glance it gives the reader information about what your survey was about and it also helps the librarian to index the book properly.

                                                An abbreviation is a short form of a word, for example, Tb for tuberculosis. An acronym is a contraction formed by taking the first letter of several words, for example, HIV which stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. In this section of a report you give a list of all the abbreviations and acronyms you have used in the document with a full explanation of what they stand for. When using abbreviations in the body of your report, you should take note of the following rules:
                                                <ul class="enhanced-list compact" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                                    <li>The first time you use an acronym or abbreviation you should write what it stands for in full</li>
                                                    <li>Use only those abbreviations that your audience will understand</li>

                                                This section gives the background to your study. It seeks to explain why the survey was undertaken and which questions it was designed to answer. It is written in the form of broad and specific objectives which also reflect on the purpose of the study. Usually before embarking on a survey one reviews the relevant literature. If you consulted any literature you should make reference to this fact in this section as it lends support to the arguments you put forward in the introduction.

                                                Good objectives should be 'SMART':

                                                Here you describe your survey design, techniques and the instruments or tools you used to collect the data. In particular, you include information about:
                                                <ul class="enhanced-list compact" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">

                                                <strong>Limitations of study</strong><br>
                                                This section calls for honesty and openness in admitting the difficulties you may have encountered. It helps other researchers not to make the same mistakes you made. This is the essence of learning and maturity. You are actually taking a step back to ask yourself the question 'If I was to do this survey all over again, what would I do differently?'<br>
                                                Some of the difficulties which are commonly encountered in surveys have to do with: Sampling methods, Standardisation of tests and measurements, Observation variation, Incomplete records due to poor supervision.

                                                This section deals with presentation of results in any one of the formats you covered earlier, that is, figures, tabular and graphical formats. It does not matter which format you choose as long as it brings out clearly those characteristics which you think are important. If you want to show the trend in certain age groups or time periods, then you may consider using a graphical form such as a frequency polygon. A list of figures or a table may be indicated if you want to describe in detail a distribution or size of characteristics. However, when presenting figures you should take note of the following:
                                                <ul class="enhanced-list compact" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                                    <li>Do not use figures with several decimal places unless the precision of the measurement justifies this</li>
                                                    <li>It is misleading to present percentages with one or more decimals if the sample size is small</li>
                                                    <li>It is a good practice to present means and rates together with their standard error</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>

                                                <strong>Discussions</strong><br>
                                                This is mainly your interpretation of data, a process in which logical thinking, judgement and common sense all play a major role. You will be asking questions such as how reliable and valid are the observations, whether the figures are high or low, and if there are associations between variables which may indicate a causal relationship.<br>
                                                When interpreting your results it is often necessary to compare them with and refer to other studies on the same topic. In surveys which cover a variety of independent health problems this section may be combined with that of results.

                                                This is your brief summary of the essential findings and careful consideration of how the community health problem you have diagnosed can be reduced and/or controlled. You should also explain the causes of the health problems and how they can be prevented.<br>
                                                You need to describe what the community should and can do to control diseases for all concerned.

                                                It is almost impossible to conduct a survey without consulting published and unpublished documents in the community. These could be hospital records, maps and others. You must give credit to authors of any work you quote from or refer to by listing them.<br>
                                                Generally a reference gives the name of the author, the year of publication of the document, the title of the book or paper and the publisher.

                            <p>Once you have produced your reports and given feedback to all the concerned parties, the next and last step in the process of community diagnosis is the action phase. A community survey should lead to community action.</p>

                            <p>A community survey identifies a host of health problems that need to be addressed. It may have revealed a need for greater emphasis on MCH services or environmental sanitation. Therefore, you need to sit down with the community to prioritise and plan what you going to do about the identified health problems. In short, you need to mobilise them to take action.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Mobilise Community Action</h3>
                            <p>You can mobilise the community through a number of interventions, namely:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>Making them aware of their problems and promoting primary health care</li>
                                <li>Health education</li>
                                <li>Immunisation</li>
                                <li>Environmental improvement</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You have already covered these interventions in great detail in different units and modules of this course. However, you will now briefly look at them from the perspective of community diagnosis.</p>

                            <div class="enhanced-list card-list" style="padding-left: 0; list-style: none; margin-top: var(--space-6);">
                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Creating Awareness and Promoting Primary Health Care</h4>
                                    <p>As you will recall from the lesson on PHC in unit two of this module, the essence of the community based health care approach is to stimulate community interest and participation in health promotive, disease preventive and simple curative activities. For the community to participate effectively they require a number of support structures. These are:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list checklist" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li>A multi-disciplinary or inter-sectoral team which includes health workers as well as experts from other sectors such as agriculture, water, energy, and so on.</li>
                                        <li>Establishment of community structures.</li>
                                        <li>A consensus of opinion between community and professionals. Research has shown that communities have the ability to not only identify their problems but also rank them in order of importance.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The only difference between them and professionals might be the way they determine the cause of the problem. While professionals see causation in scientific terms, communities may see it in terms of evil spirit. If you can succeed in making them see that in addition to evil spirits poor latrine usage has something to do with the prevalence of intestinal parasites, then your job would be well done.</p>
                                    <p>Structures that are in place to establish care of a community's health include the establishment of health committees as well as the selection of individuals for training as community health workers. The village health committees and community health workers play a very important role in the implementation of activities that have been agreed on. Your role as a community health nurse is to facilitate the process and guide them to work efficiently.</p>

                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Health Education</h4>
                                    <p>Health education is not just about sending out posters and pamphlets to the community. It is about listening and finding out why people do things the way they do. It is about stimulating their interest in their health problems through discussion and sometimes by example. It is also about giving people information and helping them to set priorities and improve their own health.</p>
                                    <p>Health education cannot be prescribed in doses! You will therefore need to target individuals, families and the community at large with health messages using the media that is available and affordable.</p>

                                    <p>If the results of your survey indicated low immunisation coverage as one of the reasons behind the high morbidity and mortality rates among children, then you need to plan immunisation action. You will need to identify all non-immunised and inadequately immunised persons, and ensure that they receive immunisation. You will also need to ensure that you have a good supply of vaccines and that they are well maintained in order to preserve their viability and potency. Remember for your campaign to succeed you must plan it with community leaders.</p>

                                    <p>Most of the health problems found in our communities indicate the need for environmental improvement. Most surveys reveal need for housing improvement, construction of more latrines, protection of springs, and improvement of food storage. These require major education and motivation campaigns involving village health committees in order to get the necessary improvements in place.</p>
                                    <p>The community must take action and the initiative to bring about the necessary changes. There is also need for intersectoral collaboration in order to bring in useful expertise from other sectors, such as agriculture.</p>
