                            <p>The process of community diagnosis requires careful planning right from the beginning. It involves initial exploration and interaction with the community, planning of the survey, developing and pre-testing the survey tools and methods, and executing the survey and analysing the results. Once all the information has been gathered it must be documented and its conclusions disseminated to the community. The process of community diagnosis is made up of the following steps:</p>

                                Exploring the Community (Community Inventory)
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Exploration simply means mapping out of a community in order to learn or discover about it. It is also known as community inventory. Ideally, you should only carry out a community diagnosis after a request by the community or the people involved in providing health care. The exploration phase is made up of three main activities:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Seeking permission and informing the various leaders</li>
                                <li>Seeking reactions of members of the community</li>
                                <li>Gathering background data about the community</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Although these activities are listed separately, they actually can take place at the same time.</p>
                            <p>You will now look at each activity in turn.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Seeking Permission and Informing Authorities in the Community</h3>
                            <p>For the survey to succeed you must seek permission from community leaders.</p>
                            <p>Start by channelling your request through the official hierarchy of administrative leaders in that community:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Health personnel such as Medical Officer in Charge</li>
                                <li>Governmental officials such as Chiefs or District Officers</li>
                                <li>Community leaders through, for example, the village health committee</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You should approach all these people, introduce yourself and clearly state the objectives of the survey and your plan of action. Remember, for them to give you permission to proceed they need to understand what you intend to do and how it will benefit the community.</p>
                            <p>So be well prepared. The community leaders are extremely important to the success of the survey as they clearly understand what, how, when, and why things happen. They also influence other members of the community more directly than administrators who do not live in the community. You should therefore seek their assistance in implementing the survey. They will only cooperate if they perceive some beneficial results from their cooperation. So you should always plan a survey with the intention of carrying out an appropriate action programme for the community.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Seeking Reactions of Members of the Community</h3>
                            <p>During this period of exploration, you also sound out the reactions of members of the community. This can be done by talking to people informally in market places and eating places. This way, you will easily find their opinions or problems in the community and their likely solutions. Also by talking to them you can gather information regarding possible resistance to the survey and how to approach different members of the community.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Gathering Background Data</h3>
                            <p>The period of exploration also presents you with the opportunity to gather background data about the community. For instance, the Medical Officer of Health in charge of the district will give you an overview of the health profile of the district. The District Commissioner will give you boundaries, the population and maps of the area. The District Education Officer will give information about educational activities and literacy levels of the community members. Other district heads will give information related to their areas of jurisdiction. Although some of the records might not contain the most recent data, you can make projections by estimating the current population figures in the community.</p>
                            <p>Similarly by looking at other government reports you can gather information regarding the climate and weather conditions, water sources and the road network. The older people in the community are a little used resource and yet they can provide you with a lot of information on the community's history.</p>
                            <p>Gather information as you move around the community by:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>Questioning</li>
                                <li>Observing</li>
                                <li>Smelling</li>
                                <li>Listening</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You should also look at findings of previous surveys so that you can adequately address any new problems.</p>
                            <p>Once you explore the community and gather all the information you need you are now ready to plan your survey.</p>

                            <p>This is a very important part of the process of community diagnosis. There is a popular adage which says 'If you fail to plan you plan to fail'. So if you fail to plan the survey carefully and properly, your study will be unsuccessful or will give you unreliable results.</p>
                            <p>During the planning phase, you should attempt to answer the following questions.</p>

                            <div class="collapsible-section">
                                <details open>

                                    <div class="collapsible-content">
                                        <p>A survey is not carried out just to obtain interesting information. There must be good reasons and the reasons must be useful to the community. This question must therefore be answered to the satisfaction of all the leaders who are concerned with the community.</p>
                                        <p>If the community has given you permission to carry out the survey, it will expect and have a right to expect some beneficial results from its cooperation. You should therefore plan the survey with the intention of carrying out a proper action programme for the community. This information would most likely have been communicated during the exploratory phase.</p>
                                        <p>Once the community leaders understand the reasons and are ready to cooperate with you, a meeting of the members of the community should be called to explain why there is a survey, why they have been chosen, what will be involved, when it will be done and what will happen to the results. During this meeting you should invite government, health and community leaders so that the community can see who is supporting your work and who will be moving around their community and homes.</p>

                                        <p>It is usually not possible to interview everybody in a community unless of course it is very small. You will therefore need to select a sample from the total population which will be considered representative of what is happening in the entire population. The sample could be made up of individuals or households depending on the available resources and time. There are certain techniques used to choose a sample. These are covered in detail later in this unit.</p>
                                        <p>It is also useful to talk to the local opinion leaders such as, the chief, village elders, members of organised groups such as church leaders and traditional healers, professionals in the area such as teachers and medical staff, and other extension workers.</p>

It is important to choose carefully the days when the interviewers will be in the field in order to ensure that they find the people they want to interview. The exercise should also not coincide with seasons of important community activities such as planting, circumcision etc. Ideally you should decide when to conduct the survey after consulting the community members so that they are prepared for you.</p>

                                        <p>Ideally, the interviewers should come from the community so that they are well known to its members. School teachers, school children, health centre staff, village elders and young educated people are some of the people who can help you to survey your area and fill in the questionnaires. However, if your interviewers are not from that community, then you will need to introduce them to the community leaders and if possible to the community members in a public meeting. Once the survey begins, they should wear identification badges and introduce themselves.</p>

                                        <p>The people you select for training as interviewers should have the following qualities:</p>
                                        <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                            <li>Be literate and well known to the community</li>
                                            <li>Have the ability to display the right attitudes and opinions</li>
                                            <li>Be able to explain the questionnaire effectively to the community</li>
                                            <li>Be able to use the tools presented in your package</li>
                                            <li>Be able to establish good rapport with individuals, families or groups they will meet</li>
                                            <li>Be good listeners and sensitive towards other people's feelings</li>
                                            <li>Be able to relate well to the community members</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>You should impress on the interviewers the value of working well with all sections of the community. If one of your tools addresses a specific group like the youths, you should select an interviewer of the same age or sex who can identify with the group. This helps to elicit the salient points from their responses. Whenever possible, select people who speak the language of the study group.</p>
                                        <p>The people who are selected as interviewers have different educational backgrounds from yours and may interpret questions and answers differently. So you must train them on how to administer the survey tools. When training interviewers you need to explain the following:</p>
                                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                            <li>The purpose of the survey</li>
                                            <li>The method to record the various expressions used by people to answer particular questions</li>
                                            <li>The procedure they should follow to get cooperation from the people being surveyed</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>If you intend to use a questionnaire you should go through it several times with the interviewers to ensure that they all have a common understanding of the questions and are able to ask them properly. The interviewers should understand the need to follow the questionnaire closely and in a standardised manner. If each interviewer asks questions in their own manner the answers will be unreliable because they may refer to different things.</p>
                                        <p>During the training you should hold mock interviews with the interviewers so that you can ensure that each one of them can handle the assignment. Use this opportunity to correct them and also to clarify issues about the questionnaire such as wrong translations and questions. Once you are confident that your interviewers can handle the job, you should carry out a trial test or pilot test on a section of the community who have similar characteristics as the study group. This gives them a feel of the real situation and helps you to assess them further.</p>
                                        <p>Remember that the pilot group should not be included in the study group.</p>
                                        <p>Interviewers should conduct themselves in an appropriate manner when approaching respondents. The points below should be followed:</p>
                                        <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                            <li>Establish rapport by greeting the respondents and introducing themselves</li>
                                            <li>Explain carefully why they have come and what is the purpose of the survey</li>
                                            <li>Ask if they are welcome to interview the family and if it is convenient for them at that time</li>
                                            <li>Explain that they will be recording the information they collect</li>
                                            <li>Emphasise that all information collected is confidential</li>
                                            <li>Give them a chance to ask questions for clarification</li>

                            <p>Sampling is the process of selecting a number of individuals or units of the study population in such a way that the individuals selected represent the larger groups from which they are selected. You will agree that it is neither practical nor economical to survey a whole population. That is why the part of the population studied is called a sample. The aim is to get the the same information from that sample that you would have got if the whole population had been surveyed. For this reason, when you are selecting a sample for a survey, you must make sure that it is representative of the whole population.</p>
                            <p>Also, in the sampling process you have to give an equal chance for each person in the population to be included in the sample. Otherwise you can come to wrong conclusions.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>All first years in nursing</li>
                                <li>All under fives in a given community</li>
                                <li>All qualified nurses with mental health qualifications</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This must be clearly defined for example, according to age, sex, or residence. A study population may also be selected for example, according to villages, institutions, records. Each population is made up of study units identified by the type of problem that you want to study.</p>
                            <p>A study population can be divided into two main groups, namely, accessible population and the representative sample.</p>
                            <p>The accessible population is a group of individuals, objects and events with characteristics comparable to the target population and relevant to the study.</p>
                            <p>The representative sample is a group from the study population, which has all the important/relevant characteristics of the total population.</p>

                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Before you sample you need to develop a sampling frame. A sampling frame is a list of all units that make up the study population. It enables you to sample the study units in such a way that the probability or the different units to be selected in the sample are known. Sampling techniques fall under two main groups, namely, probability sampling and non probability sampling.</p>
                            <p>You will now consider each group starting with probability sampling.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Probability Sampling</h3>
                            <p>Probability sampling looks at the entire group of individuals, events or objects that have common observable characteristics. It has been found to give accurate results when one is studying groups that are too large to study in their entity. It also provides you with an efficient system of capturing; in a small group the variations or similarities that exist in the target population.</p>
                            <p>The following are the most commonly used methods in probability sampling:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>Simple random sampling</li>
                                <li>Systematic sampling</li>
                                <li>Stratified sampling</li>
                                <li>Cluster sampling</li>
                                <li>Multi-stage sampling</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You will now look at each in turn.</p>

                            <div class="enhanced-list card-list" style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Simple Random Sampling</h4>
                                    <p>This is the simplest form of probability sampling. It means that every sampling unit in the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. You can draw a simple random sample using the following steps:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                        <li>Make a list of all the units in the population to be studied</li>
                                        <li>Decide on the sample size</li>
                                        <li>Select the required number of units using ballot or lottery method or random numbers</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>For example to draw a random sample of five patients from a list of 250 using the ballot method, you follow this method:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                        <li>Give each client a number (1 - 250)</li>
                                        <li>Write them on a small piece of paper</li>
                                        <li>Fold them individually and put them in a box</li>
                                        <li>Shake the box vigorously to mix them</li>
                                        <li>Pick five pieces one by one and note the numbers and record</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Each patient is a unit and the names of the patients on these numbered papers form the sample or study population.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Systematic Sampling</h4>
                                    <p>Here you first decide the sample size you want and then proceed to select the individuals or units using a systematic method.</p>
                                    <p>For example, let us assume that the population size you want to study consists of 1000 women. Out of this population, you only want to pick a sample of ten women for your study. This gives you a ratio of 1:100 or a sample fraction of 1/10. Now, with this ratio you can proceed to pick the sample population as follows:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                        <li>Select the first file randomly. Let us assume that you have selected file number 25.</li>
                                        <li>Starting with file no. 25, proceed to pick every 100 file, that is, file 125, 225, 325, 525, 625, 725, 825, and 925. You now have your random sample of ten files.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Stratified Sampling</h4>
                                    <p>This is dividing the sample frame into smaller sub samples in order to enable you to capture the variable aspects of each subgroup. This method is used when the study population is very variable, for example, different ethnic groups, different ecological areas, or age groups. It allows you to subdivide the population into sub populations which are more homogeneous. You then apply simple random sampling to each subgroup or stratum.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Cluster Sampling</h4>
                                    <p>In this method, you randomly select groups or clusters and not the individuals or cases. This method is used when it is not possible to obtain a sampling frame because the population is either too large or scattered over a large geographical area. In cluster sampling you select an intact group and include all the members of that group in the sample. For example, say you want to study patients suffering from malaria in your district. It would be expensive and time consuming to compile a list of all malaria patients who have been hospitalised in your district.</p>
                                    <p>So the logical thing to do would be to list all health facilities in your district and then randomly select them according to your sample size. Once you select them, you would then include all the malaria patients in those health facilities in your sample.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>The methods of sampling you have just covered are known as probability sampling. You will now look at another group of sampling methods known as biased sampling or non-probability sampling methods.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Non Probability Sampling Methods</h3>
                            <p>Non probability sampling methods are used when a researcher is not interested in selecting a sample that is representative of the population. They are mainly used in qualitative studies where the focus is on in-depth information rather than making generalisations. Some examples of non-probability sampling methods are convenient sampling, quota sampling and purposive sampling.</p>
                            <p>You will now look briefly at each method.</p>

                            <div class="enhanced-list card-list" style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Convenience Sampling</h4>
                                    <p>In this method, you select cases or units of observation as they become available.</p>
                                    <p>For example, a health worker wanting to study attitudes of villagers towards family planning may decide to interview all adults visiting Maternal Child Health or Family Planning (MCH/FP) clinic on that day. Such a sample is useful for giving a first impression of a situation. However, it is not representative of the community. This sample is considered unrepresentative because some units can easily be missed out or under selected.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Quota Sampling</h4>
                                    <p>In this method, the researcher simply selects subjects to fit in identified quotas, say for example, a certain religion or social class. Quota sampling ensures that various groups or quotas of the population are included in the study according to some criteria. The selection is not random as the individuals are just picked as they fit into the identified quotas.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div style="margin-bottom: var(--space-4);">
                                    <h4 style="font-size: var(--font-size-lg); margin-bottom: var(--space-2);">Purposive Sampling</h4>
                                    <p>Here the researcher simply picks individuals or cases that have the information or characteristics which they requires. It is sometimes used in one of the stages in the sampling procedure, for instance, to get the location or district in which the units of observation have the required characteristics. Once the units are selected, the researcher may then apply random sampling to obtain the actual sample of cases.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <h3 style="margin-top: var(--space-6); margin-bottom: var(--space-3);">Bias and Sampling Errors</h3>
                            <p>As you noted in probability sampling, selecting a sample requires special techniques which ensure that each person in a population has an equal chance of being selected into the sample. If a sample is not randomly selected or if the interviewers do not follow a similar and consistent method, there will be errors in the data gathered. These types of errors are called bias. Further, even when the sampling techniques which reduce bias are correctly applied during the selection of a sample, the results of the study may be subject to another error known as sampling error. This is because within the small group selected to represent a larger one, there may be people whose characteristics are very different from anyone else's in the same group. Very small samples tend to have higher sampling errors than large samples.</p>
