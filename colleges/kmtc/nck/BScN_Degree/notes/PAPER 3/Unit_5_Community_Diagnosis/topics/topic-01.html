                            <p>When you care for an individual patient, you make a patient diagnosis and organise the appropriate treatment. Similarly, in order to look after a community you must make a community diagnosis and organise appropriate community health programmes. It is therefore important for you to learn the approaches to community diagnosis and what its purpose is, and how it differs from patient diagnosis. You will also learn the terminologies used in community diagnosis.</p>

                                The Concept of Community Diagnosis

                            <p>Community diagnosis is a process through which health workers together with members of the community identify the community's priority health problems, and together make plans of action and implement them. It points out where the health services should put their main efforts and resources. You learnt in unit three on Primary Health Care (PHC), a community's full participation depends on the four concepts of PHC or the 4As.</p>

                            <p>The four A's are acceptability, accessibility, affordability and availability using appropriate and local technologies. In the past, professionals including health workers always considered themselves experts on various issues. Health workers would visit a community and without consultation, impose certain sanctions or treatments without the community's consent. Also, some communities have received assistance particularly when there is a disaster and then been abandoned without being helped to address the causative factors. This has often resulted in dependency, lack of self-initiative to improve themselves or even a belief that they are helpless.</p>
                            
                            <p>Luckily, this notion has changed. It is now realised that people have the ability to help themselves if they are given some facilitation or guidance. People want to be independent and self-reliant. It is also true that people tend to cherish and care for what they have acquired through a struggle. Such involvement empowers individuals and makes them resourceful and self-reliant.</p>
                            
                            <p>The community diagnosis concept therefore stresses that the community must identify its problems, prioritise them and draw a plan of action to address the identified problems. The community then implements this plan to resolve the problems. It emphasises total community involvement. This is because the community knows its problems and priorities better than the health worker. When they actively participate in solving these issues they become bound by the decisions they make and feel motivated to see the plans through.</p>
                            
                            <p>Sometimes, one of the problems you experience as health workers is that communities may be more concerned about water or access to markets than they are about medical problems. In such situations, you need to look at all aspects of community development, that is, adopt an intersectoral approach, so that the real needs are tackled.</p>
                            
                            <p>There is no need to rush into a programme before there is understanding and commitment. This will just lead to failure. Sometimes you may even have to show your willingness and interest in what the community wants before you can concentrate on the main health problems.</p>
                            
                            <p>As health workers, you talk all the time about patient diagnosis. Is this the same as community diagnosis? Move on to look at the difference between patient diagnosis and community diagnosis.</p>

                                <li>Give the patient a date to return for review. A patient with an acute condition should be hospitalised for monitoring and review.</li>

                            <p>In community diagnosis, you follow the same basic steps as the ones you have seen in patient diagnosis. The only difference is that the amount of data is much greater and requires more lengthy analysis and processing.</p>
                            
                            <p>In community diagnosis you start by collecting basic information. You collect information about the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Local people and their environment</li>
                                <li>The number of people and their distribution</li>
                                <li>The diseases the local people suffer from</li>
                                <li>The organisation of local health services</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>You then make a community diagnosis by identifying the main health problems and the reasons for them. Identify priority health problems and plan a community health programme or treatment to solve these problems.</p>

                                    <p>This is because health centres often have limited resources and many demands on those resources. There are simply not enough resources to solve all the health problems in the community. Therefore, the health care worker together with the community must select priorities for health action. Remember, it is important to choose only those problems that the community can do something practical about with the help of the local health team (health centre or dispensary staff).</p>

                            <p>The final step is follow up to evaluate the programme and see if it has made the community healthier. You can evaluate an activity by counting or measuring things or simply by using your judgement. For example, to evaluate whether women are attending your antenatal clinic, you can check how many of the total number of pregnant women in your catchment area attend the clinic. You can also assess whether they are satisfied with the service by talking to women who attend the clinic and also to some who don't.</p>
