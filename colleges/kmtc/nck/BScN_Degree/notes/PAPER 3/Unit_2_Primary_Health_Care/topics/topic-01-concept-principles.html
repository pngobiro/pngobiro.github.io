                                <p>"The attainment by all people of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life" (WHO, 1977).</p>

                            <p>However, many countries in the developing world recognised that it was not possible in the foreseeable future for them to achieve this worldwide social objective due to lack of resources. They needed to adopt a strategy that allowed them to use available resources to benefit everyone and provide special attention to those at high risk. The member governments endorsed the <strong>PHC strategy</strong> for the provision of health services for all.</p>
                            <p>The strategy for the implementation of PHC was adopted by the Kenya government to provide health services to its population, the majority (80%) of whom live in the rural areas.</p>
