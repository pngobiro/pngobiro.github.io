                        <p>Infection transmission in the HBC setting can take various forms. A patient can transmit an infection to a caregiver, a caregiver can also spread infection from one patient to another. Caregivers can cross-infect their family members and the community and, if the caregiver has an infection can also transmit an infection to the patient. Finally there can be self-infection.</p>
                        <p>You will now look at how each of these modes of transmission work.</p>

                                <li>Not using gloves or other available plastic waterproof material while handling soiled linen, blood and other body fluids.</li>
                                <li>Attending to a patient while having open uncovered cuts, wounds or abrasions.</li>
                                <li>Inhaling contaminated air, which may cause infections, for example, acquiring chest infections such as tuberculosis while caring for a patient.</li>
                                <li>Splashing infected body fluids, for example, blood on mucous membranes like on eyes or nose while attending childbirth by an HIV-positive mother.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B are two diseases that are commonly transmitted by this method.</p>

                                <li>Urging People Living with Aids (PLWHA) (who are not able to abstain) to have only one sexual partner, with whom they must use condoms consistently and correctly to prevent re-infection and spread of the disease.</li>

                            <p>Having practiced as a nurse, you should know by now that hand washing is the most important way of reducing the transmission of micro-organisms.</p>
                            <p>Scientific evidence shows that hand washing reduces the risk of micro-organisms and also reduces mortality and morbidity associated with these micro-organisms.</p>

                            <h3>When should caregivers wash their hands?</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Immediately after arriving at the workstation or home</li>
                                <li>After coming into contact with equipments used for patient care or contact with the patient's body fluids and/or mucous membranes</li>
                                <li>Before and after examining a patient</li>
                                <li>Before and after putting on gloves for procedures</li>
                                <li>Before and after every procedure</li>
                                <li>Before leaving the home or at the end of the work shift</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>As you will probably recall there are four different types of hand washing. You will have been practising all these methods in your clinical setting.</p>
                            <p>List four types of hand washing.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Routine hand washing using plain soap and running water</li>
                                <li>Hand washing with antiseptic and running water</li>
                                <li>Alcohol hand rub</li>
                                <li>Surgical hand rub</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Hand washing techniques and policy statements were also covered at length in module one, unit two. If you have forgotten the details, review that topic again.</p>
                            <p>In the home care environment hand washing with plain soap and running water for 10-15 seconds is enough. Antiseptics are not necessary. If there is no tap or running water, the caregiver can use a 'leaky' tin or ask somebody to pour water for them.</p>
                            <p>Remember to teach your patients, their families and community members proper hand washing procedures. Also, teach them to use small pieces of bar soap, how to keep the bar soap dry (not moist) and how to avoid wet hands during procedures. If water is not available, then alcohol hand rub can be used. You can prepare the following hand rub solution at the health facility and supply your patients:</p>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--note">
                                <p><strong>Hand Rub Solution:</strong> 2ml of glycerine or propylene glycol or sorbitol and 100ml of 60-90% alcohol.</p>

                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>Plain water removes 50% of transient micro-organisms, while soap removes 80-90% of micro-organisms.</p>

                            </div>

                            <p>Gloves provide a strong barrier against micro-organisms. They can also protect us against hazardous chemicals. In the home care setting, caregivers should always wear gloves to prevent direct contact with body fluid. If gloves are not available, they can use plastic bags.</p>
                            <p>They should also protect their feet when cleaning body fluids spilled on the floor. Remember, the use of two pairs of gloves at the same time (double gloves) is not recommended because one may slip off. It is also not cost effective</p>

                            <p>In HBC, it is very important to use the correct procedures for processing instruments and the other items that are used. Now consider the use of antiseptics and disinfectants.</p>
                            
                            <p>Can you remember how antiseptics and disinfectants are defined?</p>
                            <p>As a reminder, it was said that antiseptics are agents used on the skin and mucous membranes to remove or kill micro-organisms without causing damage and irritation to the skin or mucous membranes.</p>
                            <p>Disinfectants are chemical agents used to kill micro-organisms on inanimate objects, for example, instruments.</p>
                            
                            <p>List six antiseptics commonly used in your practice and at home.</p>
                            <p>Your answer should include the following antiseptics:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Alcohol (60-90% ethyl isopropyl)</li>
                                <li>Chlorhexidine (hibitane, hibiclens, hibiscrub savlon)</li>
                                <li>Hexachlorophene</li>
                                <li>Iodine (including tincture of iodine)</li>
                                <li>Iodophors (solutions that contain iodine in a complex form, for example, betadine)</li>
                                <li>Para-chloro-meta-xylenol (dettol)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Antiseptics should not be used on inanimate objects such as instruments and surfaces.</p>
                            <p>Antiseptics should only be used for the following purposes:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Surgical scrub.</li>
                                <li>Skin, cervical and vaginal preparation before clinical procedures.</li>
                                <li>Hand washing in high-risk situations especially before invasive procedures.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>There are two types of disinfectant:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Low-level disinfectants which kill most bacteria and some viruses.</li>
                                <li>High-level disinfectants which kill bacteria, viruses, fungi and some but not all bacterial endophores. These can be used to process instruments.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Some common high-level disinfectants are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Chlorine</li>
                                <li>Glutaraldehyde (cidex)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Common low-level disinfectants are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Phenols (for example, carbolic acid (lysol))</li>
                                <li>Quaternary ammonium compounds (for example, benzylkonium chloride)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Before you use any of these disinfectants and antiseptics always read the label. You should also assist your patients to choose cheap but effective chemicals for use in the home environment. They should not be contaminated and they should be well labelled to avoid accidental poisoning.</p>
                            <p>The advantages and disadvantages of the various chemicals that have been covered are explained in detail in module one, unit two. Review them again so that you can support other caregivers effectively.</p>

                                <li>Try the hands-free technique when passing sharp instruments to others. This is done by placing the sharp in a container, for example a kidney dish, alert your colleague who will then pick it up from the kidney dish. The container is referred to as a 'safe zone'.</li>
                                <li>Dispose the puncture resistant container when ¾ full by incineration or burning.</li>

                            <p>You will do this through:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Decontamination, that is, making instruments and other items safe for handling by soaking them in 0.5% chlorine for 10 minutes.</li>

                        <p>Finally, before this section is concluded on infection prevention, think how you can carry out sterile procedures at home with minimum risk of introducing infection, that is, the aseptic technique.</p>

                            <p>In the home of the patient, it is important to differentiate between places where procedures can be done and where they cannot be done. Ideally there should be two separate corners: one for carrying out clean procedures and storing sterile items and the other for dirty items where decontamination takes place. This kind of arrangement ensures that only sterile surfaces or articles touch other sterile surfaces or articles in that home. Remember that whatever is sterile for one patient can only be used for that patient alone. Also when handling sterile fluids, they must be poured from a point high enough to prevent accidental touching of the receptacle.</p>
                            <p>When providing HBC or teaching others to do it, you must assess the patient using the nursing process. This will enable you to know how to advise them, and what cost-effective means are available to institute all the infection prevention measures that have been covered. For instance, some patients may have cupboards and fridges to keep their food in while others may not. Some patients may have piped water while others may not. A careful assessment enables you to apply all the knowledge you have learnt in general nursing, reproductive health and community health to care for your patients. This will prevent the unnecessary transmission of infection.</p>
