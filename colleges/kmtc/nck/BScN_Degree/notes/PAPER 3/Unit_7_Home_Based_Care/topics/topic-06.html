                        </div>

                        <p>To effectively provide HBC, there are certain resources that are needed. These resources can be broadly classified into four categories or the 4Ms.</p>
                        
                        <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                            <li><strong>Money</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Materials</strong></li>

                        </ul>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Money</h3>
                            <p>Money is an important resource in the provision of HBC. Diseases like AIDS and cancer are long, expensive and debilitating illnesses. They eventually render the affected and infected incapable of participating in gainful employment. Yet they need money to pay for services or to buy goods such as food, clothing, drugs and other materials. They may also need to pay for health, legal and other services.</p>
                            <p>In the HBC system, money can be provided by the family, the community, the government or through insurance. It is unfortunate that many insurance organisations discriminate against patients with terminal illnesses. However you should work hard at sensitising the community about the needs of the patients and how they can be met.</p>
                            <p>In Kenya, raising money through Harambee is common and community members can come together to raise money to pay a hospital bill, buy a wheelchair or crutches. Whatever the source, your role is to sensitise members and patients on the need for the funds, and the likely sources of the funds.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Materials</h3>
                            <p>Many illnesses that require HBC tend to render the affected persons incapable of meeting even the most basic material needs of everyday life. For instance a PLWHA may become too weak to fetch water or firewood, or run errands and do shopping.</p>
                            <p>Food production may be affected due to frequent sickness from opportunistic infections. Thus, the material resources required to assist can be in the form of food, cooking fuel (for example, firewood), water, or money for drugs and other purposes.</p>
                            <p>These materials may or may not be readily available.</p>
                            <p>Within communities, the materials can be bought by individuals, communities or families. They can also be donated by organisations. Some non-governmental organisations may be willing to donate the materials or money to procure them.</p>
                            <p>Some of the materials can also be obtained from the hospital.</p>
                            <p>Right now there is a cost sharing policy in Kenya. You therefore need to explain to your patients how they can obtain these materials to avoid disappointment.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Minutes (Time)</h3>
                            <p>Caring for people who need long term care, can be time consuming and emotionally draining. The caregiver may have little time left to attend to other important aspects of everyday life, like working on the shamba (farm), going to work, school, or running errands. The constant demands can be very stressful.</p>
                            <p>Time is one of the most essential resources known to man. To be able to accomplish tasks, time is essential.</p>

                            <h4>How do you create time?</h4>
                            <p>Make time by planning ahead and organising your activities to fit into the allocated time schedules, being punctual, being specific, restricting activities to those planned for, involving more people to cut down on time required for one activity.</p>
                            <p>Being present is a major source of psychological and moral support. Friends and relatives should understand the importance of sparing time not only to help out as needed, but also just to be with the patient and the family members.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Manpower</h3>
                            <p>Manpower is another important resource, which is often overlooked. These are the individuals who voluntarily spare their time to assist the patients, their families and children.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Who can assist the patient in HBC?</h4>
                            <p>The following people can be counted as human resources:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>Health workers at all levels.</li>
                                <li>Family members, relatives and friends.</li>
                                <li>Community leaders/organised groups (e.g. In Kenya, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organisation leaders).</li>
                                <li>Spiritual, political, and administrative leaders/groups.</li>
                                <li>Community volunteers including students from neighbouring institutions.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>These people can provide a variety of services. It is important for you to understand what service each person can provide so that you can refer the patient appropriately.</p>
                            <p>In the later stages of a disease such as AIDS people become too weak to support themselves. This condition calls for continuous assistance from relatives and friends.</p>
                            <p>A volunteer care provider also needs continuous support from the community, morally and materially.</p>

                            <p>The resources that have been mentioned are not all easily available. As a community nurse, you need to know what is available, where and how to obtain it.</p>
                            <p>Some of the materials can be sourced at your health facility, at the community level, government, organised groups, at the patient's home or with an NGO. You also need to understand the process of procurement. Get to know the procurement procedures and the paperwork that needs to be completed. You will have filled in various forms such as the S11, S12 or S13, which are used for procuring drugs and supplies from the hospital pharmacy or from the local medical stores. You may also have procured vaccines and family planning items. You need to do all you can to mobilise the resources needed at the local level. If the patient needs mosquito nets, you can link the caregivers with NGOs that give them out. Even some drug manufacturers give out free drug samples.</p>
                            <p>People in the community can also be mobilised to assist in HBC. These could be trained volunteers, students or untrained community members who are willing to be trained. As a community nurse, you must be ready to put in additional effort to mobilise the resources necessary to provide HBC for your patients.</p>
