                            <p>The importance of community mobilisation is to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Prepare the community for participatory action.</li>
                                <li>Create awareness about their health problems, causes, prevention and care required.</li>
                                <li>Identify problems together with the community and seek means of solving them.</li>
                                <li>Gather information about the community's beliefs', feelings, myths and misconception of their problems.</li>
                                <li>Identify available resource and how the resources can be used to solve the problems.</li>
                                <li>Establish relationships within the community.</li>
                                <li>Ownership and sustainability of the programme.</li>

                            <p>HBC has the following advantages:</p>

                                <li>It helps to counter the stigma (like for PLWHA and what their families face), so that they can live without fear or discrimination.</li>
                                <li>It involves the patients to fully participate in their care, thus helping them to 'live positively'.</li>
                                <li>It can increase community awareness and thus helps prevent the further spread of infections like HIV.</li>
                                <li>It facilitates the mobilisation of local resources, and it brings the community together in the care of the patients, and their dependants.</li>
                                <li>It leads to community empowerment, ownership and sustainability of the services.</li>

                            <p>Mobilising the community for HBC services can be done through a variety of ways:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>Meeting at specific prefixed times.</li>
                                <li>Existing committees, such as the village development committee.</li>
                                <li>Home visits to groups and individuals.</li>
                                <li>Announcements at church, mosque, temple, and school.</li>
                                <li>Group community talks.</li>

                                <p>It is well understood that to be effective at mobilising the community, you should start from the top. This gives the leaders their recognition and also allows them to use their influence to get the people together.</p>

                                    <strong>Step 1: Planning and Organising Yourself</strong>
                                    <p>The first step is to plan and organise yourself for the exercise. This involves:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li>Knowing about and believing in HBC so that you can explain it well to the people.</li>
                                        <li>Knowing the community leadership and influencers.</li>
                                        <li>Preparing yourself psychologically, emotionally and physically for commitment to work with PLWHA and chronically sick patients.</li>
                                        <li>Identifying resources and preparing them for community mobilisation according to the rationale and objectives.</li>
                                        <li>Making arrangements such as the venue (home visits, gatherings, meetings).</li>
                                        <li>Sending out information to relevant persons.</li>
                                        <li>Confirming appointment date and time, being on time and not keeping people waiting.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Step 2: Entering the Community</strong>
                                    <p>As a community health worker, you are already well known. Because you have been working in the community, this may not be a complicated step. Nevertheless, HBC is a different activity from your normal duties, so take care to plan carefully.</p>
                                    <p>Remember to show respect to the community and individuals and be willing to acknowledge and deal with the different feelings about HBC services.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Step 3: Conducting Sessions</strong>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li>Greet people according to their culture.</li>
                                        <li>Find out what they know about HBC. Do not assume that they do not know anything; they could have experiences that may be useful.</li>
                                        <li>Give correct and complete information about HBC services.</li>
                                        <li>Allow the group/individual to express fears, make contributions and suggest approaches.</li>
                                        <li>Together with them make practical agreements on the way forward.</li>

                                    <strong>Step 4: Monitoring and Reinforcement</strong>
                                    <p>The final step involves monitoring the community response and making arrangements for action. This includes:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li>Watching for signs of acceptance of HBC (e.g., asking for more info, taking interest, volunteering, seeking assistance).</li>
                                        <li>Acknowledging positive responses.</li>
                                        <li>Finding out more about reasons for negative responses to clarify issues.</li>

                            <p>You cannot succeed unless you get people to understand what HBC is. These are the people who will act as advocates of HBC. Community members must clearly understand both your role as well as theirs, otherwise they will view you with suspicion.</p>
                            <p>The members must also know the importance of their actions. They need to understand what they stand to gain from the process in the short and long term.
