                                <li><strong>Contact with infected blood or other body fluids</strong>. Transfusion of blood products from an infected person/donor. Use of contaminated instruments such as needles, syringes, knives or blades. These instruments may have been used for circumcision, skin piercing, scarification, drug abuse and other traditional practices like female genital cutting.</li>
                                <li><strong>From an infected mother to a child</strong> in the uterus, during labour and delivery or during breastfeeding.</li>

                            <h3>The Three Phases of HIV/AIDS</h3>
                            <p>HIV/AIDS progresses through three main phases:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list steps-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Phase 1</strong>
                                    Phase 1 is when HIV is present in the body but laboratory tests can not detect it. This phase lasts for up to six months and includes the entry.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Phase 2</strong>
                                    Phase 2 is the detection stage, when laboratory tests can detect the presence of HIV. However, no signs or symptoms are present at this stage. It can last from two months to several years. It is also referred to as the HIV positive phase. It comprises the seroconversion stage and the asymptomatic seropositive stage.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Phase 3</strong>
                                    Phase 3 is the phase when the person shows signs and symptoms of AIDS and develops full blown AIDS. It is also called the AIDS phase.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>AIDS, as you know is not transmitted by casual contact, (holding hands, hugging, kissing, sharing food or drink.) You should therefore show affection to your patients and their families.</p>
                            <p>You are probably aware that in this country there is Voluntary Counselling and Testing centres (VCTs). You should encourage your patients, friends and family members to visit the VCT and find out their HIV status.</p>
                            <p>Counselling and testing has three steps:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The test decision or pre-test counselling</li>
                                <li>The test which is done by a finger prick to collect a few drops of blood</li>
                                <li>Post-test or results counselling</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Even when caring for people living with HIV/AIDS you should maintain utmost confidentiality of your patients' conditions unless they desire that others know. You should however recommend testing for partners of HBC patients.</p>
                            <p>People living with HIV/AIDS need to receive education on how to protect themselves, and their partners, through either abstinence or using condoms consistently and correctly and having only one sexual partner.</p>

                                <li>They can assist the patient to change position in bed and keep the patient's environment quiet and calm.</li>
                                <li>In the case of chest pain, you can apply a warm compress to the area where the discomfort seems to be centred.</li>
                                <li>If there is pain following a cough, you can hold a pillow or hand tightly over the area that hurts when coughing.</li>

                            <p>Nausea and vomiting although frequent can sometimes be short lived. They are brought about by HIV infection, drugs, opportunistic infections and food poisoning. The family and the patient should always watch out for dehydration.</p>
                            <p>Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) and weak tea can be taken in addition to small frequent meals. If certain smells and odours make the patient nauseated, they should be kept away from the patient.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Chronic diarrhoea occurs in two forms among those with HIV/AIDS. There is the persistent form which lasts for less than two weeks and the acute form.</p>
                            <p>The most common causes of diarrhoea are infection, side effects of drugs and food poisoning.</p>

                                <li>Give more fluids than usual, especially those that the person finds favourable: such as, unsweetened juices, porridge, soup, water and ORS. Correct dehydration by giving plenty of fluids after every loose motion passed.</li>
                                <li>If the patient is a child who is breastfeeding, continue to breastfeed the child to avoid malnutrition. If the mother is HIV-infected, adhere to the current instructions on how to feed such a child.</li>
                                <li>In case of vomiting or loss of appetite, feed the patient frequently with small amounts of food that form a balanced diet and that is easily digested.</li>
                                <li>After the diarrhoea stops, give an extra meal each day for two weeks to help regain the lost weight.</li>
                                <li>Prevent dehydration by early recognition and treatment.</li>
                                <li>Care for the perianal area to avoid skin break down.</li>
                                <li>Maintain infection prevention practices when caring for the patient and also advise the patient on this practice.</li>

                            <p>These are caused by TB, pneumonia, bronchitis, heart problems, asthma and common cold among others. It is important for patients to be investigated because some of the diseases are contagious. Patients should drink lots of fluids especially if there is fever. They should also sit up in bed if possible and turn frequently. When coughing, they should cover their mouths with a piece of paper or cloth which can later be burnt.</p>
                            <p>Testing should be done to find out the main cause and paracetamol or aspirin taken for fever. When there is difficulty in breathing, the head of the bed should be elevated to assist the person to sit up in bed. Difficulty in breathing can be very frightening and so it is important to talk to the patients and soothe them.</p>

                            <p>HIV infection can cause psychological effects, especially if the person is not properly counselled to cope with the situation. It can also cause mental confusion or dementia and peripheral nerve damage.</p>
                            <p>Mental confusion can be due to the direct effect of the virus on the brain, head injury, or severe depression. Depending on the degree, this can be a serious disability. Patients can present with inability to concentrate, loss of memory, slow thinking, poor short-term memory and personality change. In late stages, about half develop motor dysfunctions like weakness of one part of the body, tremors, inability to walk and incontinence of stool and urine. In anxiety and depression, patients have feelings of nervousness, fear, sadness and hopelessness.</p>

                            <p>Cancer prevention aims at ensuring that there are fewer cases of cancer. Cancer prevention measures are divided into three: primary, secondary and tertiary.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Primary Prevention</h4>
                            <p>This involves asking people to stop smoking, drinking excessive alcohol, decrease their fat intake, limit exposure to the sun in fair skinned people, and to limit exposure to carcinogens among people who work with chemicals and in industries. In addition, it involves protecting people from:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Exposure to ionising radiation which can lead to cancer of the thyroid.</li>
                                <li>Developing atrophic gastritis and pernicious anaemia which can lead to cancer of stomach.</li>
                                <li>Early sexual activity and multiple sexual partners which can cause cancer of the cervix.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Secondary Prevention</h4>
                            <p>Secondary prevention is done by identifying individuals with cancer before signs and symptoms develop. This takes the form of early screening for breast cancer, pap smears for cancer of the cervix, and bimanual/digital examination for prostatic cancer. Pelvic exams and endometrial tissue sampling are also important.</p>

                            <h4>Tertiary Prevention</h4>
                            <p>Tertiary prevention involves early and quick treatment before the effects of the cancer become widespread and unmanageable.</p>

                            <p>The overall aim of cancer management is to control the malignancy and extend the life of the patient or cure the cancer.</p>
                            <p>Once cancer is diagnosed, several options are available which include:</p>

                                    <strong>Surgery</strong>
                                    Surgery can be a form of prophylaxis. For example, patients with a history of breast cancer may choose to undergo mastectomy instead of waiting to suffer the effects of cancer. It may also be done for palliation, that is, to control difficult symptoms that could arise later. Patients who have undergone surgery may take time to heal and instead of staying at the hospital for long periods, the justification and rationale for HBC to nurse them at home can be used. Patients who have undergone surgery may suffer from pain at the surgical incision, altered nutrition and a decrease in self-image due to removal of an organ or structure from their body such as a breast. Other more acute problems, such as infections and bleeding, can be managed at the health facility in the immediate post-operative period.

                                    <strong>Radiation Therapy (Radiotherapy)</strong>
                                    This is the use of high energy ionising radiation to kill tumour cells. It can be used singly or in combination with other treatment options. Radiotherapy may be given over a period of time with varying side effects. These effects can be managed while the patient is at home. Patients who are on radiotherapy may have bone marrow depression, frequent infections, skin changes such as drying, allopecia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, anaemia and taste alterations, among others.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Chemotherapy</strong>
                                    Various drugs and drug combinations are used in the treatment of cancers. You will have come across some of these drugs. They include vincristine, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cytarabine, methotrexate and mitomycin. These drugs have many side effects. These include: bone marrow depression, nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia and problems affecting fertility, kidneys, lungs and nervous system. The management of these effects require HBC services.

                                <li>A nutritious and appetising diet. Certain foods may be removed from the diet such as spicy, dry food, alcohol and hot liquids. The patient should take small frequent meals which are high in calories and protein.</li>
                                <li>Good personal and general hygiene need to be practiced in order to reduce the risk of infection.</li>
                                <li>Patients with radiation implants should be cared for in separate rooms to protect other family members from radiation. Body secretions should be handled carefully. Precautions should be taken in patients with isotope administration. The caregivers should observe the following radiation precautions:
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li>Principle of time, which says that exposure to radiation is proportional to the time of exposure.</li>
                                        <li>Principle of distance, that is the nearer to the emitting source the higher the dose.</li>
                                        <li>Principle of shielding, whereby one uses materials which decrease transmission of radiation.</li>
                                        <li>Pregnant mothers and children under 18 years should not visit those with radiation implants.</li>
                                        <li>Careful observation, good disposal of waste and labelling should be undertaken.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>During and after chemotherapy, minimise stimuli from noise, light and odours (especially food).</li>
                                <li>Teach the patient relaxation techniques.</li>
                                <li>Provide counselling, spiritual care, emotional support and close observation.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Patients with terminal cancer may present with depression, fear, anxiety, fever, skin problems, diarrhoea and vomiting. You should be able to use the same management protocols that were mentioned while learning about management of AIDS-related conditions in the home environment.</p>

                            <p>Generally speaking, many patients with medical and surgical illnesses may require HBC. However, in this sub-section you shall only cover issues related to their management in the home environment.</p>

                            <p>As you have just seen on the previous page, the list is quite long and all the conditions have not been exhausted. Since you have previously looked at these diseases already, you will now broadly look at the areas of care that are needed for these conditions. These are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Comfort and pain management</li>
                                <li>Personal and general hygiene</li>
                                <li>Medications, their administration and safety and management of their side effects</li>
                                <li>Activities of daily living for the patient, for example, elimination, eating, reproduction and others</li>
                                <li>Alleviation of fear, anxiety, depression and general psychological care</li>
                                <li>Nutrition</li>
                                <li>Physiological and spiritual integrity</li>
                                <li>Security and safety</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>This means that all measures to provide comfort should be instituted in the home. These include positioning using assistive devices for example crutches, and walking canes providing rest and other measures to relieve pain which have already been covered.</p>
                            <p>The patient's hygiene is also very important and should not be neglected. If the patient requires assistance to feed or bathe, they should be given that assistance. If the patient requires assistance in elimination, they may require bed pans, urinals or catheterisation. Some patients may require to be taught how to inject themselves with insulin and other drugs.</p>
                            <p>The patient should not be neglected and if bed ridden they should be free from pressure sores. They should be loved and assisted to maintain physiological integrity through skin care, good nutrition and close observation. Infections should be prevented at all costs.</p>
                            <p>The spiritual and psychological care of the patient is another important area.</p>
