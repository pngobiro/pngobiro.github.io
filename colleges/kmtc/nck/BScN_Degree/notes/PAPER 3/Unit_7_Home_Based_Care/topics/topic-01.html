                            <p>In the last two decades, there have been dramatic changes in the health needs of our populations due to the rise in non-communicable diseases, terminal illnesses, injuries leading to disability and HIV/AIDS. These changes have led to an increase in the need for long-term care and the need for care to manage everyday living.</p>
                            <p>To meet this challenge, the Ministry of Health (MoH) has had to adopt a different approach to health sector policy and health care services. It has adopted the home-based care approach. In this section, you shall look at the concepts and principles of home-based care.</p>

                            <p>You will start by trying to understand the meaning of home-based care.</p>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--note">

                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>Home-based care is the care of persons with chronic or terminal illnesses extended from the hospital or health facility to the patients' homes through family participation and community involvement within available resources and in collaboration with health care workers.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>It is a holistic and comprehensive care which relies on collaboration between the hospital, the family of the patient, and the community, in order to enhance the quality of life of the patients and their families. In home-based care, the care of the patient is extended from the hospital or health facility where they are initially seen to their homes. This therefore implies that these patients require certain services. These services form the components of home-based care.</p>

                                Components of Home-Based Care
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <p>There are four components of comprehensive home-based care.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>1. Clinical Care</h3>
                            <p>Clinical care comprises early diagnosis, rational and targeted treatment and planning for the care of persons suffering from chronic or terminal and debilitating illnesses. The patients who are assessed and referred for home-based care need the continuum of care extended rationally. If a patient has not been well diagnosed and treated, don't you think the purpose and spirit of home-based care would be defeated?</p>
                            <p>Can you think of reasons why a patient may not receive good quality home-based care? One reason is that complications may arise from the disease that the patient is suffering from. When a patient is well diagnosed and rationally cared for at a health facility, it is easier to anticipate and plan for complications and how to manage them.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>2. Nursing Care</h3>
                            <p>Patients for HBC need nursing care to promote and maintain good health, hygiene and nutrition. As a community health nurse, it is your responsibility to provide this care and extend it to the home. By training family and community members, it is possible to extend the continuum of care to the home. Do you think this is possible? What do you think happens to all those patients who are discharged from hospital with residual effects of diseases and complications? Somehow, their families, friends and community provide some form of nursing care. In home-based care, care is extended by contributing skills together with other professionals and also training family and community members to give care to those that require it.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>3. Counselling and Psychospiritual Care</h3>
                            <p>The main aim of providing care to people with chronic and terminal illnesses and injuries is to prolong their life and make it bearable. This cannot happen unless there is positive living and decisions are made on the basis of informed choice. Counselling and psychospiritual care reduces stress and anxiety for both the patients and their families. It also helps individuals to make informed decisions on say HIV testing, planning for the future, making behavioural changes and involving sexual partner(s) in such decisions.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>4. Social Support</h3>
                            <p>On many occasions when patients are discharged from health facilities, you fail to realise the network of social and support services that they can benefit from. Patients with chronic and debilitating conditions need information and referral to support groups such as church organisations, youth groups and other social organisations. They also need to be referred to welfare services provided by social workers, children's department and other services, which may be provided by various governmental and non-governmental organisations. These individuals also need to be accepted by society and get involved in community activities depending on their capabilities.</p>
                            <p>These individuals and their families may also require legal advice and material assistance. You should never forget that these services compliment the care that is given in your health facilities.</p>

                            <p>The concept of HBC, as you may have realised, does not just address any disease condition but is intended for debilitating diseases that make patients unable to care for themselves. In HIV/AIDS for instance, you do not provide HBC to those who are HIV positive but to those with advanced AIDS illness. HBC concerns those who are sick but still able to care for themselves as well as those who are bedridden and unable to care for themselves.</p>
                            <p>So far you have looked at the definition and components of HBC. Before you go further, first ask yourself the following questions. Why HBC? Why can't patients for HBC stay in the health facility and be cared for by trained health care practitioners? What these questions are really seeking is the rationale behind HBC</p>

                                Rationale for Home-Based Care
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>You are probably well aware of the big problem presented by HIV/AIDS to the health care services in this country. Demand for health services has increased due to the growing numbers of individuals who have become ill as a result of HIV infection. This has resulted in an increased workload and congestion of health facilities.</p>
                            <p>Hospital bed occupancy rates have increased with over 55% of beds occupied by People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Apart from HIV/AIDS, other chronic diseases such as cancer have made people require long-term care.</p>
                            <p>In addition there are other reasons why the home-based concept has been adopted. It has been noted that:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>People with AIDS and other debilitating illnesses are discharged from health institutions where there are trained professionals and sent home to be cared for by untrained relatives with no professional back-up support. HBC will train HBC providers to offer continued quality services and also coordinate services between the community and health facility after discharge.</li>
                                <li>HBC helps reduce the stigma attached to some chronic diseases as the providers are knowledgeable of the diseases, which assists them to change their attitudes toward the disease and the patient.</li>
                                <li>People with chronic debilitating illnesses, for example HIV/AIDS, need continuity of care to prolong their lives and reduce their suffering.</li>
                                <li>Health institutions have many limitations such as shortage of health workers, few hospital beds and a shortage of other resources.</li>
                                <li>HBC offers support that will enable the patient to extend their productive lives for many years.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This has meant that many patients may have failed to get the care that they deserve.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>Many authors agree that HBC has a positive impact on the social, economic, psychological and physical wellbeing of the patient, family, community and the general health care system.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>The Patient</h3>
                            <p>The following are the advantages of HBC to the patient:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The patient is cared for in a familiar environment. Such a patient usually suffers less stress and anxiety compared to the one in hospital, clinic or nursing home. When people are in a familiar environment their illness is more tolerable.</li>
                                <li>When the patients are in their homes, they continue to participate in family matters. Those who are heads of their families continue doing so and can be consulted on various family issues. It is quite difficult when one is in hospital or a clinic to make a decision about, for example, which goat to sell in order to pay for school fees or which part of the farm should be tilled.</li>
                                <li>When the patient is at home close to family members, friends and relatives, there is a sense of belonging. This is not the case if one is in a hospital setting where the caregivers are strangers who keep changing with every shift.</li>
                                <li>When the patient is in close contact with familiar people they are likely to accept their conditions and illnesses. The acceptance contributes to quicker recovery or, in the case of HIV/AIDS, it may assist in better management of the syndrome.</li>

                                <li>Care given in the home can be less expensive than that in the hospital. You are aware that patients will pay for bed charges, food and other items, which will normally be available and shared at home.</li>
                                <li>Caring for sick people at home prevents separation and holds family members together. You will no doubt have heard of patients being divorced or separated because of illness. Others get into adulterous relationships because their spouses are not at home. This can be prevented through home-based care.</li>
                                <li>When family members are given education and information on diseases, it helps them to understand these diseases better and accept the patients.</li>

                                <li>Training in home-based care helps community members to be aware of the various illnesses affecting members of their communities. As always there are myths, misconception and beliefs especially in relation to chronic illnesses, for example, HIV/AIDS and epilepsy. An informed community counteracts these myths and beliefs and is therefore able to actively participate in prevention efforts.</li>
                                <li>It's cheap. The cost is shared as members contribute for upkeep and the costs of going to visit a person in hospital are reduced.</li>
                                <li>Community cohesiveness is maintained. This ensures that the community is able to respond to other members' needs.</li>

                                <li>HBC reduces the pressure on hospital services and hence the health system. Therefore hospitals have fewer patients to attend to and thus are able to provide quality services to those patients who require short-term care.</li>

                            <p>The sick person's family members, relatives, friends and other caregivers play an important role in the provision of home-based care. Their role is to:</p>

                                <li>Learn to accept and adjust to the situation, including that of the terminally ill with AIDS.</li>
                                <li>Collaborate with other care providers, for example, religious institutions, support groups, health and social institutions.</li>
                                <li>Be able to volunteer or agree on other possible caregivers that could be involved in providing the services in the family. This becomes shared responsibility on issues of referral and networking.</li>

                                <li>Involve the patient in all care activities and any other family activities without discrimination.</li>
                                <li>Emphasise the need to prepare for death as inevitable and sensitise the patient about the importance of ensuring the continuing care of family members who are left behind.</li>
                                <li>Encourage and help the patient to write a will.</li>
                                <li>Remember that being present is a major support.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>As a community health nurse you need to provide education on home nursing skills, counselling, as well as information on psychosocial and material support, patient caregiver interaction and communication.</p>

                            <p>The health facility plays a very important role in the provision of HBC.

                            <p>In order to succeed in your role in HBC, you need to cooperate with the other providers of HBC in your community. You must link the patient to the available support services right from the beginning when you identify that the patient needs HBC.</p>

                        <p>As you will have seen, providing HBC is a challenging task. One of the biggest challenges is related to the risk of spreading infection to the patient or acquiring infection from patients. In the next section you will look at how you can protect yourself from infection by adopting effective infection prevention measures.</p>
