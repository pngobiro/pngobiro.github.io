                            <p>You are now half way through this unit on home-based care (HBC). As you may have realised you are revisiting most of the content you covered in earlier modules, and applying what you learnt earlier in the provision of home-based care.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>HBC needs can be identified as those specific to the patient, to the family and to the community within which the patient lives. These needs may be physical, spiritual/pastoral, social or psychological and may vary from person to person, and from one community to another.</p>
                        <p>These needs should be identified when a patient is being enrolled into a HBC programme, for example, while still in hospital, so as to ensure proper planning and integration of activities.</p>
                        <p>Early identification also ensures adequate resource mobilisation and the sustainability of activities initiated.</p>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Needs of the Patients</h3>
                            
                            <h4>Physical Needs</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Drugs for treatment.</li>
                                <li>Clinical care including medication and regular check ups in case of the onset of new symptoms to ensure immediate management.</li>
                                <li>Clothing, housing, food, fuel/energy, water, education for children and income.</li>
                                <li>General nursing care to meet Activities of Daily Living (ADL), like toilet needs, observation of vital signs, care of wounds, personal hygiene and comfort.</li>
                                <li>Nutritional needs, that is, provision of a balanced diet, which is affordable and locally available.</li>
                                <li>Physical therapies to include exercise and massage.</li>
                                <li>Information, Education and Communication (IEC), including up to date, accurate information on the illness and safer sexual behaviour, on writing a will and on preparing for the eventuality of death.</li>
                                <li>IEC on how to take prescribed drugs, prevention and care of the patient's illness.</li>
                                <li>Security and safety measures.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Spiritual/Pastoral Needs</h4>
                            <p>Strengthening existing faith and helping the patient in spiritual growth boosts the spiritual aspect of life. This plays a great part in encouraging the person to have a positive view of life and to forgive others and themselves for any misconceptions and liabilities.</p>
                            <p>The patient will therefore be able to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Accept forgiveness by others</li>
                                <li>Forgive others</li>
                                <li>Have reassurance that God accepts them</li>
                                <li>Allow religious groups to offer support</li>
                                <li>Have freedom of worship according to faith, which should be respected by the health worker and the care providers</li>
                                <li>Call a religious leader of choice for sacraments and fulfilment of other needs</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Social Needs</h4>
                            <p>The patient and especially PLWHAs need company and association without stigma or discrimination. Family and community members should facilitate recreation and exercise at clubs/groups of their choice. People living with chronic illnesses need to be considered as people of value and having rights to be respected. They should not be cut off from activities they enjoy, for example, political rallies, church/mosque/temple and spiritual gatherings. The social needs of patients living with chronic illnesses include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Respect and dignity</li>
                                <li>Love and acceptance from others</li>
                                <li>Company of those around them</li>
                                <li>Source of income/income-generating activity</li>
                                <li>Right to own, inherit and bequeath property</li>
                                <li>Confidentiality regarding their condition by all who know about it</li>
                                <li>Help with the activities of daily living</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Psychological Needs</h4>
                            <p>Love, encouragement, warmth, appreciation, reassurance and help in coping with the disease are the most important psychological needs.</p>
                            <p>Religious groups, volunteer groups and other related support groups can all play a part in meeting these psychological and counselling needs.</p>
                            <p>They can:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Instil hope so that the patient can continue with their daily activities as long as possible</li>
                                <li>Maintain confidentiality and unconditional acceptance and love</li>
                                <li>Provide supportive counselling to live positively</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="callout callout--note">
                                <p>If you look closely at these needs, you will find that they fit into Maslow's hierarchy of human needs, which you covered in module two. In short, HBC must be holistic, encompassing all the aspects of human living.</p>

                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3>Needs of the Family and Caregivers</h3>
                            <p>Families and caregivers also have physical, psychological and social/spiritual needs that must be met in order to maintain family solidarity and well-being.</p>

                            <h4>Physical Needs</h4>
                            <p>The physical needs of the family are more or less the same as those of the patient except for personal needs that are specific to the patient's condition.</p>
                            <p>Family members of PLWHAs will need proper STD/HIV/AIDS education and demonstrations on the care they will be expected to provide. Because the burden of caring for someone who is very ill or dying is constant and heavy, the family may also need help with household, farm or other chores.</p>

                            <h4>Psychological Needs</h4>
                            <p>The families of people who are terminally ill and especially PLWHA need a lot of support, encouragement and acceptance from community members so that they may be motivated and encouraged to care for the patient without fear of being isolated.</p>
                            <p>They should be adequately prepared for:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The deterioration and eventual death of the patient.</li>
                                <li>How to give un-smothering love and acceptance.</li>
                                <li>Where and how to meet others who are going through the same experience of caring for a chronically sick person. This gives the family members a sense of hope and a drive to go on.</li>
                                <li>The importance of observing confidentiality, for example, keeping matters relating to the patient in confidence.</li>
                                <li>The very real possibility that they themselves may need to seek counselling to help them cope with the situation.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Social and Spiritual/Pastoral Needs</h4>
                            <p>Families don't stop being members of the community when someone gets illnesses like cancer and HIV/AIDS.</p>
                            <p>More than ever, such families need:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Respect and help with activities of daily living when the need arises.</li>
                                <li>Acceptance of the patient and enabling them to socialise and interact in the community.</li>
                                <li>Solidarity with the patient and the family.</li>
                                <li>Spiritual comfort, including taking the initiative to involve the family in spiritual growth through worshipping and praying together.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <p>When individuals fall sick, both the body and the mind can be affected. This affects their ability to carry out routine activities. Nursing care in the context of home-based care applies at all levels, from the health institution down to the family, depending on the individual needs of the patient. Since you qualified as a nurse, you have had a lot of time to learn and practice basic nursing skills.</p>

                            <h3>Bed Bath</h3>
                            <p>Some of the patients for HBC may be too sick to provide their own hygiene. They may therefore require to be bathed in bed. The caregiver requires equipment and supplies, such as, gloves, plastic/polythene paper, a large basin, a face flannel, warm water, bath towel, soap, a container for dirty linen, scissors/razor blade, comb, chair, clean linen and clothes.</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Prepare the resources, patient and yourself.</li>

                            </ol>
                            <p>Although this sounds easy, as it's what you have been doing, you will now need to teach this to the other caregivers who have not received training in nursing skills.</p>

                            <h3>Mouth Care</h3>
                            <p>Mouth care is intended to promote salivary flow, keep one healthy and the mouth clean. It also maintains freshness of the mouth.</p>
                            <p>For mouth care, the caregiver or patient requires gloves, three small cups, toothpaste or salt water or baking soda. Glycerine or vaseline, cotton wool balls, a container for used swabs, toothbrush or stick, plastic paper, a spoon/fork or stick for swab and a padded spoon for those who are unable to keep their mouths open.</p>
                            <p>You follow the same steps as those outlined in bed bath, that is:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Prepare the items, the patient and yourself.</li>
                                <li>Clean the mouth. If the patient is able, provide the toothbrush and toothpaste and a cup with water for rinsing the mouth and a container to spit into. If the patient is unconscious or conscious but weak then assist as per the recommended procedure in the procedure manual.</li>
                                <li>Clear used items and dispose of those that are not reusable.</li>

                            <p>Unclean nails can transmit infection from food to the mouth or they may scratch and transmit infection to the skin. The main aim of nail care is to keep nails short and clean so as to reduce the collection of micro-organisms and prevent self-injury. The caregiver requires a nail cutter, scissors or a razor blade, water in a basin, a piece of cloth or a towel, nail brush, vaseline or lotion and soap.</p>
                            <p>You should proceed as follows:</p>
                            <ol class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Prepare the patient by explaining the procedure and obtaining permission to continue.</li>
                                <li>Wash each hand and finger, scrubbing the nails with a brush, rinse and dry the hands.</li>
                                <li>Trim the nails, apply vaseline or lotion and move to the next hand and to the toes.</li>
                                <li>Upon completion you should clean any equipment used, wash your hands and dry them.</li>

You should use the same materials and steps as those described earlier when covering Bed Bath. You require a patient's towel or clean cloth, soap or shampoo, a comb or hairbrush, water, a basin and a stool.</p>
                            <p>Proceed as follows:</p>

                            <h3>Care of Pressure Areas and Pressure Sores</h3>
                            <p>Some of the patients who require HBC are bedridden and therefore at risk of developing bed sores. The objective here is to prevent the development of pressure sores around the protruding bony parts of the body in a patient who is unable to move out of bed, as well as minimise the risk of infection and promote healing.</p>
                            <p>Measures of preventing pressure sores are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Getting the patient out of bed as much as possible</li>
                                <li>Turning the patient every two to four hours</li>
                                <li>Attending to pressure areas by massaging areas of prominent bones with soap and water</li>
                                <li>Using soft bed sheets and changing the bedding whenever wet</li>
                                <li>Straightening the bedding often</li>
                                <li>Putting cushions under the body to keep the bony parts from rubbing together</li>
                                <li>Holding a bedridden child on someone's lap as often as possible</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You will also require the following resources for pressure area care:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Gloves or plastic/polythene bags to use as gloves if patient is soiled or has wounds</li>
                                <li>Stool or chair</li>
                                <li>Container of warm water</li>
                                <li>Basin or similar container</li>
                                <li>Plastic or polythene paper</li>
                                <li>Soap</li>
                                <li>Patient's own towel or a clean cloth</li>
                                <li>Body powder (if possible)</li>
                                <li>Vaseline or lotion</li>
                                <li>Toilet paper and a receiver</li>
                                <li>Clean linen</li>
                                <li>Container for soiled linen</li>
                                <li>Material for treatment of sores</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Once you have assembled all your resources, you should explain the procedure to the patient and examine the areas to check if pressure sores are forming.</p>
                            <p>Place the plastic paper or towel under the part to be treated first. Then with soapy hands you should gently massage each area in a circular movement and for long enough to stimulate good circulation of blood (count to ten as you massage each part) then rinse and pat dry. Apply powder and/or vaseline and ask the patient how they feel.</p>
                            <p>Remember to clear the materials used and to clean the equipment. Also change or straighten the underlying bed cloth as necessary and remake the bed so that you leave the patient comfortable. Lastly wash and dry your hands.</p>
                            <p>If the patient has pressure sores, in addition to the previous steps, you should dress the pressure sore by:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Dipping a small piece of cloth into the soapy water and clean the sore.</li>
                                <li>Wash around the edge of the sore first, then wash from the centre out to the edges until it looks clean. If possible use separate pieces of cloth for each wiping.</li>
                                <li>If the wound has pus or blood in it, cover with a clean piece of cloth or a strip of cloth (torn as a bandage) after cleaning; leave it loose and change it everyday. If the sore is dry, leave it exposed.</li>
                                <li>Raise the area with the sore as often as possible to relieve it from pressure of the bedding (this can be done by changing the patient's position in bed).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Some home treatments, such as pawpaw, honey and sugar, are very useful in the treatment of sores.</p>

                            <p>Always use gloves and other protective materials. If the items are reusable, make sure you decontaminate, clean them and sterilise them. You should teach all caregivers how to prepare decontamination solutions such as jik. If the items are not to be reused they should be burned, buried or disposed of in a pit latrine.</p>

                            <p>It is almost impossible to put too much emphasis on the importance of good nutrition in the management of HIV/AIDS and other chronic sick patients at all stages. Good nutrition is essential for the wellbeing of the individual. Attention to nutrition should begin as soon as the person is diagnosed with a disease.</p>
                            <p>The patient should be informed very early that eating well means more than just having a full stomach; it means eating the right combination of foods to provide the nutrients the body needs to function properly. Sick people have an even greater need for a well balanced diet than healthy persons, but with proper nutrition, they can generally stay healthier longer.</p>

                            <h3>Components of a Balanced Diet</h3>
                            <p>Foods can be divided into three basic categories, with each playing its important role in nutrition.</p>
                            
                            <h4>1. Body Building</h4>
                            <p>These are foods that support the function and formation of general structures of all tissues, including muscles, bones, teeth, skin and nails.</p>
                            <p>They include animal products like meat, fish, milk, chicken, eggs and plant proteins like beans, peas, groundnuts, green grams, lentils, sim-sim (sesame).</p>

                            <h4>2. Energy Giving</h4>
                            <p>These are foods which provide the body with energy.</p>
                            <p>They include starchy foods like potatoes, yams, cassava, bananas, sugar, wheat, rice, maize meal, bread, chapati, pasta, as well as fats and vegetable oils.</p>

                            <h4>3. Protective</h4>
                            <p>They provide vitamins and minerals that are key in strengthening the immune system.</p>
                            <p>They include fruits like oranges, pineapples, pawpaw, mangoes and greens/vegetables, like carrots, tomatoes, all local green leafy vegetables, cauliflower, cucumber, eggplant (biringanya) and cabbage.</p>
                            
                            <p>In addition, water and minerals like iron and calcium are essential to good nutrition. Water is necessary for bodily functions and to prevent dehydration. Minerals are necessary elements of the blood, bones, teeth, and body processes.</p>
                            <p>Examples of foods that are rich in iron are fish, meat, and dark green leafy vegetables. Calcium is derived from milk, groundnuts, and eggs. Other important minerals like potassium, selenium, zinc, and magnesium are vital for survival.</p>

                            <p>A well balanced diet is important for:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Repairing worn out body cells</li>
                                <li>Providing energy</li>
                                <li>Protecting the body against infection</li>
                                <li>Improving the wellbeing of the patient</li>
                                <li>Stimulate appetite</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In general the foods should be familiar, that is, what the family uses daily, is available and accessible. There are a number of factors that may influence the nutrition of HBC patients. It is important to be aware of them so that you can assist the patient accordingly.</p>
                            <p>In most cases, people with some chronic illnesses like HIV/AIDS need food supplements.</p>

                            <p>People living with HIV/AIDS and chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes have many questions about their diet.</p>
                            <p>Loss of appetite or difficulty in eating can be very distressing for the sick person, making them feel helpless and ineffective. The loss of weight can cause much fear.</p>
                            <p>All the foods the family is familiar with can be combined to meet the nutritional requirements of the patient and hence allay the fears and answer their many questions.</p>
                            
                            <p>Several factors may influence nutrition. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Cultural beliefs, taboos and practices relating to foods.</li>

                                <li>Natural climatic changes like drought and floods.</li>
                                <li>General conditions of the patient that decreases the food intake: mouth sores, lack of appetite, pain when swallowing, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, neurological diseases/anorexia.</li>
                                <li>Factors that increase the metabolic demands: fever, acute illness and HIV-infection itself.</li>
                                <li>Side effects of drugs used by the patient, for example, gastrointestinal intolerance, nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting and diarrhoea. Major side effects like pancreatitis and hepatitis.</li>
                                <li>Dietary restrictions due to the illness or the drugs the patient is using.</li>

                                <li>Work with the patient to develop an individualised nutrition care plan and implement it.</li>
                                <li>Improve food intake by diagnosing and treating any signs and symptoms that interfere with food intake.</li>
                                <li>Counsel patients about which foods to eat.</li>
                                <li>Educate AIDS patients on ART and drug-food interactions.</li>
                                <li>Identify other sources of nutrition supply to the patient, for example, if possible income generating activities, support from the community members, link with programmes that provide food to patients with chronic illnesses.</li>

                            <h3>Nutritional Advice for Diabetic Patients</h3>
                            <p>Studies have shown that many complications of diabetes can be prevented or delayed through effective management. This includes lifestyle measures such as a healthy diet, physical activity, the avoidance of being overweight and obesity and not smoking.</p>
                            <p>Diabetes therapy is not only about lowering blood glucose levels, but also about the overall reduction in the risk factors for diabetic complications. This includes the control of blood pressure and blood lipids. Thus diabetic patients require lifelong care and management.</p>
                            <p>Diabetes education plays a key role in empowering people with the knowledge and skills to manage their own condition effectively. In order to prevent or delay complications, people with diabetes may have to modify their lifestyle.</p>
                            <p>People with type 2 diabetes often require oral drugs, and sometimes insulin to control their blood glucose levels. People with type 1 diabetes require insulin to survive. Although insulin has been designated an essential drug by WHO, it is not yet universally accessible to all those who need it in many developing countries. In some of these countries people with diabetes die because they cannot get the insulin they need to survive.</p>
                            <p>Several approaches have been tried to prevent type 1 diabetes but none of them have been known to work. The prevention of type 1 diabetes remains an objective for the future.</p>
                            <p>However, simple lifestyle measures have been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes.</p>

                            <h4>Increased Physical Activity</h4>
                            <p>It is estimated that currently 60% of the world's population do not do enough physical activity, with adults in developed countries most likely to be inactive. Studies have shown that just 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day, five days a week, is enough to promote good health and reduce the chances of developing type 2 diabetes.</p>

                            <h4>A Healthy Diet</h4>
                            <p>Eating between three and five servings of fruit and vegetables a day and eating less sugar and saturated fats has been shown to be important in maintaining appropriate weight, and therefore lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>

                            <h4>Weight Loss</h4>
                            <p>More than one billion adults worldwide are overweight, at least 300 million of whom are considered obese. It is estimated that well over half of all cases of type 2 diabetes could be avoided if excessive weight gain in adults could be prevented.</p>

                            <h4>Non-Smoking</h4>
                            <p>People with diabetes are at greater risk of dying from coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease than people without the condition. Smoking increases the risk even further.</p>
                            <p>For both types of diabetes, nutritional advice is necessary.</p>
                            <p>The main aim is to keep the glucose levels under control.</p>
                            <p>The patient with diabetes needs to be given the same advice mentioned above for preventing type 2 diabetes. It is important to understand that people with diabetes have the same nutritional needs as anyone else.</p>
                            <p>In addition to exercise and medication (insulin and oral diabetes pill), nutrition is important for good diabetes control. By eating well-balanced meals in the correct amounts, a person with diabetes can keep the blood glucose level as close to normal (non-diabetes level) as possible.</p>

                            <p>You have already learnt about communication and counselling in module one on general nursing.</p>
                            <p>You should utilise the knowledge, skills and attitudes you acquired in that unit to care for HBC patients.</p>
                            <p>Psychospiritual support is also an effective means of helping patients to cope with their feelings. Spiritual concerns about impending death may give rise to an interest in spiritual matters and a search for religious support.</p>

                            <h3>Basic Counselling Skills</h3>
                            <p>A good counsellor must have the following tools (basic counselling skills) to be effective:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Self-awareness</li>
                                <li>Communication (verbal and non-verbal)</li>
                                <li>Active listening</li>
                                <li>Attending skills</li>
                                <li>Paraphrasing</li>
                                <li>Reflecting feelings</li>
                                <li>Questioning</li>
                                <li>Clarifying</li>
                                <li>Summarising</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>In counselling, the focus is the person, not the disease. You should be able to listen actively and respond with empathy. Because of the feelings that your patients may have, you should be able to influence your patients to be religious. This gives peace to the mind. Forgiveness and reconciliation replace anger and guilt. You can invite spiritual persons to come and talk to the sick person.</p>
                            <p>Many illnesses cause emotional, physical, and psychosocial pain and stress. You have already covered some of the stages of stress.</p>
                            <p>These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Shock, fear and denial.</li>
                                <li>Accepting, withdrawal, depression, suicide.</li>
                                <li>Accepting help, making plans about self and family.</li>
                                <li>Becoming ill and weak.</li>
                                <li>Anger, despair and/or sadness.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Counsel your patients and provide them with the basic physical needs which you have already covered. If possible provide material support or invite those who are able to provide the support. While communicating, you should be aware that this is a two way process. It should involve a response from the patient.</p>
                            <p>You should be able to persuade, inform and assist the patient to take action.</p>

                            <p>You have already learnt that to be able to take care of anxiety, anger, guilt or distortion in imagination, the patients need assurance and acceptance by their families and the community.</p>
                            
                            <h3>How can you show your patients that you have accepted them?</h3>
                            <p>Patients should be included in day to day activities.</p>
                            <p>They should eat with the family, eat out in restaurants, go to social events, and celebrate events. Let the patients belong to clubs, groupings and other social structures. Those who are able to work should be encouraged to do so. Those who want to take over responsibilities should not be denied the chance.</p>
                            <p>When patients have a terminal illness they should be assisted to prepare for their deaths with good psychospiritual care and support. Many patients can live fulfilling lives and die peacefully. Patients should be given the opportunity to write their own will.</p>
                            <p>You may be confused and wondering why all these things are done for patients who are already out of hospital and dying anyway. You need to remind yourself that when you provide services that meet patients needs, you help them to:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Meet material/physiological needs</li>
                                <li>Provide a sense of belonging</li>
                                <li>Reduce anxiety</li>
                                <li>Improve on relationships</li>
                                <li>Ensure a high quality of care</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This ultimately contributes to a patient's quality of life.</p>
                            <p>You need to refer back to unit three of module one where you can read more about palliative care. This kind of care can be extended to the home.</p>
                            <p>More specifically read about pain management.</p>
                            <p>While providing HBC, ensure that you do not suffer from burn-out.</p>
