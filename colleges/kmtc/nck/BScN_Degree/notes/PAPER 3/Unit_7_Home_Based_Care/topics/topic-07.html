                            <p>In HBC, several networks exist. There are networks for individuals working with PLWHA, cancer patients, and so on. Several networks may also exist for people infected and affected by, for example, HIV/AIDS.</p>

                            <p>As a community health nurse, you can facilitate networking in the community where you work by doing the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li><strong>Establishing Networks</strong> - Establishing networking at different levels, for example, district, location and village. Involving all institutions and groups working with the disease, such as HIV/AIDS.</li>
                                <li><strong>Information Exchange</strong> - Facilitating the exchange of information between one group and another. This would prevent repetition and duplication of efforts.</li>
                                <li><strong>Referral Channels</strong> - Making sure referral channels exist, for example, from one centre to another. Letting each organisation or individual be aware of the existence of the others.</li>
                                <li><strong>Resource Availability</strong> - Ensuring that the basic essentials are available for the betterment of the patient who requires HBC.</li>

                                <p>You should never forget to establish the correct links between one group and another. This is where your community mobilisation skills matter. Also remember to share your experiences and information as often as possible.</p>

                            <p>As mentioned earlier, you may not be able to do all things by yourself or indeed at the same place. There may be a time when you need to send your patients or community members to other institutions or people for further care.</p>
                            <p>Before you refer a patient, you should have recognised the signs and symptoms or the need for referral.</p>

                            <h3>Why are patients referred?</h3>
                            <p>Patients are referred for the following reasons:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>When services or resources within reach are not able to meet the patients' immediate needs.</li>
                                <li>In cases where the acute phase of the disease has been dealt with, and it is considered safe to transfer care to other caring services/organisations within the community.</li>
                                <li>When the caregiver experiences burnout and has no access to counselling services for personal growth.</li>
                                <li>When the caregiver has limitations in meeting certain needs of the patient, for example, based on religious beliefs.</li>
                                <li>For better, more competent management in the next stage of referral.</li>
                                <li>For specialised care in a hospital setting, especially if the patient is deteriorating.</li>
                                <li>For continuity of care from the health facility downwards, or from family level back to the health facility.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Referral to and from the family/community should be well arranged to avoid unnecessary burdens to the patient and family.</p>
                            <p>The patient and the family should be prepared for the discharge and told what equipment and supplies they require for HBC.</p>
                            <p>The HBC team should also inform the family that in case of a change of condition of the patient, the patient will be referred to a health facility including what the family requires for the referral.</p>

                                <li>Decide where to refer them to and make arrangements by calling in advance.</li>
                                <li>Explain to the person being referred about the referral and the referral arrangements, for example, what time they will leave and how they will travel.</li>
                                <li>Prepare the patient for referral. If the patient will be admitted they may need to take certain items, such as X-ray reports, lab reports and other things required by the institution or the patient themselves. Make transport arrangements for them.</li>
                                <li>Allow the patient to express themselves and try to answer their concerns genuinely.</li>
                                <li>Fill in the referral form, obtain an escort for them and ask them to give you feedback about any actions taken. Thank and bid them farewell.</li>
