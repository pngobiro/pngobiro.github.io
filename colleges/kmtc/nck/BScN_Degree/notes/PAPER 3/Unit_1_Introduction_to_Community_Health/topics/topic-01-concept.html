                                <p>This unit gives an introduction to the concept of community health and is divided into five sections. The first section looks at the concept of community health nursing and how people organise themselves within the community. The second section looks at the principles of community health nursing and the roles and functions of a community health nurse. The third section looks at vital statistics and epidemiology in the community. The fourth and fifth sections describe the organisation of health care services in the community and how you can apply Information, Education and Communication (IEC) to promote health.</p>

                            <p>As mentioned in the introduction to this module, community health is concerned with the promotion of health and prevention of diseases through close community participation.</p>
                            <p>In this section you will start by defining the community before moving on to explore the concept of community health. You also look at how people organise themselves in the community as individuals and families and how their behaviour can affect community health. Finally you will look at home visiting.</p>
                            <p>You will begin by looking at the objectives for this section.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">The Community</h3>
                            <h4>What is a Community?</h4>
                            <p>A community is a group of people (a large or small group) living in a certain geographical area and working together for a common goal. They share the same resources such as water, climatic and geographic conditions, health services, administration and leadership, as well as disadvantages such as shortages, risks and dangers.</p>
                            <p>The individual is surrounded by the immediate and extended family, all of whom are a part of the larger community.</p>
                            <p>You will now look at the components that make up a community starting with the individual.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- Individual -->
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">Individual</h3>
                            <p>Each individual you know is different and unique. Each has a mixture of characteristics, some of which they share with others and some of which are part of a particular culture. Culture is all those things which people learn, share and pass on to later generations. One of the most important of these things is language, for it is the means by which people communicate with one another.</p>
                            <p>As a health worker you must be able to communicate with individuals in the community where you work and acquire some knowledge of the language they speak. It is important to be able to show respect and understanding for other people and their culture as well as knowing their local practices like greetings.</p>
                            <p>Individuals learn beliefs and customs about right and wrong behaviour as they grow up. For example, in some areas, young people are taught that dead ancestors can influence the lives of living people. If the ancestors become angry they can cause disease and misfortune. Therefore, when you teach such individuals about the effects of germs on their health status, they may not be convinced and may opt to follow their traditional beliefs.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes, people follow both sets of ideas – traditional and modern, whereby they consult the dispensary for treatment of the symptoms and return to the traditional healer to get rid of what they think is the 'real' cause of the illness. As a community health worker you need to understand human behaviour and the factors that influence their behaviour in order to be effective in your community health activities.</p>
                            <p>An individual can only attain full health if they have wholesome growth. The place where this wholesome growth can best be cultivated is the family.</p>
                        </div>

                        <!-- The Family -->
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <h3 class="card-title">The Family</h3>
                            <p>The family is the smallest recognised group of individuals in a community. It begins with a marriage union in which husbands and wives have certain rights and obligations. It is one of the oldest institutions that mankind has known. It defies time, boundaries, cultures and human understanding.</p>
                            <p>It is therefore not surprising that scholars from all over the world who have studied the family of mankind do not agree on one single definition of the family. Rather than look at every available definition of the family, you will consider one which tends to agree on many aspects of the family.</p>

                                    <p>The family is a group of two or more persons, who share emotional bonds and material things, usually live in the same household, are related by blood, marriage or adoption, and sexual relationship is socially approved for the parents.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>The family is a very important social group in community health.</p>
                            <p>The family provides love, security and a sense of belonging for individuals from the time they are born. Many of a person's characteristics are influenced by their family. For example, a child learns from their family what behaviour is acceptable in the community and the language its parents speak. Families have a strong influence on what each member does.</p>
                            <p>Often there is an important figure in the family who makes the decisions or whose opinions are highly valued. The opinion of people in the family may be more important to a person than the opinion of a health worker. This has important effects on health behaviour and the use of health services. For example, in some communities women may not be free to go to or take their children to a health centre, even if they want to, because their husbands do not allow them. These are important things to remember when you advise individuals about a health problem.</p>

In the next sub-section you will look at the eight sub-systems found in a community and how they influence the health of its people.</p>
                            <p>A community has eight essential sub-systems, which interact and interrelate continuously. Take a look at each of these sub-systems in detail to understand how they influence the health of people living within a community.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">This system is made up of all the customs and beliefs, family and kinships, leadership and power structures in society. This sub-system exerts a powerful influence on the lifestyles of the community members, their priorities and their attitudes and values towards health and illness. For example some cultural factors promote either acceptance or stigma towards a certain illness. High-risk behaviour may be a result of cultural traditions.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">This sub-system is made up of the government and its development policies as well as political organisations. If there is political support towards improving health care delivery, the government provides the mechanism and structure for the planning, implementation and evaluation of the health care delivery system. The constitution of Kenya contains a declaration for the elimination of poverty, ignorance and disease; hence the establishment of the Ministry of Health and several other ministries</p>

The poorer the economy of the country, the more disadvantaged its people will be. Low economic status is highly associated with malnutrition and communicable diseases.</p>

Low educational status perpetuates underdevelopment, harmful traditions and superstitions. The educational system can be effectively used to pass health related information and messages that could significantly transform the perception of the communities on healthy living and prevention of illnesses.</p>

On the other hand, religious teachings may promote ill health, for example, by forbidding the followers from seeking treatment in hospitals.</p>

The health care system is enhanced through linkages that bring together the government, non-governmental organisations, private institutions and individuals in providing continuous and comprehensive health services. These linkages strengthen the multi-sectoral approach of achieving health for all.</p>

                            <p>Assessment is the first step in the process approach to family health care, but when do you carry out this assessment? You could assess family members when they visit your health facility. However, in order to get a comprehensive picture of a family's health, you need to visit them at home. Home visits are an important part of your work as a community health nurse as they allow you to see families and their needs in their own homes.</p>
                            <p>Home visiting is one of the essential community health services that you should provide. It has two main purposes:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            </ul>
                            <p>In order for you to conduct home visiting successfully, you need to have the following skills:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Good technical skills and knowledge of preventive and therapeutic measures</span></li>
