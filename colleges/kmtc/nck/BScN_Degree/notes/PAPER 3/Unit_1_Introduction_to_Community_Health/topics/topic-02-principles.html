You are trained to play a certain part as a member of a health team which is bound by the legal and moral expectations of your profession. This is what you call your role. In your role as a nurse, you have developed ideas about what is appropriate to say or do within this role. The role of the community health nurse is to prevent illness and maximise the health of individuals in the community.</p>
                            <p>Your function, on the other hand, refers to the job that you are expected to perform as a nurse. That is, the broad areas of responsibility which you assume as a nurse. Your functions as a nurse may vary according to your training, experience, and designation. The functions of a community health nurse are many and emanate from your role.</p>
