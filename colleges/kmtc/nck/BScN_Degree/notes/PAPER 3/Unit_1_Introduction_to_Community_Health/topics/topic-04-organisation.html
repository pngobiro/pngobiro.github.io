It is headed by a minister, assistant minister and a permanent secretary, in that order of seniority. These leaders are politically appointed and need not be health professionals. Next in this hierarchy comes the technical leader of health services, that is, the Director of Medical Services (DMS). The Director of Medical Services supervises all matters pertaining to preventive, promotive and curative health services. They are assisted by Deputy Directors, who are responsible for the various divisions which deal with the different responsibilities, such as mental health, communicable diseases and health planning, among others.</p>

                            <p>The Ministry of Health is represented at the provincial level by the Provincial Medical Officer, who is a senior medical officer in charge of organisation and administration of health services within the province.</p>
                            <p>The Provincial Medical Officer is answerable to the Director of Medical Services at the Ministry of Health headquarters. At the provincial level, they are assisted by other health officers responsible for various provincial health care departments, for example, provincial matron. At the provincial level, there is usually a provincial hospital.</p>

                            <h4>District Level</h4>
                            <p>The district is the basic organisational unit of the government health services. It is a key level in the health sector administrative setup because the government decentralised almost all of its activities and made the district the focus for rural development. The government delivers health care to the district population through:</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The district health service is headed by a District Medical Officer of Health (DMOH) also referred to as Medical Officer of Health (MOH). The administrative headquarters of the district health services are usually at the district or sub-district hospital, where the DMOH is in most cases also the medical superintendent of the hospital.</p>
                            <p>The district hospital provides limited specialised medical services and also logistic and technical support to the health centres and dispensaries in the periphery. It is a crucial link in the administrative support and referral chain of health services being provided to the population in the communities.</p>

                            <p>The last level in this hierarchy is the community/peripheral level. This is really at the community level where there are divisions, locations and sub-locations. Here health centres, dispensaries and in some places, community based health workers provide basic curative, promotive and preventive services. They may be augmented by the activities of special programmes, such as KEPI, or various mobile services. These health services together form the backbone of rural health service where about 80% of the population live.</p>

                            <p>Through supplementing the government health services, private institutions play a significant role in health care delivery. Many patients, who might not otherwise receive health care, are treated in private clinics. Some of the drugs and services not available in government units can be obtained in private clinics.</p>

                                Health Sector Reforms
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Many Kenyans have for a long time lacked access to basic health care, safe drinking water, proper sanitation and adequate nutrition. Kenyans suffer from preventable or easily treatable diseases.</p>
                            <p>Old diseases which had earlier been contained, such as tuberculosis, have come back, while new diseases and viruses like HIV/AIDS have emerged.</p>
                            <p>The deteriorating situation in health caused the government of Kenya to develop a Health Policy Framework Paper in 1999 outlining the strategies for the development and management of the health services in the country. To implement this paper, a Health Sector Reform Secretariat was established to spearhead the reform process.</p>
                            <p>The effects and institutional arrangements put in place to implement the Kenya's Health Policy Framework Paper (KHPFP) were slow. The downward trend in the poor health of Kenyans continued to raise concern to both the Ministry of Health and other key stakeholders in the health sector.</p>
                            <p>Many consultative meetings and workshops were held under the guidance of the Ministry of Health to explore ways in which the KHPFP policy objectives could be translated into actions to reverse the deteriorating health situation in the country.</p>
                            <p>From these meetings, the National Health Sector Strategic Plan 1999-2004 (NHSSP) was established to address the constraints in the health sector. This was a five year strategic plan which started in 1999. It had the following objectives:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">To ensure the equitable allocation of government resources to reduce disparities in health resources distribution.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">To increase the cost effectiveness and the cost efficiency of resource allocation and use.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">To continue to manage population growth.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">To enhance the regulatory role of the government in all aspects of the health care provision.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">To create an enabling environment for increased private sector and community involvement in health service provision and financing.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">To increase and diversify per capita financial flows in the health sector.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The achievement of these objectives required a lot of effort and resources at a time when the government was faced with donor embargos and other problems. The government of Kenya, through the Ministry of Health, came up with a strategy called the National Priority Health Package. This package ranks the health problems in Kenya according to the associated morbidity and mortality.</p>
