                            <p>Information, Education and Communication is a process that empowers individuals, family and communities to make decisions concerning their health. It encourages people to change their behaviours and social conditions.</p>
                            <p>IEC combines strategies, approaches and methods that enable communities, groups and organisations to play active roles in preventing diseases, thereby promoting and sustaining good health.</p>
                            <p>With IEC, activities are developed based upon the assessed needs, sound planned educational principles and continuous monitoring and reviewing of the objectives and planned activities.</p>

                            <p>In order to increase access to knowledge by different people on various issues, products and behaviour, health information must be communicated through various channels. These include:</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The main reason of using a variety of media is because it has been found that people are influenced differently by different media. Take the youth for example, they get more information through music and so radio is a powerful tool for them. Adult learners on the other hand prefer discussions and interpersonal communication.</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: var(--space-4);">IEC therefore is not only health education but it is a comprehensive approach. It builds the capacity of communities, families and individuals by giving them relevant information communicated in a way that they can understand, internalise and take appropriate action. The information may not necessarily be directly health information as long as it will impact on people's life. For example you can give people information on the cash crops they should grow even if it means getting the Agriculture Officer to show them. Cash crops can help in alleviating poverty which as you know has a negative impact on people's health. Now move on to briefly look at factors that influence adult learning. You will learn adult education in more detail when you come to the unit on Teaching Methodology in module four.</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: var(--space-4);">Most of the teaching that you are going to carry out as a community health nurse will be focused on adults. You are going to be talking to the youth, parents, family planning patients, household heads, community members and community leaders.</p>
                            <p>Since learning is a process of acquiring knowledge, skills and attitudes, which results in modification or change in thinking and behaviour, you should always bear in mind that the people you are teaching have some knowledge no matter how inaccurate it may be. You should therefore start with what they know and what they would like to hear. Once you have their confidence, it is easy to then carry them with you. Always avoid offending people even when tackling the harmful cultural habits, you have to be very tactful and make them diagnose the problem themselves. Use problem-based learning which makes the learners discuss their problems more openly and search for solutions. You will learn about this in greater detail in the Teaching Methodology unit in module four.</p>

                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>As mentioned earlier, when you are sharing information you should not assume what the learner's level of knowledge is. It is therefore very important for you to prepare yourself and put together all the necessary resources you will need. This is what is known as mobilising the IEC materials.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What are some of the materials you may require during IEC?</h4>
                            <p>The materials you need to mobilise depend on the message you want to communicate. For example, if you are talking to a group of mothers about a weaning diet, it may be necessary that you put together nutritious foods which are locally available and culturally acceptable to give an infant. If you are talking about family planning, you will need to have all the contraceptives methods as you may even have to demonstrate, for example wearing a condom. In some health talks, you might not get a chance to have the actual items on display but a poster showing the same will do. A good example is the poster shown above. Before you use a poster, you should ensure that it is developed and pre-tested on the target audience in order to ensure that the community understands the message you want to communicate.</p>
                            <p>Mobilising materials may also mean, checking the channels/media of communication so that the individuals, families and indeed entire communities can get the message as and when planned. The media may be print, radio, television or face-to-face. Some of the materials may be the actual items such as food, while others may be in form of handouts or posters. There are many posters, charts, calendars and even pamphlets that have been developed for different messages which you may have seen in your health facility. These are some of the resources that you may have to assemble before you start your talk.</p>
                            <p>Organising resources does not only include the media that you want to use but also may mean organising the space you are going to use or even seeking permission to organise such a meeting.</p>
                            <p>The animation opposite shows some ideas for handouts, posters, pamphlets, etc.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: var(--space-6);">Organising Space and Seeking Permission</h4>
                            <p>What is meant by organising space or seeking permission?</p>
                            <p>Whether you are talking to an individual, family or community, you need a place where you can all assemble. You should check the place to ensure that it has a conducive environment for a talk. For example, you do not want to be in a noisy place or in an open space when it is either raining or very sunny. Once you select the place you will need to check on the seating arrangements if you want people to be seated and make the necessary arrangements.</p>

                                    <p>As for seeking permission to hold a meeting, it is important to operate within the law as this could affect your programme. If you need permission to hold a Baraza, it is important for you to seek it from the relevant authorities. In fact it may be helpful to involve the authorities concerned, such as the chiefs and other respected members of that community. This means you would have to brief them well in advance and give them detailed plans.</p>
