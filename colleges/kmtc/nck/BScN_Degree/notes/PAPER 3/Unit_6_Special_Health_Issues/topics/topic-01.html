                            <p>In this section you will see the words disability and impairment used interchangeably. Most disabilities start at birth or in childhood. Those that start later in life are often as a result of accidental injury. In many cases the loss of a function due to disability need not make a person useless.</p>
                            <p>Often disabled people have other faculties which they can put into good use and therefore be able to earn a living for themselves and their family. For example, blind people can work as telephone operators, those with disabilities affecting the legs can do any work that requires the use of their hands. In order to help them you will identify their abilities and modify the environment to avoid overtaxing them. You will also provide them with appliances and the appropriate apparatus, in order to develop their potential ability and compensate for the defect.</p>

                            <h3 id="what-is-hearing-impairment">What is hearing impairment?</h3>
                            <p>Hearing impairment is a disability that hinders successful processing of sound waves through audition, that is the inability to hear or interpret/perceive sound waves.</p>
                            <p>Hearing impairment is classified according to the units used to measure the loudness of sound. These units are known as decibels (db). Human contacts and relationships depend on communication by means of speech. A person who has profound hearing impairment cannot converse with others unless they can both use and understand sign language.</p>
                            <p>Impairment in hearing may also cause changes in personality and attitude, awareness of the surroundings and ability to protect oneself. This calls for a great deal of patience and tolerance from other people when dealing with the patient. People with hearing impairment try to conceal their disability by developing some defence mechanisms, such as withdrawing from contact with others and displaying unreasonable irritability and aggressiveness.</p>
                            <p>It is therefore important for health workers to bear this in mind as they help a person with hearing impairment. Sometimes the person may even reject the help required to facilitate their hearing.</p>
                            <p>For example, they may refuse to wear hearing aids because they feel it advertises their disability.</p>
                            <p>It is therefore important to teach family members and the community how to cope and live with a person who has hearing impairment. This is better than educating or training anyone with moderate hearing impairment.</p>
                            <p>There are two terms used to describe hearing impairment, which are based on time of onset of hearing loss and the functional status of hearing. These are total hearing loss and hard of hearing. You will now look at what each means.</p>

                            <h3 id="total-hearing-loss-deafness">Total Hearing Loss (Deafness)</h3>
                            <p>A person who is born completely deaf and who in the past has never developed speech is described as deaf and dumb (Davies, B.M, 1978).</p>
                            <p>This person has total hearing loss and the sense of hearing is non functional for ordinary purpose of life. The person is dumb not due to a defect in voice production but because normal speech is only learnt by copying what is heard.</p>
                            <p>Deafness is classified into:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Congenital deafness</strong>, which is loss of hearing before speech is developed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Adventitious deafness</strong>, which is when one is born with normal hearing, but later suffers some illness or accident causing the hearing to become non functional.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="hard-of-hearing">'Hard of Hearing'</h3>
                            <p>'Hard of Hearing' is the term used to describe a person who although has defective hearing, it is serviceable with or without hearing aids.</p>
                            <p>This term indicates that although the person is deaf the person has normal speech.</p>
                            <p>Examples are people with:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Conductive hearing loss</li>
                                <li>Sensory hearing loss</li>
                                <li>Psychogenic hearing loss</li>

                                <li>Tubal catarrh, which is the occurrence of the middle ear being permanently under pressure due to malfunctions of the eustachian tube.</li>
                                <li>Acute middle ear infections.</li>
                                <li>Chronic otitis media which is caused by excessive growth of the cranial bone, thus leaving little room for the ossicular chain (which is malleus, incus and stapes) to operate in. These fail to transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear leading to considerable hearing loss.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="inner-ear">Inner Ear</h3>
                            <p>The diseases and defects of the inner ear are the most serious contributors to hearing loss. They affect both perception and the recording of the four parameters of sound loudness, that is, pitch, quality and duration. These may cause other problems apart from serious hearing loss. Causes of hearing loss in the inner ear include the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Congenital causes due to infections in utero such as german measles or rubella, cytomegalovirus, syphilis.</li>
                                <li>Brain damage especially intracranial injury in cases of difficult labour and delivery.</li>
                                <li>Neonatal jaundice due to hyperbilirubinemia which can lead to kernicterus. Kernicterus causes brain damage thus interfering with interpretation of the sound wave.</li>
                                <li>Acoustic trauma caused by loud environmental noise, which distorts the tympanic membrane making it unable to vibrate.</li>
                                <li>Minieres disease which causes a considerable loss of frequency analysis.</li>
                                <li>Postnatal incidentals, such as infections due to measles, mumps and meningitis, and the overuse of drugs such as aminoglycosides (especially neomycin), quinine, or salicylates.</li>
                                <li>Tumours of the auditory nerve such as acoustic neuroma.</li>

                            <p>Community teachers, family, institutions, special schools and associations are some available resources for the hearing impaired. In most communities it is possible to find people who have hearing impairment and who can be requested to mentor and train a child with hearing impairment. It is important to identify and use such persons because they relate easily to the emotions and difficulties the child may be going through. Some may even be trained which would be an added bonus.</p>

                            <h3 id="other-families-with-hearing-impaired-members">Other Families with Hearing Impaired Members</h3>
                            <p>Families with children who have hearing impairment in the same community can come together and form a support group where they share experiences. This serves as group therapy and they learn very well as a group. As a community nurse you can again motivate these families to come together and support each other, as well as support them with information and ideas about prevention, and the different services available for their children.</p>

                            <h3 id="institutions-for-the-hearing-impaired">Institutions for the Hearing Impaired</h3>
                            <p>There are a number of institutions where special education and programmes for the persons with hearing loss take place.</p>
                            <p>You can find these through the ministry of education in our country and refer our patients to them.</p>

                            <h3 id="special-schools">Special Schools</h3>
                            <p>Persons with hearing impairment need special training in special schools where they can learn. In our country there are many schools for persons with hearing impairment.</p>
                            <p>They assist them to develop skills that make them feel important and useful members of the community. Special schools are largely public institutions run like any other school. Visiting these special schools helps us to understand and appreciate their services to persons with hearing loss.</p>

                            <h3 id="associations">Associations</h3>
                            <p>In many countries, persons with hearing impairment have formed associations to look after their needs and welfare. Some of them meet to discuss issues affecting them, and arrange for short training courses in communication skills.</p>
                            <p>The Kenya National Association for the Deaf advocates for the deaf to have equal access to public services such as schools and hospitals.</p>
                            <p>They also have a job placement activity which helps deaf persons get employment as well as start income generating activities, such as small enterprises of fishing, carpet making, carpentry, sweater making amongst others.</p>
                            <p>Another NGO known as the Kenya National Deaf HIV/AIDS Education Programme is involved in the reduction of stigma among deaf persons affected and infected by the virus, establishment of deaf-friendly VCT sites, and development of materials for the deaf.</p>
                            <p>As a health worker it is important for you to know about these associations so that you can refer your patients appropriately.</p>

                            <p>The effective management of hearing impairment is based on early detection. It is important that you remember that in most cases impairment starts in childhood. Therefore you should ensure that all under fives are properly managed in order to prevent diseases that cause hearing impairment. The management of hearing impairment starts with assessment which then leads to the choice of an appropriate treatment option, such as surgery, hearing aid, or ear syringing.</p>

                            <h3 id="what-does-assessment-mean">What does assessment mean?</h3>
                            <p>Assessment is the process of identifying persons with impairment and quantifying it through reliable tests. In the case of hearing impairment assessment tests are carried out by an audiologist.</p>
                            <p>Once the problem is diagnosed and the cause and degree of hearing loss is established, then a number of treatment options can be applied depending on diagnosis. However, the process of managing hearing problems starts right from your well-baby clinic, where children under five years of age come for treatment of ear infections, or diseases such as otitis media.</p>
                            <p>Screening tests also need to be carried out routinely on all the under fives to diagnose and assess if impairment exists. If this is done a child who has hearing loss or a hearing problem will be identified early and treated.</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Surgery</strong><br>
                                    This can be performed if the hearing loss is not congenital. Operations can be performed on the tympanic membrane and the ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes).
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Ear Syringing</strong><br>
                                    Ear syringing may be done in cases where the hearing problem is due to excessive wax and there is no ear infection. This is mainly in the external ear.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Hearing Aid</strong><br>
                                    These appliances are used to correct the hearing defect in cases of mild and moderate hearing.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Alternative Communication Skills</strong><br>
                                    It is known that the development of speech reaches its peak during the first three to four years and that the optimum period for development of hearing is during the first year. To give a child with hearing loss a chance to learn words and language, you should advise the parents to train them from an early age. The child is taught:
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li>Lip reading to help in communication</li>
                                        <li>Gestures or actions of the body to express issues</li>
                                        <li>Sign language</li>
                                        <li>Integration and rehabilitation</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The integration and management of hearing impaired persons should start at home and involve the whole community. This means encouraging the deaf to manage better at home and work in the community.</p>
                            <p>In the home you need to encourage and educate the family on how to support and live with a hearing impaired person. You should try to introduce them to other families who share the same problem in order to relieve their fears and promote acceptance of the person with hearing loss.</p>
                            <p>Your role and that of other health workers will be to support the family and the community by providing them with information, equipment and training.</p>
                            <p>Above all they will also need encouragement to strengthen social integration of the person with hearing impairment.</p>

                                <li>Prenatal labour and delivery services need to be improved to prevent occurrence of hearing impairment. Pregnant mothers should be vaccinated against german measles (rubella). The mother should also be advised to avoid taking drugs unless prescribed by the doctor. She should also have her blood checked for rhesus negative status which brings about rhesus incompatibility. Since deafness can also be caused by complications of labour and delivery, it is very important that you identify early and manage mothers who may present with labour complications. Early diagnosis is very important in order to minimise chances of intracranial injury to the newborn.</li>
                                <li>Early diagnosis and treatment of infections and trauma such as otitis media, ear discharge or a foreign body in the ear is very important, so as to prevent complications which may lead to hearing impairment.</li>
                                <li>The community should be educated on the importance of identifying these signs and seeking prompt medical advice.</li>

                            <p>Normally, activities of daily living such as feeding, socialising, playing, verbal skills, and mobility are learnt at home. A normal child learns how to do every day activities by watching what others are doing and imitating them.</p>
                            <p>If a child is under five years of age and is visually impaired, then they need special help from the family in order to learn these skills.</p>
                            <p>The family needs to train the child to recognise common domestic objects by touching. They need to provide the child with toys to play with in a room that does not put the child at risk from accidents.</p>
                            <p>Parents also need to be educated about the importance of keeping the child's articles and toys in their regular places, so that they can find them easily.</p>
                            <p>Children who are visually impaired also need more body contact, especially when talking to them to facilitate communication.</p>
                            <p>When the child is old enough to attend nursery school, the family should recite nursery rhymes and songs with the child, in order to prepare the child for integration into the community, where they will identify with the learning activities of other nursery school children.</p>
                            <p>Encourage a person who is visually challenged to have contacts relatives and friends to be contactable when the need arises. The family needs to modify the environment to prevent accidents.</p>
                            <p>Encourage the person to participate in activities they can perform and enjoy.</p>
                            <p>Your role is important in providing support and encouragement to the family and availing them with information on the available resources.</p>

                            <p>There are a number of educational institutions and associations that care for visually impaired persons.</p>

                            <h4 id="education-institutions-schools-for-the-blind">Education Institutions: Schools for the Blind</h4>
                            <p>These are special schools that provide special services to the visually impaired. Some of these schools are owned and managed by the government. Others are owned and managed by non-governmental organisations and missions.</p>
                            <p>You should be able to identify some of these schools in your catchment area. It is beneficial for you to visit them in order to know what they do.</p>
                            <p>In these schools the visually impaired are taught braille, a system of reading specially developed for blind people which uses small raised marks that they feel with their fingers. Visually impaired persons can start learning from the age of five years.</p>
                            <p>Braille is also taught to all persons under the age of 50 years who have been blinded after enjoying good sight for many years.</p>
                            <p>For example, the victims of the 1998 August terrorist bomb blast in Nairobi who lost their sight were trained on how to read braille depending on their occupation. After learning how to use braille, visually impaired persons are able to pursue their studies and careers up to the university level, becoming lawyers, administrators and teachers in society.</p>
                            <p>In addition, they are taught survival skills and skills of daily living, such as how to get around from point A to B using a cane. Special schools play a very big role in increasing their participation in the community and facilitating their integration.</p>

                            <h4 id="educational-assessment-and-resources-centres-earcs">Educational Assessment and Resources Centres (EARCs)</h4>
                            <p>These are centres which were created countrywide to offer assessment and referral, as well as placement of children in schools which are nearest to their homes.</p>

                            <h4 id="cbos-ngos-collaborators">CBOs/NGOs/Collaborators</h4>
                            <p>These are organisations which look after the interests of the visually impaired. They provide assistance in the form of materials and equipment, education, finances, and provision of guidance for the visually impaired.</p>

                            <p>The management of persons with visual impairment starts with the proper assessment of the condition followed by treatment, integration and rehabilitation.</p>

                            <p>The ageing process is often defined in terms of physical changes that negatively affect the body's function and appearance. Old age is associated with poor health, poverty and dependency.</p>
                            <p>In the past, our traditional support systems were so effective that they made the problems of the elderly insignificant. However, today these support systems have disintegrated due to socio-economic changes in our society.</p>
                            <p>In Kenya, the elderly are defined as persons aged 64 years and above, although the retirement age is 55 years of age. In this subsection you will consider an elderly person as anyone who has attained the age of 60 years and above.</p>
                            <p>The number of elderly citizens in this country has been on the increase. This increase would not be of much concern if you already had support structures in place to take care of them. However, as mentioned earlier, these systems have disintegrated leaving them vulnerable to medical and social problems.</p>

                                    <strong>At the Family Level</strong><br>
                                    In Kenya most elderly people live with their nucleus and extended family. These are the people who care for them. As a community health nurse, it is your responsibility to encourage families to care for their elderly persons. You need to educate them on the needs of the elderly, equip them with the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes to provide effective care. You also need to educate members of the community of the importance of planning for retirement. The aim for this preparation is to help the elderly persons remain independent and comfortable in their own homes as long as possible. There is need to discuss the payment of pensions and allowances early for better planning.

                                    <strong>At the Community Level</strong><br>
                                    Elderly persons require community health services. It is your responsibility to identify them and make sure they are available and accessible to the elderly persons. Encourage them to join recreation facilities to improve their mobility and to join peer groups to help them psychologically. During home visiting you should be able to provide direct care to the elderly. Churches also provide spiritual support as well as material support to the elderly persons. The women and youth groups offer different types of care. When these groups visit the elderly they alleviate their loneliness and improve their nutrition status by providing them with meals. They also help them with cleaning, repair work and gardening. As a health worker, one of your important roles is to become their advocates. You should let their needs be known by the community and motivate them, especially the youth, to have a positive attitude towards care of the elderly, so that you add life into their days.

                                    <strong>Institutions for the Elderly</strong><br>
                                    In Kenya, there are a number of homes for the elderly and day care centres. Do you have any in your district? If you do not know, then you need to identify these homes. They provide the following services:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Nutrition</li>
                                        <li>Activities of daily living such as personal hygiene</li>
                                        <li>Treatment of any sickness</li>
                                        <li>Recreational activities</li>
                                        <li>Safety and comfort</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    The best care for the elderly is the one provided by the family.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Hospitals</strong><br>
                                    Geriatric hospitals are well established in developed countries. In Kenya the elderly do not have any special health services targeting them. In some communities it is commonly believed that old age is a cause of illness. This leads to delay in seeking health care for the elderly. Another reason why the elderly may delay to seek health care, is that they live far from the health services. As a community health nurse, it is your responsibility to sensitise and encourage community members to seek health care for their elderly persons.

                            <p>An illness is said to be chronic if it meets one or more of the following criteria:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Permanent</li>

                                    <strong>Imposes Limits</strong><br>
                                    The idea of limits is sometimes expressed metaphorically, as living within an energy envelope, having an energy bank account with a very low balance, or seeing available energy as a bowl of marbles, which must be spent very carefully. Living well with chronic illness means learning to live within limits and learning to manage powerful emotions.

                                    <strong>Affects Many Parts of Life</strong><br>
                                    Chronic illness affects many parts of life, such as, the ability to work, relationships, emotions, dreams for the future and personal integrity.

                                    <strong>Brings Uncertainty</strong><br>
                                    Chronic illness brings great uncertainty, both on a day to day basis, as symptoms wax and wane, and over longer cycles. They may be concerned about their finances, worrying about whether they will be able to support themselves, or whether they can qualify for or keep up with the disability. When they think about the future, they may worry about how far down they may slide, and about becoming dependent or financially destitute. They may feel at times that they have lost control over their bodies, and over their ability to plan and predict.

                                    <strong>Varies Greatly in Severity</strong><br>
                                    Just as chronic illness is comprehensive in its effects, so too is it tremendously varied. Some people have relatively mild cases, while others may be bedridden. Most people are somewhere in between. There are many different patterns of symptoms. The bottom line is that each person's illness is different. Adding to the complexity, an individual's illness may vary over time. Some symptoms may disappear, only to be replaced by new ones. Some people may have a relatively stable course, while others may fluctuate between times of severe symptoms and times of remission.

                                    <strong>Varies Depending on Life Situation</strong><br>
                                    The financial situations of patients vary enormously. Some continue to work, have spouses who work, or receive generous disability payments. They may find their financial situation to be similar to what it was before becoming ill. For others, however, financial pressures can be overwhelming. Some patients have little or no income. Qualifying for disability can be a long and stressful ordeal. Those with disability may worry about losing it. Others feel forced to work even when their bodies cry out asking for rest. The quality of relationships may vary greatly too. Some patients receive good support from family and friends. For others, relationships are a source of great stress. For all, however, chronic illness changes relationships, creating new strains and frustrations.

                                    <strong>Will be Affected by One's Response</strong><br>
                                    Chronic illness calls for a different role for patients and doctors than is typically true for short-term illness. The doctor has limited powers, because there are no cures for chronic conditions and medications often have limited effectiveness. In chronic illness, much more responsibility falls on the shoulders of patients, the people who manage their illness on a day to day basis.

                            <p>A chronic condition does not only affect the patient, but also all the family members who live with the affected person. This is because most chronic diseases bring about dependency and an extra financial burden on the family. A number of services are available for the chronically ill at the family, community and institutional levels.</p>

                                    <strong>Family</strong>: Often, chronically ill patients are taken care of at home by family members. This is known as home-based care which you will learn more about it in the next unit of this module. In order for a family to care properly for a chronically ill patient, they need to be prepared and educated on the requirements. It is your responsibility to provide them with the necessary information and to follow up on the patient's progress from time to time. This is important as it helps the family and the patient to feel confident in the care at home.

                                    <strong>Community</strong>: Community Health Workers (CHW), as well as Community Owned Resource Persons (CORPS), can assist the family to care for a chronically ill person at home. This can take the form of medical advice, material support and spiritual support.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Institutions</strong>: Institutions that provide services to the chronically ill include hospitals, hospices, and support groups depending on the type of chronic illness. Hospitals admit these patients during the acute stage for management. Once this stage is over, they are then discharged and followed up at the consultant clinics, from where they are given medication to take at home. Hospices usually take care of terminally ill patients. They teach the patients and their caregivers all issues concerning care, and also make follow up visits at home, where the patients are being cared for.

                            <p>The management of chronically ill patients depends on the stage of adaptation to the illness that the patient is in.</p>
                            <p>In the first stage, they tend to be in denial and disbelief. During this stage you need to be actively involved in the care of this patient even if they are being cared for at home. Educate the family members to listen to all the expressions of feeling by the patient without criticising them. They should also be empathetic and listen to the arguments without being judgmental.</p>
                            <p>Patients in the second stage of adaptation to their illness commonly manifest with anger. During this stage the patient develops an awareness of the chronic illness. You should educate the caregivers to exercise restraint and self control.</p>
                            <p>In the third stage the patient undergoes reorganisation and is nourished by the concept of hope. You should therefore give hope generously within acceptable limits. You should also provide the patient and family with suitable and practical coping methods, and encourage the use of self-help devices if necessary.</p>
                            <p>Knowing the patient's values, religion and beliefs will go along way in assisting you help the patient.</p>

                            <p>These are people who have been displaced from their communities or even countries.</p>
                            <p>The displacement of people can be caused by a number of factors, the most common being armed conflict. Natural disasters, famine, political reasons and economic changes are some of the others.</p>
                            <p>They can be divided into two categories:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Internally Displaced Persons</strong>: These are people who have been displaced within their country, following ethnic clashes or disasters such as floods and earthquakes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Externally Displaced Persons</strong>: These are people who have run away from their country as a result of civil war or political persecution. They are also known as refugees. For example in Kenya there are many refugees from neighbouring countries such as Sudan and Somalia. The government works closely with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to settle all externally displaced persons.</li>

                            <p>The problems experienced by displaced persons include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Housing</li>
                                <li>Sanitation</li>
                                <li>Water supply</li>
                                <li>Lack of inadequate nutrition which may result in malnutrition</li>
                                <li>Security risk and human rights violation</li>
                                <li>Overcrowding which may cause rapid spread of diseases</li>
                                <li>Lack of education opportunities</li>
                                <li>Lack of health services</li>
                                <li>Emotional needs</li>
                                <li>Poverty</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Displaced persons tend to develop health problems due to poor living conditions, as well as psychological and physical trauma caused by displacement.</p>
                            <p>Some displaced persons are separated from their families and relatives and have lost homes, jobs and schools for their children. They need material as well as psychological care. Some may develop antisocial behaviour as a defence mechanism, as they are unhappy with the displacement. It is important that some measures be taken to help them.</p>
                            <p>Apart from the above problems, people who have been displaced may bring new diseases, such as diarrhoeal diseases, typhoid, measles, meningitis, sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV/AIDS.</p>
                            <p>Even their animals can bring in diseases such as rabies, anthrax, foot and mouth and brucellosis. So as you can see, they can also pose as a health risk to the community where they settle.</p>

                            <p>Displacement often leads to dramatic changes in the family structure and gender roles, relations and identities.</p>
                            <p>In conflict situations, many women are suddenly thrust into the role of head of the household because the men are recruited to combat, they stay behind to maintain land, or migrate in search of work.</p>
                            <p>There is also:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Escalation in the level of poverty</li>

                            <p>The services available for displaced persons tend to be those provided by relief agencies, NGOs, the government through the provincial and district administration, the church, and institutions such as UNCHR which take care of external refugees.</p>
                            <p>They provide them with shelter, medical care, food and clothing, and sometimes rehabilitation in the form of teaching them new skills.</p>
                            <p>Refugees have some sort of international protection. Their needs are catered for by UNHCR and their rights are also protected.</p>
                            <p>Internally displaced people are still citizens of their country, and are not afforded protection.</p>
                            <p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) protects the rights of internally displaced people. It conducts protection and assistance programmes for these victims.</p>

                            <p>Your role as a community health nurse, will be to work with other health workers as a team, in order to deal with the various problems of displaced people.</p>
                            <p>There will be a need to set up relief centres which provide the following services:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Screening and first aid to all new arrivals.</li>
                                <li>Food assistance, especially to infants and children, as food is a basic need. The adults also need food for survival.</li>
                                <li>Temporary shelter so that individuals can sleep and rest.</li>
                                <li>Reproductive health services; antenatal, labour, delivery and post natal, family planning services are also provided.</li>
                                <li>Medical care services, where curative care for common diseases and injuries will be provided.</li>
                                <li>Immunisation programmes for children and pregnant mothers.</li>
                                <li>Health education and community mobilisation.</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>As these emergency services are given, the families should be encouraged to settle down, especially if the situation requires them to stay there for a long period. They should be encouraged to start growing their own food and rearing their own animals.</p>
                            <p>Having looked at the special health services needed by displaced persons, Next you will consider the needs of another group, that is, widows and widowers. Do they require any care and what can you do for them?</p>

                            <p>The death of a spouse makes one to become a widow or widower and you have many of them in your community. Some of the leading causes of death today in Kenya include diseases and road traffic accidents.</p>

                            <h3 id="think-of-four-diseases-that-are-a-major-cause-of-mortality-in-kenya">Think of four diseases that are a major cause of mortality in Kenya.</h3>
                            <p>The following diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Kenya:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>HIV/AIDS.</li>
                                <li>Malaria.</li>
                                <li>Hypertension.</li>
                                <li>Typhoid.</li>
                                <li>Diabetes mellitus.</li>
                                <li>Heart diseases.</li>
                                <li>Diarrhoeal diseases.</li>
                                <li>Obstetric complications, such as pregnancy induced hypertension, ante partum haemorrhage and postpartum haemorrhage.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>As mentioned earlier, apart from disease, the second most common cause of death in Kenya is road traffic accidents.</p>
                            <p>The factors that contribute to road traffic accidents include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Unroadworthy vehicles.</li>
                                <li>Careless driving, usually under the influence of substance abuse.</li>
                                <li>Poor enforcement of traffic regulations by the concerned authorities.</li>
                                <li>Unskilled drivers.</li>
                                <li>Poor roads.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>When a spouse dies the effect of the loss affects the entire family. They not only lose the love and care from that parent or spouse, but sometimes also the financial support. Therefore widows/widowers require a lot of support, empathy, understanding, love and care. They need to surround themselves with people who they can trust and rely on.</p>
                            <p>This tends to be people who have been close, understanding and supportive to the family. They are people whom the family has shared important aspects of their life with, and are referred to as significant others. They include members of the extended family, friends, colleagues, church members, and so on. They help the family to cope with feelings of loss.</p>
                            <p>As a community health nurse, your role is mainly to counsel the widow or widower, and to support them as they go through the grieving process.</p>

                                <li>Psychological effects following the death of the husband, such as loneliness, and cultural practices not allowing the widow to re-marry.</li>
                                <li>Poverty, due to not having the right to inherit property or have their right enforced, being evicted from their property, no support from family or relatives.</li>

                            <p>In developed countries there are well established systems in place for helping widows or widowers.</p>
                            <p>However in Kenya there are no formal systems, although within many communities there are various support systems which can be mobilised to assist a widow or widower.</p>

                                    <strong>The Extended Family Members</strong><br>
                                    In many communities, the traditional support system for a widow or widower is the extended family. They support the widow during the grieving period and sometimes take the responsibility of caring for the family. They also identify ways of assisting the widow or widower and in many cases conduct fund raisings or 'harambees' to help them meet expenses such as hospital bills or school fees for the children. This is a spirit which you need to cherish.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Clan</strong><br>
                                    In certain communities, clans play a very big role in the care of a widow. The clan takes the responsibilities of the children's education, and may even assign individual members of the family, the responsibility over the children, in order to ensure that the burden is well shared out.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Support Groups</strong><br>
                                    Support groups for widows and widowers are common and exist in most of our communities. They come together to share their problems and help each other in solving them. They also contribute money, and sometimes look for donors to help them establish income-generating activities. A good example is the group known as Widows and Orphans of AIDS Kenya (WOFAK). As a community health nurse you should find out about these groups, so that you can advice and encourage widows and widowers to join them for support.

                                    <strong>Institutions</strong><br>
                                    As mentioned earlier, in Kenya there are no established institutions designed to take care of widow and widowers. However, the government has established a system known as the widow and widowers pension scheme. This scheme pays a pension to the widow or widower as well as allowances for the children. It is important to remember that the widow and widower pension scheme only covers those who are employed by the government. For the unemployed the family and community takes the responsibility.
