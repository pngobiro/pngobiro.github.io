You should therefore endeavour to provide health services such as promotive, preventive and curative care, to all people, of all ages, wherever they live and work. There are groups, however, who for various reasons need special health services. In this section, you will examine the health services needed by workers.</p>

                            <p>At independence, the government identified health as one of the basic needs and an essential precondition for the overall economic development and social progress of this country. Primary Health Care should therefore be available to everyone. But, as you know, some groups of people are at higher risk than others of becoming ill. That is why you will examine health services for special groups, such as occupational health.</p>

                                    <p>Occupational health is the physical, mental and social well being of a person in relation to their work and working environment, as well as their adjustment to work and the adjustment of work to them. People at work are an important group to be considered in planning health services.</p>

                            <p>Get a paper and pen and write down three reasons why workers require special health services.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>At work, people often come together in large numbers that can be conveniently cared for at a single service point.</li>
                                <li>At work, healthy people can be exposed to health risks.</li>
                                <li>They may work in very isolated areas where no other health services are available.</li>
                                <li>When an employment group is considered as a unit, sickness caused by certain occupations can be identified and prevented.</li>
                                <li>Illness among workers creates a loss to both individual and national productivity. Thus every effort should be made to decrease the chances of workers becoming sick.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Occupational health is also concerned with the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>The effect that work may have on health that is in causing injury or disease</li>
                                <li>The effect that injury or disease may have on ability to work</li>
                                <li>The effect of hazardous industrial fumes or toxic wastes, which pollute the air, sewers and rivers.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The first occupational health services were started by large companies for workers in dangerous jobs such as mining, large tea farms or factories. Then it was referred to as industrial medical services, because it was concerned with the treatment and prevention of injuries and special diseases, for workers in mines and factories who contracted things like lung diseases due to dust inhalation.</p>
                            <p>Gradually the aims have been broadened to cover workers in all occupations including:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Agriculture</li>
                                <li>Transport</li>
                                <li>Commerce</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The care offered to workers includes promotive, preventive and curative services for all diseases whether they arise at work or at home. In this broader context, occupational health is concerned both with the effects that work may have on health as well as the effects of health on work.</p>

                                    The use of new tools and machines, for example, a wood maker may lose a finger in a circular saw if not well trained. There is a risk of health problems from fumes, dust, noise and extreme temperatures.

                            <p>In developing countries, occupational health services are not yet well established. This is because of many factors ranging from shortage of occupational health personnel to affordability of the services by the companies. However, more and more companies are today providing their workers with occupational health services.</p>

                                Philosophy of Occupational Health
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>The guiding philosophy of occupational health services is based on the belief that the health and safety of the worker and workforce is the concern of the employer, employee and the nation at large. This should be reflected through:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>The promotion and protection of workers throughout the working community</li>
                                <li>Respect for workers' rights and adherence to principles of self determination and non discrimination in the receipt of quality healthcare while protecting employee confidentiality</li>
                                <li>Dynamics of the work environment and diversity of the workers population</li>
                                <li>Employer and employee responsibility for health and safety</li>
                                <li>The benefits of the occupational health services to the worker population and company</li>
                                <li>Collaborative multidisciplinary relationships that support and enhance worker's health and safety</li>
                                <li>The relationship of the occupational health and the community</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>With the philosophy of occupational health services in mind, it is important to design occupational health programmes just the same way programmes are designed for other special groups. In Kenya, the community health nurse carries the responsibility of organising practical occupational health programmes. It is therefore your responsibility to carry out these activities at the different levels of the health system, from the provincial down to the community level where industries, factories and farms are found.</p>

                            <p>The practice of health care provision among people at work has much in common with the practice of any other type of medicine. Indeed, nearly all kinds of health staff deal with workers in one way or another. However, there are special aspects of medical care provided at the work place which are important and unique for working groups.</p>

                            <p>In the context of occupational health, primary prevention anticipates problems and tries to avoid them before they occur. Promotion of good occupational health involves the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Good construction of machines and buildings.</li>
                                <li>Training of the workforce on how to work with machines.</li>
                                <li>Proper utilisation of protective, safety equipment and clothing.</li>
                                <li>Good personal hygiene and health.</li>
                                <li>Adequate rest when working with machines.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Primary prevention is also concerned with preventing and dealing with the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Wounds and cuts caused by machines and tools.</li>
                                <li>People falling over equipment or equipment falling on people.</li>
                                <li>The effect of a toxic substance entering the body through inhalation, skin or eye contact.</li>
                                <li>Increased risk of any of the above because of the employee's own poor personal habits, attitudes or physical condition.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="preventing-hazards">Ways in which these hazards can be prevented</h3>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list bordered">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Toxic Gases</strong><br>
                                    Accidents from toxic gases, for example, carbon monoxide. These can be prevented or managed easily if gas detection warning systems are installed. Oxygen cylinders with reducing valve masks and bags should be readily at hand, preferably in the supervisor's office.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Chemical Burns</strong><br>
                                    Risk of liquid or chemical burns. In this case plunge baths or showers should be sited alongside the working area.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Vulnerable Groups</strong><br>
                                    Deployment of vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, hypertensives, diabetics, or epileptics away from areas where they can easily injure themselves. Care should be taken to ensure that such groups are not deployed in areas where in the event of sudden illness they can injure themselves or jeopardise the safety of others. The workplace should have employees who are trained in first aid and are familiar with the treatment of such illnesses.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Equipment Injuries</strong><br>
                                    Injuries caused by equipment or materials at the workplace. A first-aid box or cupboard should be provided and maintained according to the standard by a responsible person. There should be a system in place that ensures immediate treatment of all injuries anticipated at the work place and referral for further management.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Occupational health workers need to know the treatment of minor injuries and illnesses common in the working environments.</p>
                            <p>Another important activity which contributes significantly to primary prevention is good record keeping. Good record keeping provides useful and easily retrievable information on the health of the individual and of groups of workers. A record of preplacement examination gives a baseline of the worker's health.</p>

                            <h3 id="preplacement-exam">Preplacement Examination</h3>
                            <p>This is the medical examination that is done before a person is employed. Routine medical examinations are one of the essential cornerstones of occupational health services. They can be of value to the worker, their employer, their fellow workers and the community. There are two main types of medical examinations:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Preplacement examinations</li>
                                <li>Routine, periodic and special examinations</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 id="preplacement-objectives">Objectives of Preplacement Examination</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list checklist">
                                <li>Determine suitability for a particular job.</li>
                                <li>Detect untreated pathological conditions and 'asymptomatic' disease.</li>
                                <li>Provide a baseline record against which any future findings or routine examinations can be compared.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 id="preplacement-benefits">How do the results of the preplacement examination assist both the worker and the organisation?</h4>
                            <p>The results enable the occupational health worker to advise the personnel department on the suitability of the applicant for the particular job. The applicant also benefits in the sense that the examination could discover a medical condition they were not aware about and be able to seek early treatment for it. In addition, a well run preplacement examination programme may help to reduce a high labour turnover, absenteeism, injury and illness thus increasing productivity.</p>

                            <h4 id="periodic-exam">Periodic Medical Examination</h4>
                            <p>This is an effective method which enables the occupational health worker to stay informed about the health of individuals and groups, and at the same time detect adverse trends which may be caused by work. Periodic physical examinations are essential in the early detection of intoxications and other effects of occupational hazards, for early management.</p>
                            <p>The maintenance of a safe and healthy work environment is crucial for enterprise. Thus investigation, control and evaluation of the working environment together with medical surveillance are the cornerstone of a good occupational health service. Remember that the average worker spends at least one third of their day at the workplace, where they may be exposed to many factors that could adversely affect their health. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the occupational health worker to identify such exposures and to assist with their control through routine and special surveys of the working environment. General surveys should be performed by occupational health workers accompanied by members of the health and safety committee at least once every six months. The use of a standardised design format should assist one to capture and cover all the areas of importance.</p>

                                    <strong>Light</strong><br>
                                    The effects of poor illumination result in eye strain, headache, eye pain, lachrymation congestion around cornea and eye fatigue, and blurring of vision.

                                    <strong>Noise Pollution</strong><br>
                                    Auditory effects leading to temporary or permanent loss of hearing.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Vibration</strong><br>
                                    It has been proven that continuous vibration hinders the proper function of blood vessels. In turn this may produce injuries to joints, elbows and shoulders.

                                <li>
                                    <strong>Ultraviolet Radiation</strong><br>
                                    This occurs mainly in welding work causing intense conjunctivitis and keratitis (welder flash).
                                </li>

                            <p>Occupational hazards may occur in the following ways:</p>
                            
                            <h4 id="contact">Contact</h4>
                            <p>Chemicals in the work place can cause one or more of a variety of toxic effects. (A toxic compound is one that causes illness or death). Toxic chemicals include teratogens, systemic poisons, mutagens, carcinogens, or behavioural toxins according to the nature of damage caused. The damage can be apparent immediately or later after some years and symptoms may be obvious or subtle. Frequent skin contact with chemical substances can lead to occupational dermatitis, eczema, ulcer, and cancer.</p>

                            <h4 id="inhalation">Inhalation</h4>
                            <p>Inhalation of dust is responsible for dust allergy, anthracosis, silicosis, asbestosis, cancer of the lung, siderosis. Inhalation of gases may cause asphyxia due to carbon monoxide and cyanide gas. Presence of metal and other components may cause toxic effects to body organs.</p>

                            <h3 id="biological-hazards">Biological Hazards</h3>
                            <p>Workers may be exposed to infective and parasitic agents at the place of work. This can result in infection with diseases such as brucellosis, anthrax, hydatidosis, tetanus, encephalitis, fungal injection, and HIV infection.</p>

                            <h3 id="mechanical-electrical-hazards">Mechanical and Electrical Hazards</h3>
                            <p>Machinery including its parts, tools, objects and materials used are often a source of mechanical hazards leading to injuries. Machinery, along with power supply systems, can also create electrical hazards, leading to severe or fatal accidents.</p>

                            <h3 id="psychosocial-hazards">Psychosocial Hazards</h3>
                            <p>Psychological hazards effect the mental and physical well being of people. The most significant psychological hazard in the workplace is occupational stress which results from negative harmful stress or distress. The more obvious forms of stress are severe stress reactions from exposure to trauma or violence at work. This is often referred to as critical incident stress. Occupations that see and work with trauma include the paramedical and health care professionals, community care workers, police and prison officers.</p>

                            <p>When a hazard has been detected, the preventive measures to be adopted depends on the nature of the hazard or harmful substance and its route of absorption into the body. The common methods of dealing with hazards are as follows:</p>

                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Remove the Hazard or Toxic Substance from the Work Place</strong><br>
                                    The best preventive measure is to get rid of the substance, chemical or machine altogether and find a less dangerous alternative.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Reducing Exposure to the Hazard</strong>
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li>Sucking or blowing away the dust or fumes from the place where they are produced.</li>
                                        <li>Wetting a substance that gives off dust when cut or worked on dry, this is common in wood industries where there is a lot of drilling and grinding.</li>
                                        <li>Carrying out a process entirely in a closed system of tanks and pipes or in a closed room or space.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>General Ventilation</strong><br>
                                    The ventilation of work rooms is improved so that the atmospheric contaminants and heat are removed or reduced. This is mainly achieved by installing wide windows and ventilators in areas of work and ensuring that there is enough operating space for the workers.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>General Cleanliness</strong><br>
                                    General cleanliness is a very important method of dealing with certain hazards and harmful substances. Good factory cleanliness reduces exposure, encourages tidiness and safer methods of working.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Personal Hygiene</strong><br>
                                    It has been documented that good washing habits can greatly protect workers from hazardous substances. Thus good washing facilities should be available so that workers may wash dirt and chemicals off their hands before eating. Where the work is very dirty, or irritant chemicals are used showers should be provided in changing rooms.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Protective and Safety Equipment</strong><br>
                                    Protective clothing should be worn all the time in order to protect oneself from health hazards. However, it has been observed that in practice it is difficult to get workers to use protective devices regularly. Therefore it is better to try to eliminate hazards by other means. Examples of protective clothing include:
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li>Rubber gloves</li>
                                        <li>Goggles to protect your eyes and face during surgical procedures</li>
                                        <li>Respirator or masks</li>
                                        <li>Aprons and gumboots</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <strong>Accident Prevention and Promotion of Safety in Working Places</strong><br>
                                    An accident is defined as an unexpected and unplanned occurrence, which can lead to bodily injury. Although it is an unexpected and unplanned occurrence, situations in which accidents occur generally can be foreseen. For example, a sharp bend or curve on a road can be identified so that motorists can avoid overtaking and over speeding at that point. Thus by identifying these situations, many accidents can be prevented, before they occur.

                            <p>Occupational health is one of the responsibilities of a community health nurse. In the communities where you work, there are small scale industries using machinery and toxic substances such as insecticides. You therefore need to be aware of these hazards and harmful substances, and be prepared to advise workers, managers and development committees on health matters. The responsibility starts and stops with you as there is often no local occupational health service in the community.</p>

                            <h3 id="functions-nurse">Functions of an Occupational Health Nurse</h3>
                            <p>The occupational health nurse looks at the health of a worker from two angles: health in relation to their occupation and the health care of non occupational illness and injuries.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, the functions of an occupational health nurse include the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Physical and psychological assessment of workers to facilitate proper selection and placement</li>
                                <li>Prevention of occupational and non occupational illness</li>
                                <li>Provisions of treatment</li>
                                <li>Fostering a high level of well being of the workers</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="responsibilities-nurse">Responsibilities of an Occupational Health Nurse</h3>
                            <p>These include the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Participating in the health assessment program that is, both preplacement and routine medical examination of workers.</li>
                                <li>Keeping a continuous watch on working conditions, equipment and materials for safety precautions and possible dangers. Counselling workers regarding personal and family health problem.</li>
                                <li>Cooperating with management in the application, enforcement and training on the use of protective measures.</li>
                                <li>Giving advice on environmental sanitation and safety education activities.</li>
                                <li>Carrying out nursing administrative duties, which assure the efficient management of the occupation health services.</li>
                                <li>Maintaining simple records on which to base surveillance, prevention and control of occupational illness or accidents.</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>Bearing in mind the responsibilities of the occupational health nurse you covered previously, occupational health nurses have four major roles in occupational health programmes. These are:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list card-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Professional Role</strong><br>
                                    (Covered in general responsibilities)
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Environmental Role</strong><br>
                                    An occupational environment is the combined effects of external conditions and influences which prevail at the place of work and have a bearing on the health of the working population. For example in industry, the worker interacts with three different types of agents:
                                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li>Physical, chemical and biological agents, for example
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Physical - heat, cold, radiation</li>
                                                <li>Chemical - toxic dust liquids and gases</li>
                                                <li>Biological - viral, bacteriological, rickettsia</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Machines and electricity</li>
                                        <li>Fellow man</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    One of the roles of the OHN is to periodically assess the environment and all the facilities in the organisation in order to detect and appraise health hazards and therefore maintain a healthy working environment. In addition to the agents mentioned, the OHN also assesses the optimum condition of work such as lighting, ventilation temperature, humidity and cleanliness of all areas in the organisation to prevent contamination. These assessments in conjunction with the knowledge of plant process, modes of transmission of causative agents and conditions for optimal work output, give baseline information which enables the individual to make recommendations to management for preventive corrective measures.
                                    <br><br>
                                    To provide a safe environment in the occupational setting, particularly in industrial setting, it is recommended that:
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list compact" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                                        <li>Working hours should be organised in such a way that they allow the worker to have breaks in between.</li>
                                        <li>Periodic inspection of the plant be carried out to check on ventilation, cleanliness, dust gases, light, sanitary facilities.</li>
                                        <li>Periodic medical checks up of the workers be undertaken to detect any signs of sickness.</li>
                                        <li>Precaution be taken to prevent accidents by the workers and also by the management, through supply of protective devices and institution of precautionary measures in the handling of machines and other hazards.</li>
                                        <li>Adequate lighting and ventilation should be provided in order to avoid hazards like eye defects, accidents, minor ailments.</li>
                                        <li>There should be proper washing facilities to maintain cleanliness and prevent infection.</li>
                                        <li>Workers should be given health educated safety, prevention of health hazards and need for regular medical check up.</li>
                                        <li>Proper measures must be taken for the promotion of mental health and prevention of mental illness.</li>
                                        <li>Health education should be a component of the total health programme.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Managerial Role</strong><br>
                                    Occupational health nurses work closely with management. Their role is to report and give recommendations on unsafe and hazardous conditions as well as the health condition of employees. There is close interaction between an industry and the community where it is located. Workers bring their knowledge skills, attitude and personal problems to the work setting and these may influence work productivity. In addition they also bring illnesses which may affect others in the organisation. It is therefore the role of the OHN's to manage this interaction between the industry and other organisation and community resources, such as, social, health, or welfare systems, in order to meet the overall health needs of the workers. It may involve setting up a referral system to arrange care for workers and their families or it may involve compiling data on absenteeism owing to illness to be used in calculating illness rates for the community. An OHN also takes part in planning, formulation and implementation of policies related to the health and welfare of the workers in the organisation.

                                    Occupational health nurses are expected to play a vital role as advisors, counsellors, educators, environmentalist, hygienist, rehabilitators, researchers, safety experts and supervisors. Health education is essential for the promotion of optimal health for workers and their community. The OHN should plan, organise, and implement health education programmes for the workers and their community members. The following topics should be included in your health education talk during occupational health services:
