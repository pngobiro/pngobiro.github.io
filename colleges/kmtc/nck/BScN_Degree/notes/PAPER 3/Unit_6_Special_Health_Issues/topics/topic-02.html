                            <p>In all forms of injury or disease it is possible to apply first aid measures before the actual diagnosis and treatment can be applied. Such measures aim at reducing complications or preventing the injury from becoming worse. The measures may be performed by the victims themselves or by other people who are around the victim. If the measures are conducted in a professional manner then the victim is assured of a good prognosis. The same rationale applies to disaster management.</p>

                            <p>Kenya has had its share of disasters. You will have heard of fires in boarding schools, hotels and slum areas; natural disasters such as droughts, landslides and floods; and disease outbreaks such as cholera, yellow fever and currently HIV/AIDS. All these are different forms of disasters.</p>
                            <p>Like many other developing countries, Kenya only deals with disasters after they have occurred. Although the people are always ready to act in emergencies and have in the past put up valiant rescue efforts, there is a great need for the government to train different personnel on disaster preparedness and management. The experience of the 1998 bomb blast in Nairobi was a good indicator. Indeed, all communities need to be prepared to be ready for such eventualities.</p>

It can also be defined as a sudden, accidental event that causes many deaths and injuries. Most disasters also result in significant property damage.</p>

                                    <strong>Earthquakes</strong><br>
                                    Earthquakes have a high level of mortality as victims tend to be crushed by falling objects. The risk of injury is greatest inside or near dwellings but is very small in the open field. Also, earthquakes, which take place at night are more deadly with larger numbers of injuries such as fractures to the pelvis, thorax and spine. This is because most people are caught sleeping and are oblivious of what is going on. Earthquakes that take place during the day tend to cause injuries of the limbs, collarbone and skull as the victims attempt to flee from collapsing buildings.

                                    <strong>Fire & Explosions</strong><br>
                                    Disasters which involve fire, such as explosions or electrical malfunctions tend to cause varying degrees of burns in the victims. The victims may also suffer from suffocation due to smoke inhalation or air pollution as in the case of volcanic eruptions. For example, in 1985 23,000 people died in Colombia following volcanic eruptions which were accompanied by mudslides and glowing clouds.

                                    More recently you have heard of the "tsunami" tidal wave which killed thousands of people in Indonesia and left many others homeless. The survivors were suffering from varying degrees of bruising, fractures and hypothermia. Although cyclones and hurricanes do not cause high mortality rates like tidal waves, they cause houses to collapse and carry objects in the wind which can cause injuries like fractures, cuts and bruises on the victims they strike.

                                    <strong>Drought & War</strong><br>
                                    Drought causes famine that leads to malnutrition, for example, protein calorie malnutrition, kwashiorkor, marasmus and vitamin A deficiency or xerophthalmia. War can result into either internal or external displacement of people.

Dealing with some of these disasters has at times required major national and international response and recovery operations.</p>

                            <h3 id="development-impact">How do Disasters Affect the Development of an Area?</h3>
                            <p>Disasters throw everybody and everything in disarray both at individual, family or community levels. There is loss of life, property and infrastructure. All these cause delay and retardation of development in the area. However life must go on, and so people need to be mobilised to rescue, recover, readjust and reconstruct. In some instances people must start from zero.</p>
                            <p>There are many lessons which can be learned after a disaster, which if properly used may reduce the impact of damage should the disaster strike again, or prevent the disaster altogether.</p>

                            <h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned from Disasters in Kenya</h3>
                            <p>Following disasters which have taken place in Kenya several committees have met and discussed information gathered and lessons learned. They have come up with the following recommendations:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>That disaster management must include all key actors in a multi-agency and intersectoral approach.</li>
                                <li>There is need for effective early warning and quick dissemination of information to all actors. A combined effort helps to utilise resources and is more cost effective.</li>
                                <li>The disaster management system needs long term funding. This is a state of preparedness for any eventuality.</li>
                                <li>The disaster management system needs flexible budgeting and rapid financial disbursement procedures. You need to harness the good will of communities to be responsive to your call when in need.</li>
                                <li>The system must facilitate community participation. In the absence of finances the community might be in a position to provide aid in other forms. It is good to have this on record so that they can be called upon when need arises.</li>
                                <li>The system must be able to collect, document and disseminate information and undertake research.</li>
                                <li>The system must emphasise public education and awareness on disaster management.</li>
                                <li>That the government should set aside funds to cater for disaster management.</li>
                                <li>That a policy should be formulated to specifically address disaster issues in consultation with experts from within and without.</li>

                            <p>In view of the experiences gained and lessons learned during management of various disasters, the government has committed itself and formulated a policy that emphasises proactive and preventive strategies in addressing disaster situations.</p>
                            <p>The policy outlines the need to reduce exposure of vulnerable communities to risk and promote a sustainable disaster management system. The policy also outlines the goals, objectives and guidelines for disaster management.</p>

                            <h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
                            <p>To establish and maintain an efficient, flexible and coordinated system for managing disasters, in order to minimise losses and resulting disruptions on the population, economy and environment.</p>

                            <h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
                            <p>The specific objectives to be met by Kenya are as follows:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>To establish an institutional framework that will manage disasters</li>
                                <li>To ensure that institutions involved in disaster management are well coordinated and focused on both risks and vulnerability reduction</li>
                                <li>To promote the linkages between disaster management and development planning</li>
                                <li>To foster partnerships, between the government and stakeholders at all levels, including regional and international bodies</li>
                                <li>To promote programmes and strategies that reduce the vulnerability of Kenyans to hazards</li>
                                <li>To provide adequate and specific funds for disaster management</li>
                                <li>To mobilise adequate resources to ensure effective implementation of the policy, subsequent strategies and programmes.</li>
                                <li>To promote disaster management culture, training, research, information dissemination, community awareness and preparedness.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Although these are broad objectives for the entire country, they can guide you to plan disaster management strategies at the community level. Various countries today have set up systems for protecting the civilian population in the event of disasters. Since the August 7th 1998 bomb blast, Kenya has also embarked on organising such preparations. A National Disaster Management Authority (NADIMA) has been proposed.</p>

                            <h3 id="policy-elements">The Policy Elements</h3>
                            <p>There are four policy elements which underpin Kenya's disaster management policy. These are:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list feature-list">
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Prevention</strong><br>
                                    This element focuses on measures aimed at preventing the occurrence of a disaster and minimising its harmful effects on the community, property and the environment.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Mitigation</strong><br>
                                    Mitigation is increasing the population's ability to cope with disaster most likely to affect them. Why do you think it is important to increase a community's ability to respond to disaster? This is because in a well organised community, it is easier for you to improve the quality of outside assistance and reduce the shortcomings that often occur during disaster.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Preparedness</strong><br>
                                    Preparedness can be defined as the readiness to take action, before, during and after a disaster. To be prepared therefore means to take precautionary measures before an imminent threat or disaster takes place and to help people and institutions respond to and cope with the effects. Disaster preparedness also means improving the quality and effectiveness of the existing community services in order to cope with any eventualities.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Response and Recovery</strong><br>
                                    In the event of a disaster, the government, community and other partners will direct resources towards saving lives, property and environment. The government in collaboration with development partners will put in place mechanisms to ensure fast recovery and reconstruction after a disaster.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 id="mitigation-details">Components of Mitigation</h4>
                            <p>Information systems, risk information, vulnerability analysis, early warning system, advocacy and public awareness, training, resource inventory, public safety and research and development are issues that must be singly addressed under mitigation</p>
                            
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Information Systems:</strong> The National Disaster Management Authority should generate and collate early warning information from relevant ministries and other sources. This information should be disseminated to users in the government's disaster management network and external networks, right down to the communities.</li>
                                <li><strong>Risk Information:</strong> A disaster management system should be established at all levels to coordinate the collection, collation, analysis and dissemination of risk information.</li>
                                <li><strong>Vulnerability Analysis:</strong> This links directly to mitigation activities and provides the context of understanding the effect of any hazard on the population, property and the environment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Early Warning System:</strong> Provides early warning information on impending disasters and helps to plan for preparedness and response activities. The policy encourages involvement of all stakeholders with regards to information provision, analysis and decision-making.</li>
                                <li><strong>Advocacy and Public Awareness:</strong> This should be undertaken to sensitise the population on the policy and increase people's understanding of the disasters they are likely to face. The policy supports the development of community based disaster initiatives.</li>
                                <li><strong>Training:</strong> For effective disaster management and sustainability of programmes capacity building and training in disaster management will be emphasised. The training includes all people of a community making use of their respective areas of specialisation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Resource Inventory:</strong> In order to increase the capacity to respond quickly to disasters, a comprehensive and all inclusive resource inventory will be established. The government is prepared to fund research whose findings will be disseminated to users for decision-making and utilised in the development planning process.</li>
                                <li><strong>Public Safety:</strong> The promotion of public safety must be given priority. The government will ensure adherence to professional and safety standards and ethics.</li>
                                <li><strong>Research and Development:</strong> Research will be funded and findings will be disseminated to users for decision making and utilised in development and planning process.</li>

                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>While going through the various units of this module, you should note that one of your responsibilities is not only to identify problems and create awareness about them, but also to promote community based primary health care, health education, immunisation and environmental improvement.</p>
                            <p>You are probably asking yourself the question "How are these related to the prevention or mitigation of disasters?" You will now look at this relationship.</p>

                            <h3 id="community-based-primary-health-care">Community Based Primary Health Care</h3>
                            <p>You can encourage your community to set up disaster management support structures within the existing primary health care system. You can adopt a multi-disciplinary approach in which you enlist resource persons from the community or what is referred to as Community Own Resource Persons (CORPS).</p>
                            <p>Why Should You Use a Multidisciplinary Approach? This is because each member brings along their specialised skills to mobilise community interest. These people can be called upon in the event of a disease outbreak, floods or other disaster.</p>
                            <p>Once you identify CORPS you need to obtain a consensus of opinion. This is very important so that you can harness the community's commitment to the proposed action.</p>
                            <p>As a supervisor and technical expert you should respect their views in order to woo them to respect your scientific input. This will enhance their participation in the recommendations which you have collectively made.</p>

                            <h3 id="health-education">Health Education</h3>
                            <p>You should motivate and educate community members to adopt and sustain habits that reduce the risk of diseases and accidents. Your health education should lay more emphasis on problem solving or action oriented efforts. You can help them to identify potential disasters that could happen and ask them to suggest how they can be managed and prevented. Remember to explain to them in simple ordinary terms and encourage them to share the information with others</p>

                            <h3 id="immunisation">Immunisation</h3>
                            <p>From your past experience you will agree that respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality in children. There are effective vaccines against the nine childhood immunisable diseases that manifest with respiratory and diarrhoeal disease complications.</p>
                            <p>The nine preventable and immunisable childhood diseases include: poliomyelitis, mumps, diphtheria, tuberculosis, pertusis, measles, haemophilus influenza type b, hepatitis b and tetanus.</p>
                            <p>There are others that often flare up when the general body resistance is low or at times of disaster when hygiene becomes poor. They include typhoid fever, yellow fever, and influenza. Since in most cases only a small number of susceptible children are adequately immunised, there is always a danger of epidemics occurring from such infections. You should, therefore, work towards having high immunisation coverage in order to help the communities mitigate the effects of epidemics.</p>

                            <h3 id="environmental-improvement">Environmental Improvement</h3>
                            <p>There are many improvements that a community can make to their environment in order to mitigate the effects of a disaster. These include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Housing improvement</li>
                                <li>Good latrine construction</li>
                                <li>Protection of springs</li>
                                <li>Improvement of food storage</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You have already covered how these can be improved in earlier units of this module. However, in the context of disaster management, housing improvement is important in areas which are prone to landslides and earthquakes. You should point out that a permanent wall and floor helps to prevent the building from collapsing easily and reduces leakages and vermin. Construction and use of latrines is also important to curb disease outbreaks which are caused by poor excreta disposal.</p>
                            <p>How about improvement of food storage? You will have heard about the aflatoxin food poisoning that keeps recurring in the eastern province of Kenya due to poor storage of maize after harvest. As a community health nurse, you can team up with other experts to teach the community simple and affordable technologies which can help them prevent such disasters from taking place.</p>

                            <p>What is the usual reaction in the event of a catastrophe? What psychological and emotional reactions occur in people?</p>
                            <p>When disaster strikes, the public reacts with terror and panic. Everybody is terrified and fearful for their safety and that of their family and friends. People tend to help themselves to safety before external help arrives. Panic is most common in crowded places, especially where there are no obvious exit points. Depending on the type of disaster at hand, some people may be buried in debris, as happened during the 1998 bomb blast, or cut off by floods.</p>
                            <p>After a disaster how would you decide which victims need urgent medical attention? When disasters happen the health facilities tend to be overwhelmed by casualties. It is easy to get confused and wonder who to attend to and who to keep waiting. Yet it is very important for you to make the right judgment in order to save lives. Fortunately, there is a process that is used to help in this. It is known as Triaging.</p>

                            <h3 id="concept-of-triaging">Concept of Triaging</h3>
                            <p>Triaging is a French term, coined into an English word. It originated from the army where injured soldiers were evacuated and methodically aligned for treatment.</p>
                            <p>Triaging is the evaluation and classification of casualties for purposes of treatment and evacuation, so as to carry out resuscitation, emergency surgery or futility surgery (radical amputation) because of the severe results (intrinsic lethality) of the wounds. This means that through triaging you can establish priorities for treatment and evacuation during a disaster.</p>
                            <p>Triaging used to be a doctor's domain. However, due to advances in the nursing profession and the gradual expansion of our roles to provision of expert care, today more and more nurses have acquired triaging skills.</p>
                            <p>In any emergency situation, patients/victims/casualties are suddenly introduced into the emergency care system. You now have regular patients as well as victims of the disaster competing for your attention. Some of the regular cases may also be of an urgent nature. In order to manage this "chaos", you have to quickly create an organised flow of receiving and handling regular patients as well as emergency casualties. Often, the regular patients who do not have medical emergencies usually comply when asked nicely to leave so that you can attend to the emergency cases.</p>

Although you are expected to be fast, you must be thorough while at the same time you strive to avoid creating a backlog of unserved patients in the waiting area. For a minimum assessment, you must at least do the following:</p>

                            <p>Documentation in triaging is very important. Indeed if it is done carelessly it can even change your fate as a professional overnight! You should organise the record sheet/form such that there is space for triage notes in a conspicuous place. Remember that the time spent on important paper work can deny the patients precious time to be triaged. Even their relatives and friends get concerned if the patient stays too long in the triaging area before any treatment is started. You should therefore arrange to speed up this process because early documentation reduces time spent on diagnosis, treatment and discharge.</p>
                            <p>Triage notes provide baseline data for the clinician who may care for the patient. Important decisions are based on this information. That is why you must ensure that they are factual, honest and informative.</p>

                            <p>Recovery from a disaster depends on the situation that existed before the disaster occurred. If before the disaster the health status of the community was low, then it will need massive assistance to recover from the disaster.</p>

                            <h3 id="post-disaster">Post Disaster Health Problems</h3>
                            <p>Immediately after a disaster, it is important to take stock of what is available and reusable. Often people want to re-establish themselves as soon as possible and continue with activities of daily living. However, some very specific health problems may arise following the disaster. These are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Complications arising from injuries sustained during the disaster</li>
                                <li>Prevalence of poor sanitary and living conditions</li>
                                <li>Outbreak of diseases or spread of old ones that were already there</li>
                                <li>Psychological suffering (post trauma syndrome) that befalls the members of the community due to incurred losses and suffering</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>As a health worker you need to organise yourself urgently and rally up the available community groups and external agencies to help the community recuperate. Using your knowledge of the community as explained earlier you will be very resourceful in providing relevant information to guide the external agencies like Red Cross, Red Crescent, Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF), African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF), Catholic Relief Services (CRS), among others in settling the community.</p>

                            <h3 id="resumption-health-care">Activities Connected with Resumption of Health Care</h3>
                            <p>There are a number of activities which are related to resumption of health care during disaster recovery. These are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Reopening of health facilities for relative care</li>
                                <li>Health education</li>
                                <li>Instituting disease monitoring systems</li>
                                <li>Conducting a survey to establish baselines for operation</li>
                                <li>Resumption of previous health programmes in the community, that is, MCH/FP and so on</li>
                                <li>Setting up an office and activities for post trauma syndrome</li>
                                <li>Re-establishing CORPS (Community Own Resource Persons) for coordination and consultation</li>
                                <li>Drawing an inventory of required materials and supplies</li>
                                <li>Liaising with hospitals for onward referral of needy victims for specialised care</li>
                                <li>Re-establishing means of communication</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 id="health-monitoring">Monitoring the Health Status of the Community</h3>
                            <p>Your team of CORPS is very useful in collecting useful data concerning the health status of individuals and other health issues impinging on families. They are well placed to conduct education activities, assist in food resource distribution, and so on. It is extremely important to contain negative propaganda in order to control a situation and avoid panic.</p>

                            <h4 id="vaccination">Vaccination</h4>
                            <p>It is extremely important to strengthen the existing routine vaccination practice instead of launching a new campaign.</p>

                            <h4 id="nutrition-monitoring">Nutrition</h4>
                            <p>If previously the nutritional status of the community was satisfactory there should be no alarm during famine. What you should do with the help of agricultural extension staff is to assess the damage to stores of food supplies and take the necessary measures. During famine, the following groups are most likely to suffer more than anybody else and therefore require special attention. These are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list compact">
                                <li>Infants</li>
                                <li>Children</li>
                                <li>Expectant and lactating mothers</li>
                                <li>Those who are chronically sick</li>
                                <li>Elderly</li>
                                <li>The disabled</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 id="health-ed-recovery">Health Education</h4>
                            <p>This is extremely important especially in conditions where people are living in makeshift temporary shelters. The following is a list of useful topics to include in your health education talks:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>Cleanliness of the temporary dwellings</li>
                                <li>Proper waste disposal</li>
                                <li>Cleanliness and protection of drinking water and proper disposal of waste water</li>
                                <li>Control of parasites and pests</li>
                                <li>Control of vectors such as flies, mosquitoes</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h4>
                            <p>At the beginning of this section you covered the fact that when disaster strikes, people tend to react with panic, fear, daze and confusion. This is often followed by the urge to act spontaneously in rescue work. It is like the individuals' psychological barriers and defences disappear and are replaced by spontaneous solidarity and an outpouring of emotions. This is a useful reaction because it helps people to "cope" with the situation. Unfortunately, once the adrenaline goes down, this may be followed by depression, lack of confidence, fatigue and passivity. Some people are overcome with fear of the hard times ahead, their losses and fear of favouritism or preferential treatment during relief supplies.</p>
                            <p>When confronted by this situation, the local health personnel must try to maintain and strengthen all the initiatives taken by the community. Experiments conducted in the past after disasters have shown that community action influences the state of mind of the population. It also represents an effective means of preventing and controlling reactions of disquiet and depression.</p>
