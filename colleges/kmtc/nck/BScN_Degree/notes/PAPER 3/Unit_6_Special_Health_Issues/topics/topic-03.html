                            <p>When a child reaches school going age, it is necessary that, the health care that was provided when they were under five years is continued.</p>

                            <p>A school health programme is an integral part of community health. A school health approach is advocated in the provision of health services as school children are easy to reach, they also disseminate health messages to the larger population.</p>

                                    <strong>A Stable Home</strong><br>
                                    The home should provide basic needs especially shelter and security.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Proper Nutrition</strong><br>
                                    The child needs to grow well physically and mentally. It is therefore important for the child to take adequate nutrition at least three times a day. The diet should have extra proteins and vitamins to meet there nutritional needs. This will help the child to cope with demands of school life. The meals may be provided at home, school, or may be packed.
                                </li>

                                    The child needs to have enough rest at home from school activities. The evening meal should be taken early so that the child will have enough sleep and rest.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    This is normally provided as school uniform, which should be clean and tidy. The child needs to wear shoes to prevent injuries and hookworm infestation.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Good Sight, Hearing and Speech</strong><br>
                                    Defects of sight, hearing and speech interfere with the learning process of a child. Early detection of all disabilities and referral to appropriate specialist is a very important activity of a school health programme.
                                </li>

                                    All school children should be immunised against childhood diseases. Treatment of common conditions, for example colds, skin rashes, sore throat and cuts should also be given. The treatment could take place in the school clinic or in the local health care facility.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    This should be provided in the school and at home to prevent water related diseases. Adequate sanitation, proper excreta and refuse disposal is important at home and in school.
                                </li>

                                    Clinic records from the health care facility near the school. This will provide information about the health problems that are commonly seen among school children who attend the centre.

                                    You can hold discussions with the health care teams in your catchment area, to find out health problems of school children and their possible solutions.

                                    Discussions with teachers, students and parents will yield useful information about their problems, and will also give you a chance to explain the importance of school health services.

                                    You can gather a lot of information merely by observing and listening to people, as you make contact and interact with them.

                                    Village leaders usually have a repertoire about the most disturbing health care problems, and can assist you to plan school health services.

                            <p>Once you gather the information regarding the health needs of school children in your catchment area, you then need to discuss your findings, and plan your programme with stakeholders from the Ministry of Health.</p>

                            <p>Implementing a school health programme requires quite a lot of resources. You will require funds for equipment, drugs, supplies, fuel and staff. You will also need cooperation from your team members. It is therefore very important for you to carefully identify each member of the team, and discuss with them their roles during the school health services.</p>
                            <p>Like all good programmes, you will require some resources to implement a school health programme. What resources do you think you would you require?</p>

                                    <strong>Money</strong><br>
                                    Funding for school health programmes mainly is the responsibility of the government. Stakeholders also give financial support to the government through procurement of equipment, drugs and supplies, vehicles, training of personnel, supporting advocacy, meetings and development of policies, guidelines and standards.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Manpower</strong><br>
                                    Personnel from the ministry of health and education need to be trained on relevant issues for the implementation process. More human resources can also be sourced from the community by training the community leaders, and the communities own resource personnel to ensure support and sustainability of the programme.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Materials</strong><br>
                                    Policies, guidelines and training materials, drugs, vaccines, supplies and transport.
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Time</strong><br>
                                    Time is required for the planning, implementing and evaluating. The time for the programmes should not interfere with school activities, and should be convenient for both the implementers and the beneficiaries. There should be sufficient time for the implementation process.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>During the planning phase you also need to consider the following supporting activities.</p>
                            
                            <h4 id="partnerships">Effective Partnerships</h4>
                            <p>The success of school health programmes demands an effective partnership between teachers and health workers, and between the education and health sectors.</p>
                            <p>The health sector retains the responsibility for the health of children, but the education sector is responsible for implementing, and often funding the school based programmes. These sectors need to identify responsibilities and present a coordinated action, to improve health and learning outcomes from children.</p>

                            <h4 id="pupil-participation">Pupil Awareness and Participation</h4>
                            <p>Children must be important participants in all aspects of school health programmes, and not simply the beneficiaries.</p>
                            <p>Children should participate in health policy development and implementation efforts, to create a safer and more sanitary environment.</p>
                            <p>Health promotion aimed at their parents, other children, community members is taught during school health services. Children in turn disseminate. This is an effective way to help young people and the community acquire the knowledge, attitudes, values and skills needed to adopt healthy lifestyles, and to support health and education for all.</p>

This examination should be done systematically from head to toe for every child. A cumulative record of a child's history, medical examination and immunisations should be kept for each child.</p>
