# Content Integration Report: Nursing Research
**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Project:** BScN Degree Notes Integration
**Scope:** Integration of "Research Proposal/Report Nursing" (9 Modules) into Paper 4.

## Executive Summary
The existing Unit 3 (`03_Unit_3_Research`) consists of 7 topics. Your new content provides a 9-module structure that offers better depth in "Literature Review," "Methodology," and "Utilization." I recommend creating a unified directory to match this 9-module curriculum.

## 1. Mapping & Gap Analysis
| New Module | Existing Equivalent | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mod 1: Intro to Research** | `topic-01` | **Expand.** Focus on concepts and contributions. |
| **Mod 2: Fundamentals** | `topic-02` | **Expand.** Quantitative vs Qualitative and research paradigms. |
| **Mod 3: Planning/Formulation**| `topic-03` | **Expand.** Problem statement, objectives, and hypotheses. |
| **Mod 4: Literature Review** | `topic-04` (Partial) | **Create.** Dedicated focus on searching and synthesizing literature. |
| **Mod 5: Methodology** | `topic-04/05` | **Consolidate.** Design, population, sampling, and data collection. |
| **Mod 6: Proposal/Report Writing**| `topic-07` | **Expand.** Specific structure of the proposal vs the report. |
| **Mod 7: Data Analysis** | `topic-06` (Partial) | **Expand.** Statistics, coding, and presentation. |
| **Mod 8: Utilization** | `topic-06` (Partial) | **Create.** Dissemination and evidence-based practice (EBP). |
| **Mod 9: Research Reports** | `topic-06/07` | **Consolidate.** Formatting and final reporting standards. |

## 2. Integration Strategy
I recommend creating a **Unified Directory** for this 9-module curriculum to ensure linear study.

**Location:** `PAPER 4/Nursing_Research_Integrated/`

## 3. Implementation Plan
1.  **Create Directory:** `PAPER 4/Nursing_Research_Integrated/`
2.  **Scaffold Topics:** Create 9 topic files.
3.  **Create Dashboard:** A main `index.html`.
4.  **Quiz Hub:** Dedicated to research terminology and methodology.

**Next Step:** Proceed with scaffolding the 9 Research topics.
