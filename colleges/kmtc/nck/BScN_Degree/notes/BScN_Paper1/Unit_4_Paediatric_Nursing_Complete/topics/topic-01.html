                            <p>Paediatric nursing is concerned with the health of infants, children and adolescents, their growth and development and their opportunity to achieve full potential as adults.</p>
                            
                            <p>In order to provide quality nursing care you will have to acquire knowledge in child health, growth and development. This will assist you to identify any deviations from the normal and to take appropriate corrective measures. As far as is practically possible, sick children should be nursed in their own home environments, among people they are used to. This is necessary because hospitalisation and separation of children from their parents or guardians can have serious psychological effects hence worsening their health.</p>
                            
                            <p>Whether the care of children is given in hospital, home or the community, it is paramount that the paediatric nurse and the parents or guardians work in harmony in order to achieve set objectives for the benefit of the child's well being.</p>

                            <h3>Growth</h3>
                            <p>Growth implies a change in quantity. Human growth can be defined as a change in body structure. The changes are both in height and size. They are influenced by various factors, which will be covered later.</p>

                            <h3>Development</h3>
                            <p>Development is a physiological process, which occurs in children right from conception until puberty. It involves a qualitative change in this case from a lower to a more advanced stage of complexity. This process is also influenced by a number of factors.</p>

                            <h3>Rate of Development</h3>
                            <p>During the foetal period the child's growth rate is rather rapid if it is well supplied with the essential requirements through its mother's placenta. At the infantile stage, up to 18 months of age, growth is similarly rapid, provided the child's health is maintained and the essential requirements are given.</p>
                            <p>During the childhood phase, growth tends to slow down and the process is prolonged. The child's height gradually increases under the influence of hormones. This also plays a part in the psychosocial development of the child. When the child reaches puberty, the sex hormones facilitate the individual's physical, psychological and emotional development.</p>

                            <p>The health of a growing child can be sustained to an acceptable standard when various activities are readily available. The nursing mother and her child should have a well balanced diet rich in proteins, vitamins, iron and calcium for proper growth of the child. In addition, the child requires enough rest, sleep, play, love, recognition and a certain amount of independence. You should explain these in details to the mother during your health education sessions.</p>

                            <h3>Health Promotion in Paediatric Nursing</h3>
                            <p>In order to give holistic care to children under your jurisdiction, you should remember that your role goes beyond nursing. You should operate as health educator, patients' advocate and a counsellor both in the hospital and in the community for the well being of the child.</p>
