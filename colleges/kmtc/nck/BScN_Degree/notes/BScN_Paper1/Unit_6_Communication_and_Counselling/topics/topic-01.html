                            <h3>Formal Communication</h3>
                            <p>Formal communication is any official method of communicating with people (employees) in an organisation. The communication may be passed orally or in written form. The message flows from top to bottom, for example, from the top management to staff at the lower levels, following the hierarchy or chain of command in the particular organisation.</p>
                            <p>Formal communication mainly involves giving instructions to be followed and clarifying the roles of staff in the organisations. It also emphasises the use of available resources to achieve the desired goals. Formal communication flows in three directions, namely:</p>

                            <h4>Downward Communication</h4>
                            <p>This is where the communication flow comes from top management to the lowest level. The communication channels used include oral messages, telephone calls, written communication in the form of circular letters, memoranda, pamphlets or posters.</p>
                            <p>The main advantage of downward communication is that it is received immediately and is not distorted. For example, the district public health nurse may request the nurse working in a health centre to submit a written report on a monthly basis to their office.</p>
                            <p>The main disadvantage of downward communication is that it is unidirectional, that is, there is no return path for communication, this delays feedback. For example, a nurse in charge of a unit may decide to keep a recommendation report for promotion in the file and delay sending it to the Public Service Commission for approval. Downward communication within the Ministry of Health is illustrated in the diagram below.</p>

                            <h4>Upward Communication</h4>
                            <p>This type of communication flows from staff at lower and middle levels to the top management. This provides feedback regarding organisational progress, a consultative forum to improve the quality of service and a means for staff to request clarification of goals and/or additional resources. Practically, however, this very rarely happens and it is important to encourage staff at lower levels to participate.</p>
                            <p>The main advantage of this type of communication is that it helps to maintain the discipline of staff at lower levels. It also protects the seniority of staff at the middle levels.</p>
                            <p>The main disadvantage is that the middle level staff management may refuse to forward the grievances coming from the lower level staff. For example, a sister in charge of a ward may refuse to pass information from junior nurses to the matron in charge of the hospital.</p>

                            <h4>Horizontal Communication</h4>
                            <p>In horizontal communication the communication flow occurs between heads of departments or supervisors who are at the same level. The nurses in-charge of medical and surgical departments/wards consult one another. The supervisors at the same level exchange ideas on common goals in order to improve the quality of patient care. The supervisors may discuss the common problems affecting their departments with a view of getting solutions to recommend to the top management for approval.</p>
                            <p>Horizontal communication also occurs at the health centre and dispensary levels when the staff consult one another. The main advantages of this type of communication are that it encourages free communication by all staff in the departments all the time and ensures that staff do not fear each other, thus improving interpersonal relationships.</p>

                            <h3>Informal Communication</h3>
                            <p>Informal communication is an unofficial form of communication between groups of people in the organisation. The messages are discussed casually and are not recognised by the management. Informal communication is also known as the <strong>'grapevine'</strong>.</p>
                            <p>The grapevine is a form of information containing some half-truths and may emanate from the staff at the lower or middle levels in the organisation. The grapevine is common in organisations where a certain cadre of staff feels that their needs are not being addressed or where top management fails to clarify issues or communicate effectively with the middle and lower level staff. The grapevine should not be ignored because it gives a warning of impending issues of concern to the employees. The top management should provide current information to minimise grapevine rumours. Grapevine communication also gives a chance to the colleagues to express their views.</p>

                            <h3>Unconscious Communication</h3>
                            <p>Unconscious communication is where a wrong meaning has been transferred because of the way the communication has been conveyed unconsciously to the receiver. Usually the sender of the message is unaware that their behaviour is sending the wrong signals. For example, if you appear quite casual when giving important information, the recipient will misinterpret the importance of the information because of the manner in which you speak. Therefore, it is important for health workers to be aware of unconscious communication.</p>
