                            <p>In your practice, you might have experienced a situation where the life of a patient was lost but could have been saved had the situation been handled with a different approach. It is, therefore, important for you to learn the approaches that would increase patient survival rates by improving the care you give to support a failing biological system.</p>

                                    <p>The Oxford Pocket Dictionary defines the word critical as 'at a crisis'. The word 'crisis' is defined in the Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary as: 'The turning point of a disease for better or worse, especially a sudden change'.</p>
                                    <p>It follows, therefore, that <strong>critical care nursing</strong> can be defined as the nursing care given to a patient whose health is in danger or in a crisis, so as to save their life or prevent complications.</p>

                            <p>The main purpose of critical care nursing is to maintain accurate continuous observations of the patient's vital functions and to treat or support a failing or failed biological system. It focuses on the whole body system so as to maintain health.</p>

                            <p>During your practice as a nurse you will have come across a patient whose condition you would have classified as critical. Before you proceed, reflect on why you classified that patient as critical.</p>
                            
                            <p>It is possible you may have based your judgment on the following observations:</p>

                            <p>Going by this approach, a critically ill patient is one whose physical condition, physiological and psychological state poses an immediate threat to their life.</p>
                            
                            <p>By now you must have realised that critically ill patients need total and specialised nursing care. This care is usually provided in special facilities. However, one fact that you as a health worker must bear in mind, is that their survival rate will highly depend on your quick and accurate intervention.</p>

                            <p>Actually, all of these factors are important. For example, the location must allow easy access to continuous monitoring of patients by the health team. Patients who are nursed here require life support equipment and continuous monitoring or observation. Hence this room must be located closer to the nursing station than others.</p>
