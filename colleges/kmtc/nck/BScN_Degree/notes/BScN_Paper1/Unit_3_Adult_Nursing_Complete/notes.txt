# TO-DO LIST: Med-Surg & Gerontology Expansion
Location: BScN_Paper1/Unit_3_Adult_Nursing_Complete/

1. ENRICH SYSTEM TOPICS:
   Use your detailed Med-Surg notes to expand Topics 01-08 (CVS, Respiratory, GI, etc.).
   The existing notes are good but your new content adds better clinical depth.

2. GERONTOLOGY (Topic 09):
   Populate the new topic-09-gerontological-nursing.html with your geriatric care notes.

3. LAB VALUES QUIZ:
   Create a specific quiz file (e.g., quizzes/lab-values.js) and link it in the Quiz Hub.
   This is a highly requested feature for clinical prep.
