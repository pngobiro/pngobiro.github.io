                        <p>In a normal vaginal delivery, the foetus must pass through the bony canal formed by the pelvic bones. The foetal skull is the most rigid structure that has to pass through this canal. You should therefore know the limits of a normal female pelvis so that you can detect deviations from the normal. By so doing, you will be able to identify women at risk and refer them to a hospital, where a caesarean section can be performed.</p>
                        <p>While learning obstetric anatomy, you will also look at parts of the female pelvis and the foetal skull.</p>

                        <h3>The Bony Pelvis</h3>
                        <p>The shape of a normal female pelvis is cylindrical and has a slight anterior curve near the outlet. The curve results from the fact that the posterior body of the pelvis sacrum and coccyx is longer than the anterior border which is the symphysis pubis.</p>
                        <p>In order for the foetal head to pass through the maternal pelvis, the diameter of the pelvis at the inlet, outlet and mid-cavity levels must be adequate.</p>

                        <p>As you can see from the illustration, the bony female pelvis is a basin-like structure with a hole at the bottom through which the baby passes. It is made up of four bones, namely: two innominate bones, one sacrum and one coccyx</p>

                        <h3>The Innominate Bones</h3>
                        <p>These form the sides of the basin. They are joined together at the front by the symphysis pubis and are separated at the back by the sacrum. Each innominate bone is composed of three parts: the ilium, the ischium and the pubic bone.</p>

                        <h3>The Three Parts of the Innominate Bones</h3>

                        <h4>The Ilium</h4>
                        <p>The ilium is large and flares out. The upper border is called the iliac crest. The anterior superior iliac spine is a bony prominence that is at the front of the iliac crest, and below it is the anterior inferior iliac spine. At the end of the iliac crest are the posterior-superior and posterior-inferior iliac spines. The iliac fossa is the concave anterior surface of the ilium.</p>

                        <h4>The Ischium</h4>
                        <p>This is the thick lower part of the innominate bone. When sitting, the body rests on its large prominence, that is, the ischial tuberosity. The ischial spine lies behind the ischial tuberosity.</p>

                        <h4>The Pubic Bones</h4>
                        <p>These form the anterior part of the innominate bone. They have a body and two projections: the superior ramus and the inferior ramus. The two pubic bones meet at the symphysis pubis and the two inferior rami form the pubic arch.</p>

                        <h4>The Sacrum</h4>
                        <p>The sacrum is a wedge shaped bone consisting of five fused vertebrae. The upper border of the first sacral vertebra juts forward and is known as the sacral promontory. The anterior surface of the sacrum is concave and is known as the hollow of the sacrum.</p>

                        <h4>The Coccyx</h4>
                        <p>The coccyx is the tailbone. It consists of four fused vertebrae and is the lowest part of the vertebral column. It has no significance in applied obstetric anatomy as it moves out of the way during delivery.</p>

                        <h4>Pelvic Joints</h4>
                        <p>There are four pelvic joints, namely:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="list-content">The symphysis pubis which is formed at the junction of the two pelvic bones, which are united by a pad of cartilage.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content">Two sacroiliac joints which join the sacrum to the ilium and so connect the spine to the pelvis.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content">The sacrococcygeal joint that is formed where the base of the coccyx articulates with the tip of the sacrum.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="content-figure" data-lightbox="true">
                            <div class="figure-image-wrapper">
                                <img src="../assets/images/image-20260111-af828bbb.jpeg" alt="Pelvic Joints" class="figure-image">
                                <div class="figure-overlay">

                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>When there is no pregnancy, there is very little movement in these joints. However, during pregnancy due to endocrine activity the ligaments soften, allowing the joints to give. This allows for more room for the foetal head as it passes through the pelvis. The sacroiliac joints allow a limited backward and forward movement of the tip of the promontory of the sacrum.</p>
                        <p>The sacrococcygeal joint allows the coccyx to be deflected backward during the birth of the head.</p>

                        <h4>The Pelvic Ligaments</h4>
                        <p>Ligaments hold each pelvic joint together. These are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        </ul>
                        <p>There are two more ligaments that are also important in midwifery, namely:</p>

                        <p>Also referred to as the true female pelvis, the gynaecoid pelvis has the following features:</p>

                        <h3>The Android Pelvis</h3>
                        <p>The android pelvis is also known as the male pelvis. Its brim is heart-shaped with a narrow fore-pelvis. The pelvic cavity is funnel-shaped. The ischial spines are prominent and the pubic arch is less than 90°. It is mostly found in short and heavily built women. It predisposes to an occipital posterior position of the foetal head. It is the least suited to childbearing.</p>

                        <h3>The Anthropoid Pelvis</h3>
                        <p>The anthropoid pelvis has a long oval brim, in which the anteroposterior diameter is longer than the transverse. The sides diverge and the sacrum is long and deeply concave. The ischial spines are not prominent and the sciatic notch is very wide and so is the sub-pubic angle. It tends to be found in tall women with narrow shoulders. Labour usually does not present any difficulties, but a direct occipito-anterior or occipito-posterior position is often a feature.</p>

                        <p>As illustrated below, the Platypelloid pelvis is a flat pelvis, with a kidney shaped brim. The antero-posterior diameter is reduced while the transverse is increased. The sidewalls diverge, the sacrum is flat, and the cavity is shallow.</p>
                        <p>The ischial spines are blunt. The sciatic notch and sub-pubic angle are both wide. The foetal head usually descends through the cavity without difficulty.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The true pelvis is the body canal through which the foetus must pass during birth. It has a brim, a cavity and an outlet.</p>

                        <h3>The Pelvic Brim</h3>
                        <p>The pelvic brim, which is also known as the inlet, is surrounded anteriorly by the symphysis pubis, laterally by the iliac bones and to the posterior by the sacral promontory. The sacral promontory projects into the brim. This tends to make the anteroposterior diameter less than the transverse diameter, thus forcing the oval head of the foetus to engage the brim in the more accommodating transverse diameter.</p>
                        <p>As a reproductive health nurse, you need to be familiar with the fixed points on the pelvic brim, which are known as its landmarks.</p>
                        <p>Move on to learn more about these landmarks.</p>
                        <p>As illustrated opposite the landmarks commencing posteriorly are:</p>

                        <h3>The Anteroposterior Diameter</h3>
                        <p>This is measured from the upper border of the symphysis pubis to the sacral promontory. When measured to the uppermost point of the pubis, it is called the anatomical conjugate and measures 12 centimetres. When taken to the posterior border of the upper surface, which is about 1.25 centimetres lower, it is called the obstetrical conjugate and measures 11 centimetres.</p>
                        <p>The obstetrical conjugate represents the available space for the passage of the foetus. Both these diameters are sometimes referred to as the true conjugate.</p>

                        <h3>The Diagonal Conjugate</h3>
                        <p>This is measured from the lower border of the symphysis pubis to the sacral promontory. It measures 12 to 13 centimetres. It can be estimated per vaginum when conducting pelvic assessment.</p>

                        <h3>The Oblique Diameter</h3>
                        <p>This is measured from one sacro-iliac joint to the iliopectineal eminence on the opposite side of the pelvis.</p>
                        <p>It measures 12 centimetres. There are two oblique diameters, that is the, left oblique and right oblique.</p>

                        <h3>Transverse Diameter</h3>
                        <p>This is the line between the furthest points on the iliopectineal lines. It measures 13 centimetres. Another dimension is the sacrocotyloid which is between the sacral promontory and the iliopectineal eminence on each side.</p>
                        <p>It measures 9 to 9.5 centimetres. It is important because in posterior position of the occiput, the parietal eminencies of the foetal head may become caught there.</p>

                        <h4>The Pelvic Cavity</h4>
                        <p>The pelvic cavity, which is also known as the mid-cavity, is a forward curving canal that is bounded above by the plane of the pelvic brim, laterally by ischial spines, posteriorly by the forward curving sacrum and anteriorly by the ascending ramus of the ischium.</p>
                        <p>The anterior wall is only about 4 centimetres and the posterior wall is approximately 12 centimetres. The transverse diameter, which is 12.5 centimetres, is slightly narrower than the antero-posterior diameter, which is 13.5 centimetres. The oval head of the foetus therefore has to turn through 90° so that its long axis fits in this more accommodating antero-posterior diameter.</p>

                        <h4>The Pelvic Outlet</h4>
                        <p>The posterior outlet is bounded anteriorly by the pubic arch, laterally by the ischial tuberosities, posteriorly by the tip of the sacrum or coccyx and the ligament joining the ischial tuberosities to the sacrum, which are known as sacrotuberous ligaments.</p>
                        <p>There are two outlets that are described as:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content">The anatomical outlet, which is formed by the lower borders of each of the bones and the sacrotuberous ligaments.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content">The obstetrical outlet, which is of greater significance because it includes the narrow pelvic strait through which the foetus must pass. It is the space between the narrow pelvic strait and the anatomical outlet. The outlet is diamond-shaped and has three diameters.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now move on to look at the three diameters of the obstetrical outlet.</p>
                        <p>The anteroposterior diameter is from the lower border of the symphysis pubis to the sacrococcygeal joints and is 13 centimetres. It indicates the space available during delivery.</p>
                        <p>The oblique diameter lies between the obturator foramen and the sacrospinous ligament but there are no fixed points. It is 12 centimetres.</p>
                        <p>The transverse diameter lies between the two ischial spines and measures 10 to 11 centimetres.</p>

                            <h2 class="section-title">Pelvic Assessment</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>It is very important for you to understand how to assess the landmarks and measurements of the female pelvis. This is because it will help you to anticipate complications that may occur during delivery so that you can take the appropriate action to save the mother and child.</p>
                        <p>The adequacy of the pelvis can be judged clinically through a vaginal examination. Three diameters are measured:</p>

                        <h4>Anteroposterior Diameter</h4>
                        <p>During a vaginal examination, you can estimate the Antero-Posterior diameter (AP) of the pelvic inlet by palpating for the sacral promontory with the examining finger. Then you note where the lower margin of the symphysis pubis touches that finger. This gives the diagonal conjugate.</p>
                        <p>The true conjugate is the line from the sacral promontory to the upper border of the symphysis pubis. The true conjugate is derived by subtracting 1.5 from the diagonal conjugate.</p>

                        <h4>The Oblique Diameter</h4>
                        <p>This is the line from one sacroiliac joint to the iliopectineal eminence on the opposite side of the pelvis. It measures 12 centimetres. There are two oblique diameters, the left oblique and right oblique.</p>

                        <h4>Transverse Diameter</h4>
                        <p>The transverse diameter of the pelvic outlet is measured by placing a clenched fist between the two ischial tuberosities (see illustration below). A measurement of 8 centimetres or more suggests an adequate diameter, which is at least about four knuckles.</p>
                        <p>Another dimension is the sacrocotyloid dimension. It passes from the sacral promontory to the iliopectineal eminence on each side and measures 9 to 9.5 centimetres. It is important because in posterior position of the occiput, the parietal eminencies of the foetal head may be caught there.</p>

                        <h3>The Pelvic Floor</h3>
                        <p>The pelvic floor is formed by two muscle layers and layers of pelvic fascia. The most important of these is the strong diaphragm of muscles slung like a hammock from the walls of the pelvis. This pelvic diaphragm is made up of muscles and fascia, which unite in the midline. The muscles are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content">Levator ani, which are flat muscles that form a sling which supports the pelvic organs</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content">Coccygeus, which are triangular sheets of muscle and tendinous fibres situated behind the levator ani</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The pelvic floor supports the weight of the abdominal and pelvic organs. Its muscles are responsible for the voluntary control of micturition and defecation. They also play an important part in sexual intercourse. During childbirth, the pelvic floor influences the passive movement of the foetus through the birth canal and relaxes to allow its exit from the pelvis. In prolonged labour, it is strained and overstretched. This may lead to genital prolapse later.</p>
                        <p>Every pregnant woman needs to have an assessment of the pelvic capacity to determine pelvic adequacy for the passage of the child she is carrying.</p>
                        <p>It is important for you to understand the obstetric anatomy of the female pelvis. You will need this knowledge in order to understand and appreciate the mechanisms of labour, which will be covered later in unit three.</p>

                        <p>The foetal skull contains a delicate brain, which may be subjected to great pressures as the head passes through the birth canal.

                        <h3>The Foetal Skull - Moulding</h3>
                        <p>Moulding is the term applied to the alteration in the shape of the foetal head that takes place during its passage through the birth canal. This alteration is possible because the bones of the vault allow a slight degree of bending and the skull bones are able to override at the sutures.</p>
                        <p>The overriding allows a reduction in the size of the presenting diameters while the diameter at right angles to the presenting diameters is able to lengthen due to the give of the skull bones.</p>
