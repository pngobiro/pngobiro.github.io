                        <p>As you learnt in the introduction to reproductive health unit, the Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI) is designed to reduce the high numbers of deaths (maternal mortality) and illnesses (maternal morbidity) resulting from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. It is, therefore, important to study and understand the whole process of reproduction, that is, the anatomy and physiology of the human reproductive system.</p>
                        <p>A lot of the information you will find in this unit is not new to you as you studied it during your previous nursing training. However, it is important to go through everything once again as you will build on this knowledge in the subsequent sections of this unit.</p>

                            <h2 class="section-title">The Components of the Female Reproductive System</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>The female reproductive system consists of two parts: the external genitalia and the internal genitalia. You will study each part separately starting with the external genitalia.</p>

                        <h3>The External Genitalia (Vulva)</h3>
                        <p>The external genitalia is also known as the vulva. It is made up of all the external organs as shown in the illustration opposite. It extends from the mons veneris anteriorly, to the perineal body posteriorly.</p>

                        <div class="content-figure" data-lightbox="true">

                            <p class="figure-caption">The External Genitalia (Vulva)</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The following are parts of the external genitalia</p>

                        <h4>The Mons Veneris</h4>
                        <p>This is a pad of fat lying over the body of the pubic bone and is covered by skin on which hair grows from the time of puberty.</p>

                        <h4>The Labia Majora</h4>
                        <p>These are two thick folds of fatty and areola tissue covered by skin externally. They start in the Mons Veneris and merge into the Perineum posteriorly.</p>

                        <h4>The Labia Minora</h4>
                        <p>The labia minor are two small thin folds of skin lying between, and almost covered by the labia majora. They fuse posteriorly thus forming the fourchette.</p>

                        <h4>The Clitoris</h4>
                        <p>This is a highly sensitive erectile structure situated at the anterior junction of the Labia minora. It is the female equivalent of the male penis.</p>

                        <h4>The Urethral Meatus</h4>
                        <p>This is a small opening about 2.5 centimetres below the clitoris.</p>

                        <h4>The Vaginal Orifice</h4>
                        <p>This is also known as the introitus of the vagina. It lies between the labia minora and posteriorly to the urethra. It is partially occluded by the hymen in girls who have not been sexually active.</p>

                        <h4>The Hymen</h4>
                        <p>This is a thin membrane which partially shuts the introitus in the vagina.</p>

                        <h4>The Bartholin's Glands</h4>
                        <p>These are two small glands, one on either side of, and slightly posterior to the vagina, beneath the labia majora. Their ducts open into the vaginal orifice. They secrete mucus, which lubricates the vaginal orifice.</p>
                        <p>The vulva receives its blood supply from the internal and external pudendal arteries and which is then returned through the pudendal veins. The lymphatic drainage is via the inguinal glands, while the nerve supply is derived from the pudendal nerve</p>
                        <p>These parts make up the external genitalia. Now move on to look at the internal genitalia.</p>

                        <h3>The Vagina</h3>
                        <p>The vagina is a fibro-muscular canal joining the external genitalia and the uterus. The posterior wall of the vagina is longer than the anterior wall. This is because the cervix projects at right angle into the upper part of the anterior wall. Its walls are arranged in folds known as rugae, which allow the vagina to stretch during sexual intercourse and childbirth.</p>
                        <p>The vault is the upper end of the vagina, which forms four arches known as fornices. The posterior fornix is the largest.</p>
                        <p>The vagina has four layers, these are:</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Blood Supply - The blood supply comes from branches of the internal iliac artery, the vaginal artery and a branch of the uterine artery. The blood drains through the vaginal vein and a branch of the uterine artery. Lymphatic drainage is via the inguinal, the internal iliac and the sacral glands. Nerve supply is via the Lee Frankenhauser plexus.</p>
                        <p>In front of the vagina lies the bladder and the urethra, which are closely connected to the anterior wall. Behind the vagina are the pouch of Douglas, the rectum and the perineal body. Each of these occupies about one third of the posterior vaginal wall. The uterus lies above the vagina.</p>

                        <h3>The Uterus</h3>
                        <p>The non-pregnant uterus is a hollow pear-shaped muscular organ situated in the pelvic cavity. It is 7.5 centimetres long, 5 centimetres wide, 2.5 centimetres deep and 1.25 centimetres thick. It lies behind the bladder and in front of the rectum. It leans forward over the bladder, which is known as anteversion and bends forward the cervix at the level of the internal os, which is known as anteflexion. When a woman stands, the position becomes almost horizontal with the fundus, resting on the bladder.</p>
                        <p>The uterus performs the following functions among others:</p>

                        <p>The transverse cervical (also called cardinal ligaments) are the most important uterine support. They fan out from the sides of the cervix to the sidewalls of the pelvis to give lateral stability to the cervix. The utero-sacral ligaments pass backwards from the cervix to the sacrum. They maintain the body of the uterus in anteversion position.</p>
                        <p>The round ligaments arise at the cornua of the uterus and descend through the broad ligaments and inguinal canal to the labia majora. They hold the fundus forward in anteversion, especially when forces such as distension of the bladder tend to push the uterus back. The broad ligaments are folds of peritoneum over the fallopian tubes and do not support the uterus.</p>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>The Layers of the Uterus</h3>
                        <p>The uterus has three layers: the endometrium, the myometrium and the perimetrium.</p>

                        <h4>The Endometrium</h4>
                        <p>This is the inner lining of the uterus composed of ciliated epithelium (mucous membrane) on a connective tissue base and it changes in thickness during the menstrual cycle. The basal layer does not change. This will be discussed further under the menstrual cycle.</p>

                        <h4>The Myometrium (or Muscle Coat)</h4>
                        <p>This is the middle layer of the uterus. It is the thickest layer and is made up of three layers of muscle fibre. The fibres run in all directions and intermingle to surround the blood vessels and lymphatics.</p>

                        <h4>The Perimetrium</h4>
                        <p>This is a double serous membrane and extension of the peritoneum, which is draped over the uterus and uterine tubes.</p>

                        <h3>The Uterine Tubes (Fallopian Tubes)</h3>
                        <p>The fallopian tubes are passages that link the ovaries to the uterus. Each tube is between 10 - 12 centimetres long and is divided into four main parts, namely:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content">The interstitial portion, which is the medial part that opens into the uterus. Its whole length lies within the walls of the uterus. It is the shortest and narrowest part of the tube with a length of 1.25 centimetres and its lumen is 1 millimetre wide.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content">The isthmus, which is the narrow portion immediately adjoining the uterus.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content">The ampulla, which is the widest and longest (5 centimetres long) part of the fallopian tube and it is here that fertilisation occurs.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                <span class="list-content">The infundibulum, which is the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube. It is in close proximity to the ovary and its finger-like projections are known as fimbriae. One of the fimbriae, being longer than the others, is in contact with the ovary and picks up the ovum from the surface of the ovary at ovulation.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The uterine tube has three coats or layers. These are the serous, the muscular, and the mucous layers. The inner epithelium is lined with a mucous membrane of ciliated cubical epithelium, which is arranged in folds. These folds slow the ovum down on its way to the uterus. In the lining are cells that produce a secretion containing glycogen to nourish the ovum. Beneath the lining is a layer of vascular connective tissue.</p>
                        <p>The middle layer of thin muscle coat consists of two layers, a longitudinal outer layer and a circular inner layer, both of smooth muscle. The tube is covered with peritoneum.</p>
                        <p>The blood supply comes from the uterine and ovarian arteries and returns through the corresponding veins. The lymphatic drainage is carried out through the lumbar glands and the nerve supply is from the ovarian plexus.</p>

                        <h3>The Ovaries</h3>
                        <p>These are two glandular structures lying on the posterior surface of the broad ligament, supported by the ovarian and the infundibulopelvic ligaments. They are oval shaped and are composed of a medulla and a cortex, which is covered with germinal epithelium.</p>
                        <p>The medulla is made up of fibrous tissue, throughout which the ovarian blood vessels and the lymphatics and nerves travel. The cortex is the functional part of the ovary. It contains the Graafian follicles that are in different stages of development, surrounded by the stroma.</p>
                        <p>From puberty some of the Graafian follicles enlarge under the influence of the follicle-stimulating hormone. One Graafian follicle matures each month and ruptures to release an ovum. The ovaries produce ova and the hormones oestrogen and progesterone.</p>

                        <p>Blood supply to the ovaries is provided by the ovarian arteries and drained by the ovarian veins. The lumbar glands maintain lymphatic drainage while nerve supply is from the ovarian plexus.</p>
                        <p>So far, you have learned about the different structures that make up the female reproductive system. You now know that the vagina acts as a receptacle of the semen during sexual intercourse, as a passage for menstrual blood and for the foetus during delivery. It was also mentioned that the uterus is the site where the foetus grows from implantation to maturity, the fallopian tubes are passages through which the ova passes to be propelled to the uterine cavity, and that the functions of the ovaries include production of ova and hormones.</p>
                        <p>You have now completed the external and internal genitalia of the female reproductive system.</p>
