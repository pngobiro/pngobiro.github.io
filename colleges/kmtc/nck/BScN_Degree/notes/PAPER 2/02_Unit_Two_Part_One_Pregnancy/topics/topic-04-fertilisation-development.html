                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>This section will cover the process of fertilisation, the development of the foetus and physiological changes in pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Pregnancy is a critical period for both the woman and her unborn child. It is, therefore, very important for you to understand the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy in order to appreciate the effect they may have on the pregnant woman and to be able to manage her pregnancy appropriately.</p>

                        <h3>Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Fertilisation takes place when the sperm meets the ovum in the fallopian tube. After ovulation, the ovum passes into the fallopian tube and is moved along by the cilia and the peristaltic muscular contraction of the tube. At this time the cervix produces alkaline mucus that attracts the spermatozoa.</p>
                        <p>When intercourse takes place many spermatozoa (about 300 million) are deposited in the upper vagina. Those that reach the light cervical mucus survive and propel themselves towards the fallopian tubes while the rest are destroyed by the acid medium of the vagina. Many sperm will reach the fallopian tube where they meet the ovum. During this journey the sperm mature and are capable of producing an enzyme known as hyaluronidase, which will help penetration into the ovum. Only one sperm will enter the ovum. After the sperm goes into the ovum, the membrane is sealed to prevent other sperm from entering.</p>

                        <p>In order to understand the process of fertilisation you will need to remember some of the basic facts. These are:</p>

                                <span class="list-content">The ovum and the spermatozoon each contain only 23 chromosomes, hence when fertilisation occurs, the total 46 chromosomes are established. Thus, some inherited qualities are from the father and some from the mother.</span>

                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="list-content">The unfertilised ovum stays alive for about 24 hours and spermatozoa for up to 48 hours in the genital tract.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As mentioned earlier, the sperm and the ovum will each contribute 23 chromosomes to make a total of 46 chromosomes. The fertilised ovum is now known as a zygote.</p>
                        <p>After fertilisation has taken place in the ampulla of the fallopian tube, the zygote goes through the tube and continues until it reaches the uterus three to four days later. During this time, cell division takes place and the fertilised ovum or zygote divides into two cells, then into four and so on until a cluster of cells known as morula is formed. Next, a fluid filled cavity (blastocele) appears in the morula, which now becomes known as a blastocyst. A single layer of cells called the trophoblast, which will later form the placenta and chorion, surrounds the blastocyst. The mass of inner cells forms the foetus and amnion.</p>
                        <p>Pregnancy begins immediately after fertilisation. This process is then followed by implantation of the developing embryo into the deciduas. Thereafter, there is growth and differentiation of the various organs in the foetus in the first three months of pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Development of the placenta and membranes is almost complete by the tenth week of pregnancy.</p>

                        <div class="section-header">
                            <h2 class="section-title">Formation of the Decidua</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>The decidua is the name given to the endometrium during pregnancy. From conception, increased secretion of oestrogen causes the endometrium to grow four times more than its non-pregnant size. The endometrial glands become larger, more tortuous and dialled. Blood vessels increase in size. This results in a soft spongy vascular bed in which the zygote implants. Three layers can now be differentiated: the basal layer, the spongy layer and the compact layer.</p>

                        <h3>The Basal Layer</h3>
                        <p>The basal layer lies immediately above the myometrium. It remains unchanged but will regenerate a new endometrium during puerperium.</p>

                        <h3>The Spongy Layer</h3>
                        <p>The spongy layer, also called functional layer, lies above the basal layer. It consists of tortuous glands rich in secretions, enlarged blood vessels and stroma cells. The chorionic villi invade this layer to form a secure anchorage. This allows them to access oxygen and nutrition. The spongy layer will separate as soon as the baby is born.</p>

                        <h3>The Compact Layer</h3>
                        <p>The compact layer forms the surface layer of the decidua. It comprises the necks of the glands and stoma cells.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <div class="section-header">
                            <h2 class="section-title">Implantation</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>This is a process by which the blastocyst burrows into the thickened endometrium known as decidua. This process takes place on or about the sixth day after fertilisation. When the blastocyst enters the uterus, the trophoblast that lies over the inner cells mass becomes sticky and adheres to the endometrium.</p>
                        <p>The trophoblast secretes an enzyme, which digests the stroma cells and causes a depression in which the blastocyst lies. This digestion continues until the blastocyst is buried in the spongy layer and the site of entry is sealed. The endometrium closes over it completely.</p>
                        <p>The blastocyst is now referred to as the embryo. The decidua underneath the blastocyst is called the basal decidua, that which covers it is the capsular decidua and the remainder is called the true decidua. Eventually, as the blastocyst grows and fills the uterine cavity, the capsular decidua meets and fuses with the true decidua.</p>
                        <p>You will now see what happens to the trophoblast and the inner cell mass, which was mentioned earlier.</p>

                        <h3>The Trophoblast</h3>
                        <p>Small projections called chorionic villi appear all over the surface of the trophoblast at the point of contact with the basal decidua. These grow rapidly and obtain nourishment for the growing embryo.</p>
                        <p>The villi that proliferate are known as Chorion frondosum, which by the twelfth week are fully developed and form the placenta. Those that surround the decidua capsularis degenerate and become the membrane called the chorion.</p>

                        <h3>The Inner Cell Mass</h3>
                        <p>While the trophoblast is developing into the placenta, which will nourish the foetus, the inner cell mass is forming the foetus. The cells differentiate into three layers, each of which forms particular parts as follows:</p>

                            <h2 class="section-title">Foetal Circulation</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>The foetus does not breathe in the utero. If it did, it would drown in liqour amnii. Since the foetus does not breathe, the blood does not go to the lungs for oxygen. This means that the foetus must get oxygen and nourishment through the placenta, so extra structures are required to provide for this need. Thus the foetus develops its own blood and at no time do foetal and maternal blood mix.</p>
                        <p>There are five temporary structures in foetal circulation.</p>

                        <h3>The Umbilical Vein</h3>
                        <p>This leads from the umbilical cord to the underside of the liver and carries blood rich in oxygen and nutrients. It has a branch that joins the portal vein and supplies the liver.</p>

                        <h3>The Ductus Venosus</h3>
                        <p>This is a vessel from the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava, which carries oxygenated blood to the heart.</p>

                        <h3>The Foramen Ovale</h3>
                        <p>This is a temporary opening between the two atria in the foetal heart that allows oxygenated blood to enter the left atrium so as to be pumped out through the aorta.</p>

                        <h3>The Ductus Arteriosus</h3>
                        <p>This vessel connects the pulmonary artery to the descending arch of aorta. It deoxygenates blood from the head and upper limbs thereby bypassing the pulmonary circulation.</p>

                        <h3>The Hypogastric Arteries</h3>
                        <p>These two vessels branch off from the internal iliac arteries. They are known as umbilical arteries when they enter the umbilical cord.</p>
                        <p>All foetal blood passes through the placenta to get oxygen and nutrients and to eliminate waste. The course taken by the blood through the foetal circulation is as shown opposite.</p>
                        <p>The blood takes about half a minute to circulate. Oxygenated blood (50% saturated with oxygen) and nutrients flow through the placenta to the umbilical vein.</p>
                        <p>The umbilical vein takes the purified blood from the placenta and enters the baby's body at the umbilicus, then runs beneath the anterior abdominal wall to the under-surface of the liver (the liver gets the most oxygenated blood in the foetus). Here it gives off two branches to the left lobe. A small branch is also given off to join the portal vein and takes blood to the right lobe.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>The vein now becomes the ductus venosus and carries the blood to the inferior vena cava where it mixes with blood from the lower parts of the body. The blood then enters the right atrium and most of it passes through the voramen ovale into the left atrium. In this way, it bypasses the lungs. The blood then passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle and out through the aorta. The aorta gives out branches to the head, neck and arms. These, therefore, receive purer blood than any part of the foetal body except the liver.</p>
                        <p>Deoxygenated blood from the head, neck and arms passes through the superior vena cava to the right auricle and is directed through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle. From the right ventricle the blood enters the pulmonary artery. A small branch takes a small amount of blood to the functionless lungs. The remaining blood passes through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta to supply the remaining body organs and legs.</p>
                        <p>The internal iliac arteries lead into the hypo gastric arteries, which return blood to the placenta via the umbilical arteries. The external iliac artery supplies blood to the lower extremities and returns to the inferior vena cava. The umbilical arteries then pass into the abdominal wall to the umbilical cord at the navel and so reach the placenta where the blood passes through the chronic villi for respiratory and metabolic exchange, ready to circulate through the foetus again.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>At birth, the baby cries and the lungs expand and their vascular field increases. This draws blood to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries, which is then collected and returned via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium. Placental circulation ceases soon after birth reducing blood flow to the right side of the heart, while increasing blood flow to the left side. This causes the foramen ovale to close.</p>
                        <p>With the establishment of pulmonary respiration, the ductus arteriosus closes and the cessation of placental circulation results in the collapse and drying of the umbilical vein, the ductus venosus and the hypogastric arteries.</p>
                        <p>The umbilical vein becomes the ligamentum teres, the ductus venosus the ligamentum venosus and the foremen ovale becomes the fossa ovalis. The hypogastric arteries remain open as the superior vesical arteries.</p>
