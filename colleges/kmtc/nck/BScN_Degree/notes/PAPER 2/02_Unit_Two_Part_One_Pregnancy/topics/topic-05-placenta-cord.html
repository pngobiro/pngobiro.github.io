                            <h2 class="section-title">The Placenta</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>The fully formed placenta is a spongy disc, circular in shape, about 20 centimetres in diameter, and 2.5 centimetres thick. It weighs about 500 grams and is dark red in colour. It is composed of mainly chorionic villi, which are also known as chorion frondosum. The placenta begins to develop around the fourteenth day after fertilisation, and is fully formed by the sixteenth week of pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>The placenta has a foetal and a maternal surface. The maternal surface is the one attached to the uterine wall. The foetal surface lies adjacent to the foetus and is covered with amnion, which gives it a shiny appearance.</p>
                        <p>The placenta is divided into 15 to 20 centimetre lobes by deep grooves. It is made up of 15 to 20 cotyledons and an umbilical cord, which is usually attached near its centre. The umbilical cord has two arteries and one vein.</p>
                        <p>The developing chorion villi are of two kinds: those that enter deeply into the basal deciduas, anchoring the placenta and shorter ones, which hang loosely in the maternal blood and absorb food, oxygen and excrete waste, known as the nutritive villi. The former are less in number. Mature chorionic villi are tree-like and contain the foetal capillaries network arising from one stem. Each villum is covered with few layers of tissue, which make it impossible for the foetal and maternal blood to mix.</p>
                        <p>It was mentioned earlier that the placenta is fully formed by the sixteenth week after fertilisation.</p>
                        <p>Foetal blood is pumped by the foetal heart along the umbilical arteries and through their branches to the capillaries in the chorionic villi in the placenta. Here the blood absorbs oxygen and nutrients and is returned via the umbilical vein to the foetus.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The umbilical cord extends from the foetus to the placenta. It consists of the umbilical blood vessels, two arteries and one vein. The blood vessels are enclosed and protected by Wharton's jelly and a layer of amnion covers the whole cord.</p>
                        <p>The length is about 50 centimetres. If it measures 40 centimetres or less, then it is considered to be short. A very long cord may become wrapped around the neck or body of the foetus or become knotted and cause occlusion of blood vessels, especially during labour.</p>
                        <p>Move on now to discuss anatomical variations of the placenta and the cord.</p>

                            <h2 class="section-title">Anatomical Variations of the Placenta and Cord</h2>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Succenturiate Lobe</h3>
                        <p>This is the most significant variation. It is a small extra lobe separated from the main placenta and joined to it by blood vessels, which run through the membranes. It is dangerous because it can be retained in utero after delivery and cause infection and haemorrhage. It is important to examine the placenta carefully after delivery.</p>

                        <h3>Circumvallate Placenta</h3>
                        <p>Circumvallate placenta is when the placenta has two membranes that form an opaque ring on the foetal surface. It is formed by a doubling back of the amnion and chorion and may result in the membranes leaving the placenta nearer the centre instead of at the edge.</p>

                        <h3>Velamentous Insertion of the Cord</h3>
                        <p>This is when the cord is inserted into the membranes. The umbilical vessels run through the membranes from the cord to the placenta. The cord may become detached during active management of the third stage. If the placenta is low lying, the vessels may run across the uterine os. This situation is known as vasa praevia. In this case there is danger of haemorrhage from the foetus when the membranes rupture.</p>

                        <h3>Bipartite Placenta</h3>
                        <p>In this case two separate lobes are present, each with a cord leaving it. The two cords join a short distance from the two parts of the placenta.</p>

                        <h3>Tripartite Placenta</h3>
                        <p>In tripartite placenta, there are three distinct lobes similar to bipartite placenta.</p>

                            <h2 class="section-title">The Foetal Sac & Amniotic Fluid</h2>
                        </div>

                        <h3>The Foetal Sac</h3>
                        <p>This consists of a double membrane. The outer membrane is the chorion, which lies under the capsular decidua. It becomes closely adhered to the uterine wall. The inner membrane is the amnion, which contains the amniotic fluid.</p>

                        <h3>The Amniotic Fluid (Liquor Amnii)</h3>
                        <p>The amniotic fluid is a clear, pale, straw-coloured fluid consisting of 99% water. The amniotic fluid fills the space enclosed by the amnion which is the innermost membrane enclosing the foetus. It is constantly in circulation, being excreted by the placenta and the amnion itself. Later in pregnancy, the foetus swallows the amniotic fluid and passes it out as urine.</p>
                        <p>The amniotic fluid is contained in the foetal sac, which consists of a double membrane. The outer membrane is the chorion and the inner is the amnion. The chorion is a thick, opaque and fragile membrane while the amnion is a smooth, tough translucent membrane. It is derived from the inner cell mass. The foetal sac contains the amniotic fluid and the foetus.</p>
                        <p>The functions of the amniotic fluid include the following:</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The source of amniotic fluid is thought to be both foetal and maternal. It is secreted by the amnion, especially that which covers the placenta and the umbilical cord. Some fluid is excluded from the maternal vessels in the deciduas and some from the foetal vessels in the placenta. Foetal urine also contributes to the volume from the tenth week of gestation onwards.</p>
                        <p>The normal amount of amniotic fluid is about 600 to 1500 millilitres. If the amount exceeds 1,500 millilitres the condition is known as polyhydramnious and if it is less than 1,300 millilitres, it is known as oligohydramnious. These abnormalities are often associated with congenital malformations of the foetus.</p>
