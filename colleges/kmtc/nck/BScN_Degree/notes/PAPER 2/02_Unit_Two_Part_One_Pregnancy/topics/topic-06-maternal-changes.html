                        </div>
                        <p>The breasts are secreting glands composed mainly of glandular tissue arranged in lobes (about 20 in number). Each lobe is divided into lobules that consist of alveoli and ducts. The alveoli contain acini cells, which produce milk. The acini cells are surrounded by myoepithelia cells, which contract and relax to propel milk out. Small lactiferous ducts, carrying milk from the alveoli, unite to form larger ducts. One large duct leaves the lobe and widens to form an ampulla (lactiferous sinus) which acts as a temporally milk reservoir. A lactiferous tubule emerges from each ampulla to the surface of the nipple. Each breast functions independently of the other.</p>

                        <p>The nipple is composed of erectile tissue, which is covered with epithelium and plain muscle fibres. These muscles have a sphincter-like action which controls the flow of milk. Around the nipple is an area of pigmented skin called the areola, which contains the Montgomery's glands. The glands produce sebum, which lubricates the breasts during pregnancy and throughout breastfeeding.</p>
                        <p>Blood supply is from the internal and external mammary arteries and branches from the intercostal arteries. During lactation blood supply is increased. Blood, from the breasts, drains into the mammary and axillary veins. The lymphatic drainage systems of the two breasts communicate freely. This accounts for the rapid spread of malignant growth from one breast to another. The breasts have poor nerve supply and their function is controlled by hormones.</p>

                        <h3>Physiology of Lactation</h3>
                        <p>During pregnancy, oestrogen and progesterone hormones stimulate the growth and secretion of colostrum. Production of milk is inhibited by oestrogen. At the end of the third stage of labour, hormone production is reduced by the delivery of the placenta. This stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release Prolactin, which initiates milk production. The sucking reflex by the infant stimulates the production of oxytocin by the posterior pituitary gland. The oxytocin is carried in the blood stream to the breasts where it causes the myoepithelia cells to contract and propel milk along the ducts.</p>

                        <p>It is very important for you to understand the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy in order to appreciate their effects on the pregnant woman. This will enable you to manage her pregnancy appropriately.</p>
                        <p>Physiological changes in pregnancy take place in the following:</p>

                        <p>Now move on to look at the physiological changes in pregnancy in more detail.</p>

                        <h3>Changes in the Reproductive Organs</h3>

                        <h4>Changes in the Uterus</h4>
                        <p>The uterus provides a nutritive and protective environment in which the foetus will develop and grow. The uterine muscle fibre increases in size (hypertrophy) and in number (hyperplasia). The uterus continues to grow this way for the first 20 weeks, thereafter, it stretches to accommodate its contents. It increases in size from 60 grams - 900 grams.</p>
                        <p>By the eighth week of gestation it begins to generate small waves of contractions known as Braxton Hicks contractions, which are painless and continue throughout pregnancy. The blood supply to the uterus increases to keep pace with its growth and also to meet the needs of the placenta.</p>
                        <p>In early pregnancy the uterus becomes globular in shape to accommodate the foetal growth, liquor amnii and placental tissue. This causes pressure on other pelvic organs. For further reading, refer to Myles Textbook 13th Edition</p>

                        <h4>Changes in the Cervix</h4>
                        <p>The cervix acts as an effective barrier against infection. It also protects the pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Under the influence of progesterone, the endocervical cells secrete mucus, which becomes a cervical plug known as operculum. This plug provides protection from ascending infection. In late pregnancy, the cervix softens in response to increasing painless contractions. Prostaglandins are thought to have a role in cervical softening in readiness for the onset of labour.</p>

                        <h3>Changes in the Vagina</h3>
                        <p>Oestrogen causes the vagina to become more elastic. These changes will allow dilatation during the second stage of labour to receive the descending foetal head.</p>
                        <p>There is an increased amount of the normal white vaginal discharge called leucorrhoea. The vaginal ph becomes more acidic to provide protection to some micro-organisms but also increases susceptibility to others such as candida albicans.</p>

                        <h3>Changes in the Cardiovascular System</h3>
                        <p>The cardiac output increases from 5 litres to 7 litres per minute by late pregnancy. This is caused by an increase in resting heart rate of about 15 beats per minute by the end of pregnancy and an increase in blood volume.</p>
                        <p>The red cell mass increases by about 18% by the end of the pregnancy. The plasma volume increases from the tenth week of pregnancy and reaches its maximum level of 50% above non-pregnant values by the 32nd to 34th week, and maintains this until term.</p>
                        <p>As the plasma increase is greater than that of the red cell mass, there is haemodilution effect. This results in lowered haemoglobin level. This effect is referred to as physiological anaemia. The mean acceptable HB level in pregnancy is 10 - 12 g/dl of blood.</p>
                        <p>Despite these changes the blood pressure remains normal. The increased cardiac output does not affect the blood pressure. It may drop slightly by mid-trimester and towards term it returns to the level of the first trimester.</p>

                        <h3>Changes in the Respiratory System</h3>
                        <p>The respiratory rate does not alter but the amount of air inhaled per minute increases from 7 to 11 litres.</p>

                        <h3>Changes in the Renal System</h3>
                        <p>Progesterone relaxes the walls of the ureters and allows dilation and kinking. This tends to result in a slowing down or stasis of urinary flow, making infection a greater possibility.</p>

                        <h3>Changes in the Gastrointestinal Tract</h3>
                        <p>There is increased salivation. Women often experience changes in their sense of taste, leading to dietary changes and food cravings. Craving for substances such as bricks/soil is known as pica.</p>
                        <p>Progesterone relaxes the smooth muscles. Gastric emptying and peristalsis are reduced in order to maximise the absorption of nutrients. Heartburn is common and is associated with gastric reflux due to relaxation of the cardiac sphincter. Constipation is also common due to sluggish gut motility. Nausea and vomiting occur mainly during early pregnancy as a result of raised hormonal levels.</p>

                        <h3>Changes in Maternal Weight</h3>
                        <p>There is continuous weight increase during pregnancy, which is due to the foetus and fat deposition. The expected weight gain is approximately 2 kilograms in the first 20 weeks followed by an average of 0.5 kilogram per week until term leading to 12 kilograms in total.</p>

                        <h3>Changes to the Musculo-Skeletal System</h3>
                        <p>Progesterone encourages relaxation of ligaments and muscles. This increases the capacity of the pelvis in readiness for labour. The unstable pelvic joints result in the rolling gait sometimes seen in pregnant women. In the multigravidae, this is likely to cause backaches and ligamental pain especially in the hip joint.</p>

                        <h3>Changes to the Skin</h3>
                        <p>During pregnancy, there is increased activity of the melanin-stimulating hormone causing deeper pigmentation. Some women develop deeper, patchy colouring on the face known as chloasma. Many develop a pigmented line running from the pubis to the umbilicus known as linea nigra. Others may develop thin stretch marks called striae gravidarum. The increased blood supply to the skin leads to sweating. Women often feel hotter possibly due to progesterone-induced rises in temperature of 0.45°C together with vasodilation.</p>

                        <h3>Changes in the Breast</h3>
                        <p>The breast enlarges due to increased tissue growth, blood supply and fat deposition. Deposition of melanin toughens the nipple area in preparation for breastfeeding.</p>
