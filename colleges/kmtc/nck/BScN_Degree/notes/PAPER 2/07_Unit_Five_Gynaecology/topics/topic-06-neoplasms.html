                            <h3 class="card-title">Diagnosis and Management</h3>
                            <p>The diagnosis is generally based on clinical suspicion, symptoms, signs and examination and a biopsy for histology.</p>
                            <p>The management of neoplasms follows the same general measures that you have been looking at throughout this unit. Can you remember them?</p>
                            <p>The first step is to take a detailed history. Your investigations should include routine laboratory data like haemoglobin, urea, blood group, urinalysis and so on. You should also conduct an Examination Under Anesthesia (EUA) where a biopsy is taken to detect the type of cancer and staging.</p>

                            <p>Genital cancers in women account for 5% of the reproductive organ cancers. The benign lesions (tumours) of the vulva include:</p>

                            <p>Another rare tumour of the vulva is basal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer), which grows slowly and does not metastasise although it infiltrates locally.</p>

                            <p>For cancer of the vulva, treatment will include examination under anaesthesia after which a biopsy is taken, and staging done. Surgery may involve the radical excision of the vulva and of the inguinal and femoral glands on both sides, especially if it is undertaken in the late stage.</p>
                            <p>Alternatively, an excision and biopsy may be done. Radiotherapy is performed on tumours at the fourchette because of involvement of the anal canal. This may be curative in the early stages.</p>

                            <p>A urethra carbuncle is a small, bright red swelling at the urethral orifice, usually occurring in menopausal women. Some carbuncles cause no symptoms but most are very tender, and may cause dyspareunia or pain on micturition. They are not neoplastic but probably result from chronic infection of the paraurethral glands in the floor of the urethra.</p>
                            <p>Treatment is by excision or destruction by diathermy. Carcinoma of the urethra is a rare tumour but if it occurs, it is usually a squamous cell carcinoma arising near the meatus. It may sometimes be an adenocarcinoma arising in the paraurethral glands.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Tumours of the Vagina</h3>
                            <p>The benign tumours here include <strong>condylomata acuminata</strong>, which are also known as venereal genital warts. This is caused by the human papilloma virus and is transmitted through genital contact.</p>
                            <p>The originally small papillary growths tend to coalesce and form large cauliflower-like masses, which proliferate profusely during pregnancy. The growths may aggregate into a large mass that may even block the introitus during late delivery. Secondary infection is common. These venereal warts usually regress markedly during puerperium and may even disappear. The virus does not affect the foetus.</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="card-title">Management</h4>
                            <p>The most effective drug is fluorouracil, recommended for use only during non-pregnant state because it is noxious to the foetus. The gravida with this condition should be treated by cryotherapy or excision of the lesions. Improved vaginal hygiene is also beneficial.</p>
                            
                            <h4 class="card-title">Other Tumours</h4>
                            <p><strong>Fibromyoma</strong> is another benign tumour which may occasionally arise in the vaginal wall. It is hard and smooth and can easily be enucleated. Another possible tumour is endometriosis.</p>
                            <p><strong>Carcinoma of the vagina</strong> is rare and, if it occurs, it is usually of the squamous type. Cancer of the cervix very commonly spreads to the vaginal vault. In the case of endometrial carcinoma, isolated vaginal metastases may occur. Patients complain of bleeding, especially after coitus and later, an offensive watery discharge. The growth may ulcerate forming a fistula into the rectum or vagina.</p>
                            <p>Treatment is often very unsatisfactory. Most cases are treated by local application of radium or caesium and external irradiation of the lymphatic glands of the pelvis. The only alternative treatment is extensive operation to remove the whole vagina, uterus and pelvic lymphatic glands. If the rectum is involved, it is also removed and colostomy established.</p>
