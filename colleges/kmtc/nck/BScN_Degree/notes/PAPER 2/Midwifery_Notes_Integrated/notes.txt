# TO-DO LIST: Midwifery Integration
Location: PAPER 2/Midwifery_Notes_Integrated/

1. POPULATE CONTENT:
   Open topics/topic-01.html through topic-15.html.
   Replace the placeholder text with your detailed midwifery module notes.

2. ADD IMAGES:
   Midwifery relies heavily on visuals (e.g., Fetal skull, Mechanism of Labour, Partograph).
   Add these to assets/images/ and link them in the relevant topics.

3. CREATE QUIZZES:
   Create 15 JS quiz files in the quizzes/ folder corresponding to each module.
   Use the "Maternity Questions and Answers with Rationales" provided.

4. CHECK LINKS:
   Ensure the flow from Topic 1 to 15 is seamless and that the Quiz Hub links work.
