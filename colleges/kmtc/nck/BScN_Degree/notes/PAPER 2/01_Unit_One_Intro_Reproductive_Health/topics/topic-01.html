                            <p>During a Kenyan population census conducted in the late 1950's, the fertility and growth rates of Kenyans were found to be high. In response, the government adopted Family Planning (FP) as an important component of socioeconomic development in the 1960's.</p>
                            <p>As early as 1965, when fertility control was a primary focus, the Government of Kenya (GoK) recognised population planning and family planning as part of the National Planning Strategies of Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1965. In 1967, the Family Planning Programme was established (GoK/MoH, 1998).</p>
                            <p>Since then, the fertility rate, which was 7.9% in 1979, has decreased to 5.45% in 1993, and the population growth rate has reduced from 3.8% in 1979 to 3.4% in 1993 (CBS, 1995). You may argue that this is still high. The population of Kenya was 15.3 million in 1979. By 1998, it has doubled to approximately 30 million (NCPD, 1998). Meanwhile, the growth of the economy has not kept pace with the growth of the population.</p>

                            <p>If the population growth rate is higher than the economic growth rate, it creates a burden on available land, health facilities, educational resources and the job market. These factors often impact more on mothers and children, whose mortality and morbidity rates are high, mainly due to complications associated with pregnancy and childbirth and HIV/AIDS prevalence.</p>
