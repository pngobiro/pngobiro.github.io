                            <p>The average duration of pregnancy is 266 days. This is counting from the time the pregnancy started, which is after ovulation and approximately two weeks after the first day of the Last Normal Menstrual Period (LNMP). If the counting is made from the first day of the LNMP, then the duration is 280 days or forty weeks.</p>
                            <p>The duration of pregnancy can also be expressed in months. These can be calendar months or lunar months. A lunar month is the time from one new moon to the next. It is equal to four weeks or exactly 28 days. A calendar month is longer, usually 30 or 31 days. Therefore, on average, pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, that is, ten lunar months or approximately nine calendar months.</p>
                            <p>The diagnosis of pregnancy is made on the basis of symptoms, signs and investigations of pregnancy. These can be conveniently divided into those of the first, second and third trimester.</p>

                            <h3>Signs and Symptoms of Pregnancy</h3>
                            <p>The main symptoms and signs during the first trimester include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Amenorrhoea</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Enlargement and tenderness of the breasts</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Nausea</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Excessive salivation (ptyalism)</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Frequency of micturition due to the pressure of the gravid uterus on the urinary bladder</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Constitutional symptoms (that is, tiredness, weakness and sometimes depression)</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>As previously mentioned, a pregnant woman often experiences tiredness, general weakness and sometimes depression. The real cause of these symptoms is not established but may be hormonal. These symptoms usually improve by the 16th week after the last menstruation.</p>
                            <p>As the pregnancy progresses more signs and symptoms are observed. You will cover each of these in a little more detail.</p>

                            <h4>Enlargement of the Breasts</h4>
                            <p>The nipple and the areola increase in size. Small nodules, known as Montgomery's tubercles, develop around the nipple. The areola darkens.</p>

                            <h4>The Cervix</h4>
                            <p>The cervix becomes bluish in colour, which is referred to as Jacquemier's sign, because of the increased vascularity and congestion with blood. It also becomes softer. When you perform a bimanual vaginal examination with two fingers inserted in the anterior fornix of the vagina, and the other hand placed behind the uterus abdominally, the fingers of both hands almost meet because of the softness of the isthmus. This is known as Hegar's sign. It is most marked between the 6th and 12th week of pregnancy. There is also an increased pulsation felt in the lateral fornices, which is known as Osiander's sign. The uterus is slightly enlarged.</p>

                            <h4>Quickening</h4>
                            <p>This is when a mother feels the first movements. Primigravidae recognise these movements at about the 20th week, and the multipara at about the 16th week.</p>

                            <h4>Uterus Enlargement</h4>
                            <p>This occurs around the 12th week. You should be able to feel the enlarged uterus abdominally just above the symphysis pubis. The fundus reaches the level of the umbilicus at about the 22nd week, and the xiphisternum by the 36th week.</p>

                            <h4>Foetal Identification</h4>
                            <p>You should be able to feel the foetal parts, for example, the head, from the 24th week onwards. You might be able to feel foetal movements while palpating the fundus. Foetal heart sounds can be heard around the 24th week. The rate varies from 120 to 160 beats per minute.</p>

                            <h3>Investigations</h3>
                            <p>Now that you are aware of the symptoms and signs of pregnancy, you will look at the investigations that may be carried out to confirm pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>When diagnosing pregnancy, it is not always necessary that you carry out investigations. However, it is important for you to know the kind of investigations that may be done.</p>

                            <h4>Pregnancy Test</h4>
                            <p>This depends on the Human Chorionic Gonadotrophins (HCG) secreted in the mother's urine. It is more likely to be certain when the urine is concentrated, that is, a fresh, clean, early morning specimen. With a sensitive test, HCG can be detected in maternal plasma or urine by eight to nine days after ovulation.</p>

                            <h4>The Ultrasound</h4>
                            <p>This is a scanner, which enables you to see the foetus and its cardiac activity, particularly if performed by the 6th week of pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>X-ray Method</h4>
                            <p>By the 16th week, if an x-ray is performed, it will show foetal bones. This is an undesirable method of diagnosing pregnancy because in early or mid-pregnancy, the foetus is very susceptible to the adverse effects of radiation.</p>

                            <p>You will now look at factors that influence the maternal and perinatal mortality rates.</p>
                            <p>Maternal mortality refers to the death of the mother during pregnancy or within 42 days after the termination of pregnancy. The cause may be related to or aggravated by pregnancy, labour or puerperium. Data from the 2003 Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS) estimated maternal mortality ratio at 414 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.</p>
                            <p>Perinatal mortality includes stillbirths, which is the death of the foetus after 28 weeks and neonatal deaths, that is, death during the first week of life. According to the 2003 KDHS, the results indicate that perinatal mortality rate is 40 deaths per 1,000 pregnancies.</p>
                            
                            <p>A successful outcome of the pregnancy depends on the following two general factors:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The reproductive efficiency of the mother</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The standard of obstetric care</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The reproductive efficiency of the woman, in turn, depends on the following factors:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The age of the mother</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Her parity</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Her physique and stature</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Her general state of health</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You will now cover each factor separately, starting with the age of the mother.</p>

                            <h4>Age of Mother</h4>
                            <p>The optimum age for child bearing is between the age of 18 and 35 years. Pregnancy occurring below 18 years of age leads to a high incidence of prematurity and perinatal mortality rate. Since adolescent girls have not yet grown to their full stature, obstructed labour with all its disastrous results is very common.</p>
                            <p>After the age of 35, babies are usually considerably large, and the pelvic joints stiffer, thus they do not give room easily. Uterine dysfunction with slow dilatation of the cervix is common. Childbearing towards the end of the woman's reproductive life carries additional risk. Hypertension, other vascular diseases, and renal degenerative conditions begin to appear, leading to placental insufficiency.</p>

                            <h4>Parity</h4>
                            <p>The risks in pregnancy for the mother and child are relatively high in the first pregnancy. They then drop sharply in the second and third and then slowly rise in subsequent pregnancies. Therefore, by the sixth pregnancy the risks to this multipara exceed those of the primigravida and thereafter rise more steeply with each pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>A grand multipara is likely to get complications in pregnancy and labour.</p>
                            <p>Iron deficiency anaemia, which occurs because pregnancy and lactation deplete the woman's iron stores.</p>
                            <p>Malpresentation because of over relaxed abdominal muscles, that is, muscles that are not firm.</p>
                            <p>Uterine rupture due to obstructed labour and malpresentation.</p>
                            <p>Postpartum haemorrhage, which occurs because the uterus has fibrous tissues and is overstretched due to repeated pregnancies. This causes uterine atony. This occurs when the uterine muscle has lost the tone.</p>
                            <p>Cephalo-pelvic disproportion, that is, babies tend to be larger with each succeeding pregnancy. Disproportion may, therefore, occur after many subsequent pregnancies.</p>

                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>As a health worker you should not unduly rely on the security of a good past obstetric history. If you do, you may easily overlook signs of trouble in pregnancy or labour in a multipara.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <h4>Physique and Stature</h4>
                            <p>The maternal height is a very valuable measure of reproductive efficiency. In any community, the shortest height group has the highest perinatal mortality and the highest prematurity rate. Women below 150cms by height are at risk of cephalo-pelvic disproportion. On the other hand, women who are obese are more at risk of getting pre-eclampsia.</p>

                            <h4>Maternal Health</h4>
                            <p>The reproductive efficiency of the woman also depends on the woman's general state of health. If she starts off her pregnancy in poor health, she is likely to deteriorate throughout her pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Factors that make a woman more vulnerable to a difficult pregnancy</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Low social status, which means the woman, may not be able to afford good nutrition or medical care. She, at the same time, is likely to live in a poor environment, conducive to infections.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">A large family to take care of, which is likely to increase stress and predispose her to other diseases such as high blood pressure.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Poor nutrition because of frequent and closely spaced pregnancies, when a woman's body is depleted of nutrients. This is known as maternal depletion syndrome. Also, because of certain beliefs and taboos, some women regard some foods such as eggs as harmful to them during pregnancy.</span></li>

                            <h3>Antenatal Care</h3>
                            <h4>Activities at the First Antenatal Visit</h4>
                            <p>The first antenatal visit should take place as early as possible, preferably in the first trimester. It is an opportunity to collect baseline data about the mother, for example, weight, blood pressure and so on. This baseline data is important because it forms a basis for comparison during later visits. Also, during the first visit, any other abnormalities can be detected and treated before they have a detrimental effect.</p>
                            <p>The activities of the first visit include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Registration</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>You will now review each of these activities in a bit more detail.</p>

                            <h4>Registration</h4>
                            <p>Every pregnant woman that comes to the antenatal clinic should be registered and given an antenatal card.</p>

                            <h4>Weight and Height Measurement</h4>
                            <p>Measure height and weight and record them on the card. A woman with a height below 150cms is likely to have cephalopelvic disproportion. Excessive weight gain, that is, more than 1kg per week indicates accumulation of fluid in the tissues (oedema). A lack of increase in weight or weight loss may mean malnutrition.</p>

                            <h3>History Taking</h3>
                            <p>When you take the history you should include the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Particulars of the mother, which include the name, age, marital status, religion, and address.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">History of the present pregnancy, which includes the date of the first day of the last normal menstrual period, the parity and gravidity. From this, calculate and record the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) by adding seven days to the first day of the last normal menstrual period and subtracting three months from that month. For example, if her last period started on 18th June, 18 plus 7 gives you 25. Then June minus three months, (6-3) will give March. So the EDD is March 25th of the following year.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Gynaecological history, which will include the menstrual history, any past operations for gynaecological complaints and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Past obstetric history, for which you should ask the mother about the outcomes or complications of each of the previous pregnancies. Inquire into whether she delivered at home or at a hospital. Ask for the birth weights of the children, whether they were breastfed and whether they are alive or not.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>General Medical History</h4>
                            <p>Ask about any serious medical diseases likely to affect pregnancy and labour such as heart diseases, diabetes mellitus, renal diseases, tuberculosis and sickle cell disease.</p>

                            <h4>Surgical History</h4>
                            <p>Find out about injuries to the pelvis and spine, operations on the abdomen and blood transfusion.</p>

                            <h4>Physical Examination</h4>
                            <p>A thorough examination is made at the first visit. This is divided into a general examination and an obstetric examination. The general examination should include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">General appearance, namely the nutritional status, whether weak or sick looking. Note the gait and if she walks with a limp.</span></li>

The total weight gain by the end of pregnancy is about 10-20kg. Excessive weight gain indicates accumulation of fluid in the tissues (oedema). Lack of increase in weight or loss may mean malnutrition. Obesity may lead to an increased risk of gestational diabetes.</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <h4>Breast Examination</h4>
                            <p>Palpate gently with the flat of the hand to feel for any lumps. Check if the nipple is protractile. Educate the woman on how to examine the breasts by herself.</p>

                            <h4>Obstetric Examination (Abdominal)</h4>
                            <p>An obstetric examination aims at:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Observing for signs of pregnancy</span></li>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Diagnosing the location of foetal parts</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Detecting any deviation from normal</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The client is asked to empty her bladder and then to lie on her back on a couch with the arms by her sides. Inspect the abdomen for the shape, size, scars and foetal movements. Any abnormality detected is referred for further investigations.</p>
                            <p>Estimate the height of the fundus and compare it with the weeks of amenorrhoea. This helps you to assess foetal growth and detect any deviations from the normal. Check for varicosities at the back of the leg. Ask the woman to remove any tight clothing at the leg. At this time it is also important to check for phlebitis by looking for any reddened areas.</p>
                            <p>Palpate the sides of the abdomen to locate the foetal back in order to determine the position. You do this by facing the patient and then supporting the uterus with your right hand. Keep pushing the foetus with your left hand towards the right. Reverse the order to feel the left side of the uterus.</p>
                            <p>Palpate the lower pole of the uterus, just above the pelvic brim. Ask the mother to bend her knees slightly in order to relax the abdominal muscles and ask her to breathe steadily with her mouth open. Facing the foot of the bed, mark the brim of the pelvis with your hands and cup what presents between them. If the head is presenting, a smooth surface will be felt. If you do not find the head in the pelvic brim or at the fundus, suspect a transverse lie. This will be significant only after the 36th week of gestation.</p>
                            <p>The foetal heart sounds are listened to last, so as to assess the foetal wellbeing. The Pinard's foetal stethoscope is commonly used to hear the foetal heart.</p>
                            <p>As you perform the physical examination, talk to the mother and check her facial reaction as you palpate the abdomen. When you complete the procedure reassure the mother.</p>

                            <h4>Findings of Abdominal Examinations</h4>

                            <p>When you are giving health information, you should emphasise on the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Keeping antenatal and immunisation cards safely.</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>There are various topics that may also be discussed with mothers-to-be during community health talks. You will now cover some of them.</p>

                            <h4>Nutrition</h4>
                            <p>A balanced diet is emphasised for the health of the woman and the developing foetus. A balanced diet contains protein, carbohydrates, fat, fibre, vitamins and minerals.</p>

                            <h4>Preparation for the Newborn</h4>
                            <p>Prepare the mother for delivery. Advise what clothing to prepare for the coming baby, as well as on how to prepare for her changing role as she becomes a mother. She should also be ready for delivery in a hospital or health centre.</p>

                            <h4>Care of the Newborn</h4>
                            <p>Educate the mother on exclusive breastfeeding, keeping the baby warm, cord care and warning signs of infection such as septic cord, fever, and refusal to breastfeed.</p>

                            <h4>Breastfeeding</h4>
                            <p>The socio-cultural changes that discourage mothers to breastfeed need to be detected and dealt with promptly.</p>
                            <p>Employers and the society at large need to support the mothers in the breastfeeding endeavour.</p>

                            <h4>The Advantages of Breastfeeding</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breast milk is clean, while powdered milk usually gets contaminated by the water used to mix it or by being put into a dirty bottle. This may lead to diarrhoea and death.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breast milk is a balanced food for the baby, while powdered milk often results in fat or thin babies.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breast milk is always available while powdered milk is imported and expensive.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Thus, breast milk is cheaper.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breast milk contains protective antibodies while powdered milk, if badly handled, will contain bacteria.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breastfeeding brings close body contact between mother and baby. There is psychological satisfaction and the mother and baby develop a strong relationship, which leads to good social adjustment later in life. Tell the mother to put the baby to the breast immediately after birth.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breast milk is at the right temperature all the time.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breast milk contains a substance that promotes absorption of iron from the baby's gut.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Care of Breasts and the Newborn</h4>
                            <p>Advice on the care of the breasts is particularly important in any primigravida. Check if the woman has inverted or 'turned in' nipples and check for any cracks. The idea of teaching mothers to do nipple stretching exercises and massaging nipples to push out inverted nipples is no longer recommended. This is because this can damage the nipple and sometimes causes uterine contractions and premature labour.</p>
                            <p>After delivery, if the baby is very reluctant to suck, the mother should express the milk into a clean container and feed the baby with a cup and teaspoon.</p>
                            <p>Many women deliver at home due to poor road communication to the health facilities. In such circumstances, you should emphasise the need to cut the cord with a new razor blade fresh from its wrapping and, therefore, free from tetanus spore contamination.</p>
                            <p>You should discourage the use of cow dung and similar local medicament on the umbilical stump. A discharging or red eye is a serious problem in the newborn and needs medical attention.</p>

                            <h4>Immunisation</h4>
                            <p>Educate the woman on the immunisations she is to receive during her pregnancy period, for example, tetanus toxoid, and their importance. At this point it is also necessary to inform her about the immunisation the baby will receive, at what age, duration and their importance.</p>

                            <h4>Complications of Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>These include excessive vomiting, vaginal bleeding, excessive swelling of the ankles and face and persistent frontal headache among others. Highlight the importance of seeking early medical attention.</p>

                            <h4>Sexually Transmitted Infections</h4>
                            <p>Underline the importance of having safe sex and the effect of sexually transmitted infections to the unborn child. At this point, it is important to inform the woman of the signs and symptoms of some of the most common STIs, and the importance of seeking treatment, together with her partner.</p>

                            <h4>Family Planning</h4>
                            <p>The importance of family planning should also be emphasised. The available methods and their effects should be outlined, so that she is able to decide on the method of her choice immediately after delivery.</p>

                            <h4>Alcohol and Smoking</h4>
                            <p>Alcohol gives rise to foetal problems. Therefore, a woman is best advised to stop drinking prior to conception, or immediately she realises she has conceived. Smoking, likewise, has adverse effects to both the mother and the unborn child, and should also be avoided.</p>

                            <h4>Sexual Intercourse</h4>
                            <p>Sometimes, sex during pregnancy is feared to have adverse effects on the baby. It is important for a midwife to advise the couple that sex is safe except in special conditions, for example, if a woman has had frequent miscarriages.</p>

                            <p><strong>Follow-up Antenatal Visits</strong></p>
                            <p>Can you think of the importance of follow-up visits?</p>
                            <p>The main aim of follow-up visits is to check the general health of the mother and to ascertain the rate of growth and welfare of the foetus. You would also check the lie and presentation of the foetus so as to determine the expected mode of delivery. It is also an opportunity to allay any anxiety or fears in the mother about the pregnancy or labour.</p>

                            <div class="callout callout--warning">
                                <div class="callout-header">

                                    <p>The wellbeing of the foetus is indicated by an increasing maternal weight that is proportional to the increasing uterine size and is compatible with gestational age, regular foetal movements that follow a regular pattern, and foeta heart rate of between 110-150 beats per minute.</p>

                            </div>

                            <p>During follow-up visits, your activities should include the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <p><strong>Low Risk Ailments (Minor Orders of Pregnancy)</strong></p>
                            <p>These remain minor as long as they do not pose much risk to the life of the mother and the baby. They are mainly caused by hormonal, accommodation, metabolic and/or postural changes. They include backache, constipation, abdominal cramps, heartburn and morning sickness.</p>

                                    <p>Minor disorders may escalate and become serious complications of pregnancy. Therefore, as a health provider you have to be alert to the development of any complications and refer appropriately.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>You will now cover the management of each minor disorder.</p>

                            <p><strong>Nausea and Vomiting (Morning Sickness)</strong></p>
                            <p>As mentioned in the previous section, this is mainly caused by a rise in hormonal levels. It occurs between four and sixteen weeks, usually in the morning hours, but it can occur at any time of the day. When vomiting becomes severe, it is called hyperemesis gravidarum. This condition will be discussed in the section on risk factors in pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>Advise the woman to take carbohydrate snacks at bedtime and in the morning before rising. At this point, it is important to rule out other causes of vomiting.</p>

                            <p><strong>Heartburn</strong></p>
                            <p>This refers to a burning sensation that is felt at the medistinal region due to reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus through the cardiac sphincter that is relaxed by the increased levels of progesterone. It is prevalent between 30 to 40 weeks.</p>
                            <p>Advise the affected woman to avoid bending over, to take small meals, to sleep with several pillows and to lie on her right side in a semi-reclining position. If this condition persists, give anti-acids and refer.</p>

                            <h4>Constipation</h4>
                            <p>This occurs due to reduced gastric motility caused by to the increased levels of progesterone. Advise the woman to take plenty of water, fresh fruits, vegetables and wholemeal foods. Inform her of the importance of taking a glass of warm water in the morning before breakfast as this will help in activating the gut. Exercise is of great importance too.</p>

                            <h4>Backache</h4>
                            <p>Backache occurs due to softening of the ligaments that is caused by hormones. Advise the woman what causes this problem and reassure her that it will be over after the pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Obstetric Pharmacology</h4>
                            <p>This is the study of the actions and effects of drugs on the foetus and the gravid uterus. Although the placenta forms a barrier between the foetal and maternal circulations, the drugs can still cross it. Drugs that are lipid, that is, fat soluble, can only cross if present in high concentrations. Water soluble drugs on the other hand, cross the placental barrier easily.</p>
                            <p>Once a drug has crossed to the foetus, it may persist there for a long time. This is due to the poor development of the mechanisms necessary to excrete the drugs.</p>
                            <p>The possible bad effects of drugs on the growing foetus are expressed by the term 'teratogenic', which means the making of monsters or abnormal children. Drugs with such properties are particularly dangerous soon after implantation when the majority of the foetal organs are being formed. This is the stage of organ formation or organogenesis. However, even later, the use of drugs carries risks as the central nervous system develops throughout pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>The high risk period, therefore, is the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, especially three to eight weeks from the first day of the last normal menstrual period.</p>

                            <h4>Specific Dangers of Drugs</h4>
                            <p>The danger the drugs may cause will depend on the stage of pregnancy during which the drug has been taken.</p>

                            <h4>Drugs in Early Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>Early pregnancy is a time characterised by nausea, vomiting and occasionally depression. Antiemetic drugs, used to stop vomiting, are dangerous to the foetus and should be avoided whenever possible. In particular, the following should be avoided:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Antiparasitic agents</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <h4>Drugs in Late Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>Drugs given in late pregnancy may not cause gross anatomical defects but they can affect the foetus in other ways, including the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Androgens or progesterone can cause foetal masculinisation</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <h4>Drugs Just Before Labour</h4>
                            <p>Drugs given at this time may accumulate in the foetal circulation. The foetal liver is not mature enough to be able to excrete them. Anticoagulants will cause severe neonatal haemorrhage. Sulphonamides can cause jaundice. Chloramphenicol results in a general collapse of the baby, which is also known as the grey baby syndrome.</p>

                            <h4>Drugs During Labour</h4>
                            <p>Any drug which acts to depress the respiratory system, such as those given to the mother to relieve pain, will make the newborn have difficulty in starting respiration. Barbiturates and anaesthetic agents may depress the newborn's respiration.</p>
                            <p>As a general principle drugs, should be avoided throughout pregnancy, and especially in the first 12 weeks. You should attempt to cope with the mother's problems by giving reassurance and moral support with the minimum amount of drugs. If drugs are really required, their safety should be evaluated and the duration should be limited to the shortest time possible.</p>

                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>As much as possible, avoid giving drugs to a pregnant mother in the first 12 weeks of the pregnancy.</p>

                            <p>Drugs acting on the uterus are classified into two groups, namely uterine relaxants and uterine stimulants.</p>

                            <h4>Uterine Relaxants</h4>
                            <p>Uterine relaxants relax the uterine muscles at different stages of pregnancy. These are progesterone and adrenoreceptor stimulants.</p>

                            <h4>Progesteron</h4>
                            <p>These act in early pregnancy and are believed to make the uterus less irritable. They are sometimes used in the management of habitual or threatened abortion. As some of these agents cause masculinisation in female foetuses, they should be used with great caution. Never give these drugs yourself. Refer the patient to hospital.</p>

                            <h4>Adrenoreceptor Stimulants</h4>
                            <p>These include isoxsuprine, salbutamol (ventolin) and orciprenaline. They are used in late pregnancy to prevent premature labour as they have a direct relaxant effect on the uterine muscle. However, they also have strong cardiovascular effects and their use on a large scale can be dangerous.</p>

                            <h4>Uterine Stimulants</h4>
                            <p>These include prostaglandins, oxytocin and ergometrine.</p>

                            <h4>Prostaglandins</h4>
                            <p>These are a group of naturally occurring agents, which, depending on the circumstances, can either contract or relax smooth muscle. They are produced by the seminal vesicles. Other sites of origin are the adrenals, kidney, liver, gut and nervous tissue.</p>
                            <p>Certain types of prostaglandins cause vigorous uterine contractions at any stage of pregnancy. They can be used to induce an abortion or to induce labour. They can be administered intravenously, orally, as vaginal pellets, or as an intrauterine injection. At present they are very expensive</p>

                            <h4>Oxytocin</h4>
                            <p>This is produced by the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Syntocinon (pitocin) is a synthetic drug similar to oxytocin. Its dosage is expressed in units and it is usually given by an intravenous infusion so that its effects can be quickly discontinued if necessary. It is occasionally administered as a tablet (buccal pitocin). Syntocinon produces rhythmic contractions of the uterus with a relaxation phase in between, thus mimicking normal uterine activity in labour. Its uses include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            </ul>
                            <p>Dangers of oxytocin include foetal hypoxia and perinatal death as well as rupture of uterus.</p>

                            <h4>Ergometrine</h4>
                            <p>This is one of the ergot alkaloids, a naturally occurring group of substances prepared from a fungus. These substances have the ability to cause strong contractions of smooth muscle, including the uterine muscle. This will be covered further on the next page.</p>
                            <p>Unlike other ergot alkaloids, Ergometrine acts almost solely on the uterus. It produces a sustained tonic contraction of the uterus and its effects wear off after two to four hours. It is therefore unsuitable for inducing labour where slow, regular contractions with a good relaxation phase, like those produced by oxytocin are needed.</p>
                            <p>Ergometrine is the most important drug used to treat or prevent post partum haemorrhage. This is because of its ability to produce a sustained contraction, which shortens the muscle fibres so as to prevent bleeding from the placental site. When given intravenously it acts in 45 seconds, but when given intramuscularly, it has the disadvantage of being slow to act (seven minutes).</p>
                            <p>However, as pitocin acts more rapidly when given by intramuscular route (two minutes), the two drugs are usually given as a combination known as syntometrine which is five units of syntocin combined with 0.5mg of ergometrine. Syntometrine acts within two to three minutes when given intramuscularly.</p>
                            <p>Ergometrine can also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, hence the patient's blood pressure can increase after an injection of ergometrine, particularly after an intravenous injection.</p>
                            <p>To avoid toxic effects, 1.5mg is the maximum total dose of ergometrine maleate that can be given safely in 24 hours.</p>
