                            <p>The first dose of tetanus toxid (0.5mls) should be given at first contact or as early as possible during pregnancy. The rest of the doses (four) are given as per schedule on the immunisation card.</p>

                            <p>The antenatal clinic visits are an ideal time to educate mothers about a variety of health issues pertaining to their health and that of their children. The best way to ensure that every mother gets maximum health information is to have a regular schedule of topics to be covered at each antenatal visit.</p>
                            <p>Write down a programme for health education of mothers. List the topic you will cover at each clinic visit and the points of emphasis for each topic.</p>

                            <p>When you are giving health information, you should emphasise on the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            </ul>
                            <p>There are various topics that may also be discussed with mothers-to-be during community health talks. You will now cover some of them.</p>

                            <h4>Nutrition</h4>
                            <p>A balanced diet is emphasised for the health of the woman and the developing foetus. A balanced diet contains protein, carbohydrates, fat, fibre, vitamins and minerals.</p>

                            <h4>Preparation for the Newborn</h4>
                            <p>Prepare the mother for delivery. Advise what clothing to prepare for the coming baby, as well as on how to prepare for her changing role as she becomes a mother. She should also be ready for delivery in a hospital or health centre.</p>

                            <h4>Care of the Newborn</h4>
                            <p>Educate the mother on exclusive breastfeeding, keeping the baby warm, cord care and warning signs of infection such as septic cord, fever, and refusal to breastfeed.</p>

                            <h4>Breastfeeding</h4>
                            <p>The socio-cultural changes that discourage mothers to breastfeed need to be detected and dealt with promptly.</p>
                            <p>Employers and the society at large need to support the mothers in the breastfeeding endeavour.</p>

                            <h4>The Advantages of Breastfeeding</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breast milk is clean, while powdered milk usually gets contaminated by the water used to mix it or by being put into a dirty bottle. This may lead to diarrhoea and death.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breast milk is a balanced food for the baby, while powdered milk often results in fat or thin babies.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breast milk is always available while powdered milk is imported and expensive.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Thus, breast milk is cheaper.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breastfeeding brings close body contact between mother and baby. There is psychological satisfaction and the mother and baby develop a strong relationship, which leads to good social adjustment later in life. Tell the mother to put the baby to the breast immediately after birth.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breast milk is at the right temperature all the time.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Breast milk contains a substance that promotes absorption of iron from the baby's gut.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Care of Breasts and the Newborn</h4>
                            <p>Advice on the care of the breasts is particularly important in any primigravida. Check if the woman has inverted or 'turned in' nipples and check for any cracks. The idea of teaching mothers to do nipple stretching exercises and massaging nipples to push out inverted nipples is no longer recommended. This is because this can damage the nipple and sometimes causes uterine contractions and premature labour.</p>
                            <p>After delivery, if the baby is very reluctant to suck, the mother should express the milk into a clean container and feed the baby with a cup and teaspoon.</p>
                            <p>Many women deliver at home due to poor road communication to the health facilities. In such circumstances, you should emphasise the need to cut the cord with a new razor blade fresh from its wrapping and, therefore, free from tetanus spore contamination.</p>
                            <p>You should discourage the use of cow dung and similar local medicament on the umbilical stump. A discharging or red eye is a serious problem in the newborn and needs medical attention.</p>

                            <h4>Immunisation</h4>
                            <p>Educate the woman on the immunisations she is to receive during her pregnancy period, for example, tetanus toxoid, and their importance. At this point it is also necessary to inform her about the immunisation the baby will receive, at what age, duration and their importance.</p>

                            <h4>Complications of Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>These include excessive vomiting, vaginal bleeding, excessive swelling of the ankles and face and persistent frontal headache among others. Highlight the importance of seeking early medical attention.</p>

                            <h4>Sexually Transmitted Infections</h4>
                            <p>Underline the importance of having safe sex and the effect of sexually transmitted infections to the unborn child. At this point, it is important to inform the woman of the signs and symptoms of some of the most common STIs, and the importance of seeking treatment, together with her partner.</p>

                            <h4>Family Planning</h4>
                            <p>The importance of family planning should also be emphasised. The available methods and their effects should be outlined, so that she is able to decide on the method of her choice immediately after delivery.</p>

                            <h4>Alcohol and Smoking</h4>
                            <p>Alcohol gives rise to foetal problems. Therefore, a woman is best advised to stop drinking prior to conception, or immediately she realises she has conceived. Smoking, likewise, has adverse effects to both the mother and the unborn child, and should also be avoided.</p>

                            <h4>Sexual Intercourse</h4>
                            <p>Sometimes, sex during pregnancy is feared to have adverse effects on the baby. It is important for a midwife to advise the couple that sex is safe except in special conditions, for example, if a woman has had frequent miscarriages.</p>

                            <p><strong>Follow-up Antenatal Visits</strong></p>
                            <p>Can you think of the importance of follow-up visits?</p>
                            <p>The main aim of follow-up visits is to check the general health of the mother and to ascertain the rate of growth and welfare of the foetus. You would also check the lie and presentation of the foetus so as to determine the expected mode of delivery. It is also an opportunity to allay any anxiety or fears in the mother about the pregnancy or labour.</p>

                                <div class="callout-header">

                                    <p>The wellbeing of the foetus is indicated by an increasing maternal weight that is proportional to the increasing uterine size and is compatible with gestational age, regular foetal movements that follow a regular pattern, and foetal heart rate of between 110-150 beats per minute.</p>

                            <p><strong>Low Risk Ailments (Minor Orders of Pregnancy)</strong></p>
                            <p>These remain minor as long as they do not pose much risk to the life of the mother and the baby. They are mainly caused by hormonal, accommodation, metabolic and/or postural changes. They include backache, constipation, abdominal cramps, heartburn and morning sickness.</p>

                                    <p>Minor disorders may escalate and become serious complications of pregnancy. Therefore, as a health provider you have to be alert to the development of any complications and refer appropriately.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>You will now cover the management of each minor disorder.</p>

                            <p><strong>Nausea and Vomiting (Morning Sickness)</strong></p>
                            <p>As mentioned in the previous section, this is mainly caused by a rise in hormonal levels. It occurs between four and sixteen weeks, usually in the morning hours, but it can occur at any time of the day. When vomiting becomes severe, it is called hyperemesis gravidarum. This condition will be discussed in the section on risk factors in pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>Advise the woman to take carbohydrate snacks at bedtime and in the morning before rising. At this point, it is important to rule out other causes of vomiting.</p>

                            <p><strong>Heartburn</strong></p>
                            <p>This refers to a burning sensation that is felt at the medistinal region due to reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus through the cardiac sphincter that is relaxed by the increased levels of progesterone. It is prevalent between 30 to 40 weeks.</p>
                            <p>Advise the affected woman to avoid bending over, to take small meals, to sleep with several pillows and to lie on her right side in a semi-reclining position. If this condition persists, give anti-acids and refer.</p>

                            <h4>Constipation</h4>
                            <p>This occurs due to reduced gastric motility caused by to the increased levels of progesterone. Advise the woman to take plenty of water, fresh fruits, vegetables and wholemeal foods. Inform her of the importance of taking a glass of warm water in the morning before breakfast as this will help in activating the gut. Exercise is of great importance too.</p>

                            <h4>Backache</h4>
                            <p>Backache occurs due to softening of the ligaments that is caused by hormones. Advise the woman what causes this problem and reassure her that it will be over after the pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Obstetric Pharmacology</h4>
                            <p>This is the study of the actions and effects of drugs on the foetus and the gravid uterus. Although the placenta forms a barrier between the foetal and maternal circulations, the drugs can still cross it. Drugs that are lipid, that is, fat soluble, can only cross if present in high concentrations. Water soluble drugs on the other hand, cross the placental barrier easily.</p>
                            <p>Once a drug has crossed to the foetus, it may persist there for a long time. This is due to the poor development of the mechanisms necessary to excrete the drugs.</p>
                            <p>The possible bad effects of drugs on the growing foetus are expressed by the term 'teratogenic', which means the making of monsters or abnormal children. Drugs with such properties are particularly dangerous soon after implantation when the majority of the foetal organs are being formed. This is the stage of organ formation or organogenesis. However, even later, the use of drugs carries risks as the central nervous system develops throughout pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>The high risk period, therefore, is the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, especially three to eight weeks from the first day of the last normal menstrual period.</p>

                            <h4>Specific Dangers of Drugs</h4>
                            <p>The danger the drugs may cause will depend on the stage of pregnancy during which the drug has been taken.</p>

                            <h4>Drugs in Early Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>Early pregnancy is a time characterised by nausea, vomiting and occasionally depression. Antiemetic drugs, used to stop vomiting, are dangerous to the foetus and should be avoided whenever possible. In particular, the following should be avoided:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Antiparasitic agents</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <h4>Drugs in Late Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>Drugs given in late pregnancy may not cause gross anatomical defects but they can affect the foetus in other ways, including the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Androgens or progesterone can cause foetal masculinisation</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <h4>Drugs Just Before Labour</h4>
                            <p>Drugs given at this time may accumulate in the foetal circulation. The foetal liver is not mature enough to be able to excrete them. Anticoagulants will cause severe neonatal haemorrhage. Sulphonamides can cause jaundice. Chloramphenicol results in a general collapse of the baby, which is also known as the grey baby syndrome.</p>

                            <h4>Drugs During Labour</h4>
                            <p>Any drug which acts to depress the respiratory system, such as those given to the mother to relieve pain, will make the newborn have difficulty in starting respiration. Barbiturates and anaesthetic agents may depress the newborn's respiration.</p>
                            <p>As a general principle drugs, should be avoided throughout pregnancy, and especially in the first 12 weeks. You should attempt to cope with the mother's problems by giving reassurance and moral support with the minimum amount of drugs. If drugs are really required, their safety should be evaluated and the duration should be limited to the shortest time possible.</p>

                                    <p>As much as possible, avoid giving drugs to a pregnant mother in the first 12 weeks of the pregnancy.</p>

                            <p>Drugs acting on the uterus are classified into two groups, namely uterine relaxants and uterine stimulants.</p>

                            <h4>Uterine Relaxants</h4>
                            <p>Uterine relaxants relax the uterine muscles at different stages of pregnancy. These are progesterone and adrenoreceptor stimulants.</p>

                            <h4>Progesterone</h4>
                            <p>These act in early pregnancy and are believed to make the uterus less irritable. They are sometimes used in the management of habitual or threatened abortion. As some of these agents cause masculinisation in female foetuses, they should be used with great caution. Never give these drugs yourself. Refer the patient to hospital.</p>

                            <h4>Adrenoreceptor Stimulants</h4>
                            <p>These include isoxsuprine, salbutamol (ventolin) and orciprenaline. They are used in late pregnancy to prevent premature labour as they have a direct relaxant effect on the uterine muscle. However, they also have strong cardiovascular effects and their use on a large scale can be dangerous.</p>

                            <h4>Uterine Stimulants</h4>
                            <p>These include prostaglandins, oxytocin and ergometrine.</p>

                            <h4>Prostaglandins</h4>
                            <p>These are a group of naturally occurring agents, which, depending on the circumstances, can either contract or relax smooth muscle. They are produced by the seminal vesicles. Other sites of origin are the adrenals, kidney, liver, gut and nervous tissue.</p>
                            <p>Certain types of prostaglandins cause vigorous uterine contractions at any stage of pregnancy. They can be used to induce an abortion or to induce labour. They can be administered intravenously, orally, as vaginal pellets, or as an intrauterine injection. At present they are very expensive</p>

                            <h4>Oxytocin</h4>
                            <p>This is produced by the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Syntocinon (pitocin) is a synthetic drug similar to oxytocin. Its dosage is expressed in units and it is usually given by an intravenous infusion so that its effects can be quickly discontinued if necessary. It is occasionally administered as a tablet (buccal pitocin). Syntocinon produces rhythmic contractions of the uterus with a relaxation phase in between, thus mimicking normal uterine activity in labour. Its uses include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            </ul>
                            <p>Dangers of oxytocin include foetal hypoxia and perinatal death as well as rupture of uterus.</p>

                            <h4>Ergometrine</h4>
                            <p>This is one of the ergot alkaloids, a naturally occurring group of substances prepared from a fungus. These substances have the ability to cause strong contractions of smooth muscle, including the uterine muscle. This will be covered further on the next page.</p>
                            <p>Unlike other ergot alkaloids, Ergometrine acts almost solely on the uterus. It produces a sustained tonic contraction of the uterus and its effects wear off after two to four hours. It is therefore unsuitable for inducing labour where slow, regular contractions with a good relaxation phase, like those produced by oxytocin are needed.</p>
                            <p>Ergometrine is the most important drug used to treat or prevent post partum haemorrhage. This is because of its ability to produce a sustained contraction, which shortens the muscle fibres so as to prevent bleeding from the placental site. When given intravenously it acts in 45 seconds, but when given intramuscularly, it has the disadvantage of being slow to act (seven minutes).</p>
                            <p>However, as pitocin acts more rapidly when given by intramuscular route (two minutes), the two drugs are usually given as a combination known as syntometrine which is five units of syntocin combined with 0.5mg of ergometrine. Syntometrine acts within two to three minutes when given intramuscularly.</p>
                            <p>Ergometrine can also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, hence the patient's blood pressure can increase after an injection of ergometrine, particularly after an intravenous injection.</p>
                            <p>To avoid toxic effects, 1.5mg is the maximum total dose of ergometrine maleate that can be given safely in 24 hours.</p>
