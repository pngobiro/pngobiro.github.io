                            <p>In the previous section you looked at the management of normal pregnancy and the management of minor disorders caused by pregnancy. In this section you will look at the high risk factors in pregnancy including the medical conditions that affect pregnancy. The types of women in this group are those who are at higher risk of having complications either during pregnancy or labour. This may be because in their past deliveries they had problems like postpartum haemorrhage, which are likely to recur, or they have chronic diseases such as diabetes which are likely to get worse with pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>There are also those who are at risk in this particular pregnancy because of a problem such as severe anaemia, which has just developed. Note that these are the major causes of both maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. Thus, early diagnosis and proper management is essential for a successful pregnancy and delivery.</p>

                            <p>This is a condition where vomiting is severe and continuous throughout the day. The woman vomits everything she has eaten. This usually leads to severe dehydration and ketoacidosis. She becomes malnourished. If treatment is not started quickly, liver and kidney damage may result. Anaemia may develop as a result of lack of vitamin B, folic acid and iron.</p>

                                    <p>Hyperemesis gravidarum occurs in very few women. It is usually associated with multiple pregnancies, hydatidiform mole and/or a history of habitual abortions.</p>

                            <h4>Management of Hyperemesis Gravidarum</h4>
                            <p>If in a health centre or dispensary, the patient should be referred to a hospital as soon as the diagnosis is made. In the hospital, the following should be done:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Intravenous infusion of five percent dextrose alternating with normal saline will be given to correct the dehydration.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Anti emetics like promethazine hydrochloride (phenergan) or metoclopramide hydrochloride (plasil) are given usually parenterally to control the vomiting.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Multivitamin supplements are given.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The patient is reassured and her visitors restricted.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Routine nursing care and observations of vital signs are maintained twice daily or as necessary.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The patient should be discharged at least two to three days after vomiting has ceased. The case should be followed up in the antenatal clinic.</p>

                            <h3>Polyhydramnios</h3>
                            <p>This is a condition in which the quantity of amniotic fluid exceeds 1500mls. It may not become apparent until it reaches 3000mls. It is a fairly rare condition.</p>
                            <p>Polyhydramnios is associated with the following conditions:</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>There are two types of polyhydramnios: chronic and acute.</p>

                            <h4>Chronic Polyhydramnios</h4>
                            <p>This occurs gradually, usually from about the 30th week of pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>It is the most common type.</p>

                            <h4>Acute Polyhydramnios</h4>
                            <p>This is a rare type, which occurs at about 20 weeks and comes on very suddenly. The uterus reaches the xiphisternum in about three to four days. It is associated with monozygotic twins or severe foetal abnormality.</p>

                            <p>Polyhydramnios can be recognised in the following ways:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The mother may complain of breathlessness and discomfort.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">If the condition is acute in onset, she may complain of severe abdominal pain.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The condition may aggravate other symptoms associated with pregnancy such as indigestion, heartburn, constipation, oedema, varicose veins of the vulva and lower limbs.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">On abdominal inspection, the uterus is larger than expected for the period of gestation and is globular in shape. The abdominal skin appears stretched and tight with marked striae gravidurum and marked superficial blood vessels.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">On palpation, the uterus is tense and it is difficult to feel foetal parts.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The abdominal girth is much more than expected for the period of gestation.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Auscultation of the foetal heart is difficult because of the free movement of the foetus.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Where possible an ultrasonic scan should be done to confirm the diagnosis. It may also reveal multiple pregnancy or foetal abnormality if these are present</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Management of Polyhydramnios</h4>
                            <p>The mother is admitted to hospital and, where possible, the cause of the condition is determined. The subsequent care will be determined by the condition of the mother, the cause and the period of gestation.</p>
                            <p>If there is foetal abnormality, the method and timing of delivery will depend on the severity. If there is gross abnormality, induction should be started. The nursing care should include rest in bed in sitting position to relieve dyspnoea. Assist the patient with personal hygiene and routine prenatal observations.</p>
                            <p>If abdominal discomfort is severe, abdominal amniocentesis may be considered. If it is done, infection prevention measures must be observed and only 500ml should be withdrawn at a time. Labour may be induced in the case of late pregnancy. Before the membranes are ruptured, the lie must be determined and the membranes ruptured cautiously allowing the fluid to flow slowly. This is to avoid cord prolapse, alteration of the lie and abruptio placenta which may occur after sudden reduction of uterine size.</p>

                            <h4>Complications of Polyhydramnios</h4>

                            <h3>Oligohydramnios</h3>
                            <p>In this condition there is an abnormally small amount of amniotic fluid. It may be 300 to 500ml at term but amounts vary and it may be much less. It is associated with absence of kidneys or Potter's syndrome in which the foetus has pulmonary hypoplasia.</p>
                            <p>The lack of amniotic fluid reduces intrauterine space and causes deformities of the foetus due to compression. The baby's skin is dry and leathery in appearance and the nose may be flat. It may have talipes and a squashed-looking face.</p>
                            <p>The following characteristics will help you recognise the presence of oligohydramnios:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The uterus is smaller than expected for the period of gestation</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The mother notices reduced foetal movements if she has had a previous normal pregnancy</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">On palpation the foetal parts are easily felt and the uterus is small and compact</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Management</h4>
                            <p>The woman should be admitted for investigations, usually in the form of an ultrasound scan. If there are no foetal abnormalities, the pregnancy will be allowed to continue. Labour may be induced early to avoid placental insufficiency.</p>
                            <p>Analgesics are given during labour because the contractions are usually very painful. However, be aware that impaired circulation may cause foetal hypoxia. After delivery the baby is examined carefully for abnormalities.</p>

                                    <p>Never perform a vaginal examination on a woman with antepartum haemorrhage. This may lead to severe bleeding which can be fatal.</p>

                            <p>The two most important causes of bleeding in late pregnancy are placenta praevia and abruptio placentae. You will now look at each of these separately.</p>

                            <h3>Placenta Praevia</h3>
                            <p>This is bleeding from a partially separated placenta, which is wholly or partially situated in the lower uterine segment. It might be covering either part or the entire internal os.</p>
                            <p>It is more likely to occur with increasing maternal age. It is more common in women aged 35 and above. It is also associated with increasing parity, and is twice as common in multigravida as in primigravida.</p>
                            <p>Placenta praevia is divided into four types or degrees.</p>

                            <h4>Signs and Symptoms of Placenta Praevia</h4>
                            <p>The signs and symptoms of placenta praevia include painless vaginal bleeding which starts when at rest or sleeping. It starts suddenly, usually from the 32nd week of gestation because of Braxton Hicks contractions.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, because the placenta occupies the lower uterine segment, the foetal head remains high, which results in malpresentation and unstable lie. If bleeding is severe, the blood pressure is low, the pulse and respirations are high, and there is shock corresponding with the amount of bleeding.</p>

                            <h4>The Management of Placenta Praevia</h4>
                            <p>If in a health centre or dispensary, refer all pregnant women with vaginal bleeding to hospital. Ensure there is a running intravenous drip of saline or dextrose before transferring the patient to the hospital. A nurse should always accompany the patient to the hospital.</p>
                            <p>In the hospital the type of management will depend on the amount of blood loss, the condition of the mother and foetus, the location of the placenta and the gestation period.</p>
                            <p>The aim of management is to control haemorrhage and to try to conserve the pregnancy up to 38 weeks gestation when the foetus is mature.</p>
                            <p>Where there is slight vaginal bleeding, conservative treatment is started if the pregnancy has not reached 38 weeks of gestation. The patient is admitted for complete bed rest and total care.</p>

                            <h4>Types of Abruptio Placentae</h4>
                            <p>There are three clinical presentations.</p>
                            <p>Mixed or combined, where bleeding is partly revealed and partly concealed.</p>
                            <p>Concealed, where the blood is trapped between the placenta, membranes and the uterine wall. There is no visible bleeding.</p>
                            <p>External or revealed, which is where there is free (visible) vaginal haemorrhage.</p>

                            <h4>Signs and Symptoms of Abruptio Placentae</h4>
                            <p>In the revealed type, there is slight to severe vaginal bleeding. On abdominal palpation there may or may not be pain and tenderness. The pulse is raised and there is low blood pressure or hypertension.</p>
                            <p>In the concealed type, there is severe abdominal pain and the patient is in shock. There is no vaginal bleeding and the uterus is very tender and is board like. The foetal parts cannot be palpated and there are no foetal heart sounds. The pulse is raised and there may be oliguria and proteinuria.</p>
                            <p>In the combined type, the patient has both features of revealed and concealed bleeding. The degree of shock is higher than the visible blood loss. The uterus is tender and rigid and pain is constant.</p>

                            <h4>Management of Abruptio Placentae</h4>
                            <p>Refer the patient to hospital if in a health centre or dispensary. She should be started on intravenous drip. Inform the hospital if possible. Take a specimen of blood for grouping cross matching before starting the drip and take it with the patient when she is transferred. In the hospital, admit the patient and call the doctor immediately. Give emotional support and physical care. Relieve pain with IM morphine 15mg or pethidine 100mg. If there is severe bleeding treat for shock and prepare for caesarean section.</p>
                            <p>Take vital signs, such as blood pressure and pulse, quarter to half hourly and temperature four hourly. Raise the foot of the bed to prevent vena cava occlusion by gravid uterus. Maintain a urine output chart and test urine for protein. You should also test blood for coagulation defects and take clotting time at intervals for monitoring. Prepare for reception and resuscitation of the baby. Usually, the baby is still born. A blood transfusion should be given where necessary.</p>

                            <h4>Conservative Management</h4>
                            <p>This occurs in cases of mild separation of the placenta. When the mother and baby are in good condition, intra-uterine scanning is done to assess the degree of haemorrhage and continuous foetal monitoring is done to assess foetal condition.</p>
                            <p>If both mother and baby are well and gestation is under 37 weeks, she may be discharged and seen weekly at the antenatal clinic.</p>
                            <p>At 37 weeks gestation you should readmit the mother for induction. The membranes should be ruptured and she should be started on oxytocin drip and monitored half hourly for onset of labour. In case of foetal distress, Caesarean section should be performed.</p>

                            <p>Pre-eclampsia is a condition peculiar to pregnancy and occurring usually after the 28th week of gestation. It is characterised by the presence of hypertension, oedema and proteinuria or any two of the three. It is more common in the following conditions:</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>As you can see, it is important to take a good history as it will enable you to detect this condition early.</p>
                            <p>The cause of pre-eclampsia is not known, but there are various theories relating to its possible causes, which are endocrine in nature, metabolic or immunological.</p>

                            <h4>Diagnosis of Pre-eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>The diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is not easy since the mother has no obvious complaints. There are three cardinal signs.</p>

                            <h5>Hypertension</h5>
                            <p>There is a rise in diastolic pressure of 15 to 20mm/hg above the mother's normal diastolic pressure, or an increase above 80 to 90mm/hg on two occasions. A marked increase in systolic pressure above that expected for the mother's age is important to note, for example, 140 to 170 where the mother's normal pressure is between 90/60 and 120/70mm/hg.</p>

                            <h5>Proteinuria</h5>
                            <p>This is important in the absence of urinary tract infection. It may be detected in testing a midstream specimen of urine, which should be followed by laboratory investigation. The amount of protein in the urine indicates the severity of pre-eclampsia.</p>

                            <h5>Oedema</h5>
                            <p>Oedema of ankles is common in late pregnancy but it disappears overnight. This is known as physiological oedema. Any generalised oedema is significant and occult oedema is suspected in cases of excess weight gain above what is expected for the gestation. Clinical oedema may be mild or severe. The oedema puts on pressure and is found in the following areas:</p>
                            <p>Feet, ankles, and pretibial region; lower abdomen; vulva, which is uncomfortable and distressing to the mother; sacral area in a mother confined to bed; facial puffiness of the face and eye lids, fingers.</p>
                            <p>Pre-eclampsia can be classified as mild, moderate or severe.</p>

                            <h4>Mild Pre-eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>This is detected when, after resting, the diastolic pressure is 15 to 20mm/hg above the basal blood pressure recorded in early pregnancy or a diastolic above 80 to 90mm/hg, for example, BP 130/80 to 140/90. Oedema of feet, ankles and pretibial region may also be present.</p>

                            <h4>Moderate Pre-eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>This is diagnosed when there is marked rise in both systolic and diastolic pressure - 140/100 to 160/100mm/hg, proteinuria of 0.5gm/litre with no evidence of urinary tract infection and generalised oedema.</p>

                            <h4>Severe Pre-eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>Symptoms include the blood pressure exceeding 160/110mm/hg and an increased proteinuria over 1gm/litre. There may be marked generalised oedema, frontal headache and visual disturbances.</p>
                            <p>The effects of severe pre-eclampsia on the mother include:</p>

                            <p>The midwife plays an important role in detecting pre-eclampsia. There should always be vigilant antenatal care to enable early detection and management.</p>
                            <p>You should also ensure a thorough history taking to detect the mothers at risk early in pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>Follow up should include monitoring of weight and blood pressure and urine testing on every subsequent visit.</p>
                            <p>Factors that may predispose the patient to pre-eclampsia, such as multiple pregnancies and obesity should be noted early.</p>

                            <h4>Management of Pre-eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>The method of management will depend on the severity of the condition. The main principles of care are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Provide adequate rest and monitoring of observations to avoid eclampsia</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <h5>Mild Pre-eclampsia Management</h5>
                            <p>The mother should be advised on bed rest at home and she is seen weekly to assess her condition. She should be given anti-hypertensive drugs such as aldomet 500mg. Sedatives such as valium or phenobarbitone should also be administered to help her rest and she should be advised to report to the hospital in case of any problem.</p>

                            <h5>Moderate Pre-eclampsia Management</h5>
                            <p>The patient should be admitted to hospital for bed rest. She should only be allowed to go to the toilet. She should be nursed in sitting position or lying on the side to encourage uterine blood flow. Bed rest will reduce oedema by improving the renal circulation, facilitating kidney filtration and producing diuresis. It also lowers the blood pressure.</p>
                            <p>The patient's diet should be rich in protein, fibre and vitamins and low in carbohydrates and salt. Her weight should be recorded twice a week. Observe for oedema daily. Urine should be tested for protein and Ketones. Esbach setting is done daily to assess level of protein loss. Twenty four hour urine collection should be done to estimate oestriol level as an indication of placental function.</p>
                            <p>Fluid intake and output should be maintained strictly to monitor renal function.</p>
                            <p>Sedatives, such as phenobarbitone, may be given to ensure rest and sleep. Give antihypertensive drugs like aldomet to lower blood pressure. Take vital signs: blood pressure, temperature, pulse and respirations four hourly.</p>
                            <p>The foetal heart rate should be taken four hourly or two times daily, depending on the condition. A kick chart to monitor foetal movement should also be kept.</p>
                            <p>When the mother's condition improves, she can be discharged to attend clinic weekly until she goes into spontaneous labour. Otherwise, she should be admitted at 38 weeks for induction of labour. If, in spite of the above care, the condition does not improve, caesarean section should be performed.</p>

                            <h5>Management of Labour</h5>
                            <p>Remain with the mother throughout labour. Maintain close vigilant observations of:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Presence of oedema</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Urinary output</span></li>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Blood pressure</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Report any deviations to the doctor immediately. Take vital signs as follows: blood pressure and pulse rate half hourly, temperature four hourly, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
                            <p>Perform abdominal examination and observe for contractions and foetal heart rate half hourly. At the same time, observe for signs of second stage of labour and immediately alert both the obstetrician and paediatrician.</p>
                            <p>After delivery, monitor blood pressure four hourly for 24 hours. Urinalysis should be done twice a day. You should maintain a urinary output chart and continue with antihypertensive drugs and normal postnatal or caesarean section care.</p>

                            <h5>Active Management of Severe Pre-eclampsia</h5>
                            <p>Admit the mother in a quiet, dimly lit room on complete bedrest. In the room there should be an emergency tray and an epileptic tray in case of a fit. The aim of care is to prevent convulsions and control hypertension to prevent death of the mother and foetus.</p>
                            <p>Place the mother on lateral position to improve foetal circulation and to prevent vena cavae compression by the uterus. Remain with the mother and maintain vigilant observations. On admission you should take all observations and note them on a chart and continue half hourly or as prescribed by the doctor.</p>
                            <p>The doctor will prescribe antihypertensive drugs like hydrolysing 5-10mg which is administered slowly and blood pressure monitored every five minutes until it stabilises. Diazepam is also given 10mg stat followed by 40mg in 5% dextrose. Lasix 20 to 80mg may be given as a diuretic. Antibiotics may be prescribed if necessary. Strict monitoring of blood pressure should be done.</p>
                            <p>Maintain a strict intake and output chart and test all urine that is passed. In some cases an indwelling catheter may be passed. Fluid intake is restricted to one to two litres in 24 hours.</p>
                            <p>Esbach should be set daily. The weight should also be measured daily or on alternative days.</p>
                            <p>Administer medication as prescribed. Observe for signs of onset of labour and signs of impending eclampsia. If protenuria and high blood pressure persist, the doctor should induce labour by artificial rupture of membranes followed by syntocinon drip. Unless there is some obstetric contra-indication a caesarean section will be done.</p>
                            <p>You have seen that mothers with severe pre-eclampsia can proceed to eclampsia. The following are warning signs of impending eclampsia:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">A sharp rise in blood pressure</span></li>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Increased proteinuria</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Severe persistent frontal occipital headache</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Drowsiness or confusion (due to cerebral oedema)</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Blurring of vision or flashing lights (due to retinal oedema)</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Nausea and vomiting</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Epigastric pain which the mother may interpret as indigestion (due to oedema of the liver)</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Should a mother present to your clinic with these signs, give her an anticonvulsant and refer to hospital immediately for further management. In the hospital, the midwife should summon the doctor immediately.</p>

                            <h5>Care During Labour</h5>
                            <p>Treatment for severe pre-eclampsia should be continued. Perform a vaginal examination to assess the progress of labour. During the second stage, episiotomy should be performed to shorten the phase and the doctor will use vacuum extractor to prevent the mother from pushing. Ergometrine is avoided because of its vaso-constrictive effect and instead syntocinon 5 IV in a drip or intramuscularly is given. A Caesarean section may be performed if the condition does not improve or there is obstetric contra-indication for vaginal delivery.</p>

                            <h5>Post Delivery Care for Pre-eclampsia Cases</h5>
                            <p>Sedate the mother and continue observations of vital signs. Continue and adjust drugs as necessary.</p>

                            <h3>Eclampsia</h3>
                            <p>Eclampsia is an acute condition characterised by convulsions and coma. The incidence of eclampsia is 0.2 to 0.5% of all pregnancies. It can occur in the antenatal period at the rate of about 20%; during the intrapartum period at the rate of about 25% and during the postnatal period within the first few hours after delivery (35%).</p>

                            <h4>Signs and Symptoms of Eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>The prodromal signs of eclampsia are those we have described as serious signs of preeclampsia. The more immediate precursors of eclampsia are vomiting, intense headache and epigastric pain.</p>
                            <p>There are four stages of an eclampsia fit.</p>
                            <p><strong>Premonitory stage</strong>, which lasts 10 to 20 seconds. The mother is restless and rapid eye movements can be noted. The head may be drawn to one side, twitching of the facial muscles may occur, and the mother is not aware of what is happening.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>tonic stage</strong> lasts 10 to 20 seconds. The muscles of the mother's body go into spasms and become rigid. The back may become arched and her teeth become tightly clenched. The eyes appear like they are staring and her diaphragm goes into spasm. Respirations cease and cyanosis occurs.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>chronic stage</strong> lasts 60 to 90 seconds. There is violent contraction and intermitted relaxation of the mother's muscles causing convulsive movements. There is increased salivation and foaming at the mouth.</p>
                            <p>The mother's face becomes congested and bloated while her features become distorted. The mother becomes unconscious and breathing is stertorous while the pulse full and bounding. The convulsions subside gradually. In the stage of <strong>coma</strong> stertorous breathing continues and the coma may persist for minutes or hours. Further convulsions may occur before the mother regains consciousness.</p>
                            <p>Now move on to look at the management of eclampsia</p>

                            <h4>Management of Eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>The main principle of management is to stop convulsions and deliver the pregnant woman by the quickest and safest method. The mother's welfare is of paramount importance and the foetus is the secondary consideration as it is already in great danger.</p>

                            <p>After a fit continue oxygen therapy and, do not give oral fluids. Intravenous fluids should be restricted to 2000ml in 24 hours. Maintain strict fluid intake and output chart. Observe for signs of labour. Delivery is by vacuum extraction and sedation is continued. The baby should be nursed in the special care baby unit (nursery).</p>

                            <h3>Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy</h3>
                            <p>There are changes that occur in the cardiac system during pregnancy due to the increased demand in the foeto-placental unit. These changes increase the workload of the heart. The major changes are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Blood volume increases by 35%</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Cardiac output increases by 40%, that is from 4.5 to 6l/min</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The extra work that the heart has to do is reduced by the decreased blood viscosity and lowered peripheral resistance. The pulse rate rises slightly in order to pump out the extra blood around the body. Oxygen consumption is raised. The heart is displaced upwards during the last trimester by the gravid uterus. During the third stage of labour 300 to 400ml of blood is added to the circulating volume by the contracting uterus.</p>
                            <p>These changes commence in early pregnancy and gradually reach their maximum at the 30th week and are maintained until term.</p>

                            <h4>Risk Factors for Heart Disease</h4>
                            <p>The following factors predispose patients to heart disease:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Anaemia, which should be avoided and if present, vigorously treated.</span></li>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Strain of any form should be avoided and mothers should be encouraged to have enough rest and adequate sleep.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Exercises that induce breathlessness should be discouraged.</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Cardiac disease in pregnancy has been classified in four grades. These are:</p>

                            <dl>
                                <dt>Cardiac Grade I</dt>
                                <dd>In this grade, there are no symptoms but a heart murmur is discovered on general examination.</dd>
                                
                                <dt>Cardiac Grade II</dt>
                                <dd>There are symptoms during ordinary physical activity (breathlessness) but no symptoms when at rest.</dd>
                                
                                <dt>Cardiac Grade III</dt>
                                <dd>There are symptoms during mild physical activity. The mother is unable to perform ordinary daily activity. On slight exertion she gets exhausted and severely dyspnoeic and has anginal pain.</dd>
                                
                                <dt>Cardiac Grade IV</dt>
                                <dd>There are symptoms even at rest. There are signs of cardiac disease and heart failure.</dd>
                            </dl>

                            <p>Effects of cardiac disease in pregnancy</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The increase in blood volume and body weight causes strain on the already impaired heart.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The increased cardiac output reaches maximum at 30 weeks when the output is 25% above normal and, therefore, there is greater need for rest.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The normal venous dilation, which accompanies pregnancy, slows the venous return to the heart and, therefore, increases the difficulty in maintaining adequate output.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This results in an increased risk of thromboemboli and bacterial endocarditis and raised maternal mortality when blood flow is impaired. There also also risks to the foetus and these include intrauterine growth retardation, raised incidence of congenital heart disease, and raised risk of foetal loss.</p>

                            <p>The mother is followed up by obstetrician, cardiologist, haematologist and anaesthetist for effective management. The main aim of management is to maintain and improve the physical and psychological well being of both the mother and the foetus and to prevent complications.</p>
                            <p>Prenatal management for mild cardiac disease (Grades I &amp; II) should include:</p>

                            <h5>Management of Heart Disease (Grade III and IV)</h5>
                            <p>When managing a patient with severe cardiac disease, the following steps should be taken in the prenatal stage.</p>
                            <p>The patient should be nursed as a cardiac failure patient. She should be admitted on first contact for complete bed rest. The strain is greatest between the 23rd and 32nd weeks and so total nursing care should be given during that period. There should always be two nurses present to perform any procedure.</p>
                            <p>A very sick mother should be nursed in the propped up position and preferably in a cardiac bed. You should monitor foetal heart and foetal placental blood flow. Administer a diet low in salt and ensure adequate rest, through the use of sedatives if necessary. Maintain good hygiene. Administer drugs as prescribed by the doctor and treat anaemia. Ensure that there is social care and support by family members and social workers.</p>
                            <p>In terms of psychological care, it is very important to reassure the patient about her condition. Attend to her emotional needs and give counselling on reproductive health.</p>
                            <p>Intrapartum management usually involves an easy delivery due to hypoxia. Take the following measures:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Avoid exhaustion</span></li>

                            <p>In the second stage, avoid pushing and give episiotomy and vacuum extraction. No ergometrine should be administered. If there is any post partum haemorrhage, give syntometrine.</p>
                            <p>Puerperium management involves nursing in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for 48 hours. You should take the following steps:</p>

                            <p>Patient may collapse when uterus contracts returning more blood into circulation thus overloading the heart. To avoid this, the right hand is placed on the abdomen firmly above the umbilicus to decrease abdominal pressure.</p>
                            <p>Discourage mother from over breathing because it draws more blood to the heart. If syntocinon is given, it should be continuous infusion with a syringe pump (10 to 20 units). Lasix should be given half hour before commencing the drip. This also applies if blood is to be transfused.</p>

                            <p><strong>Puerperium</strong></p>
                            <p>Heart failure may occur suddenly during puerperium, especially if the patient has incompetence of the aortic valve.</p>
                            <p>The patient should be nursed on complete bed rest. Ensure adequate breathing and leg exercises to prevent embolism. Ambulate on the fourth to fifth day. You should continue antibiotics for two weeks</p>

                            <p>Anaemia is a deficiency in the quality or quantity of red blood cells with the result that the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is reduced. The normal haemoglobin level in a female is 12 to 14gm per deciliter. Anaemia is diagnosed in pregnant women when the haemoglobin level is below 10gm per deciliter.</p>
                            <p>The following are some of the signs and symptoms of anaemia:</p>

                            <p>Anaemia affects the patient in several ways. With regard to the mother, anaemia has the following effects:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <p>Anaemia also affects the foetus in the following ways:</p>

                            <h4>Degrees of Anaemia</h4>
                            <p>These are classified according to the severity in pregnancy:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Mild anaemia is when haemoglobin level is between 8.1gm/dl to 9.9gm/dl</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>In severe anaemia there is:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <p>You will now look at the types of anaemia commonly seen in pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Physiological Anaemia</h4>
                            <p>During pregnancy the blood plasma volume increases by 15% by the 10th week of gestation and 50% by the 32nd to the 35th week of pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>The red cells mass increases by 30%. These result in increased cardiac output from five to seven litres per minute.</p>
                            <p>These changes result in apparent anaemia but as this represents the normal pregnancy state, they should not be regarded as pathological.</p>

                            <h4>Iron Deficiency Anaemia</h4>
                            <p>During pregnancy approximately 1400gm of iron is needed during the entire period. Please note that this is given in small doses of about 200gm three times a day. This is necessary for:</p>

                                    <p>Absorption of iron is usually hindered by tea or coffee consumption, thus ascorbic acid is given to hasten iron absorption if one cannot stop taking tea or coffee.</p>

                            <p>Folic acid is required for the increased cell growth of both the mother and the foetus. The main causes of folic acid deficiency anaemia are:</p>

                            <h4>Management of Anaemia in Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>The management of a woman with anaemia depends on the type and severity of anaemia, and the duration of pregnancy.</p>

                            <h5>Mild Anaemia</h5>
                            <p>This is characterised by haemoglobin between 8.1 to 9.9gm/decilitre. At a gestation of 20 to 29 weeks, the woman is given haematinics and a diet rich in protein and iron.</p>
                            <p>At 30 to 36 weeks, the haemoglobin levels are checked, diet is emphasised and haematinics continued. These include oral iron, for example, ferrous sulphate 200mg three times daily.</p>
                            <p>Investigations are carried out to establish the cause of the anaemia, for example, malarial parasites, hookworms, sickle cell disease. The mother is given health messages on nutrition, rest and taking drugs as prescribed.</p>

                            <h5>Moderate Anaemia</h5>
                            <p>This is characterised by haemoglobin levels of between 5.1 to 8gm per decilitre. At gestation of 29 to 30 weeks investigations are carried out to establish the cause and institute treatment.</p>
                            <p>Haematinics are given and a total dose of parenteral inferon 50 mgs/mililitre is given in a slow intravenous infusion of normal saline after a test dose to rule out sensitivity.</p>
                            <p>Intramuscular iron in the form of sorbital 50mg/ml is also administered. The dose is 1.5mg/kg body weight weekly. Haemoglobin levels are monitored regularly starting on the third day after commencement of treatment and then monthly. The injection should not be given in conjunction with oral iron as this enhances toxic effects.</p>
                            <p>At 30 to 36 weeks of gestation the woman is given total dose inferon and transfused with no more than 500ml whole blood. The blood is given slowly under close supervision. After transfusion, the woman will be put on folic acid. At 37 weeks blood transfusion is given again as above.</p>
                            <p>Parenteral iron is contraindicated for women who have liver or renal conditions.</p>

                            <h5>Severe Anaemia</h5>
                            <p>This is characterised by haemoglobin below 5gm per decilitre. This is an emergency where the mother is admitted and put on complete bed rest to reduce cardiac workload as she could go into cardiac failure.</p>
                            <p>Investigations are carried out to establish the cause. Meanwhile, she is nursed in left lateral position to prevent compression of the vena cava by the gravid uterus. Vital observations are taken quarter hourly and the foetal heart rate is monitored.</p>
                            <p>Transfuse three units of packed cells slowly. Monitoring is continued quarter hourly. Administration of haematinics is continued.</p>
                            <p>In case of malaria, hookworm or sickle cell disease, the root cause of the anaemia is treated.</p>
                            <p>Health messages are shared on diet and general prevention.</p>

                            <h5>Management During Labour</h5>
                            <p>Blood is cross-matched and the patient is started on transfusion of packed cells only to avoid cardiac overload. Emergency drugs are kept ready. In the second stage of labour, oxygen is given and a vacuum extraction is carried out. Intravenous lasix is given. Syntocinon 40 to 60 units in half litre of 5% dextrose is given by pump.</p>

                                    <span class="callout-icon">⚠️</span>
                                    <h4 class="callout-title">Remember</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>Ergometrine is contra-indicated because it causes vaso-constriction.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>Blood loss should be minimised by rubbing the uterus to contract it. Controlled cord traction is used to deliver the placenta. The mother should avoid any exertion.</p>

                            <h5>Post Natal Care</h5>
                            <p>The mother is given antibiotics to prevent infection, and put on haematinics for three months. The haemoglobin is checked on the third and sixth week.</p>
                            <p>Family planning and good nutrition are encouraged.</p>
                            <p>If a pregnant woman has folic acid deficiency, you should give folic acid supplements and oral Iron. If she has vitamin B12 deficiency she should be given a weekly dose of 100mg of vitamin B12 injections until the condition is reversed.</p>

                            <h4>Prevention of Anaemia in Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>The prevention of anaemia in pregnancy involves taking the following steps.</p>

                            <h5>Health Education</h5>
                            <p>You should advise mothers in the antenatal clinic about a balanced diet. Green vegetables should not be overcooked as this destroys the folic acid. Teach them about proper disposal of faeces to avoid hookworm infestation. Encourage the practice of child spacing to avoid frequent pregnancies so as to give the woman's body time to replenish her body stores. In addition encourage her to continue coming to antenatal clinic.</p>

                            <h5>Prophylactic Medication</h5>
                            <p>Give the following supplements to the women throughout pregnancy:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Ferrous sulphate 200mg three times a day</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Folic acid 5mg daily</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Prophylactic anti malarial medication</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Ensure early detection and adequate treatment of malaria, anaemia, antepartum and postpartum haemorrhage.</p>

                            <h3>Diabetes in Pregnancy</h3>
                            <p>Diabetes is a metabolic disorder due to partial or total lack of insulin, characterised by hyperglycaemia. This may seriously complicate a pregnancy as you will see later on.</p>

                            <h4>Primary Diabetes</h4>
                            <p>Diabetes can be primary which involves abnormality of the pancreas and is sometimes called juvenile diabetes.</p>

                            <h4>Secondary Diabetes</h4>
                            <p>The other type of diabetes is known as secondary diabetes. It occurs later in life and could be due to a disease in the pancreas such as tumours or infection interfering with the normal production of insulin by the islets of Langerhan's. It can also first appear during pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Classification of diabetes mellitus in pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus is where the patient has abnormal blood sugar and is on insulin therapy to control the blood sugar levels.</p>
                            <p>Non Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus is where the patient has abnormal blood sugar but it is controlled by diet alone.</p>
                            <p>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus is where the patient develops abnormal glucose during pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>Potential Diabetic is where the individual has an increased tendency to develop the disease during pregnancy, due to having delivered an unduly large baby (4.5kg or more), family history of diabetes, chronic obesity or glycosuria.</p>

                            <h4>Carbohydrate Metabolism in Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>There are a lot of changes, which occur due to pregnancy and some of these changes will be covered now.</p>

                            <h5>Fall in fasting blood sugar</h5>
                            <p>The foetus obtains glucose from its mother via the placenta by the process of diffusion. From the 10th week of pregnancy there is progressive fall in maternal fasting glucose from 4 to 3.6 mmol/l.</p>

                            <h5>Ketoacidosis</h5>
                            <p>During the third trimester the mother begins to utilise fat stores laid down in the first and second trimester. This results in free fatty acids and glycerol in the blood stream and the woman becomes ketotic more easily.</p>

                            <h5>Hormonal Effect</h5>
                            <p>The foeto-placental unit alters the mother's carbohydrate metabolism to make glucose more readily available. Human Placental Lactogen hormone (HPL), manufactured by the placenta, causes resistance to insulin in the maternal tissues. The blood remains raised for a longer period than in the non-pregnant state.</p>
                            <p>The extra demands on the pancreatic beta cells can precipitate glucose intolerance or overt diabetes in those whose capacity for producing insulin was just adequate prior to pregnancy. If the mother was already diabetic before pregnancy, her insulin need will be further increased.</p>

                            <h5>Glycosuria in Pregnancy</h5>
                            <p>Glycosuria in pregnancy is not diagnostic of diabetes because there is:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">An increase in glomerular filtration rate as it passes through the proximal convoluted tubule faster than the reabsorption</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Lowered renal threshold to glucose for the diabetic, which leads to more glucose in the glomerular filtrate</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Renal tubular damage interferes with glucose re-absorption and may be revealed for the first time during pregnancy</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You will now cover the different grades of diabetes.</p>

                            <h4>Potential Diabetes</h4>
                            <p>Potential diabetes is indicated by various criteria, for example, one or both parents are diabetic, or the mother has previously borne an unduly large baby. Usually, there is marked chronic obesity and glycosuria.</p>

                            <h4>Chemical</h4>
                            <p>Chemical diabetes is characterised by abnormal Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT) but is without symptoms.</p>

                            <h4>Overt or Clinical</h4>
                            <p>This is indicated by abnormal GTT with symptoms and raised fasting blood glucose level.</p>

                            <h4>The Effects of Pregnancy on Diabetes</h4>
                            <p>When the mother has diabetes and then becomes pregnant, there will be further increase in insulin demand and even a mother who had only been on a controlled diet, without need for medication, may now require insulin supplements. This is due to low renal threshold to glucose and also low glucose intake by mother due to nausea and vomiting.</p>
                            <p>The mother easily gets ketoacidosis as the fat is broken down. In late pregnancy, insulin requirements are still high as there is reduced sensitivity of the tissues to due to the Human Placental Lactogen hormone. Those with juvenile diabetes may progress to nephropathy hence kidney failure and retinopathy leading to blindness.</p>

                            <h4>The Effects of Diabetes on Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>It is important to know what happens to the mother and foetus in relation to glucose and insulin control and the effects.</p>

                            <h5>Effects of Diabetes on the Mother</h5>
                            <p>Unrecognised or a badly treated diabetes leads to complications in both the mother and the baby. If well controlled, then the effects to pregnancy may be minimal.</p>
                            <p>Maternal complications include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Urinary tract infection</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The foetal and neonatal complications occur when the blood sugar is not controlled and are mainly due to glucose being attached to the haemoglobin (glycosulated haemoglobin). This results into impaired oxygen carrying capacity resulting in the following conditions.</p>

                            <h5>Macrosoma</h5>
                            <p>Glucose crosses the placental barrier easily but insulin does not. Hyperglycaemia in the mother is reflected by foetal hyperglycaemia in late pregnancy. The foetal pancreas responds by producing excess insulin, which cannot cross back into the maternal circulation. The insulin converts excess glucose into glycogen, which is stored as fat deposits in the tissues resulting in a big baby.</p>

                            <h5>Foetal Hypoxia</h5>
                            <p>Intrauterine hypoxia is caused by vascular changes on the maternal side of the placenta, and increased oxygen consumption by the placenta and foetus. The foetal haemoglobin is glycosurated hence there is an increase in the red blood cells count (polycythaemia) in order to compensate for the demand of oxygen by the foetus. The baby is red due to polycythaemia.</p>

                            <h5>Congenital Malformations</h5>
                            <p>Poor control of sugar in the first seven weeks of pregnancy leads to congenital malformation. The most common occurrence is sacral agenesis which includes anencephaly and spina bifida. The cardiovascular system will have ventricular septal defects and transposition of the great vessels.</p>
                            <p>Other conditions that may transpire include intrauterine death as a result of too severe maternal ketosis. There may be increased perinatal death soon after birth from hypoglycaemia and respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn.</p>
                            <p>The babies are also prone to jaundice and hypocalcaemia. Birth trauma is also possible due to their large size and all these increase the risk of perinatal mortality if not well managed. Perinatal mortality is high in mothers who have developed nephropathy and retinopathy. Such women should avoid pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Risk Factors of Diabetes Mellitus</h4>
                            <p>At this point you will deal with those who are predisposed to diabetes in pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>Certain women are at risk of developing gestational diabetes during pregnancy and may be identified when the history reveals one or more of the following:</p>

                            <h4>Diagnosis of Diabetes During Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>Diagnosis of diabetes includes assessing the obstetric history of the patient which may include</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Unduly large babies</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The potential diabetic state of the woman should also be assessed. Checking for glycosuria two hours after a meal involves the use of reagent strips or tablets if approximately 6.7mmol/1 (20mg/dl) GTT. A full GTT involves:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Fasting blood sample for glucose level</span></li>

                            <p>The aim of GTT is to assess body response to a glucose load. The level of glucose should gradually decrease in the blood as follows:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Fasting blood glucose: 5.8mmol/l</span></li>

                            <p>After ingestion, the blood glucose rises initially but returns to normal within a given length of time. At 28 to 34 weeks gestation, if after giving glucose and testing of venous sample, you find two out of four samples exceed the above, then a diagnosis can be made.</p>

                            <h4>Pre Natal Care of the Diabetic Case</h4>
                            <p>A mother who is at risk of developing diabetes during her pregnancy should be taken care of by the diabetic specialist, obstetrician, dietician and midwife. Ideally preconception counselling is done and the mother is stabilised. If she has nephropathy or retinopathy, pregnancy should be avoided. The aim of prenatal care is the control of blood sugar. To avoid hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia adjust the insulin dose.</p>

                                    <p>Maintain blood glucose level within the normal range of 4.0 - 5.5mmol/l. Ensure that post-delivery the blood sugar does not exceed 7.2mmols/l. Prolong the pregnancy to ensure foetal viability.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>Once diagnosed, the mother should be followed up keenly by the two doctors fortnightly up to 32 weeks gestation and then weekly up to term.</p>
                            <p>Admission may be undertaken at 12 weeks and 32 weeks for stabilisation when hormonal changes may affect the mother. Hospitalisation is also done in case any complication or infection occurs.</p>

                            <h5>Stabilisation</h5>
                            <p>This is the care given to the admitted mother to bring the blood sugar down and maintain it. A daily urinalysis should be carried out six hourly using dextrostix, and also when necessary. Blood sugar should be measured twice weekly or daily if high.</p>
                            <p>Short acting insulin subcutaneously given on a sliding scale (measure) helps to avoid gross foetal abnormality. Scanning is done to assess the foetal maturity/growth and an x-ray may be carried out after 30 weeks gestation. The foetal wellbeing is also monitored by the mother noting the frequency of the foetal kicks.</p>
                            <p>Any infection, for example urinary tract infections, has to be detected early and appropriate treatment given. At term a pelvimentry is done to assess pelvic adequacy.</p>
                            <p>Once the mother is stabilised, she is discharged to continue with prenatal clinic fortnightly or weekly depending on the gestation. The mother is readmitted at 37 to 38 weeks for induction of labour if she has not gone into spontaneous labour.</p>

                            <h5>Weight Monitoring</h5>
                            <p>A dietician should be consulted but diet with high fibre produces a more constant blood glucose as carbohydrate is released for absorption more slowly. The need for carbohydrate increases as the foetus grows and must be reviewed.</p>

                            <h4>Management of the Diabetic Case During Labour</h4>
                            <p>After the good care prenatally you still have to maintain observation during labour and delivery. The mothers who are at risk, for instance those with a bad obstetric history, the elderly primigravidae, the mother with pre-eclampsia and a baby that is too big, should not deliver vaginally.</p>
                            <p>At 36 to 38 weeks the mother is admitted for elective Caesarean section. On the day of operation, the morning dose of insulin is omitted. However, if the operation is performed at a late hour then one third or half of the intermediate acting dose of insulin should be given in the morning before starting the drip.</p>
                            <p>Premature delivery is not necessary if the diabetes is well controlled. If labour starts spontaneously prematurely, then dexamethasone is given to aid in lung maturity or salbutamol (ventolin) to relax the uterus. The drugs are given with care as they increase insulin requirements.</p>
                            <p>Aim at controlling blood sugar between 4 to 5mmol/l.</p>
                            <p>Hyperglycaemia increases foetal insulin production, which usually causes neonatal hypoglycaemia. The patient may be allowed a light breakfast or nil by mouth. In some cases subcutaneous insulin is given to mothers with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.</p>

                            <h4>Induction of Labour in a Diabetic Mother</h4>
                            <p>To induce labour, artificial rupture of the membranes is done and oxytocin is put in normal saline, which is regulated depending on the uterine contractions.</p>
                            <p>For the nutritional needs and to prevent hypoglycaemia, a drip of 10% dextrose is set up and regulated at 20 drops per minute.</p>
                            <p>Soluble insulin is given by syringe pump at six units in 60ml of normal saline. This is regulated depending on the blood sugar levels. Throughout labour the blood sugar is checked hourly. If the results are lower than 4mmol/l, reduce the insulin dose by half. If they are higher, double the dose and check blood sugar every 30 minutes.</p>

                            <div class="callout callout--warning">

                                    <p>Long acting insulin is NOT given during induction of labour because the insulin requirements fall by about 50 percent once the placenta is delivered.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>Vigilant observations of the general condition of the mother, uterine contractions, foetal heart rate, maternal pulse half hourly, blood pressure, vaginal examination four hourly, and urinalysis two hourly (or more frequently) are made and charted on the partograph accordingly every half, two and four hours. Any deviation from the normal should be noted and the doctor informed. Sedatives and analgesics, which could depress the foetal respiratory centre, should be avoided. The physical care of the mother is maintained. The drips are regulated accurately. If the mother has not delivered within eight hours, she is reassessed and caesarean section is performed.</p>
                            <p>During delivery a paediatrician should be present to take care of the baby immediately after birth. The principles of managing the baby after birth involve clearing the airway, providing warmth, giving oxygen and preventing hypoglycaemia and hypocalcaemia. The baby is admitted in the baby unit for management after the resuscitative measures are carried out.</p>

                            <h4>Postnatal Care of the Diabetic Mother</h4>
                            <p>The care of a diabetic mother after delivery is very important as it enhances the previous care. You will note that after delivery of the placenta the carbohydrate metabolism returns to normal almost immediately. Thus, the insulin dose has to be reduced by half immediately to avoid hypoglycaemia.</p>
                            <p>The intravenous infusion is maintained until the next meal. Meanwhile, the blood sugar has to be constantly checked and levels controlled within the normal range and the insulin dose adjusted accordingly. When she is breast feeding, the mother will need increased intake of carbohydrate by 50gm a day. Small amounts of insulin enter the breast milk but these are destroyed in the baby's stomach.</p>
                            <p>A diabetic mother is more prone to infection so care should be exercised to prevent it. On discharge, the health messages shared with the mother should include: diet, insulin administration, post natal and diabetic check up, personal hygiene, baby care and immunisation and so on.</p>
                            <p>Now you have gone through diabetes in pregnancy you must have realised that, if well managed, the risk to both mother and baby can be minimised. Throughout pregnancy, labour and delivery, the blood sugar should be controlled between 4-6mmols/l.</p>
                            <p>Attendants should be very keen to identify complications and manage the woman appropriately. You should also be able to decide the mode of delivery, which is either per vaginal or elective caesarean section. If the mother has not gone into spontaneous labour at term, induction of labour should be done under the supervision of an obstetrician, a diabetician and a paediatrician.</p>

                            <h3>Malaria in Pregnancy</h3>
                            <p>As you know, malaria is a very common condition in Kenya. You will cover malaria in detail later in the course.</p>
                            <p>In this unit you will cover the effects malaria may have on the course of pregnancy as it affects the health of the mother.</p>
                            <p>Malaria can cause the following in a pregnant woman and the foetus:</p>

                            <h3>Tuberculosis in Pregnancy</h3>
                            <p>Tuberculosis will be covered in more detail later in the course. In this unit only the effects of tuberculosis on pregnancy will be covered.</p>
                            <p>The incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in Kenya seems to be on the increase because of its association with the HIV and AIDS epidemic.</p>

                            <h4>How does tuberculosis present in a pregnant woman?</h4>
                            <p>Clinical presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis in pregnancy may be asymptomatic but typical symptoms include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            </ul>
                            <p>Women with advanced pulmonary tuberculosis are often anaemic and may go into premature labour. Some of them will present with severe breathlessness secondary to pleural effusion or empyema thoracis. Those who are anaemic will not respond to haematinics until the tuberculosis infection is brought under control.</p>
                            <p>Diagnosis of tuberculosis in pregnancy can be done by:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Sputum smear</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <h4>Management of Tuberculosis in Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>The aim of treatment is to make the mother sputum negative by the time the baby is born. A sputum positive mother can transmit the disease to her baby. The mother is admitted until the disease is controlled. This is mandatory. Chemotherapy is commonly used. Other therapies include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Streptomycin and thiazina (TH). Streptomycin is given for 60 days (intramuscularly injection) and TH for 18 months.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">An alternate short term therapy regime may be preferred and the commonly used one is a combination of rifampicin, ethambutol, isoniazid and Para AminoSalicycin acid (PAS) for a period of six to nine months.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>During labour necessary steps should be taken to observe infection prevention measures to avoid development of puerperal sepsis. Care should be taken to avoid post partum haemorrhage, which may lead to anaemia during puerperium.</p>
                            <p>The mother is encouraged to breastfeed but remember to protect the baby from tuberculosis by giving prophylactic Isoniazid (INAH, 25mg per kg per day). INAH resistant BCG should be given since ordinary BCG may be inhibited by INAH. If INAH resistant BCG is not available, the baby should be given ordinary BCG at birth and separated from its mother for two weeks.</p>
                            <p>If the baby still gives a negative reaction to tuberculosis at six to eight weeks, it should be re-vaccinated with INAH resistant BCG and prophylaxis should be maintained with INAH for a further six weeks until mantoux conversion occurs.</p>

                            <h3>Urinary Tract Infections</h3>
                            <p>Although Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) also occur to women who are not pregnant, it is a common problem among pregnant women. In a pregnant woman, this infection presents in different forms, some of which are serious, and others of mild consequence. The common conditions of urinary tract infection in pregnancy are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Asymptomatic bacteriuria</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Acute cystitis</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Acute pyelonephritis</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Asymptomatic bacteriuria is more common in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. The condition is also twice as common in pregnant women with sickle cell trait and three times in those with diabetes as compared to normal pregnant women.</p>
                            <p>A woman with asymptomatic UTI may feel nothing except a slight pain when passing urine. She may also have offensive smelling urine. If the condition remains untreated during pregnancy, about 25 to 35% of these women will develop acute pyelonephritis.</p>
                            <p>Acute pyelonephritis occurs in two percent of all pregnant women and its effect may be fatal to the mother and/or her foetus. This occurs in those women with previous asymptomatic bacteriuria.</p>
                            <p>Acute cystitis is less common in pregnancy than asymptomatic bacteriuria. However, it causes more concern because of its symptoms.</p>
                            <p>As stated earlier, urinary tract infection occurs more frequently in pregnancy. This is because:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The pregnant uterus causes pressure on the ureters and the bladder which delays emptying.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The action of hormones on the smooth muscles of the ureters and bladder also causes them to relax and dilate easily. This causes urine to move more slowly down the dilated tubes and infection lodges in them easily.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Normally the urinary tract mucosa is highly sensitive to invading organisms and the ureters go into spasmodic contractions to get rid of such invaders.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Clinical Presentation of Urinary Tract Infection in Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>Asymptomatic bacteriuria is usually diagnosed based on laboratory investigations. E-coli is the most common organism causing this condition and accounts for 80% of the cases.</p>
                            <p>Acute cystitis presents with urinary frequency and urgency, dysuria, suprapubic discomfort, urine is cloudy with offensive smell and if cultured, bacteria cells are identified.</p>
                            <p>In acute pyelonephritis, the patient will present with the following symptoms:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <h4>Management of Urinary Tract Infections</h4>
                            <p>Where possible, refer all suspected cases for further investigations and management to an obstetrician in hospital. In case this is difficult, give the patient a broad spectrum antibiotic such as ampicillin 500mg, six hourly for two weeks and assess her regularly to make sure that the pus cells are cleared.</p>
                            <p>If there is no improvement within 48 hours, refer the patient to hospital. In the hospital, a urine specimen will be collected for culture and sensitivity. The appropriate antibiotics will be prescribed.</p>
                            <p>Advise the patient to clean the vulva area from front to back to avoid contamination with faecal matter from the rectum.</p>

                            <h3>Pregnancy and HIV</h3>
                            <h4>Effects of Pregnancy on HIV</h4>
                            <p>Pregnancy is a very important and emotional period for a woman. There are many issues and concerns that HIV/AIDS presents to pregnant mothers, their partners, their families and health care workers during this period.</p>
                            <p>In the early asymptomatic phase of HIV disease, pregnancy does not seem to have any significant effect on the progress of HIV. However, pregnancy will greatly affect women whose defence mechanism has already been destroyed. Pregnancy in such women will make the disease progress rapidly to full blown AIDS.</p>

                            <h4>Effects of HIV on Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>HIV infection on the other hand, does not usually appear to seriously affect the pregnancy. However, HIV infection may cause an increased likelihood of intra uterine growth retardation, prematurity, still births and congenital infection.</p>
                            <p>An HIV positive woman has about 30% chance of transmitting the HIV virus to her infant. This may occur during pregnancy, at childbirth, or during breastfeeding.</p>

                            <h4>HIV Screening During Pregnancy</h4>
                            <p>HIV screening during pregnancy needs careful sensitive consideration. The decision to screen a woman for HIV infection is a joint consideration between the health worker and the woman, but the woman herself should make the final decision.</p>
                            <p>Any HIV testing must be accompanied by careful and adequate pre test counselling with proper post test counselling and support. Confidentiality of the results is important. There are many advantages of knowing whether a woman is HIV positive during her pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Advantages</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <p>The possibility of transmitting the infection to the foetus will raise many other problems and considerations for the mother and her partner.</p>

                            <p>If the HIV infection is newly diagnosed, the woman is under a lot of stress and will need a lot of support and counselling.</p>
                            <p>The health care services and the health workers should make a great effort to establish good support and care structures to manage women, their partners and their newborns. Support and care will need to be considered for the family.</p>

                            <p>It is very important to be on the look out for the development of any HIV related conditions, especially for infections such as vaginal and oral thrush and other opportunistic infections such as herpes. Other infections which should be treated are respiratory infections, diarrhoea, skin infections, sexually transmitted diseases and Kaposis sarcoma.</p>
                            <p>It is important to provide counselling for encouragement and support to the HIV positive mother and her partner throughout the pregnancy. It is also important to start preparing them for possible problems that may occur after the pregnancy, that is, whether to breast or bottle feed the baby, possibility of HIV diagnosis in the baby and the care and treatment that may be necessary.</p>
                            <p>During delivery, every effort should be made to avoid even minor trauma to the baby before birth as this may promote transmission of the virus to the baby. All injection sites on the newborn must be properly cleaned before inserting the needle to make sure the mothers' blood is not on the skin.</p>
                            <p>Breastfeeding should be avoided if the mother can safely feed her infant with other milk feeds.</p>
                            <p>BCG immunisation should be given to the newborn as usual, unless the infant is very ill. The usual postpartum care should be given to the mother.</p>
