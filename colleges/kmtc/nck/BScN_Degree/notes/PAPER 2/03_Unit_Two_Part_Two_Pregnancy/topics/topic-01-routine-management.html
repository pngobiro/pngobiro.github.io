                            <p>In unit one of this module you were introduced to the Safe Motherhood Initiative (SMI) and child survival. You learnt that one of the pillars of safe motherhood and child survival was antenatal care. In this section you are going to study antenatal care in detail.</p>

                            <h3>The Aims of Antenatal Care</h3>

                            <p>In order for you to provide good quality antenatal care, you must achieve the following aims:</p>

                            <p>You will now look at factors that influence the maternal and perinatal mortality rates.</p>
                            <p>Maternal mortality refers to the death of the mother during pregnancy or within 42 days after the termination of pregnancy. The cause may be related to or aggravated by pregnancy, labour or puerperium. Data from the 2003 Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS) estimated maternal mortality ratio at 414 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.</p>
                            <p>Perinatal mortality includes stillbirths, which is the death of the foetus after 28 weeks and neonatal deaths, that is, death during the first week of life. According to the 2003 KDHS, the results indicate that perinatal mortality rate is 40 deaths per 1,000 pregnancies.</p>
                            
                            <p>A successful outcome of the pregnancy depends on the following two general factors:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The reproductive efficiency of the mother</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The standard of obstetric care</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The reproductive efficiency of the woman, in turn, depends on the following factors:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The age of the mother</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Her parity</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Her physique and stature</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Her general state of health</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You will now cover each factor separately, starting with the age of the mother.</p>

                            <h4>Age of Mother</h4>
                            <p>The optimum age for child bearing is between the age of 18 and 35 years. Pregnancy occurring below 18 years of age leads to a high incidence of prematurity and perinatal mortality rate. Since adolescent girls have not yet grown to their full stature, obstructed labour with all its disastrous results is very common.</p>
                            <p>After the age of 35, babies are usually considerably large, and the pelvic joints stiffer, thus they do not give room easily. Uterine dysfunction with slow dilatation of the cervix is common. Childbearing towards the end of the woman's reproductive life carries additional risk. Hypertension, other vascular diseases, and renal degenerative conditions begin to appear, leading to placental insufficiency.</p>

                            <h4>Parity</h4>
                            <p>The risks in pregnancy for the mother and child are relatively high in the first pregnancy. They then drop sharply in the second and third and then slowly rise in subsequent pregnancies. Therefore, by the sixth pregnancy the risks to this multipara exceed those of the primigravida and thereafter rise more steeply with each pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>A grand multipara is likely to get complications in pregnancy and labour.</p>
                            <p>Iron deficiency anaemia, which occurs because pregnancy and lactation deplete the woman's iron stores.</p>
                            <p>Malpresentation because of over relaxed abdominal muscles, that is, muscles that are not firm.</p>
                            <p>Uterine rupture due to obstructed labour and malpresentation.</p>
                            <p>Postpartum haemorrhage, which occurs because the uterus has fibrous tissues and is overstretched due to repeated pregnancies. This causes uterine atony. This occurs when the uterine muscle has lost the tone.</p>
                            <p>Cephalo-pelvic disproportion, that is, babies tend to be larger with each succeeding pregnancy. Disproportion may, therefore, occur after many subsequent pregnancies.</p>

                            <div class="callout callout--warning">
                                <div class="callout-header">
                                    <span class="callout-icon">⚠️</span>

                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>As a health worker you should not unduly rely on the security of a good past obstetric history. If you do, you may easily overlook signs of trouble in pregnancy or labour in a multipara.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <h4>Physique and Stature</h4>
                            <p>The maternal height is a very valuable measure of reproductive efficiency. In any community, the shortest height group has the highest perinatal mortality and the highest prematurity rate. Women below 150cms by height are at risk of cephalo-pelvic disproportion. On the other hand, women who are obese are more at risk of getting pre-eclampsia.</p>

                            <h4>Maternal Health</h4>
                            <p>The reproductive efficiency of the woman also depends on the woman's general state of health. If she starts off her pregnancy in poor health, she is likely to deteriorate throughout her pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>Factors that make a woman more vulnerable to a difficult pregnancy</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Low social status, which means the woman, may not be able to afford good nutrition or medical care. She, at the same time, is likely to live in a poor environment, conducive to infections.</span></li>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Poor nutrition because of frequent and closely spaced pregnancies, when a woman's body is depleted of nutrients. This is known as maternal depletion syndrome. Also, because of certain beliefs and taboos, some women regard some foods such as eggs as harmful to them during pregnancy.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Infectious diseases, because immunity to infection is weakened during pregnancy. Infections such as AIDS, malaria, amoebic dysentery, and infective hepatitis, are particularly severe during pregnancy.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Anaemia, which is caused by a number of factors such as hookworm infestation, is common in rural areas, especially where there are no latrines. You will learn more about anaemia in pregnancy in section two of this unit.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Many women still deliver without the care of a skilled attendant. People who are unskilled and untrained still deliver many women in unhygienic conditions. There is a high risk of rupture of uterus and other complications.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Antenatal Care</h3>
                            <h4>Activities at the First Antenatal Visit</h4>
                            <p>The first antenatal visit should take place as early as possible, preferably in the first trimester. It is an opportunity to collect baseline data about the mother, for example, weight, blood pressure and so on. This baseline data is important because it forms a basis for comparison during later visits. Also, during the first visit, any other abnormalities can be detected and treated before they have a detrimental effect.</p>
                            <p>The activities of the first visit include:</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>You will now review each of these activities in a bit more detail.</p>

                            <h4>Registration</h4>
                            <p>Every pregnant woman that comes to the antenatal clinic should be registered and given an antenatal card.</p>

                            <h4>Weight and Height Measurement</h4>
                            <p>Measure height and weight and record them on the card. A woman with a height below 150cms is likely to have cephalopelvic disproportion. Excessive weight gain, that is, more than 1kg per week indicates accumulation of fluid in the tissues (oedema). A lack of increase in weight or weight loss may mean malnutrition.</p>

                            <h3>History Taking</h3>
                            <p>When you take the history you should include the following:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Particulars of the mother, which include the name, age, marital status, religion, and address.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">History of the present pregnancy, which includes the date of the first day of the last normal menstrual period, the parity and gravidity. From this, calculate and record the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) by adding seven days to the first day of the last normal menstrual period and subtracting three months from that month. For example, if her last period started on 18th June, 18 plus 7 gives you 25. Then June minus three months, (6-3) will give March. So the EDD is March 25th of the following year.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Gynaecological history, which will include the menstrual history, any past operations for gynaecological complaints and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Past obstetric history, for which you should ask the mother about the outcomes or complications of each of the previous pregnancies. Inquire into whether she delivered at home or at a hospital. Ask for the birth weights of the children, whether they were breastfed and whether they are alive or not.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>General Medical History</h4>
                            <p>Ask about any serious medical diseases likely to affect pregnancy and labour such as heart diseases, diabetes mellitus, renal diseases, tuberculosis and sickle cell disease.</p>

                            <h4>Surgical History</h4>
                            <p>Find out about injuries to the pelvis and spine, operations on the abdomen and blood transfusion.</p>

                            <h4>Physical Examination</h4>
                            <p>A thorough examination is made at the first visit. This is divided into a general examination and an obstetric examination. The general examination should include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">General appearance, namely the nutritional status, whether weak or sick looking. Note the gait and if she walks with a limp.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Height, noting that any woman below 150cms in height is likely to have cephalopelvic disproportion.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Weight, that is, a pregnant woman on average gains 2kg every month. The total weight gain by the end of pregnancy is about 10-20kg. Excessive weight gain indicates accumulation of fluid in the tissues (oedema). Lack of increase in weight or loss may mean malnutrition. Obesity may lead to an increased risk of gestational diabetes.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Blood pressure, which is taken in order to ascertain the normal and provide a baseline for comparison. A pressure of 140/90mm/Hg at booking is indicative of hypertension and could cause damage to the placenta.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Signs of anaemia in conjunctiva, hands and tongue.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Check for oedema of face, hands and ankles</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Observe type of breathing and chest generally for abnormalities.</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Breast Examination</h4>
                            <p>Palpate gently with the flat of the hand to feel for any lumps. Check if the nipple is protractile. Educate the woman on how to examine the breasts by herself.</p>

                            <h4>Obstetric Examination (Abdominal)</h4>
                            <p>An obstetric examination aims at:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Observing for signs of pregnancy</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Assessing foetal size and growth</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Assessing foetal health</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Diagnosing the location of foetal parts</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Detecting any deviation from normal</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The client is asked to empty her bladder and then to lie on her back on a couch with the arms by her sides. Inspect the abdomen for the shape, size, scars and foetal movements. Any abnormality detected is referred for further investigations.</p>
                            <p>Estimate the height of the fundus and compare it with the weeks of amenorrhoea. This helps you to assess foetal growth and detect any deviations from the normal. Check for varicosities at the back of the leg. Ask the woman to remove any tight clothing at the leg. At this time it is also important to check for phlebitis by looking for any reddened areas.</p>
                            <p>Palpate the sides of the abdomen to locate the foetal back in order to determine the position. You do this by facing the patient and then supporting the uterus with your right hand. Keep pushing the foetus with your left hand towards the right. Reverse the order to feel the left side of the uterus.</p>
                            <p>Palpate the lower pole of the uterus, just above the pelvic brim. Ask the mother to bend her knees slightly in order to relax the abdominal muscles and ask her to breathe steadily with her mouth open. Facing the foot of the bed, mark the brim of the pelvis with your hands and cup what presents between them. If the head is presenting, a smooth surface will be felt. If you do not find the head in the pelvic brim or at the fundus, suspect a transverse lie. This will be significant only after the 36th week of gestation.</p>
                            <p>The foetal heart sounds are listened to last, so as to assess the foetal wellbeing. The Pinard's foetal stethoscope is commonly used to hear the foetal heart.</p>
                            <p>As you perform the physical examination, talk to the mother and check her facial reaction as you palpate the abdomen. When you complete the procedure reassure the mother.</p>

                            <h4>Findings of Abdominal Examinations</h4>
                            <p>All these are recorded upon completion of the exercise and they include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Gestational age, which is estimated as per the size of the fundus.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Lie, which refers to the relationship between the long axis of the foetus and that of the mother and can either be longitudinal, transverse or oblique.</span></li>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Presentation, which means the foetal part that is lying at the pelvic brim or in the lower pole of the uterus and can either be vertex, breach, face, shoulder or brow. The most common is the vertex. Note that vertex/brow/face all refer to head presentation.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Denominator is the name given to the presenting part for example, occiput for vertex, sacrum for breech and mentum for face.</span></li>
