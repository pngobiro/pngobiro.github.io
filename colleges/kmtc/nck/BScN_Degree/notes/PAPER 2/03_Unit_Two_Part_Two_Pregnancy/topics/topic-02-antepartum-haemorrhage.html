                            <p>Bleeding in late pregnancy refers to any bleeding from the genital tract from the 28th week of gestation and before the birth of the baby. It is usually known as antepartum haemorrhage.</p>

                                    <p>Never perform a vaginal examination on a woman with antepartum haemorrhage. This may lead to severe bleeding which can be fatal.</p>

                            <p>The two most important causes of bleeding in late pregnancy are placenta praevia and abruptio placentae. You will now look at each of these separately.</p>

                            <h3>Placenta Praevia</h3>
                            <p>This is bleeding from a partially separated placenta, which is wholly or partially situated in the lower uterine segment. It might be covering either part or the entire internal os.</p>
                            <p>It is more likely to occur with increasing maternal age. It is more common in women aged 35 and above. It is also associated with increasing parity, and is twice as common in multigravida as in primigravida.</p>
                            <p>Placenta praevia is divided into four types or degrees.</p>

                            <h4>Signs and Symptoms of Placenta Praevia</h4>
                            <p>The signs and symptoms of placenta praevia include painless vaginal bleeding which starts when at rest or sleeping. It starts suddenly, usually from the 32nd week of gestation because of Braxton Hicks contractions.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, because the placenta occupies the lower uterine segment, the foetal head remains high, which results in malpresentation and unstable lie. If bleeding is severe, the blood pressure is low, the pulse and respirations are high, and there is shock corresponding with the amount of bleeding.</p>

                            <h4>The Management of Placenta Praevia</h4>
                            <p>If in a health centre or dispensary, refer all pregnant women with vaginal bleeding to hospital. Ensure there is a running intravenous drip of saline or dextrose before transferring the patient to the hospital. A nurse should always accompany the patient to the hospital.</p>
                            <p>In the hospital the type of management will depend on the amount of blood loss, the condition of the mother and foetus, the location of the placenta and the gestation period.</p>
                            <p>The aim of management is to control haemorrhage and to try to conserve the pregnancy up to 38 weeks gestation when the foetus is mature.</p>
                            <p>Where there is slight vaginal bleeding, conservative treatment is started if the pregnancy has not reached 38 weeks of gestation. The patient is admitted for complete bed rest and total care.</p>

                            <h4>Measures to be Taken in the Case of Placenta Praevia</h4>

                            <p>There are three clinical presentations.</p>
                            <p>Mixed or combined, where bleeding is partly revealed and partly concealed.</p>
                            <p>Concealed, where the blood is trapped between the placenta, membranes and the uterine wall. There is no visible bleeding.</p>
                            <p>External or revealed, which is where there is free (visible) vaginal haemorrhage.</p>

                            <h4>Signs and Symptoms of Abruptio Placentae</h4>
                            <p>In the revealed type, there is slight to severe vaginal bleeding. On abdominal palpation there may or may not be pain and tenderness. The pulse is raised and there is low blood pressure or hypertension.</p>
                            <p>In the concealed type, there is severe abdominal pain and the patient is in shock. There is no vaginal bleeding and the uterus is very tender and is board like. The foetal parts cannot be palpated and there are no foetal heart sounds. The pulse is raised and there may be oliguria and proteinuria.</p>
                            <p>In the combined type, the patient has both features of revealed and concealed bleeding. The degree of shock is higher than the visible blood loss. The uterus is tender and rigid and pain is constant.</p>

                            <h4>Management of Abruptio Placentae</h4>
                            <p>Refer the patient to hospital if in a health centre or dispensary. She should be started on intravenous drip. Inform the hospital if possible. Take a specimen of blood for grouping cross matching before starting the drip and take it with the patient when she is transferred. In the hospital, admit the patient and call the doctor immediately. Give emotional support and physical care. Relieve pain with IM morphine 15mg or pethidine 100mg. If there is severe bleeding treat for shock and prepare for caesarean section.</p>
                            <p>Take vital signs, such as blood pressure and pulse, quarter to half hourly and temperature four hourly. Raise the foot of the bed to prevent vena cava occlusion by gravid uterus. Maintain a urine output chart and test urine for protein. You should also test blood for coagulation defects and take clotting time at intervals for monitoring. Prepare for reception and resuscitation of the baby. Usually, the baby is still born. A blood transfusion should be given where necessary.</p>

                            <h4>Conservative Management</h4>
                            <p>This occurs in cases of mild separation of the placenta. When the mother and baby are in good condition, intra-uterine scanning is done to assess the degree of haemorrhage and continuous foetal monitoring is done to assess foetal condition.</p>
                            <p>If both mother and baby are well and gestation is under 37 weeks, she may be discharged and seen weekly at the antenatal clinic.</p>
                            <p>At 37 weeks gestation you should readmit the mother for induction. The membranes should be ruptured and she should be started on oxytocin drip and monitored half hourly for onset of labour. In case of foetal distress, Caesarean section should be performed.</p>
