                            <p>Pre-eclampsia is a condition peculiar to pregnancy and occurring usually after the 28th week of gestation. It is characterised by the presence of hypertension, oedema and proteinuria or any two of the three. It is more common in the following conditions:</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>As you can see, it is important to take a good history as it will enable you to detect this condition early.</p>
                            <p>The cause of pre-eclampsia is not known, but there are various theories relating to its possible causes, which are endocrine in nature, metabolic or immunological.</p>

                            <h4>Diagnosis of Pre-eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>The diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is not easy since the mother has no obvious complaints. There are three cardinal signs.</p>

                            <h5>Hypertension</h5>
                            <p>There is a rise in diastolic pressure of 15 to 20mm/hg above the mother's normal diastolic pressure, or an increase above 80 to 90mm/hg on two occasions. A marked increase in systolic pressure above that expected for the mother's age is important to note, for example, 140 to 170 where the mother's normal pressure is between 90/60 and 120/70mm/hg.</p>

                            <h5>Proteinuria</h5>
                            <p>This is important in the absence of urinary tract infection. It may be detected in testing a midstream specimen of urine, which should be followed by laboratory investigation. The amount of protein in the urine indicates the severity of pre-eclampsia.</p>

                            <h5>Oedema</h5>
                            <p>Oedema of ankles is common in late pregnancy but it disappears overnight. This is known as physiological oedema. Any generalised oedema is significant and occult oedema is suspected in cases of excess weight gain above what is expected for the gestation. Clinical oedema may be mild or severe. The oedema puts on pressure and is found in the following areas:</p>
                            <p>Feet, ankles, and pretibial region; lower abdomen; vulva, which is uncomfortable and distressing to the mother; sacral area in a mother confined to bed; facial puffiness of the face and eye lids, fingers.</p>
                            <p>Pre-eclampsia can be classified as mild, moderate or severe.</p>

                            <h4>Mild Pre-eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>This is detected when, after resting, the diastolic pressure is 15 to 20mm/hg above the basal blood pressure recorded in early pregnancy or a diastolic above 80 to 90mm/hg, for example, BP 130/80 to 140/90. Oedema of feet, ankles and pretibial region may also be present.</p>

                            <h4>Moderate Pre-eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>This is diagnosed when there is marked rise in both systolic and diastolic pressure - 140/100 to 160/100mm/hg, proteinuria of 0.5gm/litre with no evidence of urinary tract infection and generalised oedema.</p>

                            <h4>Severe Pre-eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>Symptoms include the blood pressure exceeding 160/110mm/hg and an increased proteinuria over 1gm/litre. There may be marked generalised oedema, frontal headache and visual disturbances.</p>
                            <p>The effects of severe pre-eclampsia on the mother include:</p>

                            <p>The midwife plays an important role in detecting pre-eclampsia. There should always be vigilant antenatal care to enable early detection and management.</p>
                            <p>You should also ensure a thorough history taking to detect the mothers at risk early in pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>Follow up should include monitoring of weight and blood pressure and urine testing on every subsequent visit.</p>
                            <p>Factors that may predispose the patient to pre-eclampsia, such as multiple pregnancies and obesity should be noted early.</p>

                            <h4>Management of Pre-eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>The method of management will depend on the severity of the condition. The main principles of care are:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Provide adequate rest and monitoring of observations to avoid eclampsia</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <h5>Mild Pre-eclampsia Management</h5>
                            <p>The mother should be advised on bed rest at home and she is seen weekly to assess her condition. She should be given anti-hypertensive drugs such as aldomet 500mg. Sedatives such as valium or phenobarbitone should also be administered to help her rest and she should be advised to report to the hospital in case of any problem.</p>

                            <h5>Moderate Pre-eclampsia Management</h5>
                            <p>The patient should be admitted to hospital for bed rest. She should only be allowed to go to the toilet. She should be nursed in sitting position or lying on the side to encourage uterine blood flow. Bed rest will reduce oedema by improving the renal circulation, facilitating kidney filtration and producing diuresis. It also lowers the blood pressure.</p>
                            <p>The patient's diet should be rich in protein, fibre and vitamins and low in carbohydrates and salt. Her weight should be recorded twice a week. Observe for oedema daily. Urine should be tested for protein and Ketones. Esbach setting is done daily to assess level of protein loss. Twenty four hour urine collection should be done to estimate oestriol level as an indication of placental function.</p>
                            <p>Fluid intake and output should be maintained strictly to monitor renal function.</p>
                            <p>Sedatives, such as phenobarbitone, may be given to ensure rest and sleep. Give antihypertensive drugs like aldomet to lower blood pressure. Take vital signs: blood pressure, temperature, pulse and respirations four hourly.</p>
                            <p>The foetal heart rate should be taken four hourly or two times daily, depending on the condition. A kick chart to monitor foetal movement should also be kept.</p>
                            <p>When the mother's condition improves, she can be discharged to attend clinic weekly until she goes into spontaneous labour. Otherwise, she should be admitted at 38 weeks for induction of labour. If, in spite of the above care, the condition does not improve, caesarean section should be performed.</p>

                            <h5>Management of Labour</h5>
                            <p>Remain with the mother throughout labour. Maintain close vigilant observations of:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Presence of oedema</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Urinary output</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Urinalysis results</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Blood pressure</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Report any deviations to the doctor immediately. Take vital signs as follows: blood pressure and pulse rate half hourly, temperature four hourly, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
                            <p>Perform abdominal examination and observe for contractions and foetal heart rate half hourly. At the same time, observe for signs of second stage of labour and immediately alert both the obstetrician and paediatrician.</p>
                            <p>After delivery, monitor blood pressure four hourly for 24 hours. Urinalysis should be done twice a day. You should maintain a urinary output chart and continue with antihypertensive drugs and normal postnatal or caesarean section care.</p>

                            <h5>Active Management of Severe Pre-eclampsia</h5>
                            <p>Admit the mother in a quiet, dimly lit room on complete bedrest. In the room there should be an emergency tray and an epileptic tray in case of a fit. The aim of care is to prevent convulsions and control hypertension to prevent death of the mother and foetus.</p>
                            <p>Place the mother on lateral position to improve foetal circulation and to prevent vena cavae compression by the uterus. Remain with the mother and maintain vigilant observations. On admission you should take all observations and note them on a chart and continue half hourly or as prescribed by the doctor.</p>
                            <p>The doctor will prescribe antihypertensive drugs like hydrolysing 5-10mg which is administered slowly and blood pressure monitored every five minutes until it stabilises. Diazepam is also given 10mg stat followed by 40mg in 5% dextrose. Lasix 20 to 80mg may be given as a diuretic. Antibiotics may be prescribed if necessary. Strict monitoring of blood pressure should be done.</p>
                            <p>Maintain a strict intake and output chart and test all urine that is passed. In some cases an indwelling catheter may be passed. Fluid intake is restricted to one to two litres in 24 hours.</p>
                            <p>Esbach should be set daily. The weight should also be measured daily or on alternative days.</p>
                            <p>Administer medication as prescribed. Observe for signs of onset of labour and signs of impending eclampsia. If protenuria and high blood pressure persist, the doctor should induce labour by artificial rupture of membranes followed by syntocinon drip. Unless there is some obstetric contra-indication a caesarean section will be done.</p>
                            <p>You have seen that mothers with severe pre-eclampsia can proceed to eclampsia. The following are warning signs of impending eclampsia:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <p>Should a mother present to your clinic with these signs, give her an anticonvulsant and refer to hospital immediately for further management. In the hospital, the midwife should summon the doctor immediately.</p>

                            <h5>Care During Labour</h5>
                            <p>Treatment for severe pre-eclampsia should be continued. Perform a vaginal examination to assess the progress of labour. During the second stage, episiotomy should be performed to shorten the phase and the doctor will use vacuum extractor to prevent the mother from pushing. Ergometrine is avoided because of its vaso-constrictive effect and instead syntocinon 5 IV in a drip or intramuscularly is given. A Caesarean section may be performed if the condition does not improve or there is obstetric contra-indication for vaginal delivery.</p>

                            <h5>Post Delivery Care for Pre-eclampsia Cases</h5>
                            <p>Sedate the mother and continue observations of vital signs. Continue and adjust drugs as necessary.</p>

                            <h3>Eclampsia</h3>
                            <p>Eclampsia is an acute condition characterised by convulsions and coma. The incidence of eclampsia is 0.2 to 0.5% of all pregnancies. It can occur in the antenatal period at the rate of about 20%; during the intrapartum period at the rate of about 25% and during the postnatal period within the first few hours after delivery (35%).</p>

                            <h4>Signs and Symptoms of Eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>The prodromal signs of eclampsia are those we have described as serious signs of preeclampsia. The more immediate precursors of eclampsia are vomiting, intense headache and epigastric pain.</p>
                            <p>There are four stages of an eclampsia fit.</p>
                            <p><strong>Premonitory stage</strong>, which lasts 10 to 20 seconds. The mother is restless and rapid eye movements can be noted. The head may be drawn to one side, twitching of the facial muscles may occur, and the mother is not aware of what is happening.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>tonic stage</strong> lasts 10 to 20 seconds. The muscles of the mother's body go into spasms and become rigid. The back may become arched and her teeth become tightly clenched. The eyes appear like they are staring and her diaphragm goes into spasm. Respirations cease and cyanosis occurs.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>chronic stage</strong> lasts 60 to 90 seconds. There is violent contraction and intermitted relaxation of the mother's muscles causing convulsive movements. There is increased salivation and foaming at the mouth.</p>
                            <p>The mother's face becomes congested and bloated while her features become distorted. The mother becomes unconscious and breathing is stertorous while the pulse full and bounding. The convulsions subside gradually. In the stage of <strong>coma</strong> stertorous breathing continues and the coma may persist for minutes or hours. Further convulsions may occur before the mother regains consciousness.</p>
                            <p>Now move on to look at the management of eclampsia</p>

                            <h4>Management of Eclampsia</h4>
                            <p>The main principle of management is to stop convulsions and deliver the pregnant woman by the quickest and safest method. The mother's welfare is of paramount importance and the foetus is the secondary consideration as it is already in great danger.</p>

                            <p>After a fit continue oxygen therapy and, do not give oral fluids. Intravenous fluids should be restricted to 2000ml in 24 hours. Maintain strict fluid intake and output chart. Observe for signs of labour. Delivery is by vacuum extraction and sedation is continued. The baby should be nursed in the special care baby unit (nursery).</p>
