                            <p>The average duration of pregnancy is 266 days. This is counting from the time the pregnancy started, which is after ovulation and approximately two weeks after the first day of the Last Normal Menstrual Period (LNMP). If the counting is made from the first day of the LNMP, then the duration is 280 days or forty weeks.</p>
                            <p>The duration of pregnancy can also be expressed in months. These can be calendar months or lunar months. A lunar month is the time from one new moon to the next. It is equal to four weeks or exactly 28 days. A calendar month is longer, usually 30 or 31 days. Therefore, on average, pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, that is, ten lunar months or approximately nine calendar months.</p>
                            <p>The diagnosis of pregnancy is made on the basis of symptoms, signs and investigations of pregnancy. These can be conveniently divided into those of the first, second and third trimester.</p>

                            <h3>Signs and Symptoms of Pregnancy</h3>
                            <p>The main symptoms and signs during the first trimester include:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Amenorrhoea</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Enlargement and tenderness of the breasts</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Nausea</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Excessive salivation (ptyalism)</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Frequency of micturition due to the pressure of the gravid uterus on the urinary bladder</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Constitutional symptoms (that is, tiredness, weakness and sometimes depression)</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>As previously mentioned, a pregnant woman often experiences tiredness, general weakness and sometimes depression. The real cause of these symptoms is not established but may be hormonal. These symptoms usually improve by the 16th week after the last menstruation.</p>
                            <p>As the pregnancy progresses more signs and symptoms are observed. You will cover each of these in a little more detail.</p>

                            <h4>Enlargement of the Breasts</h4>
                            <p>The nipple and the areola increase in size. Small nodules, known as Montgomery's tubercles, develop around the nipple. The areola darkens.</p>

                            <h4>The Cervix</h4>
                            <p>The cervix becomes bluish in colour, which is referred to as Jacquemier's sign, because of the increased vascularity and congestion with blood. It also becomes softer. When you perform a bimanual vaginal examination with two fingers inserted in the anterior fornix of the vagina, and the other hand placed behind the uterus abdominally, the fingers of both hands almost meet because of the softness of the isthmus. This is known as Hegar's sign. It is most marked between the 6th and 12th week of pregnancy. There is also an increased pulsation felt in the lateral fornices, which is known as Osiander's sign. The uterus is slightly enlarged.</p>

                            <h4>Quickening</h4>
                            <p>This is when a mother feels the first movements. Primigravidae recognise these movements at about the 20th week, and the multipara at about the 16th week.</p>

                            <h4>Uterus Enlargement</h4>
                            <p>This occurs around the 12th week. You should be able to feel the enlarged uterus abdominally just above the symphysis pubis. The fundus reaches the level of the umbilicus at about the 22nd week, and the xiphisternum by the 36th week.</p>

                            <h4>Foetal Identification</h4>
                            <p>You should be able to feel the foetal parts, for example, the head, from the 24th week onwards. You might be able to feel foetal movements while palpating the fundus. Foetal heart sounds can be heard around the 24th week. The rate varies from 120 to 160 beats per minute.</p>

                            <h3>Investigations</h3>
                            <p>Now that you are aware of the symptoms and signs of pregnancy, you will look at the investigations that may be carried out to confirm pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>When diagnosing pregnancy, it is not always necessary that you carry out investigations. However, it is important for you to know the kind of investigations that may be done.</p>

                            <h4>Pregnancy Test</h4>
                            <p>This depends on the Human Chorionic Gonadotrophins (HCG) secreted in the mother's urine. It is more likely to be certain when the urine is concentrated, that is, a fresh, clean, early morning specimen. With a sensitive test, HCG can be detected in maternal plasma or urine by eight to nine days after ovulation.</p>

                            <h4>The Ultrasound</h4>
                            <p>This is a scanner, which enables you to see the foetus and its cardiac activity, particularly if performed by the 6th week of pregnancy.</p>

                            <h4>X-ray Method</h4>
                            <p>By the 16th week, if an x-ray is performed, it will show foetal bones. This is an undesirable method of diagnosing pregnancy because in early or mid-pregnancy, the foetus is very susceptible to the adverse effects of radiation.</p>
