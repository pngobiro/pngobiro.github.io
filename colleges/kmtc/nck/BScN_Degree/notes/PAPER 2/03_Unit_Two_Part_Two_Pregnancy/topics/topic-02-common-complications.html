                            <p>In the previous section you looked at the management of normal pregnancy and the management of minor disorders caused by pregnancy. In this section you will look at the high risk factors in pregnancy including the medical conditions that affect pregnancy. The types of women in this group are those who are at higher risk of having complications either during pregnancy or labour. This may be because in their past deliveries they had problems like postpartum haemorrhage, which are likely to recur, or they have chronic diseases such as diabetes which are likely to get worse with pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>There are also those who are at risk in this particular pregnancy because of a problem such as severe anaemia, which has just developed. Note that these are the major causes of both maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. Thus, early diagnosis and proper management is essential for a successful pregnancy and delivery.</p>

                            <p>This is a condition where vomiting is severe and continuous throughout the day. The woman vomits everything she has eaten. This usually leads to severe dehydration and ketoacidosis. She becomes malnourished. If treatment is not started quickly, liver and kidney damage may result. Anaemia may develop as a result of lack of vitamin B, folic acid and iron.</p>

                                    <p>Hyperemesis gravidarum occurs in very few women. It is usually associated with multiple pregnancies, hydatidiform mole and/or a history of habitual abortions.</p>

                            <h4>Management of Hyperemesis Gravidarum</h4>
                            <p>If in a health centre or dispensary, the patient should be referred to a hospital as soon as the diagnosis is made. In the hospital, the following should be done:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Intravenous infusion of five percent dextrose alternating with normal saline will be given to correct the dehydration.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Anti emetics like promethazine hydrochloride (phenergan) or metoclopramide hydrochloride (plasil) are given usually parenterally to control the vomiting.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Multivitamin supplements are given.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The patient is reassured and her visitors restricted.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Routine nursing care and observations of vital signs are maintained twice daily or as necessary.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The patient should be discharged at least two to three days after vomiting has ceased. The case should be followed up in the antenatal clinic.</p>

                            <h3>Polyhydramnios</h3>
                            <p>This is a condition in which the quantity of amniotic fluid exceeds 1500mls. It may not become apparent until it reaches 3000mls. It is a fairly rare condition.</p>
                            <p>Polyhydramnios is associated with the following conditions:</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>There are two types of polyhydramnios: chronic and acute.</p>

                            <h4>Chronic Polyhydramnios</h4>
                            <p>This occurs gradually, usually from about the 30th week of pregnancy.</p>
                            <p>It is the most common type.</p>

                            <h4>Acute Polyhydramnios</h4>
                            <p>This is a rare type, which occurs at about 20 weeks and comes on very suddenly. The uterus reaches the xiphisternum in about three to four days. It is associated with monozygotic twins or severe foetal abnormality.</p>

                            <p>Polyhydramnios can be recognised in the following ways:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The mother may complain of breathlessness and discomfort.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">If the condition is acute in onset, she may complain of severe abdominal pain.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The condition may aggravate other symptoms associated with pregnancy such as indigestion, heartburn, constipation, oedema, varicose veins of the vulva and lower limbs.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">On abdominal inspection, the uterus is larger than expected for the period of gestation and is globular in shape. The abdominal skin appears stretched and tight with marked striae gravidurum and marked superficial blood vessels.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">On palpation, the uterus is tense and it is difficult to feel foetal parts.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The abdominal girth is much more than expected for the period of gestation.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Auscultation of the foetal heart is difficult because of the free movement of the foetus.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Where possible an ultrasonic scan should be done to confirm the diagnosis. It may also reveal multiple pregnancy or foetal abnormality if these are present</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Management of Polyhydramnios</h4>
                            <p>The mother is admitted to hospital and, where possible, the cause of the condition is determined. The subsequent care will be determined by the condition of the mother, the cause and the period of gestation.</p>
                            <p>If there is foetal abnormality, the method and timing of delivery will depend on the severity. If there is gross abnormality, induction should be started. The nursing care should include rest in bed in sitting position to relieve dyspnoea. Assist the patient with personal hygiene and routine prenatal observations.</p>
                            <p>If abdominal discomfort is severe, abdominal amniocentesis may be considered. If it is done, infection prevention measures must be observed and only 500ml should be withdrawn at a time. Labour may be induced in the case of late pregnancy. Before the membranes are ruptured, the lie must be determined and the membranes ruptured cautiously allowing the fluid to flow slowly. This is to avoid cord prolapse, alteration of the lie and abruptio placenta which may occur after sudden reduction of uterine size.</p>

                            <h4>Complications of Polyhydramnios</h4>

                            </ul>

                            <h3>Oligohydramnios</h3>
                            <p>In this condition there is an abnormally small amount of amniotic fluid. It may be 300 to 500ml at term but amounts vary and it may be much less. It is associated with absence of kidneys or Potter's syndrome in which the foetus has pulmonary hypoplasia.</p>
                            <p>The lack of amniotic fluid reduces intrauterine space and causes deformities of the foetus due to compression. The baby's skin is dry and leathery in appearance and the nose may be flat. It may have talipes and a squashed-looking face.</p>
                            <p>The following characteristics will help you recognise the presence of oligohydramnios:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The uterus is smaller than expected for the period of gestation</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The mother notices reduced foetal movements if she has had a previous normal pregnancy</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">On palpation the foetal parts are easily felt and the uterus is small and compact</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Management</h4>
                            <p>The woman should be admitted for investigations, usually in the form of an ultrasound scan. If there are no foetal abnormalities, the pregnancy will be allowed to continue. Labour may be induced early to avoid placental insufficiency.</p>
                            <p>Analgesics are given during labour because the contractions are usually very painful. However, be aware that impaired circulation may cause foetal hypoxia. After delivery the baby is examined carefully for abnormalities.</p>

                            <p>The two most important causes of bleeding in late pregnancy are placenta praevia and abruptio placentae. You will now look at each of these separately.</p>

                            <h3>Placenta Praevia</h3>
                            <p>This is bleeding from a partially separated placenta, which is wholly or partially situated in the lower uterine segment. It might be covering either part or the entire internal os.</p>
                            <p>It is more likely to occur with increasing maternal age. It is more common in women aged 35 and above. It is also associated with increasing parity, and is twice as common in multigravida as in primigravida.</p>
                            <p>Placenta praevia is divided into four types or degrees.</p>

                            <h4>Signs and Symptoms of Placenta Praevia</h4>
                            <p>The signs and symptoms of placenta praevia include painless vaginal bleeding which starts when at rest or sleeping. It starts suddenly, usually from the 32nd week of gestation because of Braxton Hicks contractions.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, because the placenta occupies the lower uterine segment, the foetal head remains high, which results in malpresentation and unstable lie. If bleeding is severe, the blood pressure is low, the pulse and respirations are high, and there is shock corresponding with the amount of bleeding.</p>

                            <h4>The Management of Placenta Praevia</h4>
                            <p>If in a health centre or dispensary, refer all pregnant women with vaginal bleeding to hospital. Ensure there is a running intravenous drip of saline or dextrose before transferring the patient to the hospital. A nurse should always accompany the patient to the hospital.</p>
                            <p>In the hospital the type of management will depend on the amount of blood loss, the condition of the mother and foetus, the location of the placenta and the gestation period.</p>
                            <p>The aim of management is to control haemorrhage and to try to conserve the pregnancy up to 38 weeks gestation when the foetus is mature.</p>
                            <p>Where there is slight vaginal bleeding, conservative treatment is started if the pregnancy has not reached 38 weeks of gestation. The patient is admitted for complete bed rest and total care.</p>

                            <h4>Types of Abruptio Placentae</h4>
                            <p>There are three clinical presentations.</p>
                            <p>Mixed or combined, where bleeding is partly revealed and partly concealed.</p>
                            <p>Concealed, where the blood is trapped between the placenta, membranes and the uterine wall. There is no visible bleeding.</p>
                            <p>External or revealed, which is where there is free (visible) vaginal haemorrhage.</p>

                            <h4>Signs and Symptoms of Abruptio Placentae</h4>
                            <p>In the revealed type, there is slight to severe vaginal bleeding. On abdominal palpation there may or may not be pain and tenderness. The pulse is raised and there is low blood pressure or hypertension.</p>
                            <p>In the concealed type, there is severe abdominal pain and the patient is in shock. There is no vaginal bleeding and the uterus is very tender and is board like. The foetal parts cannot be palpated and there are no foetal heart sounds. The pulse is raised and there may be oliguria and proteinuria.</p>
                            <p>In the combined type, the patient has both features of revealed and concealed bleeding. The degree of shock is higher than the visible blood loss. The uterus is tender and rigid and pain is constant.</p>

                            <h4>Management of Abruptio Placentae</h4>
                            <p>Refer the patient to hospital if in a health centre or dispensary. She should be started on intravenous drip. Inform the hospital if possible. Take a specimen of blood for grouping cross matching before starting the drip and take it with the patient when she is transferred. In the hospital, admit the patient and call the doctor immediately. Give emotional support and physical care. Relieve pain with IM morphine 15mg or pethidine 100mg. If there is severe bleeding treat for shock and prepare for caesarean section.</p>
                            <p>Take vital signs, such as blood pressure and pulse, quarter to half hourly and temperature four hourly. Raise the foot of the bed to prevent vena cava occlusion by gravid uterus. Maintain a urine output chart and test urine for protein. You should also test blood for coagulation defects and take clotting time at intervals for monitoring. Prepare for reception and resuscitation of the baby. Usually, the baby is still born. A blood transfusion should be given where necessary.</p>

                            <h4>Conservative Management</h4>
                            <p>This occurs in cases of mild separation of the placenta. When the mother and baby are in good condition, intra-uterine scanning is done to assess the degree of haemorrhage and continuous foetal monitoring is done to assess foetal condition.</p>
                            <p>If both mother and baby are well and gestation is under 37 weeks, she may be discharged and seen weekly at the antenatal clinic.</p>
                            <p>At 37 weeks gestation you should readmit the mother for induction. The membranes should be ruptured and she should be started on oxytocin drip and monitored half hourly for onset of labour. In case of foetal distress, Caesarean section should be performed.</p>
