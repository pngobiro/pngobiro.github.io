                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>Natural family planning is an approach to the understanding and respecting of human sexuality with its inherent procreative capacity and its consequent responsibility. Any teaching of the natural methods of family planning is, therefore, within the context of strengthening the family bonds and promoting responsible parenthood and its pro-life.</p>
                            <p>The natural methods are based on simple observance of nature in regard to human fertility. The methods do not interfere with the body functions in any way. The natural family planning methods require the cooperation of both the husband and wife and the study and discussion of their combined fertility brings them closer together. The sacrifice and control they demand generate respect of love and life. Because this is a natural method it overcomes all barriers, such as religious, social or ethnic. NFP goes hand in hand with LAM. As the mother breastfeeds, ovulation is delayed for as long as two years thus reinforcing the relationship and baby care.</p>

                            <h3>Natural Family Planning (Fertility Awareness Based Method)</h3>
                            <p>Natural Family Planning (NFP) is the oldest method of contraception. In our societies most tribes practiced some form of FP, such as when a mother was breast feeding it was a taboo to have sex as it was believed the baby would become sick and even die. The woman would abstain from sex for two to four years after childbirth. On some occasions she would even go back to her family home. Many communities also sanctioned polygamy, which allowed the man to have his sexual desires fulfilled while the mother was breast feeding.</p>
                            <p>As communities started changing, monogamy was embraced and the couple stayed in one house. As a result, new methods of FP came into existence to complement the NFP method.</p>
                            <p>Natural family planning refers to a way of life whereby a couple, if properly instructed, can choose to avoid or achieve pregnancy by applying the appropriate sexual behaviour during the fertile and infertile phases of the menstrual cycle without the use of chemicals or mechanical devices. NFP is also referred to as periodic abstinence, rhythm or fertility awareness method.</p>
                            <p>The NFP method seems to work best when couples are clear about whether they want to have a child or not. The method appeals to couples who feel that fertility control is a joint responsibility and that neither partner should be required to bear the brunt of the health burden.</p>
                            <p>NFP educates couples on their reproductive processes and human sexuality as they work in harmony to control or regulate their fertility. There are several methods of NFP.</p>

                            <p>This is a natural method of family planning and it involves the woman taking and recording her body temperature every morning before rising to know when ovulation occurs. In a healthy woman the body temperature remains relatively constant during the first phase of her menstrual cycle. Shortly before ovulation the temperature rises by about 0.2°C to 0.5°C and stays elevated until the next menstrual period. The couple should avoid sexual intercourse during the period when BBT is high. They can have sex after the third day of consecutive high temperature until the beginning of next menstrual bleeding.</p>

                            <p>This method is based on the ability to recognise fertile and infertile phases of the menstrual cycle. It requires a high level of motivation and cooperation from both partners. The woman needs to become aware of mucus changes and abstain from sexual intercourse to avoid pregnancy during the fertile period.</p>
                            <p>In the beginning, a daily record on the type of mucus is important until the patient becomes confident. This takes about one year. In order for you to understand and instruct patients to follow the Billings method you need to review the menstrual cycle.</p>

                            <h4>The Menstrual Cycle</h4>
                            <p>Failure of fertilisation results in menstruation. This discharge is shed from the endometrium. It consists not only of blood but also debris from the uterine wall in the form of mucus and fragments.</p>
                            <p>The menstrual cycle is defined as a series of physiological changes directly related to the development, regression and shedding of the endometrium under various hormonal influences.</p>
                            <p>The monthly cycle begins with the first day of bleeding and ends with the day before the next cycle begins. It varies in length but the average cycle is taken to be 28 days and reoccurs regularly from puberty to menopause, except when pregnancy intervenes.</p>

                            <p>Lactational Amenorrhoea is a family planning method based on the physiology of breast feeding. LAM involves the use of breast feeding as a temporary family planning method.</p>
                            <p>Breast feeding has the effect of stopping ovulation because it changes the rate of natural hormones for at least six months or longer. The mother is encouraged to start another method at the proper time. LAM has several advantages, which range from contraceptive to non-contraceptive.</p>
