                            <p>The patient assessment will help you to give an appropriate method of contraception to an individual patient. In many ways counselling forms a part of patient assessment since both go together as you assist the patient to make an informed choice about the most appropriate method.</p>

                            <p>The main objective of carrying out a patient assessment is to determine:</p>

                                <li class="list-item">

                                </li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>To achieve the above objective, you have to be careful with the questions you ask and remain attentive to the patient's concerns. Furthermore, you need to clarify any points that you feel the patient does not understand clearly.</p>

                            <p><strong>Why should you perform a breast examination?</strong><br>
                            The main reason for performing a breast examination is to enable you to detect abnormalities (such as cancer of the breast) and take appropriate action.</p>

                            <p><strong>When should a breast examination be performed?</strong><br>
                            From the age of 20 years all females should do Self Breast Examination (SBE) immediately after their menstrual period. If the patient is on the pill, she should perform her SBE on the day she starts a new packet. Those in menopause should do a SBE on the first day of each calendar month.</p>

                            <p><strong>How do you perform a breast examination?</strong><br>
                            This is the method whereby the patient inspects, palpates and expresses both breasts. The axilla is also palpated for any nodules.</p>

                            <h4>Inspection</h4>
                            <p>Ask the patient to undress and sit or stand relaxed in front of a mirror with good lighting. With hands at the sides, on the waist and on the head respectively, check on the size, shape, discoloration and retraction (dimpling) of the nipple. Turn from side to side and look underneath, push the hands inward and outwards until the chest muscles tighten. Check again at the breasts while pressing and note any puckering of the skin or retraction of the nipple.</p>

                            <h4>Palpation</h4>
                            <p>Ask the patient to lie down in a dorsal position on a firm surface with her head on a pillow. Tell her to put her left hand on top of the head folded and then use the right hand to examine the left breast. She should then reverse this to examine the right breast. Emphasise that she should examine one breast at a time using the flat of her fingers but not the fingertips. The fingers should be kept flat and close together. Instruct her how to divide the breast into quadrants (four areas), and starting with the upper scale near the collarbone, to press gently but firmly towards the body and going round the whole breast clockwise to check for any lumps. Show her how to examine the tail of the breast by going right up into the hollow of the armpit. Then she should repeat the whole process for the other breast.</p>

                            <p>Now you have looked through the points to remember, you will look at how the procedure is performed.</p>
                            <p>Ensure privacy and explain the procedure to the patient. Let her empty the bladder. You should position her on a couch in the dorsal position with the abdomen covered. Insert speculum and after visualising the cervix, screw it into position. With the wooden spatula, scrape the cervical cells by rotating the end of the spatula through 360° in the cervical os.</p>
                            <p>Quickly spread the sample onto the slide and put a fixative solution or spray to fix it on the slide. Repeat the procedure for the second slide. Allow to dry and ensure that the specimen is taken to the laboratory immediately.</p>
