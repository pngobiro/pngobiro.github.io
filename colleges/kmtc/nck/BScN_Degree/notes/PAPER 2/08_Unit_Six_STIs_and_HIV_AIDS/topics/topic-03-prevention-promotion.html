                            <h3 class="card-title mt-6">The Role of Syndromic Management in the Prevention/Control of STIs</h3>
                            <p>You learnt about syndromic case management in section one of this unit. The role of the syndromic approach in preventing and controlling the spread of STIs cannot be overly emphasised. If the client is treated early and adequately, the spread of the infection does not continue. The exact magnitude of STIs in Kenya is unknown. It is among the five top diseases for which patients seek medical attention, in our health facilities.</p>
                            <p>Considering the serious consequences of STIs, particularly for women and children, and the increasing evidence that they facilitate the transmission of HIV infection, medical professionals and health planners should accord them high priority. Lack of a well equipped health facility for STI management has led many patients to seek treatment outside the formal health sector. This often involves inadequate management, leading to increasing antimicrobial resistance among sexually transmitted pathogens.</p>
                            <p>The management of STIs has been constrained by the lack of diagnostic facilities especially in developing countries, of which Kenya is one. To overcome this problem, the WHO has developed a syndromic algorithm to be used in low resource settings. Kenya has adopted this approach. There should be syndromic management flow charts hanging on the walls of your health facility.</p>
                            <p>The Syndromic Management Approach of STIs, which is thought to be an answer to many obstacles to efficient STI case management (as recommended by WHO), facilitates adequate treatment. However, to achieve this, health care providers need to be trained on the use of this approach and all health facilities need to be well equipped.</p>
                            <p>This approach calls for the government to ensure STI drugs are distributed to all health facilities. This should guarantee prompt and adequate treatment for prevention/control of not only the common STIs but, also HIV/AIDS transmission.</p>
                            <p>Emphasis should be put on the four C's so that infected individuals avoid spreading the infection and also know how to avoid re-infecting themselves. (Remind yourself what the four C's stand for in section one of this unit).</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">The Role of Laboratory Investigations in STIs Prevention/Control</h3>
                            <p>Laboratory investigations of STIs depend on the facilities available at the health centre and the referral system in place. This should be decided on the principle that a patient with one STI is also at increased risk of another STI. Additionally, it is government policy that all patients be screened for syphilis, and if possible for HIV, after getting their consent.</p>
                            <p>It is also government policy that all pregnant mothers be screened for syphilis. Thus, all health facilities offering antenatal services should be equipped well enough to provide this service to be able to capture a larger population. In this regard, all health workers should be trained in counselling so that they can convince patients of the importance of screening. They should also do a follow up to make sure patients testing positive have been treated and the four C's stressed.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">The Role of IEC and Advocacy in Community Mobilisation and Capacity Building for STI Prevention/Control</h3>
                            <p>The government has attempted to increase awareness of STI transmission through public health education programmes.</p>
                            <p>The Ministry of Education has also incorporated sex education in their curriculum, which is aimed at the adolescent and youth.</p>
                            <p>Awareness appears to have been raised to a level of 90%. However, this high awareness level has not been successful in controlling the spread of infection, as indicated by the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS and the incidence of STIs.</p>
                            <p>This tells us that knowledge alone is not enough to slow down the spread. Knowledge should be accompanied by behavioural change.</p>
                            <p>The main mode of transmission of STD/HIV is sexual intercourse, every individual needs to change their sexual behaviour if the campaign is to succeed.</p>
                            <p>Matters of human sexuality are closely tied to traditional beliefs and cultural practices in the African context that, in themselves, are obstacles to behaviour changes.</p>
                            <p>The diversity of cultural beliefs and practices among various Kenyan ethnic groups, which play an important role in the spread of STI, include female genital mutilation (FGM), circumcision, tattooing and drug abuse. Such practices should be discouraged through intersectoral actions and collaboration. This is an area where all government ministries have to work together to bring positive behaviour change in all ethnic groups, to slow down the spread of STIs as a way of fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>
                            <p>In our campaign, special groups like the adolescents and youths need to be targeted because they are at greater risk of acquiring STIs. They need to avoid the infection, especially through abstinence or the use of condoms.</p>
                            <p>Other groups to focus on are commercial sex workers, truck drivers, military personnel and sailors. No sexually active individual is immune to STIs, the type of work of the groups mentioned here place them at higher risk than others. The worst hit group, which needs special attention to be empowered, is women.</p>
                            <p>Women are the worst hit when it comes to STIs because they are easily lured into sex due to poverty or cultural beliefs. Worse still, married women cannot refuse sex or demand protected sex even when they know their husbands are having affairs outside the marriage.</p>
                            <p>The control/prevention campaign should aim at empowering women by equipping them with the skills necessary to negotiate for safer sex.</p>
                            <p>There is a need to increase awareness of the disease burden attributable to STD/HIV/AIDS among the public, the leaders and vulnerable groups.</p>
                            <p>To be able carry out this task, all reproductive health care providers should be trained in the prevention, detection, treatment and counselling of STIs/HIV/AIDS patients.</p>
                            <p>Infection prevention practices should be promoted amongst health personnel and traditional health practitioners. (Revise the section on infection control in module one).</p>

                                Effects of HIV/AIDS
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>To understand the seriousness of the HIV/AIDS endemic, you need to look at some of the effects the infection has on the infected and affected individuals, the community and the country at large. HIV/AIDS affects man in totality.</p>
                            <p>If you have nursed or taken part in caring for an AIDS patient, you will have witnessed the confusion and strain the disease sets on the individual's family, community and even the employer of the infected.</p>
                            <p>In Kenya, HIV/AIDS has had a significant impact on the socio-economic indicators of well being, such as infant mortality and life expectancy. Also, owing to its rapid spread, the epidemic is likely to reverse the gains previously made in economic development, as well as in social sectors through illness, deaths and diversion of resources to care for the infected and the affected.</p>
                            <p>The worst hit group is between the ages 15 - 45 because they are more sexually active, this deprives the country of its labour force.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, HIV/AIDS is worsening the socio-economic situation and the poverty level in Kenya and continues to give a gloomy picture.</p>
                            <p>It is difficult to exhaust the list of effects of HIV/AIDS to all sectors in detail, so you will look at the most affected ones, and the ones that play a key role in development.</p>

                                    <h4 class="vuln-title">Impact on Health</h4>
                                    <p class="vuln-text">The health budget has been overstretched by the AIDS epidemic because about 50% of the patients in medical wards are suffering from AIDS and related illnesses, hence the reason for starting home based care programmes. The Ministry of Health is responsible for providing treatment for opportunistic infections as well as antiretroviral drugs to the infected. The Ministry is also involved in many prevention programmes like STD control, condom promotion and distribution, health education and VCT centres, all of which cost money.</p>
                                    <p class="vuln-text mt-2">In addition, the health sector has seen a resurgence of diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid and cholera, many of which had almost been contained. It has also been plagued by the emergence of new disease such as highland malaria, Rift Valley fever as well as an increase in case fatality of common disease such as pneumonia. This has been exacerbated by the advent of HIV/AIDS, which threatens to consume over 50% of the public health resources, if this upward trend does not change.</p>

                                    <h4 class="vuln-title">Impact on Education</h4>
                                    <p class="vuln-text">The education system is affected by HIV/AIDS in many ways. Infected teachers cannot perform their duties properly due to ill health and eventually they die, creating shortages.</p>
                                    <p class="vuln-text mt-2">Many children infected at birth do not even live to enrol in school and those who do, die before going far. Many children also drop out of school when they become orphans due to AIDS impacting on their family, or to take care of AIDS patients at home.</p>
                                    <p class="vuln-text mt-2">All these factors disrupt learning, making the majority of youth vulnerable to AIDS. However, the education system can be used to disseminate information on HIV/AIDS prevention and this can help young people understand how and why they should avoid the risk of unsafe sex.</p>

                                    <h4 class="vuln-title">Impact on Agriculture</h4>
                                    <p class="vuln-text">In the agriculture sector, food security is threatened as the country gets deprived of a labour force as AIDS related illnesses and death affects the most productive age group (15 - 45 years old).</p>
                                    <p class="vuln-text mt-2">This portends a grim picture, especially in rural areas. AIDS has adverse effects on small scale farmers as well as commercial agriculture due to loss of skilled and unskilled labour supply which leads to low labour productivity hence low income to the affected persons and agricultural sector as a whole.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="vulnerability-card">

                                    <h4 class="vuln-title">Impact on the Economy</h4>
                                    <p class="vuln-text">AIDS has the potential to create a severe negative economic impact in Kenya. HIV/AIDS is worsening the socio-economic situation and poverty level in Kenya, and continues to give a gloomy picture in all settings. AIDS has had the effect of reducing the size and experience of the labour force, increasing health care expenditure, raising labour costs and reducing savings and investment.</p>
                                    <p class="vuln-text mt-2">HIV/AIDS is different from most other diseases because it strikes the most productive age groups and it is essentially 100% fatal. You find that the individual and the family will feel the economic effects first, then the employer or the company the victim is associated with.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p class="mt-4">For example, when you look at the impact at family level, you find that when a member of the family becomes sick with AIDS, it is usually the women/wives who care for the sick, and young girls may drop out of school to help their mother as a result. The family may exhaust its savings in paying for drugs and funeral expenses. As a result, the family becomes poorer affecting children's education and the living standards of the entire family.</p>
                            <p>Looking at the impact of AIDS on firms, you find that economic impact on companies is manifested by reduced labour productivity due to absenteeism and loss of skilled work force through AIDS related deaths. Also companies lose a lot of money through medical schemes for the infected employee, funeral expenses and increased employee terminal benefits not to mention the expenses of recruiting and training new staff in an effort to replace the diseased.</p>
                            <p>As mentioned earlier, HIV/AIDS basically affects all aspects of our lives. You will briefly look at some other consequences of HIV other than its effects on health, education, agriculture and socio-economic sector, but I would advice you to read widely on the topic and add on the list of consequences of the disease.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">AIDS Orphans</h3>
                            <p>One of the consequences of AIDS is an increase in the number of orphans. An AIDS orphan is defined as 'a child under 15 years who looses their mother to the AIDS disease.' These orphans may lack proper care and supervision they need at this critical period of their lives. Their care and support also puts strain on family members, the community and the nation as a whole.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Impact on Population Structure, Size and Growth/Impact on Demography</h3>
                            <p>AIDS has, and will continue to have a negative impact on population size. This is because many AIDS patients are dying. Women who are infected are advised to control their productivity in order to avoid mother to child transmission and also to limit the number of orphans. Young adults are dying, leaving children and elderly adults to care for the young. In summary, AIDS is a devastating illness that affects not only the lives of the infected individuals and their families, but also the economy and social well being of the society as a whole since it:</p>

                            <p>Poverty, ignorance and ill health and HIV/AIDS are interrelated. The government alone has neither the means nor adequate resources to tackle the problem. So it is the duty of every person to do what it takes, to at least control the spread if not prevent it all together.</p>
                            <p>To achieve this you need to equip yourself with knowledge, skills and the right attitude to enable you to be agents of change as far as HIV/AIDS prevention and control is concerned.</p>

                            <p>The impact of AIDS will be severe in Kenya, if the HIV infection rate, currently at approximately 7%, is not reduced.</p>
                            <p>The AIDS disease is not only a serious threat to our socio-economic development as mentioned earlier, but a real danger to our very existence, given the fact that it is 100% fatal.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Prevention of Heterosexual HIVTransmission</h3>
                            <p>Since the main mode of transmission is through heterosexual contact, it is in this area that interventions have to be intensified.</p>
                            <p>Interventions include promoting abstinence and faithfulness, reduction in the number of sexual partners, encouraging delay in the onset of sexual activity among adolescents and the youth, correct use and consistent availability of condoms, strengthening programmes for STI control and encouraging voluntary counselling and testing.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Promoting Abstinence Before Marriage and Faithfulness to One Partner</h3>
                            <p>One set of interventions focuses on encouraging people to abstain from sex before marriage and to remain faithful to a single partner. Abstinence and faithfulness can be promoted through a combination of mass media, counselling and education programmes.</p>
                            <p>Delay in the onset of sexual activity among adolescents can have a significant impact on the spread of HIV. Information, education, communication and other programmes that address the needs of adolescents and young people are necessary.</p>
                            <p>A reduction in HIV incidence among young people would not only avoid much suffering but would also be a critical step in controlling the spread of the virus.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Promotion of Voluntary Counselling and Testing in Kenya</h3>
                            <p>In voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) for HIV, a person receives counselling needed to make informed choices about whether to undergo confidential testing for HIV. The government of Kenya is fully committed to encourage the provision of VCT services throughout Kenya so that all Kenyans who wish to know their HIV status will have access to these services.</p>
                            <p>HIV Voluntary Counselling and Testing has been shown to have a role both in preventing HIV infection, and for people with infection, it provides an entry point to care. Counselling gives people an opportunity to learn and accept their HIV status in a confidential environment with ongoing emotional support and medical care.</p>
                            <p>Rapid whole blood tests are now available that provide accurate results from a finger prick in just 10 to 15 minutes. People who have tested HIV positive can benefit from early appropriate medical care and interventions to treat or prevent HIV associated illnesses.</p>
                            <p>Pregnant women who are aware of their HIV positive status can prevent transmission to their infants through the use of antiretroviral therapy. Knowledge of HIV status can also help some people decide how to protect themselves from infection when they are HIV negative and to protect their sexual partners from infection if they are HIV positive. VCT can be a cost effective intervention in preventing HIV transmission.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Promoting the Use and Availability of Condoms</h3>
                            <p>Another important intervention is to promote condom use for safer sex through mass media, counselling, and education programmes and to increase the availability of condoms through expanded public distribution, social marketing programmes and programmes in the workplace. The consistent and correct use of condoms at every sexual encounter significantly reduces chances of HIV infection. Condoms also prevent other sexually transmitted infections.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Promoting the Control of Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases</h3>
                            <p>Another intervention focuses on controlling the spread of sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhoea and chancroid. A study in Mwanza, Tanzania, for example, found a reduction of 42% in the number of new HIV infections after an improved STI prevention and treatment programme. Therefore, it is obvious that services to detect and control STIs can be critically important for managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Promoting Delayed Sexual Activity Among the Adolescent and Youth</h3>
                            <p>The level of HIV infection is alarmingly high among young people, particularly young women. Special efforts are required to protect the youth. It is difficult to change any behaviour pattern, especially a sexual behaviour pattern, once it has become a habit. Around the world, successful prevention programmes among young people are ones that equip adolescents with the knowledge, skills and attitudes that will keep them safe from infection before they become sexually active.</p>
                            <p>Alcohol and drug abuse increases HIV transmission risk. This is as a result of impaired judgement that may lead to unprotected sex. Other practices such as intravenous drug use, often associated with the developed world, and drug abuse in general should be discouraged as they increase risk of HIV/AIDS transmission.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMCT)</h3>
                            <p>A mother who is infected with HIV has 30 - 40% chance of transmitting the virus to her newborn child in the absence of medical intervention. Various approaches can be used to reduce the number of children infected through vertical transmission.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">The best way to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV is to prevent the women from becoming infected. Delaying the sexual debut of teenage girls, keeping girls in school, and providing HIV prevention counselling can reduce the number of young pregnant women who are infected. Protecting women from becoming infected during pregnancy and lactation will also reduce the number of infants who are infected.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">Providing HIV counselling and testing for women and their partners during pregnancy offers an opportunity to prevent HIV infection in HIV negative women and to start antiretroviral therapy for the infected patient to reduce mother to child HIV transmission. Such counselling also enables couples to make informed reproductive choices for the future.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">Antiretroviral drugs taken during labour or during the last week of pregnancy can reduce the viral load in the mother and reduce the risk of mother to child transmission during this time by half. Nevirapine is taken as a single dose early in labour and another dose is given to the newborn at three days of age. AZT (azidovudine) is usually taken in the last week of pregnancy and during labour.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">One third of mother to child transmission occurs through breastfeeding. However many children who are not breastfed die from diarrhoeal diseases and other infections. Therefore health personnel should counsel women about safe and appropriate feeding strategies to minimise mother to child transmission and improve child survival. This includes the choice of replacement feedings, lactation management method and timely weaning.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title mt-6">Promoting Safe Blood Supply for Transfusion</h3>
                            <p>A safe blood supply is necessary to avoid infection through blood transfusion. This means that possible donors are first screened through interviews to reject those that have a high probability of being infected with HIV. The donated blood is then screened through laboratory tests to detect any infection.</p>
                            <p>It follows that because safe blood is often not available, non essential transfusions are always discouraged and autologous transfusions (using the patient's own blood that has been obtained earlier) for planned operations are encouraged.</p>
