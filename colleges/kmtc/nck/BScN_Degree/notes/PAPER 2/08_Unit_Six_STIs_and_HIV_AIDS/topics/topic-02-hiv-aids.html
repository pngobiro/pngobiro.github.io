                            <p>Good information is still the best cure for HIV/AIDS. You therefore, need to equip yourself with up to date information to enable us to answer these questions correctly, and provide quality care to your patients, and offer support to their families as well as to the community.</p>
                            <p>HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa. The pandemic is causing great suffering, not only to the infected individual, but also to the family members (affected) and to some extent the wider community.</p>
                            <p>The pandemic was declared a national disaster in Kenya in 1999. The immediate past five year reproductive health (RH) program (1999 to 2003) contributed to high level advocacy of overall efforts to highlight the disaster the HIV/AIDS has become. The ongoing five year RH program (2004 to 2008) continues with this high level advocacy. Some of the most pressing issues discussed in relation to HIV/AIDS include:</p>

                            <p>HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV stands for Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus. This is the virus that destroys the human immune system, leaving the body defenceless hence vulnerable to other infections. It is of interest to note that HIV is a member of a group of viruses called retroviruses, which cause immune deficiency in both animals and humans. Those that affect humans, are HIV1 and HIV2, the commonest being HIV2.</p>

Once the immune system cannot function properly, then the person may be infected by many bacteria, viruses and parasites, which the person's immune system is no longer able to fight. These infections are referred to as opportunistic because they take advantage of the opportunity offered by the lowered immunity.</p>

                            <p>HIV infection is primarily a STI (Sexually Transmitted Infection) because it is mainly transmitted through contact with infected body fluids (semen, vaginal and cervical secretions, blood and blood products) usually during sexual intercourse, but sometimes through activities such as breastfeeding, skin piercing practices, blood transfusion, organ transplants, drug injections, circumcision and other operations. The most likely mode of transmission includes:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            </ul>
                            <p>You will now look at some of the activities that encourage HIV transmission.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Unprotected Sexual Contact</h3>
                            <p>This includes vaginal and anal sexual intercourse. Both in the genitalia and the rectum, HIV may infect the mucous membranes directly or enter through cuts or sores caused during intercourse (many of which would be unnoticed). Vaginal and anal intercourse is a high risk practice. Ulcerations arising from infection with other sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, chancroids or gonorrhoea allow the virus to enter the body easily during sex. Therefore, the presence of other STIs increase the risk of HIV transmission.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Direct Blood Contact</h3>
                            <p>This includes, blood and blood products, sharing drug injecting needles and injuries by sharp instruments. Transmission through blood occurs when a person is transfused with unscreened blood from an infected donor. It can also occur when one comes into contact with contaminated blood or blood products through contaminated needles, syringes, razor blades, or sharp objects used either for circumcision or skin piercing or scarification for beauty.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes one may come into direct contact with infected blood during an emergency, for example, when assisting accident victims or in childbirth.</p>
                            <p>Sharing of injection needles is a common practice among drug abusers. An injection needle can pass blood directly from one person's blood stream to another. Sharing a circumcision knife is another common practice by traditional circumcision practitioners. These are very efficient ways to transmit a blood borne HIV. These practices are considered to be a high risk behaviour.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Mother to Child</h3>
                            <p>It is possible for a HIV infected mother to pass the virus directly during pregnancy through the placenta barrier, during childbirth, or through breast milk. Breast milk contains HIV, and while small amounts of breast milk do not pose a significant threat of infection to adults, it is a viable means of transmission to infants.</p>

                                </div>

                                    <p>The time it takes for a person who has been infected with the HIV to seroconvert (test positive) for HIV antibodies is commonly called the <strong>'window period'</strong>.</p>
                                    <p>According to NASCOP, when a person is infected with the HIV virus, statistics show that 95-97% (perhaps even higher) of all infected individuals develop detectable antibodies within 12 weeks (three months).</p>
                                    <p>The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said that in some rare cases, it may take up to six months for one to seroconvert (test positive). At this point the results would be 99.9% accurate.</p>
                                    <p>It is important to note that, during the window period, the infected person is infectious despite negative results. This contributes to the high rate of spread since the infected persons will transmit the virus to the sexual partner(s) or from mother to child without realizing it.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>Therefore, HIV infection is only confirmed after an infected person has developed antibodies and goes through a HIV antibody test. Positive test results confirm the HIV infection except in children below 18 months old because the baby might have acquired the antibodies from the infected mother and not the virus.</p>
                            <p>According to the Centre for Disease Control (CDC), the average time between HIV infection and appearance of signs that could lead to an AIDS diagnosis is eight to ten years. This time varies greatly from person to person and can depend on many factors including the person's health status and sexual behaviour.</p>
                            <p>Once an adult develops AIDS, the time of death varies from a few months to about two years if no antiretroviral treatment is given. In children (mother to child transmission) the progression is faster and the majority die within the first three years of life and few live up to ten years.</p>
                            <p>Today, there are medical treatments that can slow down the rate at which HIV weakens the immune system. There are other treatments that can prevent or cure some of the illnesses associated with AIDS, especially opportunistic infections. As with other diseases, early detection offers more options for treatment and preventive health care.</p>
                            <p>For the purpose of clinical management, all individuals diagnosed as HIV positive should be classified according to the disease stage. As you may be aware, HIV infection has four stages of progress and each stage has specific signs and symptoms.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Stage 1: Acute Infection (Acute Seroconversion Syndrome)</h3>
                            <p>This is the first stage of HIV infection, when the virus establishes itself in the body. Some researchers use the term Acute HIV Infection (acute seroconversion syndrome) to describe the period of time between when a person is first infected with HIV and when antibodies against the virus are produced by the body (usually six to twelve weeks).</p>
                            <p>Some people newly infected with HIV will experience some 'flu like' symptoms (sometimes called sero-conversion illness). These symptoms, which usually last no more than a few days, might include fever, chills, night sweats, rashes, joint and muscle pain, swollen lymph glands, diarrhoea or some sore throat (not cold like) symptoms.</p>
                            <p>Other people either do not experience 'acute infection' or have symptoms so mild that they may not notice them. This is the window period. In any case, the symptoms are mild and disappear in a few weeks, frequently giving rise to the assumption that the illness was only a cold or flu.</p>
                            <p>During this period the virus is multiplying inside the infected person's body and can be passed on to others, but the usual HIV test (an antibody test) will produce a false negative report, since it takes approximately two-three months for an infected person to develop antibodies against HIV after which the HIV antibody test will be positive.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Stage 2: Latent or Asymptomatic Period (Asymptomatic HIV Infection)</h3>
                            <p>After the acute stage the HIV infection remains latent (in the body) usually for a period of up to 10 years. Throughout this period the person stays infected and infectious, but is unlikely to be aware of his/her status unless he/she has been tested for HIV.</p>
                            <p>During this period, the infected person feels and appears healthy and has no symptoms, which suggest HIV infection.</p>
                            <p>The immune response of an infected person is able partially to suppress the HIV virus during this stage so that the amount of virus in the body and bloodstream is very much reduced (although the virus is not eliminated) but throughout the asymptomatic period there is progressive damage to the person's immune system as it tries to control the virus. This is demonstrated by a steady decline in the number of CD4 cells in the blood (CD4 count). Some people will have persistently enlarged lymph nodes or persistent generalised lymphadenopathy (PGL).</p>
                            <p>During this latent period, the person is infective and the HIV virus can be detected in various body fluids and lymph nodes. Also, the HIV antibody can be demonstrated in the blood serum.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Stage 3: Symptomatic HIV Disease</h3>
                            <p>Eventually, many individuals develop a variety of indicators of ill health. As you may have already noted, weight loss and general weakness (asthenia) are the most common clinical manifestation in patients with HIV infection. Generally, the patient presents with the following signs and symptoms, which suggest that the HIV virus is beginning to affect the immune system, though at this stage it is not yet as bad as when the person has developed the actual AIDS disease (full blown AIDS).</p>
                            <p>The symptoms may include swollen lymph glands, joint and muscle pains, sore throat, fatigue, fever, night sweats and diarrhoea. Generally, these symptoms may come and go intermittently over a period of weeks or months, but you will notice that lymphadenopathy involving two or more extra inguinal sites is found in the majority of HIV positive patients. Lymphadenopathy occurs most frequently in the cervical and axillary regions. Lymph nodes are firm, mobile, non-tender and generally do not exceed six cm in diameter. Lymph nodes larger than six cm in diameter in HIV infected patients are often of a tuberculosis origin.</p>
                            <p>Mucocutaneous manifestations are also common in patients with HIV infection. A characteristic generalised papular parasitic eruption is found in approximately 20-60% patients with HIV infection, which is often seen in the early stages of illness but is generally found intermittently throughout the course of the disease though its aetiology is unknown.</p>

                            <p>The initial lesion is a small firm and very pruritic papule, which releases a small drop of fluid when scratched. The papules become hyper pigmented macules. They are symmetrically distributed over the body, but are most frequently found on the extremities. Histological features are non-specific and include perivascular infiltration of the skin and subcutaneous tissue with mononuclear cells with a variable number of eosinophils.</p>
                            <p>Recurrent mucocutaneous herpes simplex infections are found in 5-10% of patients with HIV infection. Over 10% of patients with HIV infection experience a varicella Zoster infection, which is recurrent in one-quarter of the cases. The initial episodes of varicella Zoster infection are often the first manifestations of HIV-associated illness.</p>
                            <p>Oral candidiasis in the absence of antimicrobial immunosuppressive therapy or an immunosuppressive illness is highly associated with HIV infection. Its occurrence in an HIV-positive patient is often a bad prognostic sign and an indication of progression towards 'full-blown' AIDS.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Stage 4: AIDS or Late HIV Infection</h3>
                            <p>This is the final stage of HIV infection. It occurs when HIV has destroyed vital aspects of the immune system leaving the body vulnerable to life threatening infections, which eventually lead to death. You may have nursed or seen an AIDS patient in this stage.</p>
                            <p>You will now look at some of the life threatening diseases, which manifest during this stage since signs and symptoms depend on the opportunistic infection, which sets in.</p>
                            <p>There are no common symptoms for individuals diagnosed with AIDS. When the immune system damage is more severe, people may experience opportunistic infections (called opportunistic because they are caused by organisms which take the 'opportunity' of the weakened immune system to flourish in people with HIV infection). Most of these more severe infections, diseases and symptoms fall under the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's definition of 'full blown AIDS'.</p>
                            <p>You will find that these opportunistic infections generally result from reactivation rather than from primary infection.</p>
                            <p>The predominant clinical presentation of AIDS is diarrhoea (wasting syndrome). Patients may lose several litres of liquid stool a day, sometimes leading to severe dehydration. The cause of this secretory diarrhoea is not known and established intestinal pathogens like cryptosporidium parvum, microsporidia and Isospora belli can be detected in only a minority of patients with HIV/AIDS. Also, fever of unknown origin is a very common symptom. It may be due to endemic infections unrelated to the underlying HIV infection, for example, malaria. Additionally, the patient might develop pneumonia, Haemoptysis and pleural effusion, which is mainly caused by tuberculosis or Kaposi's sarcoma. You may also find that Neurological syndromes such as chronic and acute meningitis, myelopathy, encephalopathy with dementia and peripheral neuropathy complicate the clinical course of AIDS.</p>

                            <p>The diagnosis of AIDS is initially clinical, based on the opportunistic infections identified or other factors suggestive of HIV/AIDS like if the patient has multiple sex partners, or a sex partner known to have HIV/AIDS. Other factors include history of recent genital ulcer disease or any STI, blood transfusion or any surgical procedure with unsterilised instruments. A serological test is used to confirm the infection through HIV antibody detection. Although the serological results may be positive, the test is repeated three times, using different types of preparation according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations.</p>

                                Management of HIV/AIDS
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Management of a HIV/AIDS patient is very complex, as you have to deal with physical and psychosocial aspects. The main aim of management is to reduce suffering caused by HIV infections itself and by the opportunistic diseases.</p>
                            <p>Management of the AIDS patient does not require any special facility except for those with tuberculosis who may be highly contagious. However, contact with mucosal excretions should be avoided by use of gloves.</p>
                            <p>When talking of management you think about nursing management and drug therapy. The opportunistic diseases weighing the patient down will dictate nursing management. Please refer to nursing management for specific conditions in module one. This leaves drug therapy. There is no cure for HIV infection but antiretroviral therapy can assist the infected individual to live a better life.</p>
                            <p>You will now look at antiretroviral therapy and goals of therapy, which include maximal and durable suppression of plasma viral load, preservation or restoration of immunology function, improvement of quality of life and reduction of HIV related morbidity and mortality. To achieve these goals there must be maximum adherence to the antiretroviral regimen, rational sequencing of drugs, preserving future treatment options and use of resistance testing in selected clinical settings where possible.</p>
                            <p>Before you decide to start antiretroviral therapy you should consider the patient's acceptance or readiness and the probability of adherence, though the strength of recommendation is dependent on the prognosis as determined by how far the disease has progressed (the stage of the disease) CD4 (T-lymphocyte) count and viral load (plasma HIV RNA) assessed through laboratory investigations. Also investigations should be carried out to establish factors leading to symptomatology including common opportunistic infections.</p>
                            <p>The optimal time to initiate antiretroviral therapy is not known or not decided upon. Thus, you should weigh the benefits against the risks of early and delayed antiretroviral therapy, you then need to discuss these with the patient before starting the treatment. Now look at the benefits and risks of early or delayed antiretroviral therapy.</p>
                            <p>Early antiretroviral therapy makes it easier to control viral replication, it delays or prevents immune system compromise, lowers risk of resistance to the drug if complete viral suppression is achieved, while the risks include early development of drug resistance thus limitation of future antiretroviral treatment options.</p>
                            <p>Delayed therapy benefits the patient in that it preserves the maximum number of available and future antiretroviral drugs options when HIV disease risk is highest and delays development of drug resistance. However, it has its own disadvantages. When treatment is started late there are possible risks of irreversible immune system depletion and it is also difficult to suppress viral relocation. With this in mind, you should make the decision on when is the best time to start the treatment basing on when is it likely to benefit the patient most.</p>
                            
                            <h3 class="card-title">Antiretroviral Drug Classes</h3>
                            <p>Antiretroviral drugs are combined to achieve good results. The antiretroviral drugs are grouped into three different classes according to how they work on the HIV virus. They have been found to provide Highly Active Anti-retroviral Therapy (HAART) when combined properly.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4"><strong>The doses given are for an adult.</strong> Doctors prescribe the drugs but you need the knowledge to assist in decision making and administering of the drugs. Remember, you are an active member of the caring team.</p>
                            <p>Patients on antiretroviral therapy need close monitoring so that drugs can be changed if need be.</p>
                            <p>The CD4 cell count is a laboratory marker of the strength of one's immune system, (normal adult range is 500-1800 cells per cubic millimetres of blood volume) and is used to determine the progress of HIV disease and predict the risk of developing complications. During this time nursing care and counselling services should be availed continuously to the patient. Nursing care will be discussed under home-based care, so now move on to look at counselling in detail.</p>
                            <p>Management of the HIV/AIDS patient is complex. It is this complexity that makes the counselling of such a patient difficult depending on the level (stage of the disease) you meet the patient or the purpose for which counselling is being conducted. For the already diagnosed case, counselling should take care of physical, psychological and socio-economic issues. Thus, in most cases you will do as much you can as a nurse then refer the patient to the trained counsellors who are equipped with the knowledge, skills and attitudes to face the challenges of HIV/AIDS counselling.</p>
                            <p>In the management of HIV/AIDS there is pre and post counselling. It is government policy that every patient should be counselled before undergoing and an AIDS test and before receiving test results. As a rule, all patients undergoing an HIV test should do so after adequate pre-test counselling. They should be informed of the nature of the test and the meaning and consequences of a positive result.</p>
                            <p>There are different reasons for HIV testing, for example, an asymptomatic individual test is often made as a result of a test solicited for routine medical examination required by insurance schemes, employers or for travel purposes while a symptomatic test may be taken as part of medical investigations. I hope you remember the difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic stages. Please check up if you have forgotten.</p>
                            <p>Post testing counselling forms an integral part in the process of giving back HIV test results. This will be discussed in details under Voluntary Counselling and Testing VCT.</p>
                            <p>As you have seen earlier, HIV positive results confirm the diagnosis. Once that is done, the patient should benefit from ongoing counselling and support which will be discussed under home based care.</p>

                                Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT)
                            </h2>
                        </div>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>Voluntary counselling and HIV testing (VCT) is an essential component of response to the AIDs epidemic. The campaigns for VCT aim at behaviour change. You know that the first government approach was to create awareness about the seriousness of HIV spread, which has given rise to a high level of awareness but without corresponding behaviour change. Currently the Ministry of Health (MOH) response to the HIV epidemic in the national strategic plan (1999-2004) includes the introduction of voluntary counselling and testing into the public health care system. You might wonder how VCT will assist in 'behaviour change', which is need so badly to avert the spread of HIV/AIDS?</p>
                            <p>Documented research from many countries has shown that people, who know their HIV status whether negative or positive, drastically change their sexual behaviour. Therefore, it is believed that knowing one's HIV status empowers people to make informed decisions about their sexual lifestyle that would otherwise predispose individuals to HIV infection. It is believed that the majority of Kenyan people do not know their HIV status. So it is this population that VCT targets.</p>
                            <p>Through VCT, it is possible to identify those infected early for proper care services and the uninfected to be informed on how to remain HIV negative. Therefore, VCT is important in any HIV prevention efforts that have proven to be cost effective. Additionally, VCT serves as entry point for long term supportive services for patients who become aware of their HIV status. VCT can also assist HIV positive patients adopt behaviour that does not transmit the disease to their sexual partner or infants. VCT services can also be entry points for providing other services like detecting and treating tuberculosis, preventing other opportunistic infections in HIV infected persons, and preventing mother-to-child transmission.</p>
                            <p>You also find that, through VCT those who are HIV positive can be assisted to be open up and start informing their sexual partners, families, community and general population about their HIV status, with an aim of preventing HIV spread. At the same time, they can be helped to make appropriate plans for their future by making informed decisions about certain issues like marriage, pregnancy or sexual relationships. VCT can also provide the opportunity for receiving additional services such as legal assistance, family planning and detecting and treating other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
                            <p>You have seen that there are many advantages of VCT and the chances are that it might have an impact in prevention of HIV spread. You will now look at what VCT entails. First and foremost the campaign for VCT aims at motivating people of all cadres to come forward on their own accord to receive the services. So VCT services should be completely voluntary, that is the patient should come and make a request for the service. Then pre-testing counselling is carried out before testing so that the patient can give informed consent for the test.</p>
                            <p>Confidentiality is maintained at all times. After the test is done, post counselling is also carried out to prepare the patient for receive the results. Therefore, it is mandatory that pre and post test counselling is done with a lot of concentration because it carries the key to success. At any level, counselling should emphasise on behaviour change as a way to prevent transmission.</p>
                            <p>To succeed in VCT services, counselling procedures should be carried out in a safe and trusting environment where individuals or the couples feel free to express their feelings. There is need to discuss the window period and the need for retesting especially for those with HIV negative results. It is during counselling where the patient should receive relevant and accurate information about HIV/AIDS hence the need to refer patients to a trained VCT counsellor. Relevant and accurate information help individuals or couple to make informed decisions regarding their health, family planning, child bearing and safer sex</p>
                            <p>There are some important facts you need to appreciate whilst talking of VCT. For instance, HIV is mostly contracted through sexual intercourse and it can be prevented, HIV is spreading very fast yet there is no cure (antiretroviral drugs only prolong and improve the quality of life), and HIV/AIDS affects everyone.</p>
                            <p>You will now look at look who benefits from VCT services.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">A person who is serious about behaviour change.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Those planning marriage or a new relationship.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Those with more than one sexual partner now or in the past.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">A person who has had a blood transfusion.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">An individual or couple considering a pregnancy or a woman who is already pregnant.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">A person suffering from sexually transmitted diseases especially genital ulcer disease.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The HIV negative individual will benefit from VCT services in that he/she will learn how to remain negative. Couples can marry or plan for future pregnancies without doubt and, above all, testing negative creates powerful motivation towards behaviour change which is the goal of VCT.</p>
