                            <p>At present AIDS has no cure, The disease is spreading so fast that hospitals can't cope with the large numbers of patients wanting admission, which leaves no other alternative but to care for them at home. This section will take you through the important aspect of home care.</p>
                            <p>So far, you have learned to diagnose, treat and educate people who are infected with almost all STIs that are common in Kenya. However, you have not adequately considered the management of HIV/AIDS, the subject of this section.</p>
                            <p>Since there is no cure, management of HIV/AIDS may be thought of as care aimed at relieving and containing physical symptoms, conserving and maintaining the body strength and providing emotional, social and spiritual support.</p>
                            <p>The increasing number of people developing AIDS is alarming and it is creating a heavy burden on formal health sector, which has led to the home based care concept.</p>

                            <p>Home based care is an approach to care provision that combines clinical services, nursing care, counselling and social support. It represents a continuum of care, from the health facility, to the community, to the family and to the individual infected with HIV/AIDS. It is a call for partnership among family members, healthcare organisations and the patients themselves in the provision of care. Thus, home based care can be defined as the care given to persons infected and affected by HIV/AIDS that is extended from the health facility to the patient's home, through family participation and community involvement.</p>
                            <p>Home based care is holistic. It is a product of collaborative efforts by the hospital, family and the community to enhance the quality of life for people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. It encompasses clinical care, nursing care, counselling, psycho spiritual care and social support and these form the four components of comprehensive home based care.</p>

                            <p>Clinical care is concerned with an early diagnosis, rational treatment and planning for follow up care. It includes care to promote and maintain good health, hygiene and nutrition.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Nursing Care</h3>
                            <p>Nursing is defined as 'the art of assisting individuals, sick or well, to do those things they would do if they had the strength, knowledge, or will, or to a peaceful death.'</p>
                            <p>Nursing care for people living with HIV/AIDS is aimed at alleviating physical and psychological symptoms as well as maximising the level of function of the affected person. A systematic assessment of the needs of the sick individual and provision of care to meet those needs is important in achieving the nursing aims. While the PLWHA is still in the hospital, there is recruitment into a home based care programme for patients and relatives. Preparation of a hospital discharge plan should be taken as a priority.</p>

                            <p>Nurses and health care workers should be trained in home based care. Community health workers and family members should also be trained to provide care. Nurses also require equipment and supplies for general nursing procedures as well as time and transport to enable them to access the patient. The family/relatives of the patient should be provided with home care kits containing gloves, cotton wool, disinfectants, and basic medicines.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Counselling and Psycho Spiritual Care</h3>
                            <p>This component of the caring process includes reducing stress and anxiety for both the patient and family members, promoting positive living, and helping individuals to make informed decisions on HIV testing, plan for the future and behavioural change, make risk reduction plans, and involve sexual partner(s) in such decisions.</p>
                            <p>The counselling component is particularly important given the emotional and spiritual upheaval the disease causes. Remember that home based care does not end when a person succumbs to the disease. It must be extended to the survivors, especially the children.</p>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Social Care</h3>
                            <p>Social support includes information and referral to support groups, welfare services, and legal advice for individuals and families, and provision of material assistance where possible.</p>
                            <p>Home based care can provide the support that will enable the HIV positive person to extend their productive life for many years. It enables the patient to live positively with the disease because home based care recognises that a diagnosis of HIV does not necessarily mean death is at hand.</p>
                            <p>This type of care also helps people change attitudes towards persons living with HIV/AIDS and towards the disease itself. As a result, it reduces the stigma attached to HIV/AIDS victims.</p>
                            <p>The disease is ultimately fatal and has no cure, therefore you all must continue with prevention efforts. It is observed that when the family and community members provide social support to their family members, neighbours and colleagues, they not only increase access to care but become involved in prevention activities.</p>
                            <p>Thus home based care enhances prevention of HIV spread.</p>

                            <p>You have seen that home based care is a teamwork affair, as people with HIV/AIDS have needs of different types which dictate that a variety of care providers must work collaboratively for their patient's welfare. This collaboration is called 'a continuum of care'.</p>
                            <p>The concept of a continuum of care highlights the need for, and importance of, interrelated and complementary inputs from a variety of sources, all directed towards the welfare of a person who has HIV/AIDS.</p>
                            <p>The idea of a continuum of care is that the welfare of a person with HIV/AIDS is best served by integrated and complementary inputs from a variety of sources, for example, health workers, family, community, social services, religious groups and so on. However partnership between the health workers and the family forms the foundation of the care for person with HIV/AIDS.</p>
