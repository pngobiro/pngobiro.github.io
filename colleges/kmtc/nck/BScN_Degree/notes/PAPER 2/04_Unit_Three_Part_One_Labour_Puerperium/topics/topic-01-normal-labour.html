                                You have successfully completed Units One and Two of this module on Reproductive Health. In the previous units, you learnt about obstetric anatomy, normal pregnancy, antenatal care, obstetric pharmacology and breastfeeding. As you learned, a well-managed pregnancy is likely to have a very happy ending. This unit will take you through labour, puerperium and the neonate.

                                The unit is divided into two parts. Part One deals with normal labour, the neonate and puerperium. In Part Two, we will discuss abnormal pregnancy and abnormal labour.

                                Your role as a midwife demands clinical expertise in supervising, caring for and supporting the pregnant mother during pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, labour and puerperium. You should be able to conduct deliveries on your own, and be ready to intervene when complications arise. It is also your responsibility to recognise and act promptly should you be presented with an abnormal condition, for example: mal-presentation, obstructed labour, or obstetric and neonatal emergencies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In order to recognise and deal with complications of pregnancy, delivery, and the puerperium, you as a health worker must first be thoroughly familiar with the characteristics of normal pregnancy, delivery and puerperium. As you may remember, you have already discussed normal pregnancy in the previous Unit. In this Unit, you will review the features of normal and abnormal labour and consider how each stage of labour is managed. You will also examine the normal puerperium and review methods of monitoring a mother for post-delivery complications.

                                    <p>Do you know that a mother, who is psychologically well prepared during pre-natal care, will go through labour and delivery with ease? Research has shown that if a woman in labour has confidence in her caregiver she will experience a considerably lower level of labour pains. Professionalism, calmness and a 'matter-of-fact' manner on the part of the caregiver is a greater tranquiliser to the mother who is in pain than medicine (Leeder: 1994).</p>
                                    <p>It goes without saying, therefore, that a midwife's behaviour and attitude towards a mother in labour makes the difference between painful and less-painful labour. A relaxed mother will usually have a shorter period of labour than a tense mother.</p>

                            <p>A midwife should ensure women have sufficient information to assist them to recognise the onset of true labour. A pregnant woman would be best placed to diagnose the onset of labour herself.</p>
                            <p>Some young women, especially the primigravidae (those pregnant for the first time), may fail to recognise true labour. It is important that you help them differentiate between false and true labour signs. The contractions of true labour are regular and intense. In false labour, the contractions are sporadic (Braxton-Hicks contractions). False contractions occur during the last weeks of pregnancy. The following table outlines some factors that can help to differentiate true and false labour.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Signs of True Labour</h3>
                            <p>The presence of the following signs and symptoms will give evidence that the mother is in labour:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Contractions of the uterus, which are increasingly strong, painful and regular</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The cervix is taken up into the lower uterine segment causing dilatation of the cervix</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">There is a mucoid blood stained discharge, which is called show</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>The causes that trigger the onset of labour are not known. However, many theories have been offered which indicate that both hormonal and mechanical factors play a big part. You will now study each of these factors in turn.</p>

                            <h3>Hormonal Factors</h3>
                            <p>It is believed that close to term progesterone levels in the body fall, while at the same time levels of oestrogen (which is responsible for sensitising the uterine muscles) rise. The fall in progesterone levels is important because it has effect on muscle contractions. The rise in oestrogen levels meanwhile triggers the release of oxytocin, which causes uterine contractions. The foetal hypothalamus is believed to produce releasing factors, which stimulate the anterior pituitary gland to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH stimulates the foetal adrenal glands to secrete cortisol, which causes relative levels of placental hormones to rise. These cause further uterine contractions.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Mechanical Factors</h3>
                            <p>Uterine activity can also result from the mechanical stimulation of the uterus and cervix. This may be due to over stretching, as in the case of multiple pregnancy and polyhydromnios, or pressure from the presenting part, when it is well applied to the cervix.</p>
                            <p>It appears that there is a combination of hormonal (from both mother and foetus) and mechanical factors that set labour in motion.</p>

The descent of the head and the body of the baby gives space to the lungs, heart and stomach, which enables these organs to function easily. The symphysis pubis widens and the pelvic floor softens and becomes more relaxed, allowing further descent of the uterus into the pelvis.</p>

The laxity of the pelvic floor muscles gives rise to poor sphincter control causing a degree of stress incontinence. This pressure results in the congestion of circulation to the lower limbs. Additionally the relaxation of the pelvic joint may give rise to backache.</p>

                            <h3>Contractions</h3>
                            <p>The contractions of the uterus are coordinated by two pacemakers in the region of the cornua. These are located where the fallopian tubes join the uterine body. The muscle contractions start at the top corner of the uterus, spread to the fundus, and then downward. During normal pregnancy, the uterus contracts intermittently but the contractions are not strong enough to overcome the resistance of a normal cervix and do not lead to its dilation. The contractions of pregnancy become more frequent towards full term and get more painful and noticeable. A multipara may have such 'false pains' for some days before the onset of true labour. They may come to hospital too early thinking they are in established labour. This is what is referred to as 'false labour'.</p>
                            <p>You will now look at uterine action and how contractions interact with the cervix.</p>

                            <h3>Uterine Action</h3>
                            <p>By the end of pregnancy, the uterus is divided into two anatomically distinct segments, known as the upper and the lower uterine segments.</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Upper uterine segment:</strong> A thick muscular, contractile area from where the contractions begin. The longitudinal fibres retract, pulling on the lower segment and causing it to stretch, pushing the head down.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li class="list-item">
                                    <span class="list-marker"></span>
                                    <span class="list-content"><strong>Lower uterine segment:</strong> Thinner and develops from the isthmus of the uterus about eight to ten centimetres in length and is prepared for distension and/or dilatation. The lower segment stretches when being pulled by the longitudinal fibres. The force applied by the descending head or breech also aids the stretching.</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The retraction ring which is an imaginary ridge, forms between the upper and the lower uterine segment. It is present in every labour and is perfectly normal as long as it is not marked enough to be visible above the symphysis pubis.</p>

                            <h3>Fundal Dominance</h3>
                            <p>During a contraction the uterus feels hard to touch. At the beginning of the process, contractions are painless and involuntary, and are controlled by the nervous system under the influence of endocrine hormones.</p>
                            <p>The contraction starts at the upper part of fundus, spreading across, and by the time they reach the lower fundus, they last longer and are very intense. The peak of the contraction is reached simultaneously over the whole uterus and fades from all parts together. This pattern allows the cervix to dilate and the contracting fundus to expel the foetus.</p>

                            <h3>Polarity</h3>
                            <p>Polarity describes the neuromuscular harmony between the two poles or segments of the uterus throughout labour. The upper pole contracts strongly and retracts to expel the foetus. The lower pole contracts slightly and dilates to allow expulsion of the foetus to take place.</p>

                            <h3>Contraction and Retraction</h3>
                            <p>When labour starts, approximately 280 days from the first day of the last menstrual period, the contractions change in character. They become regular and more painful. Labour contractions differ from those of pregnancy in that they are followed by retraction. This is characteristic of uterine muscle in labour. The contracted muscle does not return to its original length when the contraction passes off.</p>
                            <p>Each succeeding contraction leads to further shortening of the muscle fibres so that the uterine cavity becomes smaller and smaller.</p>
                            <p>This is what makes the cervix dilate. This process is illustrated in the figure below.</p>

                            <p>When talking about contractions, you as a midwife are concerned with three factors, namely the strength, the duration and the frequency of the contraction.</p>
                            <p>When you talk of the strength of a contraction, you identify it as one of three categories: weak, fair or fairly strong, and strong. The strength of a contraction is measured according to the time it has taken. Thus, a contraction which takes 10 to 30 seconds is said to be weak, one that takes 30 to 40 is said to be fair or fairly strong and one that lasts for 40 to 60 seconds is said to be strong.</p>
                            <p>The duration refers to the time taken by a contraction, for example a weak contraction lasts for 10 to 30 seconds.</p>
                            <p>Frequency, on the other hand refers to the number of intervals between one contraction and the next. If a mother has one contraction after every 45 minutes, the frequency is written as 1:45.</p>

                            <h3>The Shortening and Dilation of The Cervix</h3>
                            <p>Before labour begins, the cervix of a primagravida is a thick hard cone which protrudes into the vagina. The canal is at least one inch long. When labour begins the strongly contracting upper segment of the uterus starts retracting and getting shorter, while the thinner lower segment of the uterus gets pulled away from the presenting part. This stretches the lower segment. The latter, in turn pulls the internal Os. This dragging away of the internal Os from the presenting part starts dilating the upper part of the cervical canal. This goes on until the canal is shorter and shorter and finally there is no canal at all. The canal becomes part of the uterine cavity with only the undilated external Os and the thinly stretched cervix separating this cavity from the vagina. When this happens, we say the cervix has been 'effaced' or 'taken up'.</p>

                            <p>In a primigravida the cervix usually becomes almost fully effaced before any dilation takes place, while in multiparous women the two processes take place together. The cervix of a multipara might be already effaced and be dilated enough to admit a finger up to the internal Os even before labour starts. These signs of labour are assessed by doing a vaginal examination, though with experience, you can also get a good idea by doing a rectal examination.</p>
                            <p>The way you guide a mother has a great influence on the progress of her labour.</p>

                            <h3>The Show</h3>
                            <p>Throughout pregnancy the cervical canal is sealed by a plug of mucus known as an operculum. Together with the intact membranes this prevents organisms ascending into the uterine cavity.</p>
                            <p>When labour starts, the internal Os is pulled away from the foetal membranes and the canal is opened up. This releases the mucous plug which oozes out of the vagina mixed with a little blood. This is called the 'show'.</p>

                            <p>Labour is divided into four stages, although in real practice, the process is a continuous one and change from one stage to the other may not be clearly obvious. The four stages of labour are known as First stage, Second stage, Third stage and Fourth stage.</p>
                            
                            <div class="callout callout--note">

                                    <h4 class="callout-title">The First Stage</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="callout-content">
                                    <p>This is known as the stage of cervical dilatation. This stage begins when regular, painful uterine contractions start and is detected clinically by the thinning and effacement of the cervix, followed by its dilatation. The normally thick cervix becomes thinned out and stretched over the presenting part. The first stage is completed when the cervix is fully dilated and the presenting part starts being expelled. This stage has two phases, known as the latent and the active phase.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>The contractions of the uterus dilate the cervix. The dilatation of the internal Os causes the separation of the chorion from the decidua closest to it. A small bag of membranes is formed and is forced into the internal Os by the intrauterine pressure. At the beginning of each contraction, a little more amniotic fluid is forced into the bag of membranes. The head of the foetus then comes down like a ball valve and separates the amniotic fluid above it from that in the bag. The bag of membranes may remain intact until nearly the end of the first stage. However, even if the membranes rupture early the cervix will still become dilated as it is drawn up over the presenting part by the retraction of the upper segment.</p>
                            <p>During the first stage, the foetus does not move downwards to any great degree. When a certain amount of fluid has left the uterus after the membranes have ruptured, a new form of pressure comes into play, namely foetal axis pressure. The upper pole of the foetus, normally the breech, is pressed on by the fundus of the uterus, while the lower pole is pressed down onto the lower segment and cervix. Should the membranes rupture early, foetal axis pressure will operate at an early stage. In modern practice, the membranes are often deliberately ruptured during labour because this is believed to encourage more efficient uterine action and shorten labour. You should be cautious carrying out this procedure in this era of HIV.</p>
                            
                            <p>The duration of the latent phase of labour need not be defined too accurately. Dilation of the cervix from 0 to 3cm can take six hours, but slower progress may be normal and is perfectly acceptable provided that the woman is comfortable and in no way distressed. Between 3 and 10cm dilatation (that is in the active phase of labour) the cervix should dilate at a rate of about 1 cm per hour, giving a theoretical duration of seven hours for this phase of labour in both primiparous and multiparous women. During the early part of the latent phase the pains may not be very severe but towards the end of the active phase they are often very distressing, constituting the most painful part of labour. Vomiting and reflex shivering are common at the end of the active phase of the first stage of labour.</p>
                            <p>By now the membranes have ruptured. If the membranes remain intact when the cervix is fully dilated, the onset of the expulsive stage may be delayed. This is because the cervix does not receive the pressure of the head, which helps to stimulate the uterus to increase its activity. If the membranes remain intact after full dilatation, they should be ruptured with toothed forceps or a sterile plastic amnihook during a contraction.</p>

                            <h3>Physiological Changes in the First Stage of Labour</h3>
                            <p>This is the stage of dilatation of the cervix. On average, it lasts eight to twelve hours in a primigravida and six to eight hours in a multipara. It should not go beyond 14 hours in either. This stage is characterised by the uterus doing an immense amount of muscular work in the form of contracting and relaxing. Contractions are involuntary in that they do not come on through voluntary effort of the woman nor can they be voluntarily stopped. They are peristaltic and regular.</p>
                            <p>Contractions at the start of labour come every 10 to 15 minutes and last between 30 to 45 seconds. They increase in frequency and strength as labour progresses until they are separated by a minute or two. Towards the end of the first stage they last for one minute. The relaxation phase during which the muscles remain retracted also shortens.</p>
                            <p>Each contraction begins with a gradual build-up towards a peak of intensity. This is followed by a relaxation phase. During the relaxation phase, the muscle recovers and gets ready for the next contraction. This relaxation phase is important to both the foetus and the mother during the first and second stages of labour.</p>
                            <p>During a contraction the circulation through the uterine wall is reduced and the foetal heart rate is slowed but regains its normal rate as soon as the contraction has passed. If there is increasing foetal tachycardia between contractions or if the bradycardia is prolonged after each contraction, then foetal distress sets in. If the uterus contracts continuously the foetus dies from lack of oxygen (anoxia).</p>
                            <p>The mother is also able to relax during the relaxation phase. However, if the uterus contracts continuously, the mother also gets very exhausted because the uterus uses up a lot of energy during contractions. If this goes on for too long, as is the case during prolonged labour, her energy stores become depleted and maternal distress sets in.</p>
                            <p>As the mother will not be able to eat or absorb much by mouth, she should be given supplementary carbohydrates intravenously. In a normal first stage, oral fluids to which additional sugar has been added are sufficient.</p>
                            <p>As the uterus contracts and retracts more and more, the upper muscular part becomes progressively thicker. The less muscular lower segment is pulled upwards over the presenting part and becomes thinner. The cervix becomes effaced. The effacement is followed or accompanied by progressive dilation of the cervix until full dilatation when the uterus becomes a continuous cavity with the vagina.</p>
                            <p>A fully dilated cervix is 10 cm dilated. During the first stage the uterine cavity gets progressively smaller but the foetus moves down very little. The presenting part helps in dilating the cervix. During this stage the woman should not use her voluntary efforts to bear down as this will exhaust her unnecessarily and may cause oedema of the cervix and/or foetal distress.</p>

                            <p>The proper management of labour is essential, if you are to avoid problems or to detect them early when they occur. The patient will come to you believing she is in labour. You should be able to assess and decide whether she is in labour or not. The patient may be in early labour, but often she might arrive in the late second or even third stage.</p>
                            <p>If you are sure she is not in labour send her home to wait. If she is in labour, keep her in the ward and continue monitoring her progress. Danger, especially to the foetus, can arise suddenly and unexpectedly</p>

                            <p>When you admit a mother in the first stage of labour, what activities should you carry out?</p>
                            <p>You would take the patient's personal history, conduct a physical examination and carry out tests/investigations.</p>
                            <p>On admission, you should check the woman's antenatal card for any identified risk factors. It will also help you to see if there were any abnormalities during her pregnancy. The records will also have information on her medical and obstetric history. If she has not been attending an antenatal clinic, this is the time to take detailed history as covered in unit two of this module.</p>
                            <p>Once this information has been established, find out more about the present labour. Take her history, do an examination and carry out the necessary investigations to establish the stage of labour and the state of the mother and the foetus. The steps you should take will be covered on the following pages.</p>

                            <h3>History Taking</h3>
                            <p>A detailed personal history should have been taken during pre-natal care. However, if this has not been done, this is a good time to get it recorded. Make sure the names are correctly spelled because this can eventually result in problems when registering the baby. Review the last day of menstruation to calculate the expected date of delivery. Check her age, parity and contraceptive history. Assuming that a detailed personal history had been taken during pre-natal care, you should now take information about the following:</p>

                            <p>You should start by explaining to the mother that you want to examine her. The health care provider should appreciate the psychological aspect of a woman in labour, respect her feelings and the need for company or privacy. They should support the woman and her partner or family during labour, birth and the immediate postpartum period. Failure to do this has contributed to many women delivering at home, a place where they are appreciated but without an assured clean and safe delivery.</p>
                            
                            <p>When examining her, check on her general condition. Check if she is exhausted, anaemic, in great pain, dehydrated, or with generalised oedema. You should also check her height. This will enable you to exclude any risk factors.</p>
                            <p>You should also take her vital measurements including her blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Conduct an abdominal examination checking for:</p>

                            <p>You should also check on the presentation. Which part of the foetus is at the pelvic brim? Is it a head (cephalic) or the buttocks (breech)? Check the attitude; whether the head is well flexed or extended. A well-flexed head presents the smallest diameter and delivers easily. A deflexed head presents a larger diameter and causes delayed or obstructed labour.</p>
                            <p>Finally check the position of the relation of the foetal parts to the mother. This is confirmed through a vaginal examination by checking the position of the foetal occiput relative to the mother. The position of the foetal spine is the same as that of the occiput.</p>

                            <p>This is an important examination as it can give you a lot of information, which you might not get from an abdominal examination. On the other hand, if you do it often it is uncomfortable for the woman and you might introduce an infection into the uterine cavity, especially if the membranes have ruptured. To avoid infections, you should scrub and put on gloves as you would for any other sterile procedure. Then thoroughly swab the perineum of the woman with an antiseptic solution such as Savlon or Hibitane, or boiled water if these are not available.</p>

                            <h3>The Presenting Part</h3>
                            <p>Next, determine the level of the presenting part. You should ask the following questions:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Is it fitting the pelvis and cervix well?</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">If it is the head, can you feel a suture or fontanel? Which one?</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Is it well flexed?</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">If the head is at the brim it, will not be felt vaginally unless you push it down with your left hand which is on the mother's abdomen</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">If the head has just engaged, it can be touched or just be tipped</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">If the head is deeply engaged, the head is felt at the level of the ischial spines</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The station or level of the presenting part is the level to which the presenting part has descended in the pelvis. The level of the presenting part is expressed in relation to the easily palpable ischial spines. You can also state if it is above the brim, at the brim, in the cavity or at the outlet.</p>
                            <p>Remember that if the presenting part is at the brim then it is at station -5. As the head descends down in to the cavity of the pelvis it decreases from -5, -4, -3, -2, -1. By the time it is at the ischial spines, it is said to be at 'zero station'. It reappears from the pelvic outlet into the perineum, which is classified as +1, +2, +3, and +4. By the time it is seen at the perineum it is at station +5.</p>

                            <h3>Position</h3>
                            <p>Observe the position of the presenting part. This is the position of the foetal parts in relation to the parts of the pelvis. A point on the foetus, such as the occiput in a vertex presentation, is usually used as a reference point.</p>
                            <p>To get the position right, you have to palpate the sutures and fontanel to determine their position relative to the pelvis. This can be confirmed by abdominal examination.</p>
                            <p>In a breech or a face presentation, the reference points on the foetus are the sacrum and the chin or mentum respectively. A soft mass is felt. Foetal genital parts or the anus may be felt with the examining finger. The position is determined by the position of the sacrum in relation to the side of the mother's pelvis. The left side is expressed as left sacro-anterior (LSA) or the right side, which is known as right sacro-anterior (RSA).</p>
                            <p>In a vertex presentation, when the occiput is persistently posterior, this causes prolonged labour. In a cephalic presentation, you will feel the hard head sutures and fontanel. Determine whether it is the anterior or posterior fontanel by its shape. If it is the posterior fontanel, then the position is occipito-anterior. If it is the anterior fontanel then the position is occipital-posterior.</p>
                            <p>Face presentation is important as the chin is the facial landmark. Note how the position of the chin is related to the mother's right thigh (RT) or left thigh (LT), side of the pelvis and the anterior and posterior position expressed as RMP (right mento posterior). You should also note the brow or sincipit presentation on vaginal examination (VE). You should be able to feel the brow, frontal sutures and possibly the posterior fontanel. The extension is usually a temporary presentation, which converts to face or occiput presentation during labour. However, at times it persists and in such instances, a caesarean section is usually called for.</p>

                            <p>Note whether the long axis of the body of the foetus is perpendicular to that of the body of the mother. A left acromiodorso posterior (LADP) indicates that the baby's lower shoulder is to the mother's left and its back is towards her back. A compound presentation is when the hand or occasionally a foot lies alongside the head.</p>

                            <h3>The Pelvis</h3>
                            <p>Next check for moulding or caput succedaneum.</p>
                            <p><strong>What is moulding?</strong></p>
                            <p>Moulding is when the diameters of the foetal skull are reduced in size. During labour the bones of the foetal skull tend to overlap at the sutures so that the head can easily pass through the birth canal. During a vaginal examination this is how you should check for moulding:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">In cephalic presentation, run the finger on the head feeling for the sutures</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>The pelvis is assessed to check if it is adequate (see unit two).</p>
                            <p>The following factors should be checked:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Is it roomy?</span></li>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Is the pubic arch wide enough?</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">After checking for moulding, direct the fingers behind the head and make an effort to reach the sacro-promontory. The palm of the hand should be facing upwards. Promontory of the sacrum should not be reached.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">With the palm facing downwards run the two fingers down along the hollow of the sacrum and determine the shape. The hollow of the sacrum should be curved.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The two fingers are then moved to where the ischial spines are located on either side of the pelvis. Run the finger along this area to determine whether or not the ischial spines are unduly prominent. Or else you can stretch your fingers to see if the spines are prominent. The ischial spines should not be prominent.</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">As you move the fingers with the palm facing upward, on reaching the pubic arch check if it can accommodate two fingers. The apex usually should accommodate two fingers.</span></li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>The following steps should be taken as part of your investigation:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Take a urine sample for albumin and sugar</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>By this time you will have gathered enough information as to the stage of labour and whether the patient belongs to the 'at risk' category and needs referral or not.</p>

                            <p>Remember to allay the mother's fears and reassure her throughout your examination and indeed throughout labour. A mother in labour needs to feel loved, cared for and to be treated with dignity.</p>

                            <p>After conducting a thorough examination of the mother and recording your observations in the partogram, there are a number of things you can do to make her feel comfortable during her labour i.e. allow her to change position and move around, use back massage, have a chosen companion with her during labour, allow her to take fluids as required and return the placenta to parents if so desired and directed by the culture. However do not forget to check on the foetus especially if you suspect foetal distress.</p>
                            <p>Write down any signs of foetal distress that you can think of.</p>
                            <p>If you diagnose foetal distress what steps might you carry out?</p>
