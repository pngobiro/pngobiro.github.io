                                Second Stage of Labour
                            </h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p>This starts with the full dilatation of the cervix and the expulsion of the presenting part and finishes with the complete delivery of the baby. As you know, there may be very little descent of the foetus during the first stage. However, in the second stage, the resistance offered by the lower uterine segment and the cervix has been overcome and the presenting part can be pushed down onto the pelvic floor. The resistance of the pelvic floor then has to be overcome by uterine contractions, aided by the action of the voluntary muscles of the abdominal wall and the diaphragm.</p>
                            <p>In the absence of an effective epidural block, full dilatation of the cervix is accompanied by a bearing down sensation during contractions and women are usually encouraged to push. As the contraction comes on, the woman takes a deep breath, then holds it and subsequently bears down with all the force of her abdominal muscles. These partly voluntary, partly reflex expulsive efforts place the foetus under additional stress and pushing should, therefore, not be allowed to continue for more than one hour. If delivery is not imminent, assistance in the form of Ventouse extraction, forceps delivery or even a Caesarean section may be necessary.</p>
                            
                            <p>As mentioned earlier, the second stage of labour begins with full dilatation of the cervix. It is the stage of descent and expulsion of the baby. It normally lasts from one to two hours on average in primigravida, and half an hour in multipara. If this stage goes beyond two hours it is considered abnormal. The contractions become stronger, lasting 40 to 60 seconds, with a one-minute recovery interval.</p>
                            <p>The retracted and contracting uterus pushes the foetus down into the pelvis. During the relaxation phase the pelvic floor pushes the presenting part up again but the retracted uterus does not allow all the progress achieved to be lost. Progressively the presenting part moves down until it reaches the pelvic floor. The presence of a foreign body in the vagina makes the woman want to bear down even against her will. The voluntary muscles of her abdomen and diaphragm help the uterus in the pushing. As a contraction comes the mother should be instructed to take in a deep breath, hold it and then bear down.</p>
                            <p>These expulsive efforts are partially voluntary. The vagina widens to accommodate the baby. It is now a continuous cavity with the uterus. The presenting part may push out faeces from the rectum as it goes through the vagina. When the presenting part reaches the pelvic floor it starts stretching the vulva, causing much pain, especially in the primigravida. For some time it keeps popping out during a contraction and receding back during the relaxation phase. After some time it can no longer slip back. This is known as 'crowning'. The head will have passed through the bony outlet of the pelvis. The perineum becomes stretched and paper-thin and it is at this stage that an episiotomy should be performed if necessary. The next contraction normally expels the presenting part.</p>

                            <p>The mechanism of labour refers to a series of movements the foetus has to make to pass through the birth canal.</p>

The foetus, therefore, has to adapt itself to the shape, size, and curve of the pelvis at different levels as it descends.</p>

                            <p>To be able to manage labour skilfully, you need to understand the natural movements made by the baby so that, when assisting in delivery, you can follow the movements rather than oppose them.</p>
                            <p>The factors, which influence the mechanism of labour, are known as the three 'Ps': power, passage, and passenger.</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">This refers to the size, lie and presentation of the foetus, as well as the placenta and membranes. For the foetus, a vertex presentation makes labour shorter as the presenting part fits well on the cervical Os and stimulates the cervix to dilate faster.</p>

                            </div>

                            <p>It is important to remember that descent occurs throughout and as mentioned earlier, ninety five per cent of all presentations are cephalic, and the presenting part is usually the vertex. This areas boundaries include the bregma or the anterior fontanel, the perietal eminences and the posterior fontanel. The presenting diameter is, therefore, the smallest - 9.5cm. In order to present with the smallest diameter, the head must be well flexed on the neck with the chin touching the chest. As the leading part meets resistance of the pelvic floor it rotates 1/8th forwards until it comes under the symphysis pubis.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Cardinal Movements of Labour</h3>
                            <p>The mechanism of labour in a cephalic vertex presentation includes the following steps:</p>

                                        <p class="step-text">Engagement is the descent of the presenting diameter through the pelvic brim. The head usually engages late in pregnancy in the primigravida while in the multipara it does not engage till labour starts. The head enters the pelvic brim in oblique diameter with sub occipital frontal diameter (10.5cm). With good uterine contraction, there is more flexion of the head. The head engages with sub occipital bregmatic (9.5 cms) oblique diameter of the pelvis brim.</p>

                                        <p class="step-text">The head rotates 1/8th of a circle. Such a rotation is achieved by the action of the uterine muscle pushing downwards. The pointed vertex presents on the broad levator ani muscle. When the vertex reaches the perineum, the occiput turns from the posterior to the anterior position. Anteriorly there is more room for further descent. When the occiput is below the symphysis pubis, crowning takes place.</p>

The nape of the neck is pressed firmly against the pubic arch. This extension of the head causes the anterior part to stretch the perineum gradually. Further extension allows the sinciput, face and chin to escape the perineum and the head is born by extension. Extension is the result of action from two forces. The abdominal and thoracic muscles exert downward pressure. The pelvic floor and perineum resist this pressure and push the head forward and upward through the weak area, which is the vagina.</p>

                            </ul>

                            <h4>Crowning and Extension</h4>
                            <p>Next is the crowning of the head. The parietal eminences pass through the bony outlet. At this stage the head no longer recedes between contractions.</p>
                            <p>Tell the mother to stop pushing as this might lead to a rapid delivery of the head and consequent brain damage. Ask her to pant. Research has shown that a series of short pushes are more effective than a long push. Encourage her as she pushes.</p>
                            <p><em>It is really hard work! So keep encouraging the mother with kind words and warmth!</em></p>
                            
                            <p>Assist the extension by grasping the parietal eminences with your left hand. Let the head come out slowly and naturally. Feel for the cord around the baby's neck. If it is there, slip it from the baby's neck over the head. If it is too tight, place two artery forceps on the cord and cut it between them. When the nose and mouth come out, wipe away the mucus with a sterile swab. By this point the whole head should be out.</p>
                            <p>The head will have restituted and rotated spontaneously to face the mother's left or right thigh. This shows you that the shoulders have descended and rotated to the anterior posterior diameter.</p>

                            <h4>Delivering the Shoulders and Body</h4>
                            <p>The following procedure should be followed when delivering the shoulders by lateral flexion of the body:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <p>This stage commences immediately after the birth of the baby. It includes the delivery of the placenta and membranes as well as the control of bleeding. At this stage the uterus contracts down to follow the body of the foetus as it is being born. As the cavity of the uterus becomes smaller, the area of the placental site is diminished. The placenta is then cut off from the spongy layer of the decidua basalis. Further uterine contractions expel the placenta from the upper segment into the lower segment and through the vaginal vault. This process, whereby the placenta leaves the upper segment to the lower segment and through the vagina, is referred to as separation and descent.</p>

                            <h3>Mechanism of the Third Stage: Mechanical Factors</h3>
                            <p>During the third stage, the following mechanical factors come into play:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The uterus reduces in size 2.5cm below the umbilicus, or 15cm above the symphysis pubis after the expulsion of the foetus</span></li>

                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The placental site is reduced to half</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Since the placenta is inelastic, it does not contract, so it detaches from the shrinking uterine wall</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">The placenta is pushed further to the lower uterine segment by the weight of the retro-placental clot. This is the accumulated blood from the separated placenta</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">With the next contraction the placenta is pushed into the vagina and expelled</span></li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>You will know that the placenta has separated and has been expelled from the upper uterine segment into the lower segment or into the vagina when you have noted:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="list-marker"></span><span class="list-content">Elongation of the cord which does not recede on pressing at the symphysis pubis</span></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The placenta is expelled either with maternal side exposed, known as the Mathew-Duncan method or the foetal side exposed known as the Shultz Method.</p>

                            <h3>Control of Bleeding</h3>
                            <p>The following steps should be taken to ensure the control of bleeding:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">

                            <h3>Management of the Third Stage</h3>
                            <p>The third stage of labour can be managed either passively or actively.</p>

                            <h4>Passive or Natural Method</h4>
                            <p>The passive or natural method occurs naturally, that is without any interference. For example, in a normal delivery, if oxytocic drugs are not used, the uterus generally remains inactive for a few minutes after the delivery of the baby, after which regular contractions then begin again. Physiology of the third stage takes place, the placenta is expelled and bleeding is controlled.</p>

                            <h4>Active Management: Giving Oxytocic Drugs</h4>
                            <p>Oxytocin, ergometrine or syntometrine stimulate uterine contraction. Ergometrine 0.5mg given IM causes a uterine contraction to occur five to seven minutes after the injection. Given intravenously it acts within 45 seconds. Syntometrine is a mixture of oxytocin and ergometrine 0.5ml given IM acts within two to three minutes. Usually sytrometrine is given with the delivery of the anterior shoulder while ergometrine is given at the crowning of the head.</p>

                            <h4>Controlled Cord Traction</h4>
                            <p>The uterus must be firmly contracted before this method can be used. It is not necessary to wait for signs of placenta separation. Place the left hand above the symphysis pubis, push the uterus upwards and backwards with the right hand and pull the cord downwards and outwards. Apply traction steadily without jerking. When the placenta is visible at the vulva, direct the cord upwards. The placenta will follow the curve of the birth canal. Receive it with both hands and rotate the placenta. This will twist the membranes. You can then deliver the membranes with up side movements, which enable them to be drawn out without breaking.</p>

                            <h4>Maternal Effort</h4>
                            <p>This method is not commonly used. When the placenta has separated and descended, the palm is placed downwards on the mother's abdomen to provide a backup that the mother can push against. During a contraction, the mother should be asked to push down. The placenta will be pushed out of the vagina. This method is useful in the event of a macerated birth</p>

                            <h4>Fundal Pressure</h4>
                            <p>This method should be used in case of a macerated or pre-term baby as the strength of the cord is reduced. You should wait for the following signs of placental separation:</p>

                            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Make sure the bladder is empty. Instruct the mother to breathe through an open mouth slowly and quietly. When there is a contraction, grasp the uterus with your left hand fingers behind the uterus. Thumb in the anterior surface. Apply pressure to the pelvic inlet in downward and backward direction. Receive the placenta with both hands. If the membranes do not slip out, turn the placenta around and deliver the membranes slowly with an upward movement. Rub the uterus and expel the clots.</p>

                            <p>This is the period from the delivery of placenta and membranes to the end of the first hour postpartum. The uterus is firm at level of two fingers breadth above the umbilicus. Restoration of physiological stability is established. During this period myometrial contractions and retraction, accompanied by vessel thrombosis, operate effectively to control bleeding from the placenta site. Failure of this mechanism could result in excessive blood loss (postpartum haemorrhage (PPH)) that could be life threatening. The mother should be closely observed for haemorrhage, urine retention or hypotension. The mother and child relationship should be initiated and encouraged, as it has an effect to the subsequent quality of their relationship and bonding.</p>
                            
                            <p>The nurse or midwife should observe the mother for blood loss, monitor vital signs, reassure her and let the mother hold the baby.

                            <h3>Psychology of the Mother</h3>
                            <p>Have you talked to friends about how they felt during their puerperal period? You will be surprised! Some say that whenever the midwife asked them any questions, they felt irritated for no good reason. Others felt like crying when their partners were late to visit. Some felt like screaming when the baby cried and wanted to cover it with a pillow to suffocate the innocent precious baby!</p>
                            <p>During the puerperium the mother is subjected to emotional turmoil and you must be supportive and observant. She should be allowed to cuddle her baby and express her love as she wishes. This maternal instinct is at times delayed.</p>
                            <p>The midwife should be kind, patient, and compassionate towards the mother and give her the necessary education concerning her and the baby. Each mother should be taken as an individual based on her maternal experience, educational background, maturity and parity. Mothers should be given all the information necessary to ensure they know how to care for their babies.</p>
                            <p>Rooming is the term given when a hospital plans for the mother to stay with the baby for most of the 24 hours in a day. It is highly recommended because it has been seen to have great psychological advantages for both mother and baby. Bonding commences immediately and demand breast-feeding can be successfully practised. Most baby-friendly hospitals in this country encourage rooming in.</p>

                            <h4>Postpartum Tears or Fourth Day Blues</h4>
                            <p>This condition is characterised by mild depression and mood swings due to a temporary endocrine hormonal imbalance following childbirth. It occurs in fifty percent of post-natal mothers on around the fourth day. A midwife should try to prevent the 'blues' by educating the mother during the pre-natal period on how to take care of herself and the baby to build up her confidence. Involve the partner in these teachings so that the partner can give moral support. Teach the mother how to check for minor discomfort and the relevant remedies to reduce the feeling of anxiety that the baby is ill whenever they cry.</p>

                            <h3>General Involution</h3>
                            <p>It is a time of great physiological change, accompanied by some anatomical and psychological changes as well. This is a time of change in the body in general with the exception of the breasts. The breasts continue to develop so as to establish and maintain lactation.</p>
                            <p>Every system in the body is affected during this process, including the heart and circulatory system. With the cessation of the utero-placental circulation, the work done by the heart decreases. The quantity of blood required also gradually returns to normal. The renal and musculo-skeletal systems also return to normal.</p>

                            <h3>Involution of the Uterus</h3>
                            <p>The size of the pregnant uterus is <span class="math-inline">\(30 \times 22 \times 20\mathrm{cm}\)</span> and it weighs 100gms at the end of labour. It is <span class="math-inline">\(15 \times 11 \times 7.5\mathrm{cm}\)</span> by the end of puerperium. Involution takes place, by which point it measures <span class="math-inline">\(7.5 \times 5 \times 2.5\mathrm{cm}\)</span> and weighs 60gms. Involution is the return of the uterus to its normal size, position and tone and is brought about by autolysis and ischaemia.</p>
                            <p><strong>Autolysis</strong> is a process by which muscle fibres are digested by the proteolytic hormone. The muscle fibres have to dissolve a large amount of their protein in order to achieve this reduction in size. This means that a great deal of nitrogen is excreted by the body in the urine together with the excess fluid retained during pregnancy. This is why a lot of urine containing large amounts of nitrogen is excreted during the first few days after delivery. In addition, the epithelial lining of the uterus, other cellular debris, and red blood cells are expelled as lochia from the uterus.</p>
                            <p><strong>Ischaemia</strong> is localised anaemia of the uterus, which occurs when the placenta is expelled. Blood vessels are constricted, which results in the reduction of the blood supply to the uterus. The phagocytes dispose of the redundant muscle fibre and elastic tissue. The vagina, ligaments of the uterus and muscle of the pelvis also return to their pre-gravida state. If not, prolapse of the uterus may occur later.</p>

                            <h3>Onset of Lactation</h3>
                            <p>Lowered oestrogen levels trigger the production of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland, which initiates lactation. The maintenance of lactation depends on putting the baby on the breast, but secretion of milk commences on the third to fourth day. The baby should be put on the breast immediately, which leads to oxytocin release and assists in keeping the uterus well-contracted. (You should revise the anatomy and physiology of the breast in unit one).</p>

                                    <p class="feature-text">Check the breasts and if she is not lactating, express colostrum. Increase expressing on the second day and milk should be established on the fourth day.</p>

                            <p>Advise the mother on how to feed the infant. When fixing the baby on the breast she should put the whole areola in the baby's mouth. She should initially breast feed the baby for three minutes to prevent cracked nipples and empty the breast in cases where the baby does not feed a lot. This is especially important in the first days to prevent engorgement.</p>
                            <p>Measure the fundal height and record the measurement daily. Assess whether the involution is taking place satisfactory. The fundal height should reduce by 0.5 - 1 centimetre daily. Check on lochia loss, noting the colour. This should change as per the schedule we noted earlier. If there is persistent red lochia, this points to the need for further investigation. Offensive lochia odour denotes infection.</p>
                            <p>You should also check the perineum to see if there was episiotomy and note its state. Advise the mother to wash the episiotomy at least four times a day with salt water and change the pad as soon as it is soiled and after she goes to the toilet.</p>
                            <p>Check on the calf muscles and exclude any pain that may indicate deep venous thrombosis. You should also exclude oedema and anaemia. Ensure that the mother gets enough sleep and rest. If she cannot sleep, she should be given a sedative.</p>
                            <p>Take note of any pain and administer analgesics. Ask the mother to report if lochia is heavy. Also encourage her to pass urine when her bladder is full. Encourage her to continuously check on the baby's cord and to report any bleeding, especially in the first 12 hours.</p>

                            <h3>Post Natal Examination</h3>
                            <p>This is carried out during the sixth post-partum week. You should inquire about the general health of the mother and baby. You should also do a haemoglobin estimate and if you find that it is low, embark on treatment.</p>
                            <p>You should inquire and note any gynaecological symptoms. Examine the mother's general condition, with specific emphasis on the breasts. Find out if the breasts are active. Examine the abdomen for tone of muscle and any masses. Also examine the vulva and vagina to ascertain the healing of the repaired episiotomy or tear. Pass a speculum (sims) to see the state of the cervix and if there is any discharge. Do a Pap smear at this stage. If possible, you should carry out a bimanual examination of the uterus to ascertain that the uterus has involuted to its normal size. Finally, remind the mother of the various family planning methods discussed and re-emphasise the importance of attending maternal and child health clinics.</p>
