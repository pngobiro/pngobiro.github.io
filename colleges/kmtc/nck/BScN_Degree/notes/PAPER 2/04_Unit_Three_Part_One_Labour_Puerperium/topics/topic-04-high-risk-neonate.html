                                In this subsection, you will begin looking at neonates at risk. You will then move on to neonates found in abnormal circumstances, for example, babies born before their due date and those who are abandoned.

                                Usually, maternal conditions may predispose a neonate to be at high risk of developing the disorders you are about to cover. The high risk groups of neonates require early diagnosis so that the disorders can either be prevented or appropriate measures instituted early enough.

                            <p>A high percentage of premature births occur with female births and pregnancies with multiple foetuses. This is most often due to the early over distension of the uterus, which leads to the foetus being born prematurely. Premature births also occur more frequently in low socio economic and illiterate groups in the population, largely as a result of the poor nutritional intake of the pregnant mother. Additionally, they tend to be more common when there is concurrent maternal metabolic or systemic disease, for example, hypertension and renal disease.</p>

                            <h3>Causes of Prematurity</h3>
                            <p>You should note that in many instances the cause of premature birth is not known. However, some of the causal factors are thought to be:</p>

                            </ul>

                            <p>Prematurity is also associated with:</p>

                            <p>One way to prevent premature births is to give early and continued prenatal care with stress on dietary and general hygienic education to the expectant mother. This will also ensure immediate treatment of those complications of pregnancy likely to cause, or be associated with, premature labour.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes it is also possible to postpone or inhibit uterine contractions in some cases of premature labour through the use of certain pharmaceutical agents such as:</p>

There is scanty hair on the head and the eyebrows are usually absent. The nipples and areola are inconspicuous. The nails are soft. Generalised oedema is apparent at birth and later the tissue fluid decreases, leaving the skin loose and wrinkled. Blood vessels can be easily seen under the skin because subcutaneous tissue is thin.</p>

Obstruction to the free flow of air causes marked sternal retraction, a rapid heart rate and respiratory noises. Occasionally, cardiac murmurs are heard. A change in position may cause periods of apnoea. Very small infants will not open the mouth to breathe. The nose should therefore be checked for occlusion frequently.</p>

                                        <p>You should assist in the establishment of respiration since the respiratory centre in the medulla is immature. The lungs tend to be atelectatic and are not well developed due to inadequate surfactant. The diaphragm and chest muscles are weak, therefore, the baby is constantly asphyxiated. This means that the airway should be repeatedly cleared. The infant should be laid with its head to one side and the foot of the cot should be slightly raised to aid with the drainage of mucus. You should also watch the infant closely for signs of respiratory distress and cyanosis.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Respiratory distress can be recognised by the rapid, irregular respiration with periods of apnoea, in-drawing of the chest walls and sternal recession and expiratory grunt with cyanosis of body and face.</p>
                                        <p>Give oxygen in such cases (avoid high concentrations of oxygen) to the premature infant. The recommended dosage is 30 - 40%. Note that prolonged administration of a high concentration of oxygen may lead to the development of fibrous tissue behind the lens, which results in a condition known as retrolental fibroplasia leading to blindness in the newborn.</p>

                                        <p>The midwife should do her best to ensure that the baby's temperature is prevented from reaching very low levels. Remember that the heat regulation centre in premature babies is underdeveloped. Small babies weighing less than 1.5 kilograms should ideally be nursed in an incubator with temperature of about 30 degrees Celsius and relative humidity of 65%. If there is no incubator available, they should be nursed in warm towels (which may be warmed with hot water bottles). You can also make an improvised cot out of a wooden box raised off the floor where there are no cots.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Use of cotton wool as a means of keeping infant warm has been condemned, since it deprives the skin of air and there is danger of infection and overheating of infant.</p>
                                        <p>Loose flannel clothing is recommended for infants nursed in cots (woollen material may cause a skin rash and is also cumbersome). The infant should not be exposed to direct sunlight. If the premature infant can maintain its body temperature at 36 degrees Celsius, its condition is likely to improve and it may be weaned off the incubator.</p>

                                        <p>Breast milk is ideal because of its digestibility, nutrients and the immunity it gives to the newborn. The practice of withholding feeds or fluid for 24 hours or more before feeding is considered unnecessary.</p>
                                        <p>If the stomach content is aspirated before the first feed, regurgitation and inhalation of stomach contents are not likely. The first feed should be small and ideally given per tube. Five percent glucose water may be given, which has the advantage of counteracting acidosis and provides fluid and energy.</p>
                                        <p>If the infant can tolerate it expressed breast milk should be offered next. The amount of feeds given depends on the size of the infant and its tolerance levels. However, 10mls is usually offered for the first few feeds. Infection control and prevention measures are highly recommended with regard to handling expressed milk.</p>
                                        <p>Artificial milk, that is half strength cow's milk, lactogen and so on, may be resorted to only if the mother is in poor condition. The recommended amount is 90mls of milk per kilogram of body weight per day for the first week of life. This is followed by 150mls for the second week and 180 - 210mls per kilogram of body weight during the third week. To avoid over distension of the stomach, vomiting and subsequent inhalation, small feeds, of greater concentration, are given at one to two hourly intervals.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Try always to treat each infant individually and give the amount of milk the individual infant needs, depending on their appetite, tolerance to feeds and general condition.</p>
                                        
                                        <h5>Method of feeding</h5>
                                        <p>The method of feeding is determined by the infant's size, general health and presence of sucking and swallowing reflexes.</p>
                                        <p>Breast feed as soon as the infant's condition allows. Infants of 1.8 kilograms and over, with good sucking and swallowing reflexes, may be spoon fed. In cases where neither of the aforementioned options is possible, naso-gastric tube feeding is preferred because once instituted it can be left for a week before it is changed and carries less risk of bronchial aspiration. The latter is often associated with oro-gastric feeding, especially if the tube is not well pinched when being withdrawn.</p>
