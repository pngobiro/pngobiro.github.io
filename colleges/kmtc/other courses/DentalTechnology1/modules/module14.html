                    <p>For a dental unit to fully utilise its equipment and instruments in providing the expected quality dental care, a number of service supplies are necessary. These are:</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Water</li>

                <h2>8.1 Water Supply</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><b>8.1 Water Supply</b></p>
                    <p>The main requirements for water supply to the dental unit are quality and pressure. The water must be clean and fit for human consumption. It must also be at a pressure equal to, or above that required at the inlet to the connection box. This pressure varies depending on the make of the unit, and it is therefore important to confirm the actual pressure requirements for your unit from its installation manual. (Recommended water pressure for Sirona 5 for instance is 2.5 bar minimum to 4 bar maximum).</p>
                    <p>This water performs tasks such as :</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cooling at the teeth during heat generating procedures (e.g. grinding)</li>
                        <li>Washing away loose particles from the treatment area thus enabling the dentist to have a clear view of the treatment area</li>
                        <li>Flushing the cuspidor bowl (spitum)</li>
                        <li>Filling of the tumbler for the patient's use to rinse the mouth</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>8.2 Compressed Air</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><b>8.2 Compressed Air</b></p>
                    <p>The requirements for compressed air are Pressure, Quality and Flowrate. Adequate pressure is required for the air to perform its task of providing the driving force needed for the turbines to run at their designed speeds. Pressure depends on choice of compressor and pipe installation workmanship.</p>
                    <p>Other tasks for the air include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Action as air-cushion bearing for some turbine motors</li>
                        <li>Combining with water to effect a misty spray for cleaning of the treatment area</li>
                        <li>Operating the pneumatic controls and instruments which may be part of the dental equipment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Like water supply, the pressure for compressed air also varies from unit to unit and it is therefore recommended that during installation or service, the relevant equipment manual should be checked for correct pressure. (Pressure for Sirona 5 for instance, is 5.5 bar minimum to 7 bar maximum).</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Quality and Flowrate of Compressed Air</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Quality requires that the air should be free from any contaminants such as oil. Quality of compressed air will depend on type of compressor and installation technics.</p>
                    <p>Flowrate is the quantity of air flowing per given time. This ensures that there is enough volume of air to perform the necessary tasks. Flowrate depends on size of compressor and pipework installation technics.</p>
                    <p>It is the function of the compressor to take a definite quantity of air from the atmosphere through a filter, and deliver this air to the dental equipment at the required pressure and volume.</p>
                    <p>The compressors most commonly used are the reciprocating type. Some of them are designed for oil-free operation and must therefore not be filled with lubricating oil. Others use lubricating oil but are constructed in such a way that the air output is clean and free of oil carry-over.</p>
                    <p>These compressors are usually air cooled and require adequate ventilation.</p>
                    <p>Atmospheric air contains moisture. At higher pressures this moisture tends to separate from the air as condensate. A drain cock is therefore installed on the air receiver which should be drained at least once a week. Failure to do so will result in contaminated air at the point of use.</p>
                    <p>A pressure switch is usually incorporated to switch the compressor motor and maintain air pressure within adjusted limits.</p>

                <h2>8.3 Electrical supply</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><b>8.3 Electrical supply</b></p>
                    <p>Dental equipment also require an electrical supply to perform the following tasks:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Run various motors for chair positioning</li>
                        <li>Run air compressor motors</li>
                        <li>Run suction machine motors</li>
                        <li>Operate the dentist's unit and run various handpieces and instruments</li>
                        <li>Supply the dental light</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The electrical supply must then be able to meet the demand of the particular unit in terms of voltage and power rating. While most of the equipment in a dental unit may be run on single phase supply, some suction pumps (depending on the capacity) require that their driving motors be supplied by a three-phase 5-wire supply.</p>
