                <h2>Early Stages of Tooth Development</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Tooth development begins at the 6th week of intra-uterine life. An epithelial thickening appears in the primitive stomodium along the outline of the future dental arches and this is known as the dental lamina. The dental lamina is concerned with the initiation of entire deciduous dentition and their succeeding permanent dentition in chronological order.</p>
                    <p>At certain points on the dental lamina tissue proliferation continues leading to the formation of tooth buds. Ectodermal cell proliferation in these tooth buds lead to the formation of the enamel organ which gives rise to enamel of the future tooth. At the same time the mesenchymal cells inner to the enamel organ proliferate to give rise to the dental papilla which eventually forms the dental pulp and the dentine, and the mesenchymal cells around the dental papilla develop in to dental sac from which derives the cementum and the periodontal ligament. Thus, the enamel organ, the dental papilla and the dental sac together form the tooth bud which finally forms the tooth.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The deciduous dentition has twenty teeth, each quadrant of the jaw having five teeth in the order (from midline backwards):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Central incisor</li>

                        <li>Second molar</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The deciduous teeth start appearing in the mouth approximately from the sixth month after birth and the full compliment of the dentition in the oral cavity is achieved by about the age of 2¬Ω to 3 years. The shedding of the milk teeth start at about the 6th year and by about 13th year all the milk teeth are replaced by the permanent teeth. (See the chart on page 7 for details).</p>

                <h2>Permanent Dentition</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The permanent dentition comprises of thirty two teeth, each quadrant of the jaw having eight teeth. From the midline backwards the order of the permanent teeth in each quadrant is as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Central incisor,</li>
                        <li>Lateral incisor,</li>
                        <li>Canine,</li>
                        <li>First premolar,</li>
                        <li>Second premolar,</li>
                        <li>First molar,</li>
                        <li>Second molar, and</li>
                        <li>Third molar, (also known as the wisdom tooth).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Occasionally an individual may have one or more number of teeth than the normal number as mentioned earlier. These extra teeth are referred to as 'supernumerary teeth'.</p>
                    <p>Some times one or more than one tooth fail to develop, a condition known as 'partial anodontia'. Very rarely, due to developmental defects, no tooth will be formed at all and this condition is called 'total anodontia'.</p>
                    <p>The permanent teeth start replacing the milk teeth from the age of approximately 6 years. (See chart on page 7 for the chronology of tooth formation and eruption). By the age of about 13 all the deciduous teeth are replaced by the permanent teeth, and all the permanent teeth will be present in the mouth by the age of about twenty years.</p>
                    <p>The third molar often fails to appear in the mouth although it develops in the jaw, due to reduction in the size of the dental arch. Such a tooth is referred to as an 'impacted tooth'.</p>
                    <p>The differences between the permanent teeth and the deciduous teeth are given in page 9.</p>
