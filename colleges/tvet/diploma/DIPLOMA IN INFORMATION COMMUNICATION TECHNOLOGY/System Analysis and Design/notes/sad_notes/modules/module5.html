          <p>Its an important activity which like training and testing is a continuous process. It involves measuring or assessment of system development stage and the final produced system.  It may be carried out from the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> month after change-over.  The development team member, the users, or auditors, the management representative and those affected by the system may take part in the exercise.  This is to ensure that specified objectives are met and are justifiable in terms of cost, benefits and other performance.</p>
             <p><strong>The review focuses on the following areas:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Comparison on the actual system part performance against the anticipated performance objectives.  This involves assessment of system running cost, benefits etc as they compare with the estimated or anticipated.</li>

          <p>Research findings reveal that much of evaluation is performed and manager by members of development team.  They determined evaluation criteria and the methodology to be used.  Evaluation of a system should be carried out after completion of every stage of SDLC.  There are 3 types of evaluations.</p>
         <p><strong>Formative evaluation (Feedback)</strong></p>
          <p>It produces information that is feedback into the development cycle improve products under development.  It serves the needs of those who are involved into the development process.</p>
          <p><strong>Summative evaluation</strong> ‚Äì It‚Äôs done after system development project is completed.  It provides information about efficiency of the product to these decision makers adopt it.<strong> </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Documentation (post implementation evaluation </strong>is performed just before and after Hardware and Software installation and also after system change-over. It‚Äôs carried out to assess general functionality of a system after settling down.</p>
                <p><strong>Benefits of post-implementation ‚Äì evaluation</strong></p>
          <ul>
                <li>It improves system development practices, decisions to adopt, modify or discard an information system.</li>
                <li>Ensures compliance with user objectives.</li>
                 <li>It enhances evaluation and training of personnel responsible for a system development.</li>
            <li>It improves effectiveness and productivity of subsequent system design.</li>

               <p><strong>Aspects to be evaluated:</strong></p>
               <ol>
                <li>Systems output accuracy i.e information produced by the system.</li>
                <li>User satisfaction with information system.</li>

           <p><strong>Reasons why post implementation evaluation is carried out.</strong></p>
          <ul>
             <li>To verify that the installed system meets user requirements.</li>
               <li>To provide a feedback to the development personnel.</li>
               <li>To justify adoption, continuation or termination of installed system.</li>
            <li>To clarify and set priorities for any needed modification on the system.</li>
              <li>To transfer responsibility of the system from the development team to the users.</li>
            </ul>
               <p><strong>N: B System</strong> post implementation review team writes a report that indicates specific areas within the system that needs improvement.  This report is called <u>Post implementation review report.</u></p>

            <p>It involves changing part of the system according to the recommendation of the post implementation review team.</p>
               <p><strong>Causes of system maintenance:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Defects in the system after its delivery.  This involves any errors or bugs in the newly implemented system e.g Use of formula within a system.</li>
            <li>Environment change ‚Äì e.g A government tax policy change which influence a change of payroll system.</li>
              <li>A change in user requirements.  A business organization exists in a changing environment, therefore the user requirements change e.g A payslip in a payroll system may initially be required to show the employees corporate share amount.  Employees may feel that such
information should not appear in the payslip and thus influence a change in the system.</li>
          </ul>
                <p><strong>Poor documentation of the system:</strong></p>
             <p>It makes it difficult for one to understand the system, and also over to change it should there be a need to do so.</p>
            <p>A system may be changed and its documentation re-written in order to improve its maintainability.</p>
        <p>Basically system maintenance is carried to improve the system adaptability and flexibility.</p>
        <p>Flexibility involves minor changes in a system in order to benefit the user from advances in both software and hardware technology. The process of the system maintenance should be controlled by the system analyst.  When a manager or a user suggests a change to the system regardless of the reasons, the analyst should prepare diagrams and estimates the impact.</p>
        <p>The change control board decides whether or not to implement the change.  If change should take place, the analyst modifies all the documentation‚Äôs by merging the diagram and estimated into the existing problem and designs the specification.  The programmers and testing teams are responsible for incorporating any change into the programs.  They test the system to ensure that no errors or problems are introduced as a result of change.  Once the change is satisfied as default free, the revised system is adopted immediately.</p>

            <p><strong>Corrective maintenance</strong></p>
          <p>Its usually a change effected in a system response to detect problem or error. It‚Äôs objective is to ensure that the system remains functional.  It basically involves removal of errors on the already newly developed system.</p>
          <p>Example could be a failure in parts of the system.</p>
          <p><strong>Perfective maintenance</strong></p>
          <p>It‚Äôs a change to perfect a system i.e improve it‚Äôs performance in terms of response times to user request or to amend a system interface to make a system more user friendly.</p>
          <p><strong>Adaptive maintenance</strong></p>
          <p>Involves changing a system to take an account of a change in its functional environment.</p>
           <p><strong>Preventive maintenance</strong></p>
            <p> Carried out on a system to ensure that it can withstand stress. It helps in ensuring data and software integrity.</p>
            
                 <p><strong>Replacive maintenance</strong></p>
          <p>It carried out on s system when a system becomes almost unmaintainable e.g due to lack of documentation, poor design or age.</p>

              <p>An information development is in itself a project which takes up resources and time to develop.  It is a fail if does not perform as it‚Äôs expected or if it is not compiled altogether.</p>
        <p>If the number of errors or the frequency of errors is high, it can also be said to be failure.</p>
       <p>Information system development is successful if it achieves the goals set in terms of business goals, operation, performance goals etc.  It should fit in the structure of the organization for which it was developed.  It should be flexible to allow change in order to meet the changing business conditions.  It should be accurate, secure and reliable.  It should be then calculated in order to support its maintainability.  It is very expensive for system to fail.  One way of limiting the expenses associated with system failure is to take am account of the system at the design stage, and at the documentation stage.  Documentation of a system is a continuous activity right from the analysis up to post implementation stage.</p>

          </h2>
            <div class="content-block">  
            <p>It‚Äôs difficult to single out one explanation for system development success or failure.  However, the following factors can largely determine systems development and implementation outcome.</p>
                <p>(i)         User involvement in the development and implementation of information system.  If users are highly involved in the system development project may be successful since users are likely to react positively.</p>
                <p>Failure to involve them may lead to project failure.</p>
               <p>(ii)        The user/the designer communication<strong>:</strong> If the user and designer have different interests, and priorities there would be communication gap between the two.  Those will lead to comprise on the organization layout which will lead to the system failure.  If the gap is reduced or eliminated, both parties would work towards achievement of organizational objectives thus may lead to success of information development project.</p>
                <p>(iii)       Management support and commitment<strong>: </strong>If the management is supporting and committed to the system development project, the project may be successful since the development team and the users are likely to perceive the development project positively.</p>
           <p>(iv)       Management support also ensures that the project receives sufficient funding and resources. Lack of management support leads to the project failure since the development team may not perceive sufficient resources and fundings which is determined by organization</p>
        <p>management.</p>
        <p>(v)        The level of complexity and the list of project implementation activities.  There are 4 key dimensions that the level of project lists i.e</p>
                <p><strong>(a)       T</strong>he project size<strong>: ‚Äì </strong>The larger the project, the greater the risks and the higher the chance of failing.</p>
        <p><strong>(b)</strong>       <strong>P</strong>roject structure: ‚Äì Well structured project has its requirements clearly define.  They are straight forward and they have least risk of failure.</p>
        <p><strong>(c)       </strong>The project experience in technology.  A project handled by a team without technology expertise and experience has a high risk if failing.</p>
        <p><strong>(d)       Q</strong>uality of management for project implementation.  The management of system development and implementation must be people with high inter personal skills. The conflicts and uncertainties in any implementation will be magnified if the project is poorly managed.</p>
        <p><em>Improper management of system development project will:-</em></p>
                 <ul>
          <li>Exceed budget.</li>
          <li>Delay to complete.</li>
          <li>Leads to technical shortfalls, resulting in performance that is significantly low than estimated level.</li>
        </ul>
                  
                <p>(iv)       Failure to obtain the anticipated benefits.</p>
        <p>(v)        Unrealistic deadline, poor planning, lack of control, changing user requirement, poor time
        tabling and resources.</p>
