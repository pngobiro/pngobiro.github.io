               <p>Managers may wish to know the effect of uncertainty on an investments appraisal.  The following are ways in which risks can be taken into account when making a capital investment decision i.e</p>
            <ol>
                 <li>i) Set a short pay back period. If the risk is deemed to increase with the length of time then a short pay back period tends to reduce the risks.</li>
                 <li>Use a higher discount rate ‚Äì This is called adding a risk premium. If its considered to be fairly risky to undertake a project, then say 2% could be added to the basic cost of capital.  If its considered to be very risky to undertake a project then 5% could be added.</li>
                 <li>Undertake sensitivity analysis ‚Äì This involves asking a series of <strong>‚Äú</strong>what if‚Äù questions and reevaluating the projects with assumptions e.g A manager might ask <strong>‚Äú</strong>what if‚Äù the sales are 5% lower than that expected.
