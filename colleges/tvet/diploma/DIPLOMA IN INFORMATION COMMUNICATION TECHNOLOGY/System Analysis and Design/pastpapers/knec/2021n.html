                            *Note: The logic seems slightly ambiguous in the prompt ("If vacancy is available and fee is paid... else a message to pay... Otherwise, a regret letter"). The tree above interprets "Otherwise" as applying if the fee is paid but there's no vacancy.* A clearer interpretation might be needed based on exact rules.

                                <li>Complexity Management: For large systems, ERDs can become very complex and difficult to read or maintain, requiring careful layout and potentially breaking down into smaller diagrams.</li>
                                <li>Accurate Representation: Ensuring the relationships and cardinalities accurately reflect the real-world business rules can be challenging and requires thorough analysis.</li>
