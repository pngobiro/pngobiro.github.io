                        <p>(c) Crest Hotel Ltd. intends to use a self-service system to allow its customers to order from their menu that consist of food, beverages and drinks. The order details are then stored on a pending order file which is then assigned to one of the hotel chefs for processing; the chef details are stored on the chef file. The chef is required to verify the order based on the details in the inventory file. When the food is ready the chef updates both the waiter and pending files. The waiter then serves the customer with the order and receives a payment which is forwarded to the cashier who then issues the customer with a receipt and updates the waiter and order files respectively.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a)(i) Reasons for Using Data Dictionary:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Standardization: Provides consistent definitions and formats for all data elements across the system.</li><li>Communication: Acts as a central reference for developers, analysts, and users regarding data meanings and structures.</li><li>Impact Analysis: Helps identify where data elements are used, making it easier to assess the impact of changes.</li><li>Documentation: Serves as crucial documentation for system understanding and maintenance.</li></ul>
                            <p><strong>(a)(ii) Limitations of Structured Analysis:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Difficulty with Changing Requirements: Can be rigid and less adaptable to frequent requirement changes compared to agile methods.</li><li>Process-Oriented Focus: May sometimes neglect the data aspect or complex data relationships compared to data-centric approaches.</li><li>Potential for Communication Gaps: Heavy reliance on formal diagrams (DFDs, ERDs) might lead to misunderstandings if not well-explained or if stakeholders are not familiar with them.</li></ul>
                            <p><strong>(b) Disadvantages of Observation Method:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Hawthorne Effect: People may behave differently when they know they are being observed.</li><li>Observer Bias: The observer's interpretation of events might be subjective.</li><li>Time-Consuming: Can require significant time to observe processes thoroughly.</li><li>Limited Scope: May only capture routine activities and miss exceptions or infrequent events.</li><li>Interpretation Challenges: Observed actions might not fully reveal the underlying reasons or decision processes.</li></ul>
