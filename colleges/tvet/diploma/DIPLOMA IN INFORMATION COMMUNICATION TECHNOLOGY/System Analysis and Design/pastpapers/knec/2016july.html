The clerical officer then keys in, verifies and then stores farmer’s details in verified details files. The verified farmers are issued with registration numbers and passwords that are then stored in credentials file. During the milk delivery, farmers provide the registration number to the clerical attendant to enable the system retrieves his/her files. After weighing the milk, the farmer file is updated by clerical officer and a transaction receipt issued to that farmer, transaction receipt details are then stored in transaction file. At the end of the month, the accountant of the Sacco is required to process farmer's payment by subtracting stores credit from the farmer’s income. The accountant is then required to debit farmers bank account with the net balance and then update all records for that month.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) System Design Terms:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li><strong>(i) Modularity:</strong> Designing a system as a collection of independent, interchangeable components (modules), each responsible for a specific function. Promotes reusability and maintainability.</li><li><strong>(ii) Cohesion:</strong> The degree to which the elements within a single module belong together and focus on a single task. High cohesion is desirable (module does one thing well).</li></ul>

                            <p><strong>(c)(i) Selection Bias (Feasibility Study):</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Occurs when the sample or data chosen for the study is not representative of the overall situation, leading to skewed or inaccurate conclusions about feasibility.</li></ul>
                            <p><strong>(c)(ii) Closed-Loop System:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>A system that uses feedback from its own output to control or modify its actions, aiming to maintain a desired state.</li></ul>
