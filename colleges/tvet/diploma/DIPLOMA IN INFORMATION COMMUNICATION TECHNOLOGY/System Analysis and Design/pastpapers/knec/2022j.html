                            <p>Description: The Waterfall model is a sequential development process where each phase must be fully completed before the next begins. Progress flows steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. There is typically limited overlap or iteration between phases.</p>

                                <li>Relational Model: Organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns. Relationships are maintained through primary and foreign keys. Standard model used by most modern databases (SQL).</li>
                                <li>Object-Oriented Model: Stores data as objects, similar to object-oriented programming. Objects encapsulate data and behavior (methods). Can handle complex data types well.</li>
                                <li>Hierarchical Model: Organizes data in a tree structure with parent-child relationships (one-to-many). Older model, less flexible.</li>
                                <li>Network Model: Similar to hierarchical but allows more complex relationships (many-to-many) through pointers. Also an older, less common model today.</li>
