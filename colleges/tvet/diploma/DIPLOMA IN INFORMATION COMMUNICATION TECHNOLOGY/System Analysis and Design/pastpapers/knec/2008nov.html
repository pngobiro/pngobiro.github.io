                                <li>Application: One module directly modifies or relies on the internal data or implementation details of another module. (e.g., Module X directly changing a variable inside Module Y).</li>
                                <li>Disadvantage: Very high dependency; changes in one module almost always require changes in the other, making maintenance extremely difficult and violating encapsulation. (Worst type of coupling).</li>

                                <li>Application: One module passes control information (e.g., a flag or code) to another module, influencing its execution path. (e.g., Module X passes a 'PrintMode' flag to Module Y).</li>
                                <li>Disadvantage: The calling module needs to know about the internal logic of the called module, reducing independence and making modules less reusable in different contexts.</li>

                            <p><strong>(a) System Testing Guidelines:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Plan testing early in the lifecycle.</li>
                                <li>Testing should aim to find errors, not prove correctness.</li>
                                <li>Use both valid and invalid test data.</li>
                                <li>Test boundary conditions.</li>
                                <li>Document test cases and results thoroughly.</li>
                                <li>Independent testing is often more effective.</li>
                            </ol>
                             *(Note: Only four were required, marks seem low)*

                            <p><strong>(b) Types of Test Data:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Valid (Normal) Data: Input that falls within the expected range and format.
                                    <ul><li>Reason: To verify that the system processes correct inputs as expected according to requirements.</li></ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Invalid (Erroneous) Data: Input that falls outside the expected range or format (e.g., negative numbers where positive expected, text in a numeric field).
                                    <ul><li>Reason: To verify that the system handles errors gracefully, provides appropriate messages, and does not crash.</li></ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Boundary Data: Input at the edges of valid ranges (e.g., minimum/maximum allowed values).
                                    <ul><li>Reason: Errors often occur at boundaries, so testing these specifically increases confidence.</li></ul>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                             *(Note: Only two types with reasons were required)*

                            <p><strong>(c) Object Structure in System Modeling:</strong></p>
                            <p>Object structure modeling focuses on the static aspects of a system, showing the classes, their attributes, operations, and the relationships between them. Key diagrams include:</p>
                            <p><strong>1. Class Diagram:</strong> Shows the blueprint for objects.</p>
                            <pre>
    +-----------------+          +-----------------+
    |   ClassA        |          |    ClassB       |
    +-----------------+          +-----------------+
    | - attribute1    |───(Rel)──| - attributeX    |  (Rel = Relationship e.g., Association)
    | - attribute2    |          |                 |
    +-----------------+          +-----------------+
    | + operation1()  |          | + operationY()  |
    | + operation2()  |          |                 |
    +-----------------+          +-----------------+
                            </pre>
                            <p><strong>2. Object Diagram:</strong> Shows instances of classes and their links at a specific point in time.</p>
                            <pre>
    +-----------------+          +-----------------+
    | objectA : ClassA|          | objectB : ClassB|
    +-----------------+          +-----------------+
    | attribute1 = val|----------| attributeX = val|  (Link = Instance of Relationship)
    | attribute2 = val|          |                 |
    +-----------------+          +-----------------+
                            </pre>
                            <p>Description: These diagrams illustrate the 'things' (classes/objects) in the system, what they know (attributes), what they can do (operations), and how they are connected (relationships/links).</p>
