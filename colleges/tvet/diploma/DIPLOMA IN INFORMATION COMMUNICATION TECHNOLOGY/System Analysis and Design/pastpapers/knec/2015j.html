                            <ul><li>The conceptual line or interface that separates a system from its environment. It defines what is considered part of the system and what is external to it.</li></ul>
                            <p><strong>(b) Spiral Model Stages (Diagram Description):</strong></p>
                            <p>A spiral model diagram typically shows four quadrants representing key activities performed in each iteration (cycle) of the spiral:</p>
                            <ol><li><strong>Determine Objectives, Alternatives, Constraints:</strong> Planning phase, understanding requirements for this cycle.</li><li><strong>Evaluate Alternatives, Identify and Resolve Risks:</strong> Risk analysis and prototyping to mitigate identified risks.</li><li><strong>Develop, Verify Next-Level Product:</strong> Engineering phase - detailed design, coding, testing of the current iteration's product.</li><li><strong>Plan Next Phases:</strong> Evaluating the results of the current iteration and planning the next cycle.</li></ol>
                            <p><em>(A visual diagram would show these quadrants arranged in a spiral expanding outwards, indicating iterative progression and increasing completeness.)</em></p>
                            <p><strong>(c) Advantages of Use Case Diagrams:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Captures Functional Requirements: Clearly shows the interactions between users (actors) and the system to achieve specific goals.</li><li>Easy to Understand: Provides a high-level view easily understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.</li><li>Defines System Scope: Helps define the boundaries of the system by showing what actors interact with it and for what purpose.</li><li>Basis for Testing: Use cases can be used to derive test scenarios.</li></ul>
                            <p><strong>(d) Benefits of Functional Decomposition:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Manages Complexity: Breaks down a large, complex system into smaller, more manageable functional units (sub-systems or modules).</li><li>Clear Structure: Provides a hierarchical view of the system's functions, showing how they relate to each other.</li><li>Facilitates Allocation: Makes it easier to assign development tasks for specific functions to different team members.</li><li>Improved Understanding: Helps analysts and developers understand the different parts of the system and their specific roles.</li></ul>

Prospective students are required to fill their details in the college website which are vetted and stored in the prospectus file. The applicants that meet requirements are notified through the email provided in their registration form; their details are stored in waiting list file whereas rejected applicants details are stored on the applicant log file for future recommendation. Once the shortlisted applicant receives notification email they are required to attend entry interview in the college and are required to produce their original academic certificates and testimonies. Before the interview, the applicant’s sign-in attendance list and their certificates are also scrutinized to verify their authenticity; the details of attendance and authenticity of the certificate are then stored in the attendance and certificates authenticity files respectively. Successful applicants are assigned admission number and notified through email to pay fees. Details of successful applicant who are yet to pay fee are stored in enroll file for a period of one month. Similarly, applicants that pay their fee in time are assigned class and their details stored in student file and payment file respectively.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Factors Necessitating System Review:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Performance Degradation: System response time or throughput falls below acceptable levels.</li><li>Changes in Business Needs: The system no longer fully supports current or new business processes.</li><li>Technological Obsolescence: Hardware or software becomes outdated, unsupported, or inefficient.</li><li>User Dissatisfaction: Users report significant problems with usability, functionality, or reliability.</li><li>Post-Implementation Evaluation: Scheduled review after deployment to assess if objectives were met.</li></ul>

                            <p><strong>(a)(i) Challenges in Developing User Manual:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Keeping it Updated: Ensuring the manual accurately reflects the current state of the system as it evolves.</li><li>Target Audience Variation: Writing content that is clear and useful for users with different levels of technical expertise.</li><li>Completeness vs Conciseness: Balancing the need to cover all features with keeping the manual easy to navigate and not overwhelming.</li><li>Technical Writer Skill: Requires good writing, organizational, and technical understanding skills.</li></ul>
                            <p><strong>(a)(ii) Coupling:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>The degree of interdependence between different software modules. Low coupling (modules are independent) is desirable, as it makes the system easier to understand, modify, and maintain without causing ripple effects. High coupling means changes in one module are likely to require changes in others.</li></ul>
                            <p><strong>(b)(i) Type of Maintenance:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Preventive Maintenance. Justification: This involves performing routine checks and updates to prevent potential problems *before* they occur or are reported, aiming to enhance reliability and longevity.</li></ul>
                            <p><strong>(b)(ii) Advantages of Preventive Maintenance:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Increased System Reliability: Reduces the likelihood of unexpected failures and downtime.</li><li>Extended System Lifespan: Helps keep the system running efficiently for longer.</li><li>Reduced Emergency Costs: Prevents costly emergency repairs by addressing potential issues proactively.</li><li>Improved Performance: Can include optimizations that keep the system running smoothly.</li></ul>
