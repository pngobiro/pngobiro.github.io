                        <p>(d) County Coffee Society Ltd. intends to develop a system to automate its operations. When a farmer delivers the coffee harvest to designated coffee milling station, the farmerâ€™s details are retrieved from farmers file for verification purposes. The farmer then proceeds to put his/her coffee bags on the weighing machine. The attendant then updates the farmerâ€™s delivery file and copy receipt is issued to farmer. The farmer may then proceed to the store to take farm inputs and foods. At the store, the attendant updates the borrowers file and generates an invoice. At the end month, the accountant of the milling station is required to process farmerâ€™s payment and record on the farmerâ€™s debit file transmit the money to the farmerâ€™s bank account.</p>

                            <p><strong>(c) Limitations of Black-Box Testing:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Limited Code Coverage: Cannot guarantee all code paths are tested as internal structure is unknown.</li><li>Inefficient Test Case Design: May lead to redundant test cases or missing critical scenarios without knowledge of internal logic.</li><li>Difficult to Isolate Faults: When a test fails, it's harder to pinpoint the exact location of the defect in the code.</li><li>Cannot Detect Certain Error Types: May miss internal logic errors or inefficiencies that don't manifest as incorrect output for the chosen inputs.</li></ul>

                            <ul><li><strong>(i) Iterative Model:</strong> Develops the system in repeated cycles (iterations). Each iteration builds upon the previous one, adding more functionality until the full system is complete. Allows for feedback and refinement during the process.</li><li><strong>(ii) Spiral Model:</strong> An iterative, risk-driven model. Each cycle (spiral) involves planning, risk analysis, engineering (development/testing), and evaluation. Suitable for large, complex, high-risk projects.</li></ul>

                            <ul><li>Define Clear Objectives: Know exactly what information you need to gather.</li><li>Keep it Concise: Ask only necessary questions; avoid excessive length.</li><li>Use Clear and Unambiguous Language: Avoid jargon, acronyms, or leading questions.</li><li>Logical Flow: Group related questions together and order them logically.</li><li>Use Appropriate Question Types: Mix closed and open questions effectively based on the data needed.</li><li>Pilot Test: Test the questionnaire on a small group before wider distribution to identify confusing questions or issues.</li><li>Ensure Anonymity/Confidentiality (if applicable): Reassure respondents their answers will be handled appropriately.</li></ul>

                            <p><strong>(a) System Design Terms:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li><strong>(i) Modularity:</strong> Designing a system as a collection of independent, interchangeable components (modules), each responsible for a specific function. Promotes reusability and maintainability.</li><li><strong>(ii) Cohesion:</strong> The degree to which the elements within a single module belong together and focus on a single task. High cohesion is desirable (module does one thing well).</li></ul>
                            <p><strong>(b) Characteristics of an Information System:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Components: Composed of hardware, software, data, people, processes.</li><li>Purpose: Designed to achieve specific organizational objectives.</li><li>Input, Processing, Output: Takes input data, processes it, and produces output information.</li><li>Feedback: Often includes feedback mechanisms for control and improvement.</li><li>Boundary & Environment: Has defined boundaries separating it from its environment, with which it may interact.</li></ul>
                            <p><strong>(c)(i) Selection Bias (Feasibility Study):</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>Occurs when the sample or data chosen for the study is not representative of the overall situation, leading to skewed or inaccurate conclusions about feasibility. For example, only interviewing users who are enthusiastic about a new system.</li></ul>
                            <p><strong>(c)(ii) Closed-Loop System:</strong></p>
                            <ul><li>A system that uses feedback from its own output to control or modify its actions, aiming to maintain a desired state. It automatically adjusts based on the difference between the actual output and the desired output.</li></ul>
