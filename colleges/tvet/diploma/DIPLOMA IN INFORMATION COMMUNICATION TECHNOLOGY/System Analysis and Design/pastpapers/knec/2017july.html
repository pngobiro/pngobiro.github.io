The branches register new members by processing applications from prospective members whose details are then stored in the members file. The customer service officer is then required to open a FOSA account of the new Sacco members’ and issue a Sacco membership card. When a Sacco member wants to make a transaction at the branch, he/she is required to produce a Membership card and national identity card for verification purposes. The member is then required to specify the type of transaction to be carried out. On completion the member is issued a transaction receipt and the transaction file updated.</p>

                                <li>Direct Changeover (Cutover). Justification: The requirement is to replace the *entire* legacy system urgently. This strategy involves stopping the old system and starting the new one immediately, which is the fastest approach, albeit risky.</li>

                                <li>System Failure: If the new system fails upon launch, there is no fallback, causing major disruption.</li>
                                <li>Data Issues: Errors during data conversion/migration might only become apparent after going live.</li>
                                <li>User unpreparedness: Insufficient time for training or adaptation can lead to errors and reduced productivity.</li>
                                <li>High Stress: Puts immense pressure on the implementation team and users.</li>

                                <li>Late Feedback: Users see the working system only late in the process, making requirement changes hard.</li>
