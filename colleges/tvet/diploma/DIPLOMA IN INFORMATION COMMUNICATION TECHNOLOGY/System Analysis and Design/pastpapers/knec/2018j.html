                                <li><strong>Difficult to Analyze:</strong> Responses are qualitative and varied, making statistical analysis and comparison challenging and time-consuming.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lower Response Rate (Potentially):</strong> Require more effort from respondents compared to closed questions, potentially leading to fewer completed surveys or skipped questions.</li>

                                <li><strong>Sequential File Organization:</strong> Records are stored one after another in a predetermined order (e.g., by key field). Simple but slow for direct access.

+----------+    +----------+    +----------+

                                <li><strong>Indexed Sequential File Organization (ISAM/VSAM):</strong> Records are stored sequentially, but an index is maintained to allow direct access to specific records based on their key. Balances sequential processing and direct access needs.
                                    <pre class="diagram-code">

(Index points to approximate location, then sequential search)

                                <li><strong>Direct/Random File Organization:</strong> Records are stored at addresses calculated from their key field using a hashing algorithm. Very fast for direct access but inefficient for sequential processing.

                        <p>Hazina Technical Institute intends to set up a policy document for malpractice cases in Student’s term reports. A student who is suspected of plagiarizing his/her work would first be summoned by a subject lecturer for a chat to establish the authenticity of sources of references on affected reports.</p>
                        <p>Based on the outcome of the chat, the lecturer would then decide whether there is an academic dishonesty case to answer. If the lecturer attests that there is an academic dishonesty, there would be a case to answer. Hence, the lecturer would check student academic record for a similar case and if found the student would be referred to the Principal, a week suspension and a subsequent meeting with academic committee on reporting date.</p>
                        <p>However, if it is a first case the lecturer is supposed to get an approval from Dean of studies for the appropriate punishment that would be endorsed and a letter written to the student. A student would then choose to accept or appeal the finding of the Dean of studies. On acceptance he/she proceeds to carry out the punishment and the case is closed. Otherwise, if he/she chooses to appeal, he will meet the academic committee for the hearing of the case in line with the Institute’s academic policy before the case gets closed.</p>

                                <li><strong>No Feedback Mechanism:</strong> System operates without monitoring its output or results.</li>
                                <li><strong>Fixed Operation:</strong> System follows predetermined instructions without adapting to changes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Simple Design:</strong> Generally less complex than closed-loop systems due to absence of feedback components.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lower Accuracy:</strong> Less precise control due to inability to correct errors based on output.</li>
