Customers place orders by emails, telephone. or company's website. A sales representative who receives customer’s order is supposed to verify if the items are in stock and immediately notify the customer. If some of the items are not found on the inventory control book the sales representative is then supposed to update the inventory file. Once the customer order is verified the item and customer files are updated and an invoice is generated which is then sent to customer for payment. On receiving the invoice, the customer deposits money to the company’s bank account and sends an email to notify the accountant who then updates the payment file and customer file. After confirmation of payment the company dispatches the items to customer's physical address together with a delivery note. A copy of delivery note is then filed upon a successful delivery.</p>

                            <p><strong>(c) Types of Relationships (with examples):</strong></p>
                            <ul><li><strong>(i) One-to-One (1:1):</strong> Each instance in one entity relates to exactly one instance in another entity, and vice versa. Example: A `User` entity might have a 1:1 relationship with a `UserProfile` entity (each user has one profile, each profile belongs to one user).</li><li><strong>(ii) One-to-Many (1:M):</strong> One instance in the 'one' entity can relate to multiple instances in the 'many' entity, but each instance in the 'many' entity relates to only one instance in the 'one' entity. Example: A `Department` entity has a 1:M relationship with an `Employee` entity (one department has many employees, but each employee belongs to only one department).</li><li><strong>(iii) Many-to-Many (M:N):</strong> One instance in the first entity can relate to multiple instances in the second entity, AND one instance in the second entity can relate to multiple instances in the first entity. Example: A `Student` entity has an M:N relationship with a `Course` entity (a student can enroll in many courses, and a course can have many students). This usually requires a linking/junction table in database design (e.g., `Enrollment` table).</li></ul>
