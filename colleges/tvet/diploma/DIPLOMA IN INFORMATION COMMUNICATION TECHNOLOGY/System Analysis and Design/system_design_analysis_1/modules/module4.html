        <section>
          <h3>Introduction to System Study</h3>
          <p>Preliminary system study is the first stage of system development life cycle. This is a brief investigation of the system under consideration and gives a clear picture of what actually the physical system is? In practice, the initial system study involves the preparation of a System proposal which lists the Problem Definition, Objectives of the Study, Terms of reference for Study, Constraints, Expected benefits of the new system, etc. in the light of the user requirements. The system proposal is prepared by the System Analyst (who studies the system) and places it before the user management. The management may accept the proposal and the cycle proceeds to the next stage. The management may also reject the proposal or request some modifications in the proposal. In summary, we would say that system study phase passes through the following steps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>problem identification and project initiation</li>
            <li>background analysis</li>
            <li>inference or findings</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Problem definition:</h3>
          <p>On receiving a request from the user for systems development, an investigation is conducted to state the problem to be solved.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deliverables: Problem statement.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Indicator(s)</h3>
          <p>An indicator is something that points to an issue or condition. Its purpose is to show you how well a system is working. If there is a problem, an indicator can help you determine what direction to take to address the issue. Indicators are as varied as the types of systems they monitor. However, there are certain characteristics that effective indicators have in common:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Effective indicators are relevant; they show you something about the system that you need to know.</li>
            <li>Effective indicators are easy to understand, even by people who are not experts.</li>
            <li>Effective indicators are reliable; you can trust the information that the indicator is providing.</li>
            <li>Lastly, effective indicators are based on accessible data; the information is available or can be gathered while there is still time to act.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Using Indicators to Measure Progress and Performance</h3>
          <p>Progress and performance must be measured to attest a development in a (long term) project. With few, but carefully selected indicators, it is possible to get a good overview on the progress and performance. Indicators can be used in many different areas including subject project. Here, you will find how indicators work and how they are developed.</p>
          <p>"How do we know process is being made? How can we know if an intervention is making our system more sustainable?‚Äù These are very important questions regarding projects or programmes in water and sanitation. Therefore a suitable method is needed to make the development visible and measure the progress.</p>
          <p>Indicators are one approach to measure progress.The term "minimum indicators" is used in recognition that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is better to start with a small set of indicators that are feasible to monitor and to improve over time.</li>
            <li>There are many other indicators that could be used to measure progress beyond this basic level.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Indicators provide an effective tool to measure progress and performance. An indicator is the representation of a trend tracking the measurable change in a system over time. Generally an indicator focuses on a small, manageable set of information that gives a sense of the bigger picture. Therefore it can be seen that there is no need to measure everything. Furthermore the choice of indicators is important as to whether it gives sufficient ‚Äòsense of the bigger picture'.</p>
          <p>Only well selected indicators can assist the process to maintain a focus on the important work areas and take strategic decisions to address problem areas. That makes a project sustainable and allows responsible persons to act.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Use of Indicators</h3>
          <p>Indicators are useful to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Measure progress over time against various objectives providing information relevant to policy.</li>
            <li>Measure performance against a target to evaluate the effect of policy actions and plans.</li>
            <li>Present information to the public or stakeholders in a simplified way.</li>
            <li>Identify areas for increased attention by an organisation.</li>
          </ul>
          <section>
            <h4>Indicators Have Two Core Functions:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>To provide system information to inform the project team (responsible organisation), the public and policy makers.</li>
              <li>To translate data into policy relevant information. That is, they describe, show trends and communicate the results of implementing objectives.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Criteria for Developing Indicators</h4>
            <p>The most important point in developing indicators is not to be too ambitious. Start with what can be realistically done or else failure is guaranteed.</p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li><strong>Simple, Easily Measured, Understood and Applied</strong><br>The data used for indicators should be in a format that is easy to use. The more complex the indicator the less useful it will be.</li>
              <li><strong>As Few as Necessary</strong><br>The capacity to measure and report is usually limited by financial and human resources.Being burdened with an excessive number of indicators may mean that the system fails to achieve the expected benefits or does not work at all. A set with a large number of indicators will tend to clutter the overview it is meant to provide.</li>
              <li><strong>Use Existing Information Where Possible</strong><br>It is preferable that the information needed to measure an indicator is available through existing data sources and monitoring programmes or that data collection can occur through existing programmes. This will improve the cost effectiveness of the system.</li>
              <li><strong>Relate at the Appropriate Scale</strong><br>An indicator should be related to the specific situation it is "indicating" information about. The indicator should be measurable at an appropriate scale.</li>
              <li><strong>Detect Change</strong><br>The indicator should be able to detect change. If it does not reflect change because it was poorly selected or the situation has changed then another indicator should be identified.</li>
              <li><strong>Comparable, Repeatable and Defensible Between Sites and Times</strong><br>It is an advantage to use indicators which are comparable between similar projects in different countries. That allows transboundary comparisons and assures the choice of the indicator.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Indicators are useful tools for measuring progress and motivating action in specific areas. They should be limited to those that can reasonably be measured. Start small, build up gradually.</p>
            <p>Typical system indicators include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Functional indicators (e.g. adaptability, durability, and reliability of the system)</li>
              <li>Economic indicators (e.g. capital costs, operation and maintenance costs and user costs)</li>
              <li>Environmental indicators covering resource use (e.g. nutrient reuse) and emissions (e.g. emission of carbon dioxide)</li>
              <li>Social-cultural indicators (e.g. public participation, acceptance, and stimulation of sustainable behaviour)</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Problem identification method</h3>
          <p>When we get sense that something is wrong, the natural inclination for a lot of us, especially men, is to immediately switch into problem solving mode.</p>
          <p>I suggest that before diving in head first, it makes sense to verify that a) there is actually a problem worth addressing and b) it is actually clear to everyone what the problem is in the first place.</p>
          <p>This could under the wrong circumstances turn into a Ph.D. thesis project, but let's do something else and more focused.</p>
          <p>I call this the 3 Step Rapid Problem Identification Method.</p>
          <section>
            <h4>Step 1: Reality Check</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>You've noticed what looks like a problem ‚Äì take a deep breath.</li>
              <li>Is this a real problem? How do you know?</li>
              <li>Can you describe it? Do you know enough about the problem to describe it in a meaningful way?</li>
              <li>Is it urgent? Is it important to resolve this problem right now?</li>
              <li>Do you have any prior knowledge or experience with this or similar problems?</li>
              <li>Who should you talk to? Is there someone else who can help you?</li>
              <li>Make up your mind ‚Äì do you pursue this or not?</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Step 2: Problem Identification (assuming you're going to pursue it)</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Think back about what you, the process, the team, the organization or whatever were doing just prior to the problem.</li>
              <li>Look at the symptoms of the problem without disturbing the condition of the system, process or whatever is giving off problem signals.</li>
              <li>Consider the possibility of specification error, that is, you're misinterpreting what you're seeing.</li>
              <li>Ask yourself if there are alternative explanations for what's occurring (or did occur in the past).</li>
              <li>State your description of the problem.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Step 3: Investigation</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Think about how the problem can be reproduced - this is useful to test a) your understanding of it and b) check effectiveness of any proposed solutions.</li>
              <li>Identify the symptoms of the problem ‚Äì symptoms are signs of how things appear and are not necessarily causes.</li>
              <li>Try to understand how severe could the problem be ‚Äì you may not see the full, worst case manifestation of it so you need to avoid coming up with a over-simplified or weak solution.</li>
              <li>Now drill down into what might be causing the problem ‚Äì look for the cause and effect relationships, for example use the 5W=1H model: ask why five times and you'll find the how to solve it).</li>
              <li>Consider alternative solutions, for example, what might be a workaround? No need to create complicated solutions if you can run around the obstacle in some other easier and more efficient way.</li>
              <li>State your recommended solution and why you think it will work.</li>
              <li>Talk to somebody else to get a second opinion, make sure you didn't miss anything important.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This isn't a foolproof method, but at least it sorts out some of the stuff that is not urgent and therefore not useful to spend time on right now.</p>
            <p>I imagine you've got no more spare time than the rest of us, so that's a big win right there.</p>
            <p>Also, I think the admonition to step back and look at the problem from a wider perspective is very useful. Tunnel vision may cause us to cough up a premature conclusion and make a wrong or ineffective fix.</p>

          <h3>Terms of reference</h3>
          <p>Terms of Reference (TOR) provide a statement of the background, objectives, and purpose of a proposed project.</p>
          <p>Terms of Reference (TOR) are a strategy-level document that defines the tasks and duties required of a project contractor, and highlights project background and objectives at high level. The document also states the planned activities, expected inputs and outputs, project budget, working schedules, and job descriptions. It is used to judge about the performance of contractors, consultants, experts, and other project stakeholders.</p>
          <p>The purpose of TOR is to specify the amount and type of work to be accomplished by the project. It is a governance document that establishes and determines the relationships between all project stakeholders. Terms of Reference are developed once a project has been identified, defined and planned.</p>
          <p>TOR of a project provides a clear description of the following critical information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The rationale behind undertaking the project</li>
            <li>The proposed methodology of project management along with work plans and activity schedules</li>
            <li>The expected resource requirements, primarily regarding personnel</li>
            <li>Reporting rules and requirements</li>
          </ul>
          <section>
            <h4>Content of TOR</h4>
            <p>The development of Project Terms of Reference is required for making the decision on whether or not to allocate necessary funds to a proposed project. It is the result of the project proposal process, and TOR serves as the primary report of this process. TOR is usually required for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pre-feasibility and feasibility analyses</li>
              <li>Appraisal activity</li>
              <li>Implementation contracts designing and monitoring</li>
              <li>Evaluation studies</li>
              <li>Reporting and audit</li>
              <li>Other advisory work required at any project stage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Considering the listed items, the content of Project Terms of Reference should include business-critical information necessary for starting, implementing and monitoring project activities. Meanwhile, the exact content of TOR varies from project to project and significantly depends upon the scope of a proposed project.</p>
            <p>A generic content format of Project Terms of Reference is suggested below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Project Background</li>
              <li>Project Objectives</li>
              <li>Issues to be explored and analyzed against certain criteria</li>
              <li>Implementation Methodology to be applied</li>
              <li>Expertise required</li>
              <li>Reporting requirements</li>
              <li>Work plan, including activity schedules</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note these are the common sections of a TOR template. They can be changed or omitted, depending on the scope of a particular project. The following below description of the TOR sections is general and provided as an overview for guidance purposes. It means a particular project will require a deeper analysis of the content to be included in a TOR template. When you plan for your project, you must first analyze and define the work that needs to be contracted out, and then proceed with the development of Project Terms of Reference.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>1. Background</h4>
            <p>The background of a project provides an overview of the history behind the project. It should clearly state why perform the project and refer to a programming context. The purpose is to provide the reader with a brief explanation of the need behind the project.</p>
            <p>The Background section of a TOR template usually includes several paragraphs which address the following issues:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Describe the project in the context of a related business need</li>
              <li>State the general role of stakeholders in doing project activities</li>
              <li>Highlight a brief overview of the project to date</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>2. Objectives</h4>
            <p>The objectives of a project are those desired accomplishments that can be reasonably delivered upon project completion, with consumption of available resources and within an expected timeframe. They should clearly identify and define what is expected from the project and who the target audience is.</p>
            <p>The Objectives section of a Terms of Reference template should describe desired achievements at different stages of project lifecycle. It should also state the primary objectives of the project, which must be achieved upon success project completion. Here's an example of how it should look like.</p>
            <table border="1">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Work Type/Project Stage</th>
                  <th>Generic Objective</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Project Completion</td>
                  <td>To increase sales of product ‚ÄúA‚Äù by 15% over a 3-month period</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Feasibility study</td>
                  <td>To provide decision makers with sufficient information necessary for acceptance or rejection of the proposed project</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Monitoring</td>
                  <td>To provide decision makers with sufficient information necessary to make informed judgment regarding the performance of the project</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Audit</td>
                  <td>To ensure the project remains relevant and reasonable in legal, economical and technical terms</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>3. Issues</h4>
            <p>Any project involves a number of issues and problematic areas that must be addressed in order for the project to be implemented smoothly. The issues are the points of discussion or dispute throughout the project lifecycle. They cover any concern, query, request for change, or anything else that requires a resolution during the project. Unresolved issues may cause project failure.</p>
            <p>The Issues section of a TOR template should highlight key issues to be studied and disputed at every stage of the project lifecycle. Usually TOR includes a range of evaluation criteria to be used for issue analysis and solving. Here are generic issue evaluation criteria for most projects:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Efficiency - this criterion determines how well a given activity transforms available resources into desired outputs in terms of quantity, quality and time</li>
              <li>Relevance - it help analyze whether a given activity is being performed with the desired benefits</li>
              <li>Effectiveness ‚Äì it concerns how far the project's outputs have been utilized and whether the project's purpose has been realized</li>
              <li>Impact - this measure helps figure out the extent to which the project's benefits received by the target audience have an overall effect on larger numbers of people concerned</li>
              <li>Sustainability ‚Äì this criterion identifies whether the project's positive outcomes will continue after funding ends.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>4. Methodology</h4>
            <p>The implementation methodology of a project provides a set of broad principles and rules from which specific procedures will be derived in order to define how to carry out the project in a cost-effective way. It describes the main methods of project implementation.</p>
            <p>The Methodology section of a Project Terms of Reference template should therefore include a description of the following items:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Key phases of the project implementation process</li>
              <li>The required level of stakeholder involvement that ensures smooth implementation</li>
              <li>The content and duration of project activities and tasks</li>
              <li>The information collection tools to be used throughout the project for monitoring purposes</li>
              <li>Data analysis rules</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>5. Expertise</h4>
            <p>The expertise needed for doing a project defines a set of professional requirements for the individuals and teams involved in project implementation. It will be the basis for team building, including training and skill assessment.</p>
            <p>The Expertise section of a Project Terms of Reference template should identify the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The type of work involved in the project</li>
              <li>The type of skills and abilities required to do project work</li>
              <li>The exact number of individuals involved, including a description of their qualifications, experience, and other professional attributes</li>
              <li>The period of engagement of each team member</li>
              <li>A description of the duties and responsibility per teammate</li>
              <li>The relationship between the team members, including leadership roles</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>6. Reporting</h4>
            <p>Reports provide valued information about project performance over a certain period. Reporting is a process that starts once a project is launched and continues until the project is completed and its product is handed over. Reporting requirements will define how to write and submit project reports and what information to include.</p>
            <p>The Reporting Requirements section of a Terms of Reference template should clearly specify the requirements for the reporting process, and might include the details of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Table of contents for project reports</li>
              <li>Rules for composing annexes</li>

            <h4>7. Work Plan</h4>
            <p>A work plan is a kind of strategy that aims to help solve problems throughout a project and boost employee drive and focus. It determines what actions need to be taken to start, implement, and complete the project within a specified time period and under defined budget. It is often used as a general guide for developing a project implementation plan.</p>
            <p>The Work Plan section of a Project Terms of Reference template should set out the activities and necessary resources required for achieving the project's results and purpose. It should therefore include a summary of the anticipated work and time schedule, which are based upon the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>An analysis of the issues, in terms of the evaluation criteria</li>
              <li>The proposed implementation methodology</li>
              <li>The reporting requirements</li>
              <li>The finance resources allocated to the project.</li>
            </ul>
