        <section>
          <h3>Introduction to Implementation</h3>
          <p>Systems implementation is the construction of the new system and the delivery of that system into production (that is, the day-to-day business or organization operation).</p>
          <p>Implementation refers to the actualization of best management practices with the ultimate goals of conserving natural resources and improving the quality of water bodies.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Purpose/importance</h3>
          <p>Implementation process is to design and create (or fabricate) a system element conforming to that element's design properties and/or requirements. The element is constructed employing appropriate technologies and industry practices.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Implementation procedure/ Activities of implementation</h3>
          <p>The following major activities and tasks are performed during this process:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Define the implementation strategy</strong> - Implementation process activities begin with detailed design and include developing an implementation strategy that defines fabrication and coding procedures, tools and equipment to be used, implementation tolerances, and the means and criteria for auditing configuration of resulting elements to the detailed design documentation. In the case of repeated system element implementations (such as for mass manufacturing or replacement elements), the implementation strategy is defined and refined to achieve consistent and repeatable element production; it is retained in the project decision database for future use. The implementation strategy contains the arrangements for packing, storing, and supplying the implemented element.</li>
            <li><strong>Realize the system element</strong> - Realize or adapt and produce the concerned system element using the implementation strategy items as defined above. Realization or adaptation is conducted with regard to standards that govern applicable safety, security, privacy, and environmental guidelines or legislation and the practices of the relevant implementation technology. This requires the fabrication of hardware elements, development of software elements, definition of training capabilities, drafting of training documentation, and the training of initial operators and maintainers.</li>
            <li><strong>Provide evidence of compliance</strong> - Record evidence that the system element meets its requirements and the associated verification and validation criteria as well as the legislation policy. This requires the conduction of peer reviews and unit testing, as well as inspection of operation and maintenance manuals. Acquire measured properties that characterize the implemented element (weight, capacities, effectiveness, level of performance, reliability, availability, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Package, store, and supply the implemented element</strong> - This should be defined in the implementation strategy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After having the user acceptance of the new system developed, the implementation phase begins. Implementation is the stage of a project during which theory is turned into practice. The major steps involved in this phase are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Acquisition and Installation of Hardware and Software</li>
            <li>Conversion</li>
            <li>User Training</li>
            <li>Documentation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The hardware and the relevant software required for running the system must be made fully operational before implementation. The conversion is also one of the most critical and expensive activities in the system development life cycle. The data from the old system needs to be converted to operate in the new format of the new system. The database needs to be setup with security and recovery procedures fully defined.</p>
          <p>During this phase, all the programs of the system are loaded onto the user's computer. After loading the system, training of the user starts. Main topics of such type of training are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How to execute the package?</li>
            <li>How to enter the data?</li>
            <li>How to process the data (processing details)?</li>
            <li>How to take out the reports?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After the users are trained about the computerized system, working has to shift from manual to computerized working. The process is called Changeover. The following strategies are followed for changeover of the system.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Types of Implementation/ implementation techniques</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Direct changeover</li>
            <li>Parallel running or as known as parallel</li>
            <li>Pilot introduction or as known as pilot</li>
            <li>Well-trade</li>
            <li>Phased implementation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are several common conversion strategies [implementation techniques]:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Direct/abrupt cutover</strong> ‚Äì on a specific date (usually coinciding with some business data, like the start of the new financial year, or a school year) ‚Äî the old system goes off-line and the new one is placed into operation.</li>
            <li><strong>Parallel conversion</strong> ‚Äì both old and new systems are used for a period of time; this is done to ensure that all major problems in the new system have been solved before abandoning the old system.</li>
            <li><strong>Pilot/Location conversion</strong> ‚Äì when the same system will be used in multiple locations, usually one location is selected to start with (to see where the problems are in conversion) and then the conversion is performed on all the other sites.</li>
            <li><strong>Phased/Staged conversion</strong> ‚Äì each successive version of the new system is converted as it is developed.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>System Testing</h3>
          <p>System testing is the process of evaluation a system item to detect differences between given input and expected output. Also to assess the feature of a system item. Testing assesses the quality of the product. System testing is a process that should be done during the development process. In other words system testing is a verification and validation process.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Verification and Validation</h3>
          <p><strong>Verification</strong> is the process to make sure the product satisfies the conditions imposed at the start of the development phase. In other words, to make sure the product behaves the way we want it to.</p>
          <p><strong>Validation</strong> is the process to make sure the product satisfies the specified requirements at the end of the development phase. In other words, to make sure the product is built as per customer requirements.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Basics of system testing [testing techniques]</h3>
          <p>There are two basics of system testing: black-box testing and white-box testing.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Black-box Testing</strong><br>Black box testing is a testing technique that ignores the internal mechanism of the system and focuses on the output generated against any input and execution of the system. It is also called functional testing.</li>
            <li><strong>White-box Testing</strong><br>White box testing is a testing technique that takes into account the internal mechanism of a system. It is also called structural testing and glass box testing.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Black box testing is often used for validation and white box testing is often used for verification.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Types of testing</h3>
          <p>There are many types of testing like</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unit Testing</li>
            <li>Integration Testing</li>
            <li>Functional Testing</li>
            <li>System Testing</li>
            <li>Stress Testing</li>
            <li>Performance Testing</li>
            <li>Usability Testing</li>

            <li>Regression Testing</li>
            <li>Beta Testing</li>
          </ul>
          <section>
            <h4>Unit Testing,</h4>
            <p>Unit testing is the testing of an individual unit or group of related units. It falls under the class of white box testing. It is often done by the programmer to test that the unit he/she has implemented is producing expected output against given input.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Integration Testing,</h4>
            <p>Integration testing is testing in which a group of components are combined to produce output. Also, the interaction between software and hardware is tested in integration testing if software and hardware components have any relation. It may fall under both white box testing and black box testing.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Functional Testing,</h4>
            <p>Functional testing is the testing to ensure that the specified functionality required in the system requirements works. It falls under the class of black box testing.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>System Testing,</h4>
            <p>System testing is the testing to ensure that by putting the software in different environments (e.g., Operating Systems) it still works. System testing is done with full system implementation and environment. It falls under the class of black box testing.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Stress Testing,</h4>
            <p>Stress testing is the testing to evaluate how system behaves under unfavorable conditions. Testing is conducted at beyond limits of the specifications. It falls under the class of black box testing.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Performance Testing,</h4>
            <p>Performance testing is the testing to assess the speed and effectiveness of the system and to make sure it is generating results within a specified time as in performance requirements. It falls under the class of black box testing.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Usability Testing,</h4>
            <p>Usability testing is performed to the perspective of the client, to evaluate how the GUI is user-friendly? How easily can the client learn? After learning how to use, how proficiently can the client perform? How pleasing is it to use its design? This falls under the class of black box testing.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Acceptance Testing,</h4>
            <p>Acceptance testing is often done by the customer to ensure that the delivered product meets the requirements and works as the customer expected. It falls under the class of black box testing.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Regression Testing,</h4>
            <p>Regression testing is the testing after modification of a system, component, or a group of related units to ensure that the modification is working correctly and is not damaging or imposing other modules to produce unexpected results. It falls under the class of black box testing.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Beta Testing,</h4>
            <p>Beta testing is the testing which is done by end users, a team outside development, or publicly releasing full pre-version of the product which is known as beta version. The aim of beta testing is to cover unexpected errors. It falls under the class of black box testing.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Acceptance testing</h4>
            <p>Acceptance testing is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met. It may involve chemical tests, physical tests, or performance tests.</p>
            <p>Software developers often distinguish acceptance testing by the system provider from acceptance testing by the customer (the user or client)</p>
            <h5>Types of acceptance testing are:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The User Acceptance test:</strong> focuses mainly on the functionality thereby validating the fitness-for-use of the system by the business user. The user acceptance test is performed by the users and application managers.</li>
              <li><strong>The Operational Acceptance test:</strong> also known as Production acceptance test validates whether the system meets the requirements for operation. In most of the organization the operational acceptance test is performed by the system administration before the system is released. The operational acceptance test may include testing of backup/restore, disaster recovery, maintenance tasks and periodic check of security vulnerabilities.</li>
              <li><strong>Contract Acceptance testing:</strong> It is performed against the contract's acceptance criteria for producing custom developed software. Acceptance should be formally defined when the contract is agreed.</li>
              <li><strong>Compliance acceptance testing:</strong> It is also known as regulation acceptance testing is performed against the regulations which must be adhered to, such as governmental, legal or safety regulations.</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>User Training</h3>
          <p>User Training User Training is the process of identifying the gap in employee knowledge and related training needs.</p>
          <section>
            <h4>Types of Needs Analyses</h4>
            <p>Many needs assessments are available for use in different employment contexts. Sources that can help you determine which needs analysis is appropriate for your situation are described below.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Organizational Analysis.</strong> An analysis of the business needs or other reasons the training is desired. An analysis of the organization's strategies, goals, and objectives. What is the organization overall trying to accomplish? The important questions being answered by this analysis are who decided that training should be conducted, why a training program is seen as the recommended solution to a business problem, what the history of the organization has been with regard to employee training and other management interventions.</li>
              <li><strong>Person Analysis.</strong> Analysis dealing with potential participants and instructors involved in the process. The important questions being answered by this analysis are who will receive the training and their level of existing knowledge on the subject, what is their learning style, and who will conduct the training. Do the employees have required skills? Are there changes to policies, procedures, software, or equipment that require or necessitate training?</li>
              <li><strong>Work analysis / Task Analysis.</strong> Analysis of the tasks being performed. This is an analysis of the job and the requirements for performing the work. Also known as a task analysis or job analysis, this analysis seeks to specify the main duties and skill level required. This helps ensure that the training which is developed will include relevant links to the content of the job.</li>
              <li><strong>Performance Analysis.</strong> Are the employees performing up to the established standard? If performance is below expectations, can training help to improve this performance? Is there a Performance Gap?</li>
              <li><strong>Content Analysis.</strong> Analysis of documents, laws, procedures used on the job. This analysis answers questions about what knowledge or information is used on this job. This information comes from manuals, documents, or regulations. It is important that the content of the training does not conflict or contradict job requirements. An experienced worker can assist (as a subject matter expert) in determining the appropriate content.</li>
              <li><strong>Training Suitability Analysis.</strong> Analysis of whether training is the desired solution. Training is one of several solutions to employment problems. However, it may not always be the best solution. It is important to determine if training will be effective in its usage.</li>
              <li><strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis.</strong> Analysis of the return on investment (ROI) of training. Effective training results in a return of value to the organization that is greater than the initial investment to produce or administer the training.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Training Methods</h4>
            <p>Many methods of training are available- each has certain advantages and disadvantages. Here we list the different methods of training...you can comment on the pros and cons and make the examples concrete by imagining how they could be applied in training truck drivers.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Technology-Based Learning</strong><br>Common methods of learning via technology include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Basic PC-based programs</li>
                  <li>Interactive multimedia - using a PC-based CD-ROM</li>
                  <li>Interactive video - using a computer in conjunction with a VCR</li>
                  <li>Web-based training programs</li>
                </ul><br>The forms of training with technology are almost unlimited. A trainer also gets more of the learner's involvement than in any other environment and trainees have the benefit of learning at their own pace.<br><strong>Example:</strong> In the trucking industry one can imagine interactive multimedia training on tractor-trailers followed by a proficiency test to see how well the employee knows the truck.</li>
              <li><strong>Simulators</strong><br>Simulators are used to imitate real work experiences.<br>Most simulators are very expensive but for certain jobs, like learning to fly a 747, they are indispensable. Astronauts also train extensively using simulators to imitate the challenges and micro-gravity experienced on a space mission. The military also uses video games (similar to the "shoot-em-up" ones your 14-year old plays) to train soldiers.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Truck drivers could use simulators to practice responding to dangerous driving situations.</li>
              <li><strong>On-The-Job Training</strong><br>Jumping right into work from day one can sometimes be the most effective type of training.<br>Here are a few examples of on-the-job training:
                <ul>
                  <li>Read the manual a rather boring, but thorough way of gaining knowledge of about a task.</li>
                  <li>A combination of observation, explanation and practice.</li>
                  <li>Trainers go through the job description to explain duties and answer questions.</li>
                  <li>Use the intranet so trainees can post questions concerning their jobs and experts within the company can answer them.</li>
                </ul><br>On-the-job training gives employees motivation to start the job. Some reports indicate that people learn more efficiently if they learn hands-on, rather than listening to an instructor. However, this method might not be for everyone, as it could be very stressful.<br><strong>Example:</strong> New trucking employees could ride with experienced drivers. They could ask questions about truck weigh stations, proper highway speeds, picking up hitchhikers, or any other issues that may arise.</li>
              <li><strong>Coaching/Mentoring</strong><br>Coaching/mentoring gives employees a chance to receive training one-on-one from an experienced professional. This usually takes place after another more formal process has taken place to expand on what trainees have already learned.<br>Here are three examples of coaching/mentoring:
                <ul>
                  <li>Hire professional coaches for managers (see our HR.com article on <a href="#">Understanding Executive Coaching</a>)</li>
                  <li>Set up a formal mentoring program between senior and junior managers</li>
                  <li>Implement less formal coaching/mentoring to encourage the more experienced employees to coach the less experienced.</li>
                </ul><br>Coaching/mentoring gives trainees the chance to ask questions and receive thorough and honest answers - something they might not receive in a classroom with a group of people.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Again, truck drivers could gain valuable knowledge from more experienced drivers using this method.</li>
              <li><strong>Lectures</strong><br>Lectures usually take place in a classroom-format.<br>It seems the only advantage to a lecture is the ability to get a huge amount of information to a lot of people in a short amount of time. It has been said to be the least effective of all training methods. In many cases, lectures contain no form of interaction from the trainer to the trainee and can be quite boring. Studies show that people only retain 20 percent of what they are taught in a lecture.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Truck drivers could receive lectures on issues such as company policies and safety.</li>
              <li><strong>Group Discussions & Tutorials</strong><br>These most likely take place in a classroom where a group of people discuss issues.<br>For example, if an unfamiliar program is to be implemented, a group discussion on the new program would allow employees to ask questions and provide ideas on how the program would work best.<br>A better form of training than lectures, it allows all trainees to discuss issues concerning the new program. It also enables every attendee to voice different ideas and bounce them off one another.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Truck drivers could have group discussions and tutorials on safety issues they face on the road. This is a good way to gain feedback and suggestions from other drivers.</li>
              <li><strong>Role Playing</strong><br>Role playing allows employees to act out issues that could occur in the workplace. Key skills often touched upon are negotiating and teamwork.<br>A role play could take place between two people simulating an issue that could arise in the workplace. This could occur with a group of people split into pairs, or whereby two people role play in front of the classroom.<br>Role playing can be effective in connecting theory and practice, but may not be popular with people who don't feel comfortable performing in front of a group of people.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Truck drivers could role play an issue such as a large line-up of trucks is found at the weighing station and one driver tells another that he might as well go ahead and skip the whole thing. Or role play a driver who gets pulled over by a police officer and doesn't agree with the speeding charge.</li>
              <li><strong>Management Games</strong><br>Management games simulate real-life issues faced in the workplace. They attract all types of trainees including active, practical and reflective employees.<br>Some examples of management games could include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Computer simulations of business situations that managers 'play'.</li>
                  <li>Board games that simulate a business situation.</li>
                  <li>Games surrounding thought and creativity - to help managers find creative ways to solve problems in the workplace, or to implement innovative ideas.</li>
                </ul><br><strong>Example:</strong> In a trucking business, managers could create games that teach truckers the impact of late deliveries, poor customer service or unsafe driving.</li>
              <li><strong>Outdoor Training</strong><br>A nice break from regular classroom or computer-based training, the usual purpose of outdoor training is to develop teamwork skills.<br>Some examples include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Wilderness or adventure training - participants live outdoors and engage in activities like whitewater rafting, sailing, and mountain climbing.</li>
                  <li>Low-impact programming - equipment can include simple props or a permanently installed "low ropes" course.</li>
                  <li>High-impact programming - Could include navigating a 40-foot "high ropes" course, rock climbing, or rappelling.</li>
                </ul><br>Outgoing and active participants may get the most out of this form of training. One risk trainers might encounter is distraction, or people who don't like outdoor activities.<br><strong>Example:</strong> As truck drivers are often on the road alone, they could participate in a nature-training course along with depot personnel to build esprit de corps.</li>
              <li><strong>Films & Videos</strong><br>Films and videos can be used on their own or in conjunction with other training methods.<br>To be truly effective, training films and videos should be geared towards a specific objective. Only if they are produced effectively, will they keep the trainees attention. They are also effective in stimulating discussion on specific issues after the film or video is finished.<br>Films and videos are good training tools, but have some of the same disadvantages as a lecture - i.e., no interaction from the trainees.<br>A few risks to think about - showing a film or video from an outside source may not touch on issues directly affecting a specific company. Trainees may find the information very interesting but irrelevant to their position in the company.<br>Some trainers like to show videos as a break from another training method, i.e. as a break from a lecture instead of a coffee break.<br>This is not a good idea for two reasons. One: after a long lecture, trainees will usually want a break from any training material, so a training film wouldn't be too popular. Two: using films and videos solely for the purpose of a break could get expensive.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Videos for truckers could show the proper way to interact with customers or illustrate preventive maintenance techniques.</li>
              <li><strong>Case Studies</strong><br>Case studies provide trainees with a chance to analyze and discuss real workplace issues. They develop analytical and problem-solving skills, and provide practical illustrations of principle or theory. They can also build a strong sense of teamwork as teams struggle together to make sense of a case.<br>All types of issues could be covered - i.e. how to handle a new product launch.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Truck drivers could use case studies to learn what issues have been faced in the trucking industry in the past and what they could do if a similar situation were to occur.</li>
              <li><strong>Planned Reading</strong><br>Basically planned reading is pre-stage preparation to more formal methods of training. Some trainees need to grasp specific issues before heading into the classroom or the team-building session.<br>Planned reading will provide employees with a better idea of what the issues are, giving them a chance to think of any questions beforehand.<br><strong>Example:</strong> Here we may be stretching if we think that truckers are going to read through a lot of material the training department sends them.</li>

            <h4>Types of users to be trained</h4>
            <p>Users authorized to change the way the system behaves are often called operators. Users who rely on a system, but do not operate it, are sometimes called the audience or end user. For example, when a driver (car operator) uses the horn to warn a pedestrian, then the driver is the horn operator and the pedestrian is the audience. Another example of various types of users are the operators of electronic boards, such as in airports or in e-commerce, who update messages, contrasted with the audience who read the messages.</p>
