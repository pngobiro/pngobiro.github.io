          <h3>Introduction to Systems Analysis</h3>
          <p>It is a process of collecting and interpreting facts, identifying the problems, and decomposition of a system into its components.</p>
          <section>
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Systems analysis is the process of examining a business situation for the purpose of developing a system solution to a problem or devising improvements to such a situation.</li>
              <li>The process of studying a procedure or business in order to identify its goals and purposes and create systems and procedures that will achieve them in an efficient way</li>
            </ol>
          </section>

          <h3>Objectives of System Analysis</h3>
          <p>Analysis involves studying the system and seeing how they interact with the entities outside as well as inside the system. We then come out with detailed specifications of what the system will accomplish based on the user requirements.</p>
          <p>Systems design will take the requirements and analysis into consideration and come out with a high level and low level design that will form the blue print to the actual solution to the problem in hand. In this dynamic world, analysis and design have to look into making systems that a flexible enough to accommodate changes as they are inevitable in any system.</p>
          <p>System analysis is conducted for the purpose of studying a system or its parts in order to identify its objectives. It is a problem solving technique that improves the system and ensures that all the components of the system work efficiently to accomplish their purpose.</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis specifies what the system should do.</strong></p>

          <h3>Methods in systems analysis</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Structured Analysis</strong><br>Structured Analysis is a development method that allows the analyst to understand the system and its activities in a logical way.<br>It is a systematic approach, which uses graphical tools that analyze and refine the objectives of an existing system and develop a new system specification which can be easily understandable by user.<br>It has following attributes ‚Äì
              <ul>
                <li>It is graphic which specifies the presentation of application.</li>
                <li>It divides the processes so that it gives a clear picture of system flow.</li>
                <li>It is logical rather than physical i.e., the elements of system do not depend on vendor or hardware.</li>
                <li>It is an approach that works from high-level overviews to lower-level details.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prototyping</strong><br>This is designing and building a scaled down, but functional version of a desired system. You can build a prototype with any computer languages or Development tool, but special prototyping tools have been developed to simplify the process. A prototype can be developed to simplify the process. A prototype can be developed with some 4G, with the query and screen and report design tools of a DBMS, and with CASE tools.<br>Using prototyping as a developing technique, requirements are converted to working system that is continually revised through close work between an analyst and user. This interactive process continues until the users are relatively with what they have seen. There are three main activities which are described as prototyping.
              <ol type="a">
                <li><strong>mock-up</strong><br>A "mock-up" of a proposed system or subsystem is produced for demonstration purposes at the early stages of a project so as to aid the users and usually the prototype has the appearance of the final system but lacks any real processing or storage capability.</li>
                <li><strong>Trial Prototyping</strong><br>A simplified working model of a proposed system or subsystem that has capabilities (some) of the real system. It might be used to design an appropriate user interface for the new system.</li>
                <li><strong>Rapid Prototyping.</strong><br>This is one method of achieving rapid applications development (RAD). The fundamental principle of any RAD methodology is to delay producing a detailed system design document until after user requirements are clear. RAD methodologies emphasize on gaining user acceptance of the human system interface and developing core capabilities as quickly as possible, sacrificing computer efficiency for gains on human efficiency in rapidly building and rebuilding a working system. The main method is the short term gain of having a working system early.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Joint Application Design (JAD)</strong><br>This is a structured process in which users, managers, and analyst work together for several days In a series of intensive meetings to specify or review system requirements.<br>It was developed in the late 1970's by the systems development personnel at IBM. However, JAD methodologies can overlook important software engineering principles, the result of which are inconsistencies between system modules, non-compliance components, hence can tend to be costly and difficult to maintain.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>System Analysis Tools</h3>
          <p>During Structured Analysis, various tools and techniques are used for system development. They are ‚Äì</p>

            <h4>Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) or Bubble Chart</h4>
            <p>Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) or Bubble Chart It is a technique developed by Larry Constantine to express the requirements of system in a graphical form.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It shows the flow of data between various functions of system and specifies how the current system is implemented.</li>
              <li>It is an initial stage of design phase that functionally divides the requirement specifications down to the lowest level of detail.</li>
              <li>Its graphical nature makes it a good communication tool between user and analyst or analyst and system designer.</li>
              <li>It gives an overview of what data a system processes, what transformations are performed, what data are stored, what results are produced and where they flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Basic Elements of DFD</h5>
            <p>DFD is easy to understand and quite effective when the required design is not clear and the user wants a notational language for communication. However, it requires a large number of iterations for obtaining the most accurate and complete solution.</p>
            <p>The following table shows the symbols used in designing a DFD and their significance ‚Äì</p>
            <table border="1">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Symbol Name</th>
                  <th>Symbol</th>
                  <th>Meaning</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>Square</td>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>Source or Destination of Data</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Arrow</td>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>Data flow</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Circle</td>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>Process transforming data flow</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Open Rectangle</td>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>Data Store</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <h5>Types of DFD</h5>
            <p>DFDs are of two types: Physical DFD and Logical DFD. The following table lists the points that differentiate a physical DFD from a logical DFD.</p>
            <table border="1">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Physical DFD</th>
                  <th>Logical DFD</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>It is implementation dependent. It shows which functions are performed.</td>
                  <td>It is implementation independent. It focuses only on the flow of data between processes.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>It provides low level details of hardware, software, files, and people.</td>
                  <td>It explains events of systems and data required by each event.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>It depicts how the current system operates and how a system will be implemented.</td>
                  <td>It shows how business operates; not how the system can be implemented.</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <h5>Context Diagram</h5>
            <p>A context diagram helps in understanding the entire system by one DFD which gives the overview of a system. It starts with mentioning major processes with little details and then goes onto giving more details of the processes with the top-down approach.</p>
            <p>The context diagram of mess management is shown below.</p>

          <section>
            <h4>Data Dictionary</h4>
            <p>Data Dictionary A data dictionary is a structured repository of data elements in the system. It stores the descriptions of all DFD data elements that is, details and definitions of data flows, data stores, data stored in data stores, and the processes.</p>
            <p>A data dictionary improves the communication between the analyst and the user. It plays an important role in building a database. Most DBMSs have a data dictionary as a standard feature. For example, refer the following table ‚Äì</p>
            <table border="1">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Sr.No.</th>
                  <th>Data Name</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
                  <th>No. of Characters</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>

                  <td>60</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>3</td>

            <h4>Decision Trees</h4>
            <p>Decision Trees Decision trees are a method for defining complex relationships by describing decisions and avoiding the problems in communication. A decision tree is a diagram that shows alternative actions and conditions within horizontal tree framework. Thus, it depicts which conditions to consider first, second, and so on.</p>
            <img src="../assets/diagrams/module6-decision-tree-example.svg" alt="Decision Tree Example Diagram" width="600" height="450">
            <p>Decision trees depict the relationship of each condition and their permissible actions. A square node indicates an action and a circle indicates a condition. It forces analysts to consider the sequence of decisions and identifies the actual decision that must be made.</p>
            <img src="../assets/images/module6-decision-tree-discount-example.png" alt="Decision Tree Discount Example" width="600" height="450">
            <p>For example, refer the following decision tree ‚Äì</p>
            <p>The major limitation of a decision tree is that it lacks information in its format to describe what other combinations of conditions you can take for testing. It is a single representation of the relationships between conditions and actions.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Decision Tables</h4>
            <p>Decision Tables Decision tables are a method of describing the complex logical relationship in a precise manner which is easily understandable.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is useful in situations where the resulting actions depend on the occurrence of one or several combinations of independent conditions.</li>
              <li>It is a matrix containing row or columns for defining a problem and the actions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Components of a Decision Table</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Condition Stub</strong> ‚Äì It is in the upper left quadrant which lists all the condition to be checked.</li>
              <li><strong>Action Stub</strong> - It is in the lower left quadrant which outlines all the action to be carried out to meet such condition.</li>
              <li><strong>Condition Entry</strong> - It is in upper right quadrant which provides answers to questions asked in condition stub quadrant.</li>
              <li><strong>Action Entry</strong> ‚Äì It is in lower right quadrant which indicates the appropriate action resulting from the answers to the conditions in the condition entry quadrant.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The entries in decision table are given by Decision Rules which define the relationships between combinations of conditions and courses of action. In rules section,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Y shows the existence of a condition.</li>
              <li>N represents the condition, which is not satisfied.</li>
              <li>A blank - against action states it is to be ignored.</li>
              <li>X (or a check mark will do) against action states it is to be carried out.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, refer the following table ‚Äì</p>
            <table border="1">
              <thead>
                <tr>

            <h4>Structured English</h4>
            <p>Structured English Structure English is derived from structured programming language which gives more understandable and precise description of process. It is based on procedural logic that uses construction and imperative sentences designed to perform operation for action.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is best used when sequences and loops in a program must be considered and the problem needs sequences of actions with decisions.</li>
              <li>It does not have strict syntax rule. It expresses all logic in terms of sequential decision structures and iterations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, see the following sequence of actions ‚Äì</p>
            <pre><code>if customer pays advance
then
  Give 5% Discount
else
  if purchase amount >=10,000
  then
    if the customer is a regular customer
    then Give 5% Discount
    else No Discount
    end if
  else No Discount
  end if
end if
</code></pre>

            <h4>Pseudo-code</h4>
            <p>Pseudo-code A pseudo-code does not conform to any programming language and expresses logic in plain English.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>It may specify the physical programming logic without actual coding during and after the physical design.</li>
              <li>It is used in conjunction with structured programming.</li>
              <li>It replaces the flowcharts of a program.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Guidelines for Selecting Appropriate Tools</h5>
            <p>Use the following guidelines for selecting the most appropriate tool that would suit your requirements ‚Äì</p>
            <ul>
