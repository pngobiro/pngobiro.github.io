        <section>
          <h3>Introduction to System Acquisition</h3>
          <p>System acquisition is to buy or obtain (a software) for oneself.</p>
          <p>"Acquire" can mean to purchase a package, have in-house information systems personnel develop it, hire a consultant, or develop it yourself.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Choices in Systems Acquisition</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>explain the differences among the alternatives methods; tailored (custom), system development, outsourcing, licensing ready-made software, contracting with an application service provider, and encouraging users to develop their own applications</li>
            <li>list the tradeoffs inherent in the various system acquisition methods</li>
            <li>describe which systems acquisition approach is appropriate for a particular set of circumstances</li>
            <li>discuss organizational policies on employee computer use</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Systems Acquisition Methods</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Purchased</strong> - Buying a ready-made software package</li>
            <li><strong>In-house developed</strong> ‚Äì A programmer making a custom based software to a client on contract</li>
            <li><strong>Outsourcing</strong> - an arrangement in which subject company haves a second company work on its behalf on an agreed pay.</li>
            <li><strong>Rental</strong> -using information system of a license agreement</li>
            <li><strong>User</strong> - Users customizing their system to suit their working.</li>
          </ol>
          <section>
            <h4>1) In-house developed custom software</h4>
            <h5>Advantages</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>It can be tailored to meet the exact needs of the business.</li>
              <li>It can be made to fit an organization's specific processes and organizational culture.</li>
              <li>It can be designed to fit well with other systems already in place.</li>
              <li>You will have developers with expertise available to maintain the system (if you can keep them).</li>
              <li>There is a potential for strategic advantage if competitors do not have access to your software.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>The development and maintenance costs are high.</li>
              <li>The development may take a long time and use resources you could be using elsewhere.</li>
              <li>Writing custom software may make it harder to interface with other organizations using more standard software.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>2) Outsourcing options</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>System development (hardware and/or software) - short term commitment</li>
              <li>Long term commitment (5-10 years) for one or more IS services/operations:
                <ul>
                  <li>Application development and maintenance</li>
                  <li>Hardware purchase and maintenance</li>
                  <li>Telecommunications equipment installation and maintenance</li>
                  <li>Help desk operation</li>
                  <li>Website design and maintenance</li>
                  <li>Training</li>
                  <li>Data storage and backup</li>
                  <li>Data processing</li>
                  <li>Transaction processing</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of these areas may be outsourced to a single vendor, some may be outsourced and some kept in-house, or different areas may be outsourced to different vendors.</p>
            <h5>Advantages</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed IS costs make better financial planning possible for the duration of the outsourcing contract</li>
              <li>Volume discounts negotiated by the vendor may result in lower software costs</li>
              <li>Organization's staff is able to concentrate on core business</li>
              <li>Reduced staff and fixed IT-related costs - fixed costs for vendor are spread over multiple clients so per-client cost is lower</li>
              <li>Higher experience level of vendor's employees can result in shorter implementation cycles</li>
              <li>Access to vendor expertise, consulting</li>
              <li>Improved handling of security due to experience</li>
              <li>Shorter development cycles for projects due to vendor experience and expertise</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Disadvantages /Risks of outsourcing</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Loss of control (especially risky in fast-changing areas, since contract may not support evolving needs)</li>
              <li>Loss of experienced employees (frequently IS employees are transferred to outsourcing vendor)</li>
              <li>Possible loss of competitive advantage</li>
              <li>Cost may be higher than expected, even higher than in-house</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are essential when outsourcing. The client must specify in detail what services are expected and the metrics to be used in assessing how well the vendor supplied those services.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>3) Purchased (ready-made) applications</h4>
            <p>Project management activities when considering ready-made packages</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify problem - high level functional requirements, major interfaces to other systems</li>
              <li>Identify potential vendors</li>
              <li>Request vendor information</li>
              <li>Define requirements; include what features are provided by which vendor</li>
              <li>Request proposals for the system from each vendor</li>
              <li>Review proposals and screen vendors</li>
              <li>Visit sites where the application is already in use</li>
              <li>Select vendor</li>
              <li>Benchmark selected product (before final commitment to purchase, and after system is implemented)</li>
              <li>Negotiate contract</li>
              <li>Implement system</li>
              <li>Manage post-implementation support</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Advantages:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Immediately available (though installation of enterprise software packages can take months)</li>
              <li>High quality (business imperative for vendor)</li>
              <li>Low price (development cost spread over multiple customers)</li>
              <li>Support available</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Enterprise software packages can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and installation can bring the cost to several million dollars.</p>
            <h5>Disadvantages /Risks of purchasing ready-made software</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>May not be a good match for organization's needs</li>
              <li>Vendor may go out of business</li>
              <li>High turnover of vendor personnel may negate any experience advantages</li>
              <li>UCITA gives vendors too much power</li>
              <li>Software licensing may increase costs of ownership</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>4) Software rental</h4>
            <p>Renting instead of buying software makes it less costly to upgrade to a new version. It also reduces the initial cost, which can be a barrier for small organizations.</p>
            <h5>ASPs (Application Service Provider)</h5>
            <p>ASPs provide a form of software rental; the software is installed on the ASP's system(s) and the client accessed the application over the Internet. The client's data files may be stored on the ASP's systems or on the client's computers. Advantages are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>No maintenance</li>
              <li>No hardware (on which to install the application)</li>
              <li>No need to hire installation and maintenance staff</li>
              <li>Available faster than in-house installation</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Disadvantages include:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Uncertain Internet response time</li>
              <li>Security risks (can be mitigated by using leased lines, at considerable cost)</li>
              <li>Lack of control</li>
              <li>Inability to make modifications (unless agreed to by the ASP)</li>
              <li>Instability of ASPs (many have only stayed in business a short time)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Given the uncertainty of the ASP market, there are a number of factors to investigate:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>History of the ASP; talk to other users</li>
              <li>Financial status of the ASP</li>
              <li>Pricing structure</li>
              <li>Hardware, software, and telecommunication facilities - uptime is a particularly important consideration. Look for "5 9's" (99.999%) uptime.</li>
              <li>Make sure contract contains penalties for ASP's failure to deliver and does NOT include penalties for early termination of the contract</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>User Application Development</h4>
            <p>Some applications can now simply be developed by those who want to use them, thanks to the widespread use of PCs and software that requires little programming expertise to product applications. This reduces the pressure on an IT staff already overloaded with projects.</p>
            <p>User application development is a good choice if:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>User has necessary skills</li>
              <li>The application is small</li>
              <li>The application is needed immediately</li>
              <li>The user can maintain the application</li>
              <li>The application is expected to have a short lifespan</li>
            </ul>
            <p>User application development is NOT a good idea if:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The application is large or complex</li>
              <li>The application interfaces to other systems</li>
              <li>The application is mission critical</li>
              <li>The application will be used longer than its developer will be available to maintain it</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Advantages of user application development are:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Rapid development</li>
              <li>Good match for user's needs</li>
              <li>Fits organizational culture</li>
              <li>Frees up IS staff and increases skills of others</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Disadvantages are:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Applications tend to be poorly developed</li>
              <li>Pockets of isolated information/private databases develop</li>
              <li>Duplication will occur</li>
              <li>There may be security issues not considered by the user</li>
              <li>Documentation is likely to be poor</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <h3>Criteria for choosing an IS acquisition method</h3>
          <p>Factors influencing choice of software Application includes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>User requirements: the selected software or package should fit user requirement as closely as possible</li>
            <li>Processing time: these involves the response time e.g. if the response time is slow the user might consider the software or package as unsuccessful</li>
            <li>Documentation: the software should be accompanied by manual, which is easy to understand by non-technical person. The manual should not contain technical jargon.</li>
            <li>User friendliness: the package should be easier to use with clear on screen prompts, menu driven and extensive on screen help facility</li>
            <li>Controls: the software should have in-built controls which may include password options, validation checks, audit trails or trace facilities etc</li>
            <li>Up-to-date: the software should be up-to-date e.g. should have changes or corrections in line with business procedures</li>
            <li>Modification: one should consider whether the user could freely change the software without violating copyright.</li>
            <li>Success in the market: one should consider how many users are using the software and how long it has been in the market</li>
            <li>Compatibility of the software: how the software integrates with other software particularly the operating system and the user programs</li>
            <li>Portability: one should consider how the software runs on the user computer and whether there will be need for the user to upgrade his hardware</li>
            <li>Cost: the user company should consider its financial position to establish whether it can afford the software required for efficient operations rather than the least cost package software available.</li>
