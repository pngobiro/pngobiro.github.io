        <section>
          <h3>Introduction to Feasibility Study</h3>
          <p>In case the system proposal is acceptable to the management, the next phase is to examine the feasibility of the system. The feasibility study is basically the test of the proposed system in the light of its workability, meeting user's requirements, effective use of resources and of course, the cost effectiveness. In the process of feasibility study, the cost and benefits are estimated with greater accuracy to find the Return on Investment (ROI). The result is a feasibility report submitted to the management.</p>
          <p>Feasibility Study can be considered as preliminary investigation that helps the management to take decision about whether study of system should be feasible for development or not.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It identifies the possibility of improving an existing system, developing a new system, and produce refined estimates for further development of system.</li>
            <li>It is used to obtain the outline of the problem and decide whether feasible or appropriate solution exists or not.</li>
            <li>The main objective of a feasibility study is to acquire problem scope instead of solving the problem.</li>
            <li>define the resources needed to complete the detailed investigation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The output of a feasibility study is a formal system proposal act as decision document which includes the complete nature and scope of the proposed system.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Steps Involved in Feasibility Analysis</h3>
          <p>The following steps are to be followed while performing feasibility analysis</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Form a project team and appoint a project leader.</li>
            <li>Develop system flowcharts.</li>
            <li>Identify the deficiencies of current system and set goals.</li>
            <li>Enumerate the alternative solution or potential candidate system to meet goals.</li>
            <li>Determine the feasibility of each alternative such as technical feasibility, operational feasibility, etc.</li>
            <li>Weight the performance and cost effectiveness of each candidate system.</li>
            <li>Rank the other alternatives and select the best candidate system.</li>
            <li>Prepare a system proposal of final project directive to management for approval.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Types of Feasibilities</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Economic feasibility</strong> - The likely benefits outweigh the cost of solving the problem which is generally demonstrated by a cost/ benefit analysis.
              <ul>
                <li>It is evaluating the effectiveness of candidate system by using cost/benefit analysis method.</li>
                <li>It demonstrates the net benefit from the candidate system in terms of benefits and costs to the organization.</li>
                <li>The main aim of Economic Feasibility Analysis (EFS) is to estimate the economic requirements of candidate system before investments funds are committed to proposal.</li>
                <li>It prefers the alternative which will maximize the net worth of organization by earliest and highest return of funds along with lowest level of risk involved in developing the candidate system.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Operational feasibility</strong> - Whether the problem can be solved in the user's environment with existing and proposed system workings?
              <ul>
                <li>It determines whether the system is operating effectively once it is developed and implemented.</li>
                <li>It ensures that the management should support the proposed system and its working feasible in the current organizational environment.</li>
                <li>It analyzes whether the users will be affected and they accept the modified or new business methods that affect the possible system benefits.</li>
                <li>It also ensures that the computer resources and network architecture of candidate system are workable.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Behavioral Feasibility</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>It evaluates and estimates the user attitude or behavior towards the development of new system.</li>
                <li>It helps in determining if the system requires special effort to educate, retrain, transfer, and changes in employee's job status on new ways of conducting business.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Schedule Feasibility</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>It ensures that the project should be completed within given time constraint or schedule.</li>
                <li>It also verifies and validates whether the deadlines of project are reasonable or not.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Technical feasibility</strong> - Whether the problem be solved using existing technology and resources available?
              <ul>
                <li>It investigates the technical feasibility of each implementation alternative.</li>
                <li>It analyzes and determines whether the solution can be supported by existing technology or not.</li>
                <li>The analyst determines whether current technical resources be upgraded or added it that fulfill the new requirements.</li>
                <li>It ensures that the candidate system provides appropriate responses to what extent it can support the technical enhancement.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Organizational feasibility</strong> ‚Äì Whether the proposed system is consistent with the organization's strategic objectives?</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Feasibility</strong> - investigates if the proposed system conflicts with legal requirements like data protection acts or social media laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Social feasibility</strong> ‚Äì Whether the problem be solved without causing any social issues? Whether the system will be acceptable to the society?</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Benefits of Conducting a Feasibility Study</h3>
          <p>Conducting a feasibility study is always beneficial to the project as it gives you and other stakeholders a clear picture of your idea. Below are the key benefits of conducting a feasibility study:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Gives project teams more focus and provides an alternative outline.</li>
            <li>Narrows the business alternatives.</li>
            <li>Identifies a valid reason to undertake the project.</li>
            <li>Enhances the success rate by evaluating multiple parameters.</li>
            <li>Aids decision-making on the project.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Apart from the approaches to feasibility study listed above, some projects also require for other constraints to be analyzed -</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Internal Project Constraints: Technical, Technology, Budget, Resource, etc.</li>
            <li>Internal Corporate Constraints: Financial, Marketing, Export, etc.</li>
            <li>External Constraints: Logistics, Environment, Laws and Regulations, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Feasibility Study Report (FSR)</h3>
          <p>What is a feasibility study report (FSR)? In simple terms, it's just a document that aims to identify, explore, and evaluate a project's solutions to save time and money. The following definition gives a broader understanding of the document:</p>
          <p>A Feasibility Study Report (FSR) is a formally documented output of feasibility study that summarizes results of the analysis and evaluations conducted to review the proposed solution and investigate project alternatives for the purpose of identifying if the project is really feasible, cost-effective and profitable. It describes and supports the most feasible solution applicable to the project.</p>
          <p>The report gives a brief description of the project and some background information. Formally this document is the starting point for running the Pre-Charter Sub-Phase. In practice, it signifies that the sponsor can proceed with deciding on project investment and make necessary assignments to the project manager.</p>
          <section>
            <h4>FSR Importance</h4>
            <p>The process to write the report is called feasibility study reporting. Often it is a responsibility of the project manager to control such a process. The importance of writing the report consists in providing legal and technical evidence of the project's vitality, sustainability and cost-effectiveness. The reporting process allows the senior management to get the necessary information required for making key decisions on budgeting and investment planning. A well-written feasibility study report template lets develop solutions for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Project Analysis because an example of FSR helps link project efficiency to budgeted costs.</li>
              <li>Risk Mitigation because it helps with contingency planning and risk treatment strategy development.</li>
              <li>Staff Training because the report can be used by senior management to identify staffing needs as well as acquire and train necessary specialists.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The process of reporting is the trigger to run the project investing process through underpinning the business case document, stating the reasons for undertaking the project, and analyzing project costs and benefits.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Steps to Writing a FSR Example</h4>
            <p>How to write a feasibility study report? Regardless of project size, scope and type, there are several key steps to writing such an important document. Let's view the steps in detail.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Write Project Description</strong><br>At this step, you need to collect background information on your project to write the description. For example, your company needs to increase online sales and promote your products/services on the Web. Then in the first part of your report you could write the next description:<br>"This project is website development to promote the products/services in Internet and increase online sales through encouraging customers to visit the website and make online bargains."</li>
              <li><strong>Describe Possible Solutions</strong><br>In order to take this step to write a feasibility study report template, you'll need to perform an alternatives analysis and make a description of possible solutions for your project. For example, in your FSR template your e-commence project might have the following solutions description:<br>"This project can be undertaken by the implementation of the two possible solutions: 1) Online Shop; 2) Corporate Website. Each of the solutions is carefully analyzed, and necessary information required for making the final decision is available for the management team."</li>
              <li><strong>List Evaluation Criteria</strong><br>Now it's time to set and define evaluation criteria for possible solutions. This step of feasibility study report writing requires you to investigate the solutions and put them against a set of evaluation criteria. For example, you could add the following criteria to your report:<br>"The possible solutions of this project are evaluated and compared by the following criteria: 1) Concept Spec.; 2) Content Audit; 3) Technical Design Spec.; 4) Launch Schedule & Time-frames."</li>
              <li><strong>Propose the Most Feasible Solution</strong><br>Once the criteria are used to evaluate the solutions, your next step for writing a feasibility study report is to determine the most economically reasonable and technically feasible solution which lets the company 1) keep to optimal use of project resources and 2) gain the best possible benefit. For example, your report might include:<br>"After the evaluation of the possible solutions, the most feasible solution for this project is identified and selected, so the project turns to be cost-effective, vital and practical."</li>
              <li><strong>Write Conclusion</strong><br>The final step of the feasibility study reporting process requires you to make a conclusion by summarizing the project's aim and stating the most feasible solution. For example, the conclusion of your FSR might be:<br>"This project's purpose is to develop a sophisticated and original design of the website that will contribute to online sales increasing, attract the target customer's attention, and be cost-effective. The most feasible solution for the project has been chosen and approved and now is ready for further elaboration."<br>Also, look at this <a href="#">Project Feasibility and Option Analysis Template</a> to find out how to perform an analysis of alternative approaches.</li>

          <section>
            <h4>Content Requirements for Sample Feasibility Report</h4>
            <p>The content of sample feasibility report is formatted and structured according to a range of requirements which may vary from organization to organization. Meanwhile, there are common suggestions, which are listed below.</p>
            <h5>Front Matter</h5>
            <p>To begin with writing a sample feasibility report, first you need to create a title page that provides a descriptive yet concise title, your (i.e. author's) name, email, job position, and also the organization for which you're writing the report. Next, you must include an itemized list of contents that provides headings and sub-headings sequenced the same way as they are structured in the report body. Also add a list of all material (tables, figures, illustrations, annexes) used within the doc. Remember that the title page shouldn't be numbered and that no more than 4-5 pages should be dedicated to the front matter.</p>
            <h5>Report Body Format</h5>
            <p>Because there are many different styles and requirements for formatting the body of feasibility study report, it may be difficult for you to select right format for your report, so I suggest you discuss this issue with your curator or supervisor who should provide you with right styling and format requirements.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, there are several common suggestions as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each page of the report body needs to include a descriptive header with an abbreviated title for the report, the author's name and page number (at the right top)</li>
              <li>Structure the report by headings and sub-headings and indicate this structure within the document content</li>
              <li>Make sure headings are properly formatted (i.e., flush left, indented, etc.) on each page</li>
              <li>Use the same style for headings throughout the entire report template</li>
              <li>Never use too larger or too small font (font should have a professional look, 10-12 point)</li>
              <li>Use the same citation style (e.g., CBE, APA, etc.) for formatting sources used in your feasibility study template</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Report Template Sections</h5>
            <p>The following list provides an outline of the key sections to be included in report content:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Executive Summary - a description of the problem/opportunity highlighted in the study, the purpose of the report, and the importance of the research for your target audience</li>
              <li>Background - a more detailed description of the feasibility study, who it was carried out, and whether it was implemented elsewhere</li>
              <li>Analysis - an examination and evaluation method employed in the conducting your feasibility study</li>
              <li>Alternatives and Options ‚Äì an overview of any alternative proposals or options and their features in comparison to the main proposal of the study</li>
              <li>Cost-Benefit Evaluation a rigorous analysis method that was implemented to examine and evaluate the main proposal for cost-benefit effectiveness and to demonstrate the tech feasibility, economic practicality, social desirability, and eco soundness of the proposal.</li>
              <li>Conclusion - a summary of the work done and your own conclusions regarding your analysis</li>
              <li>Recommendations - a series of recommendations practices and follow-up actions based on your conclusions</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Back Matter</h5>
            <p>One last thing you need to consider when writing your feasibility study report template is that the report should include a Reference page that lists all reference material (articles, books, web pages, periodicals, reports, etc.) cited in your document. This page should be styled appropriately.</p>
            <p>Additionally, you can create an Appendix page that provides detailed discussions of all criteria used in analyzing feasibility and examples of each criterion. This page should also be styled appropriately.</p>

          <h3>Fact finding methods/Techniques</h3>
          <section>
            <h4>Information Gathering Techniques:</h4>
            <p>The main aim of fact finding techniques is to determine the information requirements of an organization used by analysts to prepare a precise Information Resource Specification (SRS) understood by user.</p>
            <p>Ideal SRS Document should ‚Äì</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be complete, Unambiguous, and Jargon-free.</li>
              <li>Specify operational, tactical, and strategic information requirements.</li>
              <li>Solve possible disputes between users and analyst.</li>
              <li>Use graphical aids which simplify understanding and design.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are various information gathering techniques ‚Äì</p>
            <section>
              <h5>Interviewing</h5>
              <p>Systems analyst collects information from individuals or groups by interviewing. The analyst can be formal, legalistic, play politics, or be informal; as the success of an interview depends on the skill of analyst as interviewer.</p>
              <p>It can be done in two ways ‚Äì</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Unstructured Interview</strong> ‚Äì The system analyst conducts question-answer session to acquire basic information of the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Structured Interview</strong> ‚Äì It has standard questions which user need to respond in either close (objective) or open (descriptive) format.</li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Advantages of Interviewing</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>This method is frequently the best source of gathering qualitative information.</li>
                <li>It is useful for them, who do not communicate effectively in writing or who may not have the time to complete questionnaire.</li>
                <li>Information can easily be validated and cross checked immediately.</li>
                <li>It can handle the complex subjects.</li>

              </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h5>Questionnaires</h5>
              <p>This method is used by analyst to gather information about various issues of system from large number of persons.</p>
              <p>There are two types of questionnaires ‚Äì</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Open-ended Questionnaires</strong> ‚Äì It consists of questions that can be easily and correctly interpreted. They can explore a problem and lead to a specific direction of answer.</li>
                <li><strong>Closed-ended Questionnaires</strong> ‚Äì It consists of questions that are used when the systems analyst effectively lists all possible responses, which are mutually exclusive.</li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Advantages of questionnaires</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>It is very effective in surveying interests, attitudes, feelings, and beliefs of users which are not co-located.</li>
                <li>It is useful in situation to know what proportion of a given group approves or disapproves of a particular feature of the proposed system.</li>
                <li>It is useful to determine the overall opinion before giving any specific direction to the system project.</li>
                <li>It is more reliable and provides high confidentiality of honest responses.</li>
                <li>It is appropriate for electing factual information and for statistical data collection which can be emailed and sent by post.</li>

              <h5>Review of Records, Procedures, and Forms</h5>
              <p>Review of existing records, procedures, and forms helps to seek insight into a system which describes the current system capabilities, its operations, or activities.</p>
              <h6>Advantages</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>It helps user to gain some knowledge about the organization or operations by themselves before they impose upon others.</li>
                <li>It helps in documenting current operations within short span of time as the procedure manuals and forms describe the format and functions of present system.</li>
                <li>It can provide a clear understanding about the transactions that are handled in the organization, identifying input for processing, and evaluating performance.</li>
                <li>It can help an analyst to understand the system in terms of the operations that must be supported.</li>
                <li>It describes the problem, its affected parts, and the proposed solution.</li>

            <h3>Data Collection Tools</h3>
            <section>
              <h5>Case Studies</h5>
              <p>Case Studies, A case study is usually an in-depth description of a process, experience, or structure at a single institution. In order to answer a combination of ‚Äòwhat' and ‚Äòwhy' questions, case studies generally involve a mix of quantitative (i.e., surveys, usage statistics, etc.) and qualitative (i.e., interviews, focus groups, extant document analysis, etc.) data collection techniques. Most often, the researcher will analyze quantitative data first and then use qualitative strategies to look deeper into the meaning of the trends identified in the numerical data.</p>

              <h5>Checklists</h5>
              <p>Checklists, Checklists structure a person's observation or evaluation of a performance or artifact. They can be simple lists of criteria that can be marked as present or absent, or can provide space for observer comments. These tools can provide consistency over time or between observers. Checklists can be used for evaluating databases, virtual IM service, the use of library space, or for structuring peer observations of instruction sessions.</p>

              <h5>Interviews, In-Depth Interviews</h5>
              <p>Interviews, In-Depth Interviews include both individual interviews (e.g., one-on-one) as well as ‚Äúgroup‚Äù interviews (including focus groups). The data can be recorded in a wide variety of ways including stenography, audio recording, video recording or written notes. In depth interviews differ from direct observation primarily in the nature of the interaction. In interviews it is assumed that there is a questioner and one or more interviewees. The purpose of the interview is to probe the ideas of the interviewees about the phenomenon of interest.</p>

              <h5>Observation</h5>
              <p>Observation Sometimes, the best way to collect data through observation. This can be done directly or indirectly with the subject knowing or unaware that you are observing them. You may choose to collect data through continuous observation or via set time periods depending on your project. You may interpret data you gather using the following mechanisms:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Descriptive observations: you simply write down what you observe</li>
                <li>Inferential observations: you may write down an observation that is inferred by the subject's body language and behavior.</li>
                <li>Evaluative observation: You may make an inference and therefore a judgment from the behavior. Make sure you can replicate these findings.</li>
              </ol>

              <h5>Surveys or Questionnaires</h5>
              <p>Surveys or questionnaires are instruments used for collecting data in survey research. They usually include a set of standardized questions that explore a specific topic and collect information about demographics, opinions, attitudes, or behaviors. Three popular programs that allow you to create online surveys are Google Forms, Survey Monkey, and Poll Everywhere. A great (low-cost) tool for reference statistics is Gimlet.</p>

            <h3>Data Analysis Tools</h3>
            <p>Use the following tools to collect or analyze data:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Box and Whisker Plot:</strong> A tool used to display and analyze multiple sets of variation data on a single graph.</li>
              <li><strong>Check sheet:</strong> A generic tool that can be adapted for a wide variety of purposes, the check sheet is a structured, prepared form for collecting and analyzing data.</li>
              <li><strong>Control chart:</strong> A graph used to study how a process changes over time. Comparing current data to historical control limits leads to conclusions about whether the process variation is consistent (in control) or is unpredictable (out of control, affected by special causes of variation).</li>
              <li><strong>Design of experiments:</strong> A method for carrying out carefully planned experiments on a process. Usually, design of experiments involves a series of experiments that start by looking broadly at a great many variables and then focus on the few critical ones.</li>
              <li><strong>Histogram:</strong> The most commonly used graph for showing frequency distributions, or how often each different value in a set of data occurs.</li>
              <li><strong>Scatter diagram:</strong> A diagram that graphs pairs of numerical data, one variable on each axis, to look for a relationship.</li>
              <li><strong>Stratification:</strong> A technique that separates data gathered from a variety of sources so that patterns can be seen.</li>
              <li><strong>Survey:</strong> Data collected from targeted groups of people about their opinions, behavior or knowledge.</li>
            </ol>
