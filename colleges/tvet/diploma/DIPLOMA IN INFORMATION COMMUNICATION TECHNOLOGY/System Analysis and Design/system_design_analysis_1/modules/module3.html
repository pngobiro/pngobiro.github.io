          <h3>Introduction and Definitions</h3>
          <p>A methodology is a standard process followed in an organization to conduct all the steps necessary to analyze, design, and maintain information systems.</p>
          <p>Techniques are particular processes that you, as an analyst, will follow to help ensure that your work is well throughout, complete and comprehensive to others on your project team.</p>
          <p>Techniques provide support for a wide range of tasks such as conducting thorough interviews, planning and managing project activities.</p>
          <p>Tools are typically computer programs that make it easy and benefit from the techniques and follow the methodology.</p>
          <p>The System Design Methodologies includes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Systems Development life cycle (SDLC)</li>
            <li>Structured Analysis and Structured Design (SASD)</li>
            <li>Object ‚Äì Oriented Analysis and Design</li>
            <li>Jackson System Development.</li>

          <h3>Meaning of SDLC</h3>
          <section>
            <h4>Definition:</h4>
            <p>A systems development life cycle (SDLC) is a systematic and orderly approach to solving system problems so referred to as The Water Fall Methodology.</p>
            <p>A conceptual model used in project management that describes the stages involved in an information system development project, from an initial feasibility study through maintenance of the completed application.</p>
            <p>The system development project meaning and direction is given by the system analyst. A candidate system is approached after the analyst has a thorough understanding of user needs and problems, has developed as viable solution to these problems, and then communicates the solution through the installation of a candidate system.</p>

          <section>
            <h4>System Development</h4>
            <p>System Development refers to the process of ‚Äì examining a business situation with the intent of improving it through better procedures and methods.</p>
            <p>System Development is having two major components in it</p>
            <ul>
              <li>System Analysis ‚Äì Analysis of current system for Problems & Demerits in it and Additional requirements in new system</li>
              <li>System Design ‚Äì Process of planning new system which will replace the old one</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Beginning of a System Development:</h4>
            <p>System Development usually begins when a problem or opportunity is identified by Managers, it can be because of any of the followings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>New design idea to smoothen the process in the organization.</li>
              <li>Evolving environmental changes such as Competition.</li>
              <li>Adding new business or product line to present business.</li>
              <li>Present system does not satisfy the users information needs.</li>
              <li>Present system no longer efficiently and effectively meets the Goals of organization.</li>
              <li>Excessive time spent in correcting errors.</li>
              <li>Current Reports / Outputs not meting users decision making skills.</li>
              <li>Escalating customer and vendor complaints.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>System Development Methodology:</h4>
            <p>A system development life cycle is a logical method of system development. Where as a methodology is the physical implementation of that logical life cycle including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>step-by-step activities for each phase</li>
              <li>individual /group roles to be played in each activity</li>
              <li>deliverables and quality standards for each activity</li>
              <li>tools and techniques to be used for each activity</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Why do we use methodologies?</h4>
            <p>To ensure that a consistent, reproducible approach is applied to all projects ‚Äì systematic approach reduce the risk associated with shortcuts and mistakes produce complete and consistent documentation from one project to the next able to incorporate the use of several development tools and techniques.</p>
            <p>A system development methodology is a very formal and precise system development process which defines a set of activities, methods, best practices, deliverables, and automated tools for system developers and project managers to use to develop and maintain information systems and software.</p>
            <p>A system development methodology is a formalized, standardized, documented set of activities used to manage a system development project. It can be characterized as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>DIVISION OF PROJECT into the identifiable phases which can be managed without having any problem.</li>
              <li>REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT PROCESS by TOP Management on periodically by getting deliverables.</li>
              <li>APPROVALS from all the participants of the Development (i.e. Users, Managers, Analyst and Auditors).</li>
              <li>TESTING OF SYSTEM thoroughly prior to implementation to ensure that it meets user's needs.</li>
              <li>TRANNING of user who will operate the new system.</li>
              <li>POST IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW for effectiveness and efficiency of new system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Different types of system development methodologies are used in designing information system. Depending upon the actual requirement of the system, different approaches for data processing are adopted. However, some system groups recommend the Centralized data processing system while others may go in for distributed data processing system. In a Centralized data processing, one or more centralized computers are used for processing and the retrieval of information is done from them. The distributed processing systems involve number of computers located remotely in the branches/departments of the organization. The client/server technologies are also gaining popularity these days.</p>

          <h3>SDLC stages</h3>
          <p>A systematic approach to problem solving and is made up of several phases, each comprised of multiple steps. System development life cycle means combination of various activities. In other words we can say that various activities put together are referred as system development life cycle.</p>
          <p>Following are the different phases of system development life cycle:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Preliminary Investigation</li>
            <li>System Analysis or Requirement Analysis</li>
            <li>System Design</li>
            <li>Development of Software</li>
            <li>System Testing</li>
            <li>Implementation</li>
            <li>Maintenance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The different phases of system development life cycle is shown in the below figure</p>

          <p>The SDLC phases/stages may loop back to immediate stage before as input for redeveloping the system.</p>
