        <section>
          <h3>Introduction to System Documentation</h3>
          <p><strong>System documentation:</strong> The collection of documents that describes the requirements, capabilities, limitations, design, operation, and maintenance of a system, such as a communications, computing, or information processing system.</p>
          <p><strong>Software documentation</strong> is written text that accompanies computer software. It either explains how it operates or how to use it, or may mean different things to people in different roles.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Importance of system documentation</h3>
          <p>One of the benefits of software system documentation is that we can preserve the history of the systems at different cycles and in turn facilitate the use of it by the users and maintainers. The latter are those who are in position to bring to-date documentation. Basically, the objective of documentation is to teach, those unfamiliar with the system, how it is structured, how it works, and what are the design motifs. Additionally, software documentation facilitates interpretation of the system.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Benefits of efficient documentation procedures</h3>
          <p>Your documentation procedures, if carried out correctly, should achieve the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>provide evidence of your system deliverable as documented;</li>
            <li>ensure that management is aware of scope of system undertaking in relation to documented capability;</li>
            <li>assist with continuous improvement of the system;</li>
            <li>demonstrate a commitment to continuous improvement in performance of the company;</li>
            <li>enable a more effective performance; and</li>
            <li>Ensure review of individual users performance and capacity building.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Types of documentation</h3>
          <p>Types of documentation include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Requirements</strong> - Statements that identify attributes capabilities, characteristics, or qualities of a system. This is the foundation for what shall be or has been implemented.</li>
            <li><strong>Architecture/Design</strong> - Overview of software. Includes relations to an environment and construction principles to be used in design of software components.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical</strong> - Documentation of code, algorithms, interfaces, and APIs.</li>
            <li><strong>End user</strong> - Manuals for the end-user, system administrators and support staff.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing</strong> - How to market the product and analysis of the market demand.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Documentation is often divided into the following categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Installation:</strong> Describes how to install a program or device but not how to use it.</li>
            <li><strong>Reference:</strong> Detailed descriptions of particular items presented in alphabetical order. Reference documentation is designed for people who are already somewhat familiar with the product but need reminders or very specific information about a particular topic.</li>
            <li><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Teaches a user how to use the product. Tutorials move at a slower pace than reference manuals and generally contain less detail.</li>
          </ul>
