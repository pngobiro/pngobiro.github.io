        <h2>üìö CHAPTER 2: SYSTEMS THEORY/CONCEPT</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Systems theory/concept explained</h3>
          <h4>Definition of System</h4>
          <p>A system is a set of elements or components that interact to accomplish goals. The term System is derived from the Greek word systƒìma which means a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. In simpler terms, a system is an organized relationship among functioning unit's or components.</p>
          <p>With reference to a business organization system or specifically a business system is a group of interrelated procedures used for a business function, with an identifiable boundary, working together for some purpose.</p>
          <p>A system can be defined in many ways. Some of these include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole.</li>
            <li>An organized set of doctrines, ideas, or principles, usually intended to explain the arrangements or working of a systematic whole.</li>
            <li>An organized or established procedure.</li>
            <li>An organized society or social situation regarded as stultifying establishment.</li>
            <li>A System is a set of related components that produces specific results.</li>
            <li>An organization consisting of interrelated departments or subsystems for carrying out specific business objectives is a business system.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>System Concept Implications</h4>
          <p>We can observe three implications from the concept of system. They are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A system must be designed to achieve some set objectives.</li>
            <li>Interrelationships & interdependence must exist among the components of the system.</li>
            <li>The objectives of the organization i.e the system must have a higher priority than that of the subsystems.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Characteristics of a system</h4>
          <p>Systems have five important characteristics namely organization, interaction, interdependence, integration and central objective.</p>
          <section>
            <h5>Organization</h5>
            <p>The term organization here implies to the structure & order of the system. It can be viewed as the arrangement of components that help to achieve the goals and objectives. It is a collection of one or more subsystems.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Interaction</h5>
            <p>A system many have many subsystems / components. The way in which each component functions with other components is called interaction.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Interdependence</h5>
            <p>Some or all components or subsystems of the system may be dependent on one another. They may be coordinated & linked together according to some plan. In simpler terms, if the output of one subsystem is input for the proper functioning of another subsystem, then the second subsystems is said to be interdependent on first. This interdependence may continue like a chain with in a system.</p>
            <p>For example the outcome of the raw material unit of a firm i.e the processed raw material may be input to the production unit. The finished products manufactured by production unit may be input to testing unit and so on.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Integration</h5>
            <p>The term integration refers to the holism of system. It tells how different subsystem or components are tied together to form a system .It also implies how the different parts of system work together within the system even though each part performs a unique function.</p>
            <p>For a Manufacturing firm to produce required products with a very good quality and at a reasonable price, all other subunits like procurement, production, finance, quality control & testing and sales must work with coordination.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Central Objective</h5>
            <p>Objectives are the main goals / aim to be achieved through the system. The systems exists to achieve or to help achieve these objectives. Objectives may be real or stated. Objectives may be long-term objectives or short-term objectives.</p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Components/elements of a system</h3>
          <p>A systems consists of the following elements,</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Input</li>
            <li>Processing</li>
            <li>Output</li>
            <li>Boundary</li>
            <li>Environment</li>
            <li>Components</li>
          </ul>
          <section>
            <h5>Input:</h5>
            <p>A system may accept input from within its boundary or from the environment. For example, in a manufacturing firm, the production unit may get raw materials from the procurement section which is a part of the system i.e. a subsystem (within the system boundary) or directly from the raw material supplier which is outside the system i.e. environment.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Output:</h5>
            <p>Any system that has an intended set of inputs with certain processing yields output. This output may be used by any subsystems or by the environment. Consider the same manufacturing scenario, the production unit may deliver finished products to the sales unit, a subsystem or directly delivery to the wholesalers / retailers i.e. to environment.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Processing:</h5>
            <p>Data to be converted into information should undergo a transformation process. Similarly, inputs that need to be converted into a desirable output should undergo the processing.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>System boundary:</h5>
            <p>System boundary is a delimiter, which divides or separates the system from the environment.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Environment:</h5>
            <p>Anything outside system boundary is environment.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>Components:</h5>
            <p>The subsystems/ subparts of a system operating independently are called the components of a system. There may be association between to or more components of a system like finance unit and sales unit of a manufacturing firm. Such an association is called interrelationship. Interaction between two or more components requires an interface to be used.</p>
          </section>
          <p>The following figure 2.1 illustrates the different view of basic elements of a system.</p>

          <h3>Types of systems</h3>
          <p>There are numerous types of systems that exist and we also come across them in our day-to-day life. Systems may be classified into different types. Normally all the systems are categorized into two categories namely natural systems and man-made systems.</p>
          <section>
            <h4>Natural systems</h4>
            <p>There are thousands of systems that exist in nature. We can further classify natural systems into two basic subcategories namely, physical systems and living systems.</p>
            <section>
              <h5>Physical systems include diverse systems like</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Stellar systems: galaxies, solar systems, etc.</li>
                <li>Geological systems: rivers, mountain ranges, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h5>Living systems encompass all of the animals, plants and human beings. The living systems, whether at the level of the cell, the organ, the organism, the group, the organization, the society, or the supranational system, all consists of around 19 subsystems. Some of these include the boundary, the distributor, the converter, the producer, the extruder, the channel and net, the decoder, the memory, etc.</h5>
            </section>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Man-made systems</h4>
            <p>Man-made systems are the systems developed to support the human working ability. Some of the man made systems include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Social systems: organizations of laws, doctrines, customs, etc.</li>
              <li>Transportation systems: networks of highways, canals and airlines.</li>
              <li>Communication systems: telephone, telex and messaging system</li>
              <li>Manufacturing systems: factories, assembly lines, etc.</li>
              <li>Financial systems: accounting, inventory, general ledger and so on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Today because of technology advancements, we can observe that most of these systems include computers. However there are still some systems may not being automated because of reasons like cost, convenience, security, maintainability and politics.</p>
            <p>Most of the man-made systems, including computer systems can interact with physical systems and living systems. In some cases, automated systems are being designed to replace living systems. And in some cases living systems are considered as components of automated systems.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Automated systems</h4>
            <p>Automated systems are the man-made systems that interact with or are controlled by one or more computers. Although many different kinds of automated systems exists, they all have some of the common components like hardware, software, people, data and procedures.</p>
            <p>Automated systems can be classified in many ways. One simplest way of categorizing is by application. But, such a classification is not useful because techniques like analyzing, modeling, designing and implementing automated systems are generally the same regardless of the application. A more useful categorization of automated systems is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Batch system: In a batch system the information is usually retrieved on a sequential basis, i.e the computer system read through all the records in its database, processing and updating those records for which there is some activity.</li>
              <li>On-line systems: An on-line system is one, which accepts input directly from the user or environment where it is used and also returns outputs or results of computation directly to where they are required.</li>
              <li>Real-time systems: A real-time system may be defined as one which controls an environment by receiving data, processing them, and returning the results sufficiently quickly to affect the environment at that time.</li>
              <li>Decision-support systems: These computer systems that help managers and other knowledge workers in an organization make intelligent, informed decisions about various aspects of the operation. Typically, the decision-support systems do not operate on a regular basis. Instead, they are used on an adhoc basis, whenever needed.</li>
              <li>Knowledge-based systems: The goal of computer scientists working in the field of artificial intelligence is to produce programs that imitate human performance in a wide variety of intelligent tasks. For some expert systems, that goal is close to being attained. For others, although we do not yet know how to construct programs that perform well on their own, we can begin to build programs that significantly assist people in their performance of a task.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Systems principles</h3>
          <p>There are a few general principles or guidelines that are of particular interest to people building automated information systems. They include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>If a system is more specialized then it is less flexible i.e., the ability of a system to be adapted to different circumstances is very less.</li>
            <li>If a system is more general-purpose then it is less optimized for a particular situation. But the more the system is optimized for a particular situation, the less adaptable it will be to new circumstances</li>
            <li>If a system is very large then maintenance is a tedious process.</li>
            <li>Systems can be part of larger systems and they can always be partitioned into smaller subsystems. Systems can be scalable. However, this principle could not be true for all systems.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Classification of systems</h3>
          <p>Systems can also divided/classified as</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Physical or abstract</li>
            <li>Open or closed</li>
          </ul>
          <section>
            <h4>Physical systems</h4>
            <p>Physical systems are tangible entities that may be static or dynamic in operation. For example, physical parts of the computer center like computers, desks, and chairs that facilitate operation of the computer can be seen and counted. Such systems are static physical systems. A programmed computer in which data, programs, output and applications change as the user's demand is dynamic physical system.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Abstract systems</h4>
            <p>Abstract systems are conceptual or nonphysical entities. They may be formulas of relationship among sets of variables or models i.e. the abstract conceptualization of physical situations. A model is an easier way of visualizing relationships in the system under study.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Open system</h4>
            <p>Open systems is a system having an interface with environment. It permits interaction across its boundary. It receives inputs from within the system or from the environment and delivers outputs the system or environment.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Closed system</h4>
            <p>A closed system is one that does not interface with its environment, i.e. it has no input or output. The concept of closed systems is more relevant to scientific systems than to social systems. Closed systems are isolated from environmental influences. A completely closed system is rare in reality. A chemical reaction in a sealed, insulated container is an closed system.</p>
            <p>Relatively closed systems are special type of closed system, which is less relaxed when compared to closed systems. They are used in organizations and in information processing, where systems are relatively isolated from the environment, but are not completely closed. For example, a computer program with predefined input, a process and an output is a relatively closed system.</p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Other Classification</h3>
          <p>They are classified according to a hierarchy of properties of the system.</p>
          <section>
            <h4>Deterministic Systems (Mechanistic Systems)</h4>
            <p>These are the systems that function according to some predetermined procedure and have results and future behavior predicted with certainty provided they are working correctly and under control. A system may be classified as deterministic if it is possible to predetermine the stages or steps through which it would pass. It is possible to examine the system and predict the next stage from the present one. However, an unexpected mode of working may develop as a result of errors or excessive weakness in which the case the system becomes probabilistic rather than deterministic.</p>
            <p>Examples include - the working of computer program, the behavior of the planet in orbit, or business systems have a variety of uncertainties e.g. customer behavior.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Probabilistic Systems (Stochastic Systems)</h4>
            <p>These are those systems whose state and behaviour can be predicted only within certain limits, even when they're under control. Although some of these states in these systems may be predicted from previous states, they can be described only in terms of probable behaviour. Example, the inventory systems, average stock, average demand, average replenishment time may be predicted but exact values of those factors any instance may not be known.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Cybernetic system (Self Organizing/ Adaptive)</h4>
            <p>These are systems that have to adapt to their environments/ react to stimuli, they learn from their mistakes, so that they do not always react in the same way to a particular input. Examples are the social systems, organizations, plants.</p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Classification of properties</h3>
          <section>
            <h4>Hard Property - Most business or organizational problems can be defined in terms of information with both hard and soft properties. Whatever sector we work in, some of the issues we face can be precisely measured, for example the cost of an item, the strength of a particular piece of material, or the number of employees in our organisation ‚Äì and the answer is not conditioned by the measurer's sense of value. This data is said to have hard properties</h4>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Soft Property - On the other hand, some issues are not capable of such precise measurement, and the assessment contains at least an element of judgement or is subjective in some way. Information such as whether a material looks attractive, whether we should recruit a particular person or what the average rate of price inflation will be over the next 10 years is subjective and we say that it has soft properties.</h4>
            <p>Needless to say these definitions can get blurred. For example, when we are measuring absences from the workplace, whether someone is absent or not would appear to be clear cut and not a matter of judgement, so we might be inclined to consider this information as having hard properties.</p>
