        <h2>üìö CHAPTER 12: ICT PROJECT MANAGEMENT</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Introduction to Project management</h3>
          <p>A project typically involves a group of resources that are dedicated to performing a series of inter-related activities that are planned and then executed in a certain sequence to create a unique product or service within a defined start and finish time frame.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Meaning Project Management</h3>
          <p>According to the Project Management Institute, project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to a broad range of activities in order to meet or exceed stakeholder needs and expectations from a project.</p>
          <p>Project Management ensures that the available resources are used in the most effective and efficient manner to support the successful attainment of the project goals and objectives. It is the application of a combination of tools and techniques that assist to assure the attainment of the project schedule, resources and quality attributes.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Key objectives of Project Management</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Active projects and projects to be initiated are based on a business rationale and are appropriately authorized.</li>
            <li>Projects are managed and steered to achieve the specified goals on schedule, on budget and at the required level of quality.</li>
            <li>Transition of project deliverables to production and deployment are performed in a controlled manner</li>
            <li>Project benefits are realized.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Project Management Tools</h3>
          <p>Project management is a challenging task with many complex responsibilities. Fortunately, there are many tools available to assist with accomplishing the tasks and executing the responsibilities. Some require a computer with supporting software, while others can be used manually. Project managers should choose a project management tool that best suits their management style. No one tool addresses all project management needs. Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) and Gantt Charts are two of the most commonly used project management tools. Both of these project management tools can be produced manually or with commercially available project management software (MS Project).</p>
          <p>PERT is a planning and control tool used for defining and controlling the tasks necessary to complete a project. PERT charts and Critical Path Method (CPM) charts are often used interchangeably; the only difference is how task times are computed. Both charts display the total project with all scheduled tasks shown in sequence. The displayed tasks show which ones are in parallel, those tasks that can be performed at the same time. A graphic representation called a "Project Network" or "CPM Diagram" is used to portray graphically the interrelationships of the elements of a project and to show the order in which the activities must be performed.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Project Evaluation</h3>
          <p>Evaluation is a systematic and objective assessment of an ongoing or completed project, programme or policy, its design, implementation and results. The aim is to determine the relevance and fulfillment of objectives, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability - as set out in the Evaluation Policy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Criteria for Evaluating New Projects</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Breadth</strong> - How many people does this project affect? What is the impact on the subject affected?</li>
            <li><strong>Audience</strong> - What groups and/or which individuals will benefit the most from this project? Will this project negatively affect anyone?</li>
            <li><strong>Stakeholders</strong> - Outside of those listed as sponsors, who are the people or groups of people who will have an interest in seeing this project carried out successfully?</li>
            <li><strong>Role of steers</strong> ‚Äì Will subject staff play a supportive or a central role in this project? Who will be the project team members from outside of sponsor team, and what will be their roles? What will be required from OIT staff after the technology has been implemented? Will there be ongoing maintenance? Do we have the people, equipment, and/or money to support it?</li>
            <li><strong>Appropriateness</strong> - In what way does the project further the strategic initiatives set forth by the University? Or, in what way does the project improve the efficiency of the University's operations?</li>
            <li><strong>Criticality</strong> - How critical is the project in carrying out the University's strategic initiatives, or in terms of effectiveness of the University's operations? Describe the current process or activity in use, and compare the level of effectiveness with the process or activity that will replace it.</li>
            <li><strong>Risks</strong> ‚Äì Possible risks could include: Design errors and omissions, scope change, launch date delay, cost changes/budget limitations/unpredicted expenses, limited scalability, skill/knowledge mismatch, change in priorities, coordination among departments, competitor actions. What is the extent of the problem(s) that could occur? What is the probability that it (they) would occur, and what would the impact be on the project? What could be done to address the problem(s)?</li>
            <li><strong>Impact on other projects</strong> - What is the impact on other projects? Is it a positive or negative impact?</li>
            <li><strong>Relation to other projects</strong> - How is this project related to other projects? Does it make more sense to integrate it with another project?</li>
            <li><strong>Payback</strong> - Does this project have a measurable payback? How do we measure it? What is the ROI?</li>
            <li><strong>Expertise</strong> - Can the work be done in house? Will we need to hire an outside contractor? If so, who will do the hiring, contracting, and oversee the work that needs to be done? Who will pay for the work?</li>
            <li><strong>Level of Effort</strong> - How long will it take to complete the project?</li>
            <li><strong>Funding</strong> ‚Äì Where is the funding coming from? Is it currently available? Does it cover maintenance, cost of operations, and administrative costs?</li>
            <li><strong>Deadline</strong> - Is the deadline realistic? Can all areas contribute the necessary resources within the given timeframe?</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>IT project failure: symptoms and reasons</h3>
          <p>We spend more than $250 billion each year on IT application development, statistically, 31% of projects will be cancelled before they ever get completed., 53% of projects will cost twice as of their original estimates, overall, the success rate is less than 30%.Why did the project fail? From symptom to root cause -what are the major factors that cause software projects to fail? What are the key ingredients that can reduce project failure?</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>IT Project Success Definition</strong><br>Stakeholder satisfaction, timely delivery and staying within budget top the list of measures that indicate a project's success, the other success factors such as: quality, acceptable ROI, whether it achieves result that are in line with strategic objectives.</li>
            <li><strong>IT Project Failure Definition</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>The project impaired:</strong> The project is cancelled at some point during the development</li>
                <li><strong>The project challenged:</strong> The project is completed and operational but over-budget, over the time estimate, and offers fewer features and functions than originally specified.</li>
                <li><strong>The project devalued:</strong> IT projects are always done in the current environment and so the effect on users such as ‚Äúpush back‚Äù needs to be carefully considered, the project is not defined specifically, measurably, consistently and dynamically, to reflect the continuous change</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ten Root Causes of IT Projects Fail</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Business purpose of project is not well-defined and communicated. :</strong>every IT project is the business project, clear-defined project purpose need well describe the business problems need be solved or the strategic vision need be implemented.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Plan is lack of structure or detail,</strong> such as project management model, technical solution, resources, skills. Poor planning (not allocating time to design, testing and requirements gathering), do not capture the essential of the old adage "if you fail to plan you must plan to fail‚Äù. And need remember the 5 P's: Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance. 90% planning, 10% implementation.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of executive support:</strong> compete priorities across various stakeholders. The politics & power play in an organization has a lot to bring to the table in the success potential of a project, specially when it impacts multiple stakeholders high up in the organizational ladder, potentially competing with each other & having conflicting priorities for the project & overall running of the organization. "Probably 90% of application project failure is due to politics!"</li>
                <li><strong>Poor execution:</strong> the failures exist because there are humans in the process. And humans make mistakes, cut corners, and never have unlimited access to all the information they need at every step in the process to make a perfect decision, over promising and under delivering by the vendor, lack of quality project management not follow the 3C Rules (communication, coordination & collaboration).</li>
                <li><strong>Over specification:</strong> trying to cover every minute detail in an initial release - almost always results in a system which very quickly becomes obsolete because operational processes will always change once a new system is introduced</li>
                <li><strong>Failure to adopt and adhere to a suitable project methodology.</strong> Using waterfall in an organization where the business has an agile mentality leads to failure. Using Agile without a full sense of the overall plan/roadmap leads to failure. If you have a sound methodology, and it is actually followed, then it is much harder for a project to "fail".</li>
                <li><strong>Poor change management</strong> that does not start when the project starts, every organizational chart has a 'shadow' of movement, opinion, and power underneath it, so does every project. That undercurrent must be managed with strong relationships that outlive any project and with a team culture that is unafraid of direct questions and healthy conflict.</li>
                <li><strong>Business initiated projects runs as an interesting technical challenge,</strong> Business initiated projects may have relatively simple and sensible scope but get over-engineered by an excessively risk-averse IT department, adding so much cost and complexity that the project exceeds the cost / benefit or technical viability hurdles.</li>
                <li><strong>Governance was missing or was skipped;</strong> no significant Project Board was developed for the major development works. Projects that compete for resources should be assessed on the metrics of the business - they should be at least ROI but could include balanced scorecard metrics; or strategic input. The focus of many IT internal methodologies is technical delivery of the software, not delivery of a business solution that must require business participation</li>
                <li><strong>Miss the components of project management processes</strong> such as: standardization and institutionalization of project management processes, integration with other corporate processes (e.g., procurement, strategic planning), prioritization of projects and application of a standard project life cycle, utilization of project portfolio techniques, and continuous improvement</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Twenty Failure Symptoms:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>The project is a solution in search of a problem.</li>
                <li>The solution wasn't fit for purpose or projects not being scoped properly</li>
                <li>Only the project team is interested in the end result.</li>
                <li>No one is in charge</li>
                <li>The project plan lacks structure.</li>
                <li>The project plan lacks detail.</li>
                <li>The unrealistic project plans</li>
                <li>The project is under-budgeted.</li>
                <li>Insufficient non-financial resources are budgeted.</li>
                <li>The project is not tracked against the plan.</li>
                <li>The project team is not communicating</li>
                <li>The project strays from its original goals</li>
                <li>Incomplete Requirements</li>
                <li>Lack of User Involvement</li>
                <li>Lack of Resources</li>
                <li>Unrealistic Expectations</li>
                <li>Lack of Executive Support</li>
                <li>Changing Requirements & Specifications</li>
                <li>Lack of IT Management</li>
                <li>Technology Illiteracy</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ten Project Success Factors</strong> [Strategies for managing a failing ICT project]
              <ul>
                <li>User/customer Involvement</li>
                <li>Executive Management Support</li>
                <li>Clear Statement of Requirements</li>
                <li>Clear Vision & Objectives</li>
                <li>Proper Planning define the project carefully.</li>
                <li>Realistic Expectations</li>
                <li>Smaller Project Milestones</li>
                <li>Scoreboard Metrics, ROI</li>
                <li>Ownership</li>
                <li>Hard-Working, Focused Staff</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Top management need understand that project and portfolio management are key to drive many business initiatives such as strategic planning, investment priority, capital budgeting, new product development, organizational changes, M&A, etc, the businesses understand the vital importance of project management will outperform the competitors and reap the business benefits for the long term.</p>
