                            <p><strong>(a) Collision Domain vs. Broadcast Domain:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Collision Domain:</strong> A network segment where data packets can collide if multiple devices transmit simultaneously. Devices within the same collision domain compete for media access (e.g., devices connected to a hub). Switches segment collision domains.</li>
                                <li><strong>Broadcast Domain:</strong> A network segment where a broadcast frame (sent to all devices) will be propagated. All devices in the same broadcast domain receive broadcast traffic (e.g., devices connected to the same switch or within the same VLAN). Routers segment broadcast domains.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Three functions of the Data Link Layer (OSI Model):</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Framing:</strong> Encapsulates network layer packets into frames, adding headers and trailers with control information (like MAC addresses).</li>
                                <li><strong>Physical Addressing:</strong> Adds source and destination MAC addresses to the frame header for local delivery on the network segment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Error Control:</strong> Detects (and sometimes corrects) errors that occur during physical transmission using techniques like CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) included in the frame trailer.</li>
                                <li><em>(Also Flow Control, Media Access Control)</em></li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>(c) TCP/IP Model:</strong></p>
                            <p>The TCP/IP model is a conceptual framework for network protocols, consisting of four layers:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Packet Filtering Firewall:</strong> Operates mainly at the Network layer. It examines each packet header individually based on static rules (IP addresses, ports, protocol type). It doesn't track the state of connections. Fast but less secure.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stateful Inspection Firewall:</strong> Operates at Network and Transport layers. It examines packet headers *and* maintains a state table to track active connections. Decisions are based on rules and the context of the connection state (e.g., allowing return traffic for an established connection). More secure and context-aware than packet filtering.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(d) Three reasons for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) use:</strong></p>
                            <p><em>Note: BGP operates at the Application layer but functions as the core routing protocol of the Internet (between Autonomous Systems), not typically considered a Transport layer protocol itself. The question might be slightly misphrased.</em></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Inter-Autonomous System Routing:</strong> BGP is the standard protocol used to exchange routing information between different Autonomous Systems (ASes) - large networks or groups of networks under single administrative control (like ISPs). It's essential for global Internet routing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Policy-Based Routing:</strong> BGP allows network administrators to implement complex routing policies based on business relationships, traffic engineering needs, and security requirements, rather than just technical metrics like hop count.</li>
                                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> BGP is designed to handle the massive scale of the Internet routing table, efficiently managing hundreds of thousands of network prefixes.</li>

                            <p><strong>(a) Internet Terms Explained:</strong></p>
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li><strong>Registrar:</strong> An organization accredited by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) or a national ccTLD authority to manage the reservation of Internet domain names. Customers register domain names through registrars (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap).</li>
                                <li><strong>Domain Name:</strong> A human-readable label used to identify network resources, such as websites, on the Internet (e.g., `google.com`, `knec.ac.ke`). It corresponds to an underlying IP address through the Domain Name System (DNS).</li>
                            </ol>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Security Updates and Patches:</strong> Licensed software typically receives regular security updates from the vendor to protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities. Pirated software often lacks this support, leaving systems exposed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Legality and Compliance:</strong> Using unlicensed software is illegal and violates copyright laws. Companies can face significant fines and legal action if audited and found to be non-compliant.</li>
                                <li><em>(Also: Access to support, full features, ethical considerations)</em></li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>(c) Four email vulnerabilities exploited by hackers:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Phishing Attachments/Links:</strong> Malicious attachments (e.g., infected documents) or links to fake websites designed to steal credentials or install malware.</li>
                                <li><strong>Spoofing:</strong> Forging the sender's email address to make the email appear legitimate, often used in phishing or business email compromise (BEC) attacks.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lack of Encryption:</strong> Sending sensitive information over unencrypted email connections (not using TLS/SSL) allows eavesdropping.</li>
                                <li><strong>Weak Authentication:</strong> Insufficient protection for email accounts (e.g., weak passwords, no multi-factor authentication) allows unauthorized access.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>(d)(i) Two wireless network topologies (with examples):</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Infrastructure Mode:</strong> Wireless devices (clients) connect to a central Access Point (AP), which typically bridges the wireless network to a wired network. All communication goes through the AP. <em>Example: Typical home or office Wi-Fi setup where laptops and phones connect to a wireless router.</em></li>
                                <li><strong>Ad Hoc Mode (IBSS - Independent Basic Service Set):</strong> Wireless devices connect directly to each other in a peer-to-peer manner without a central AP. <em>Example: Two laptops connecting directly via Wi-Fi to share files without a router.</em></li>
                                <li><em>(Also: Wireless Mesh Network)</em></li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>(d)(ii) Two advantages of token passing:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Deterministic Access:</strong> Provides predictable access times as each node gets a turn to transmit when it holds the token. This is suitable for time-sensitive applications.</li>
                                <li><strong>Collision Elimination:</strong> Since only the node holding the token can transmit, collisions are avoided, leading to more efficient use of bandwidth under high load compared to contention-based methods like CSMA/CD.</li>

                            <p><strong>(a)(i) Three limitations of a mesh network:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Configuration and management can be complex due to the multiple interconnected paths and routing decisions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Can be expensive to implement, especially in wired mesh networks, due to the amount of cabling required for full redundancy. Wireless mesh can also require more sophisticated nodes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Scalability Issues (Potential):</strong> While offering redundancy, managing routing and potential latency in very large mesh networks can become challenging.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>(a)(ii) Managed vs. Unmanaged Network Switches:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Unmanaged Switch:</strong> Plug-and-play device with no configuration options. Operates purely at Layer 2, forwarding traffic based on MAC addresses. Simple and inexpensive.</li>
                                <li><strong>Managed Switch:</strong> Offers configuration options via CLI, web interface, or SNMP. Supports features like VLANs, QoS, link aggregation, port mirroring, and security settings, providing greater control, flexibility, and monitoring capabilities. More expensive and complex.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b)(i) Three factors determining transmission media throughput:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> The theoretical maximum data carrying capacity of the medium, often measured in Hz or bits per second.</li>
                                <li><strong>Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):</strong> The ratio of signal power to noise power. Higher SNR allows for higher data rates with fewer errors.</li>
                                <li><strong>Physical Characteristics:</strong> Factors like the type of medium (copper, fiber, wireless), cable length/distance, shielding, and quality of connectors influence signal propagation and susceptibility to impairments.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li><strong>Follow a Systematic Approach:</strong> Use a structured methodology (e.g., OSI model top-down or bottom-up) to isolate the problem logically.</li>
                                <li><strong>Gather Information:</strong> Collect detailed symptoms from users, check logs, use diagnostic tools (ping, traceroute, ipconfig/ifconfig), and understand the network baseline.</li>
                                <li><strong>Test One Change at a Time:</strong> When implementing potential solutions, change only one variable at a time and test thoroughly to confirm if it resolved the issue.</li>
                                <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Record the problem, steps taken, changes made, and the final resolution. This helps with future troubleshooting and knowledge sharing.</li>

                                <li><strong>Budget:</strong> Financial limitations often dictate the choice of hardware, software, cabling, and implementation scope.</li>
                                <li><strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> Lack of skilled personnel within the organization to design, implement, or manage the proposed network can be a constraint.</li>
                                <li><strong>Existing Infrastructure:</strong> The need to integrate with or upgrade existing legacy systems, cabling, or equipment can impose limitations on the design choices.</li>

                                <li><strong>Distance Limitation:</strong> CSMA/CD effectiveness is limited by the maximum network diameter, as collision detection must occur within a specific time window. This restricts the physical size of the network.</li>
                                <li><strong>Performance Degradation:</strong> Under heavy network load, frequent collisions can significantly reduce network efficiency as devices spend more time backing off and retransmitting.</li>
