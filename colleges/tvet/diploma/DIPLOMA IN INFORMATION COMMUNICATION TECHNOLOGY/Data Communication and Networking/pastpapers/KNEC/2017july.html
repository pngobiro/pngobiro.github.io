                            <p>A <strong>repeater</strong> is a device that amplifies and regenerates signals to extend the distance over which they can be transmitted. It operates at the physical layer of the OSI model.</p>
                            <p>A <strong>transceiver</strong>, on the other hand, is a device that both transmits and receives signals. It combines the functions of a transmitter and a receiver in a single unit and is used to connect devices to a network.</p>
                            <p><strong>(b) (i) Outline three examples of network transmission impairments:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Attenuation:</strong> This is the weakening of a signal as it travels over a distance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Distortion:</strong> This is the alteration of the signal's waveform, which can lead to errors in data transmission.</li>
                                <li><strong>Noise:</strong> This is unwanted electrical or electromagnetic energy that interferes with the signal, making it difficult to distinguish the data.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>(ii) Vicky was required to use divide-and-conquer troubleshooting technique to solve a problem in a client's network. Explain two challenges that she could have realized while using the technique:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Time-consuming:</strong> The divide-and-conquer method can be time-consuming, especially in complex networks where the problem could be in any of several places.</li>
                                <li><strong>Requires expertise:</strong> This method requires a good understanding of the network and its components to effectively divide the problem and isolate the cause.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>(c) In order to carry out a network design, one is required to conduct user needs analysis. Explain three significances of this stage:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Understanding user requirements:</strong> This stage helps in understanding the specific needs and expectations of the users, ensuring that the network is designed to meet those requirements.</li>
                                <li><strong>Identifying potential issues:</strong> By analyzing user needs, potential issues and bottlenecks can be identified early on, allowing for proactive solutions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ensuring user satisfaction:</strong> A well-designed network that meets user needs leads to increased user satisfaction and productivity.</li>

                            <p><strong>(a) (i) Outline two types of multiplexing techniques:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):</strong> This technique divides the available bandwidth into multiple frequency channels, each of which is used to transmit a separate signal.</li>
                                <li><strong>Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):</strong> This technique divides the available time into multiple time slots, each of which is used to transmit a portion of a signal.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>(ii) Distinguish between broadcast and loopback IP addresses:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Broadcast IP address:</strong> This is a special IP address that is used to send packets to all devices on a network. It typically has the form of x.x.x.255, where x.x.x represents the network address.</li>
                                <li><strong>Loopback IP address:</strong> This is a special IP address (127.0.0.1) that is used for testing network interfaces on a local machine. Packets sent to this address are looped back to the sender without being transmitted over the network.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>(b) Ruth intends to use unguided transmission medium for her company's network. Explain two limitations of this medium:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Susceptibility to interference:</strong> Unguided transmission media, such as radio waves and microwaves, are susceptible to interference from other electromagnetic sources, which can degrade the quality of the signal.</li>
                                <li><strong>Limited range:</strong> Unguided transmission media have a limited range, as the signal strength decreases with distance. This limits the distance over which data can be transmitted reliably.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>(c) Quality of service majorly depends on the bandwidth of a network. Outline four factors that are considered when determining the bandwidth:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Number of users:</strong> The number of users on the network affects the bandwidth requirements, as more users require more bandwidth to maintain acceptable performance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Network infrastructure:</strong> The capacity of the network infrastructure, such as routers and switches, affects the available bandwidth.</li>
                                <li><strong>Types of applications used:</strong> Different applications have different bandwidth requirements. For example, video conferencing requires more bandwidth than email.</li>
                                <li><strong>Network protocols:</strong> The protocols used on the network can affect the bandwidth efficiency. Some protocols are more efficient than others.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>(d) IP is key in accessing the Internet. Explain three limitations characteristic of IP:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Unreliable delivery:</strong> IP does not guarantee reliable delivery of packets. Packets may be lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order.</li>
                                <li><strong>No inherent security:</strong> IP does not provide any inherent security mechanisms. Data transmitted over IP is vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.</li>
                                <li><strong>Limited address space (IPv4):</strong> The IPv4 address space is limited to 4.3 billion addresses, which is not enough to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the Internet.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Translating domain names to IP addresses:</strong> DNS servers translate human-readable domain names, such as www.example.com, to IP addresses, such as 192.168.1.1, which are used to locate devices on the network.</li>
                                <li><strong>Caching DNS records:</strong> DNS servers cache DNS records to speed up the resolution process. When a DNS server receives a request for a domain name, it first checks its cache to see if it has a recent record for that domain name. If it does, it returns the cached record to the client, avoiding the need to query other DNS servers.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>(c) (i) Outline two roles of a hub in a computer network:</strong></p>

                            <p>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is a proprietary distance vector routing protocol that provides extremely quick convergence times with minimal network traffic. EIGRP uses a sophisticated algorithm called the Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) to ensure that routing updates are propagated quickly and efficiently.</p>
                            <p><strong>(ii) Explain two drawbacks of the protocol identified in (i):</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Proprietary:</strong> EIGRP is a proprietary protocol, which means that it is only supported by Cisco devices. This can limit the flexibility of the network and make it more difficult to interoperate with devices from other vendors.</li>
                                <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> EIGRP is a complex protocol, which can make it difficult to configure and troubleshoot. Network administrators need to have a good understanding of the protocol to effectively manage EIGRP networks.</li>
