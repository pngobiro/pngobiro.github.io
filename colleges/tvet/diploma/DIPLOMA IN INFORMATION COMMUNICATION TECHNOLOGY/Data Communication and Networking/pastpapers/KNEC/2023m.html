                            <p>(a) Two factors to consider when selecting an ISP (other than cost):</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Bandwidth and Speed:</strong> Assess the available bandwidth options (upload/download speeds) and check for consistency, especially during peak usage times. Ensure the offered speed meets the user's requirements for activities like streaming, gaming, or remote work.</li>
                                <li><strong>Service Reliability and Support:</strong> Investigate the ISP's network uptime guarantees (often specified in Service Level Agreements - SLAs). Check customer reviews regarding reliability and the availability and quality of technical support (e.g., 24/7 support, response times).</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>(b) (i) Four limitations of e-learning platforms:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Technical Requirements & Issues:</strong> Requires learners to have reliable internet access and suitable devices. Technical glitches, software incompatibility, or server downtime can disrupt learning.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lack of Face-to-Face Interaction:</strong> Reduced opportunities for spontaneous discussions, immediate clarification from instructors, and building personal connections with peers and teachers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Need for Self-Discipline & Motivation:</strong> Learners require strong self-discipline, time management skills, and motivation to stay engaged without the structure of a physical classroom.</li>
                                <li><strong>Digital Divide & Accessibility:</strong> Not all learners have equal access to the necessary technology or the digital literacy skills required to navigate online platforms effectively.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>(ii) Four guidelines for network design:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Design the network with future growth in mind. It should be easy to add more users, devices, or services without a major overhaul. Use modular designs and appropriate hardware.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reliability and Availability:</strong> Implement redundancy for critical components (like routers, switches, links) to minimize downtime. Plan for fault tolerance and quick recovery.</li>
                                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Integrate security measures from the beginning. This includes firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDPS), VPNs for remote access, and strong authentication mechanisms.</li>
                                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Ensure the network can handle the expected traffic load with acceptable speed and latency. Consider Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms to prioritize critical traffic.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>(b) (i) Three challenges of Bluetooth communication:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Limited Range:</strong> Bluetooth typically has a short operational range (Class 2: ~10 meters, Class 1: up to 100 meters), limiting its use for long-distance communication.</li>
                                <li><strong>Interference:</strong> Operates in the crowded 2.4 GHz ISM band, making it susceptible to interference from Wi-Fi, microwaves, and other devices, potentially affecting performance and reliability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities:</strong> While improving, Bluetooth has known vulnerabilities (e.g., Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing) that could allow unauthorized access or data interception if not properly secured.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>(ii) Four possible causes of NIC not showing physical connectivity (Link Light Off):</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Cable Issue:</strong> The network cable might be faulty, damaged, not plugged in securely at one or both ends, or the wrong type (e.g., crossover instead of straight-through).</li>
                                <li><strong>Port Issue (Switch/Router):</strong> The port on the switch, router, or hub that the NIC is connected to might be faulty, administratively disabled, or configured incorrectly (e.g., speed/duplex mismatch).</li>
                                <li><strong>NIC Hardware Failure:</strong> The Network Interface Card itself might have failed or be malfunctioning.</li>
                                <li><strong>NIC Driver Issue / Disabled NIC:</strong> The NIC driver might be corrupted, missing, or incorrect. The NIC might also be disabled in the operating system's device manager or in the computer's BIOS/UEFI settings.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>(c) Three components considered during star topology installation:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Central Device (Hub/Switch/Router):</strong> A central connectivity device where all nodes connect. The choice (hub vs. switch vs. router) depends on network size, performance needs, and required features (e.g., collision handling, routing).</li>
                                <li><strong>Network Cabling (e.g., UTP):</strong> Individual cables (commonly Unshielded Twisted Pair like Cat 5e or Cat 6) run from each node directly to a port on the central device. Cable quality and length limitations must be considered.</li>
                                <li><strong>Network Interface Cards (NICs):</strong> Each device (computer, printer) needs a NIC to connect to the network cable and communicate with the central device and other nodes.</li>

                            <p>(a) Two disadvantages of fibre optic cables:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Fiber optic cables, associated equipment (transceivers, connectors), and installation are generally more expensive than copper cabling (like UTP). Specialized skills and tools are needed for installation and repair, adding to the cost.</li>
                                <li><strong>Fragility and Installation Complexity:</strong> The glass core is fragile and can be easily damaged by excessive bending or physical stress during installation or handling. Splicing or terminating fiber requires precision and specialized equipment.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>(b) (i) Two problems associated with token ring topology network:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Single Point of Failure:</strong> Although designed with some fault tolerance (like bypassing faulty stations), a break in the ring or a failure in the central MAU (Multistation Access Unit) can bring down the entire segment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Complexity and Cost:</strong> Token Ring hardware (NICs, MAUs) was historically more expensive and complex to configure and manage compared to Ethernet technologies that eventually became dominant. Troubleshooting could also be more difficult.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li><strong>Comprehensive Training and Communication:</strong> Provide thorough training on how the new device works, why it's necessary (benefits to security), and how it impacts their daily workflow. Communicate changes clearly and proactively address concerns through Q&A sessions or dedicated support channels.</li>
                                <li><strong>Phased Rollout and User Support:</strong> Implement the device gradually, perhaps starting with a pilot group. This allows for identifying and resolving issues before a full deployment. Provide readily accessible support (helpdesk, documentation, champions) during and after the rollout to assist users adapting to the new system.</li>

                                <li><strong>Need for Secure Authentication:</strong> When connecting over potentially insecure public networks (like the internet for VPNs or dial-up), CHAP provides a more secure authentication method than PAP because it doesn't transmit the password directly across the link. It uses a challenge-response mechanism with hashing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Periodic Re-authentication Requirement:</strong> CHAP periodically re-challenges the remote end during the session to verify its identity continuously, preventing session hijacking if credentials were somehow compromised after the initial connection.</li>
                                <li><strong>Interoperability with Systems Requiring CHAP:</strong> Connection to legacy systems or specific provider equipment that mandates the use of CHAP for authentication over protocols like PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol).</li>

                        <div class="answer-content">
                            <p>(a) (i) Two typical characteristics of Thin Ethernet (10BASE2):</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Coaxial Cable (RG-58):</strong> Uses a specific type of thin coaxial cable (RG-58 A/U) with a 50-ohm impedance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bus Topology & T-Connectors:</strong> Typically implemented in a bus topology where devices are daisy-chained using BNC T-connectors attached directly to the NICs. Terminators (50-ohm) are required at both ends of the bus segment. (Max segment length 185m, max 30 devices/segment).</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>(ii) Two benefits of Ethernet data encapsulation:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Layered Communication & Interoperability:</strong> Encapsulation allows higher-layer protocols (like IP, TCP) to be carried over the Ethernet network without needing to know the specifics of the physical transmission. The Ethernet frame adds headers (like MAC addresses) and trailers (like FCS for error checking) needed for Layer 2 transmission, enabling different layers to work together.</li>
                                <li><strong>Addressing and Error Detection:</strong> The Ethernet header contains source and destination MAC addresses, ensuring the frame reaches the correct device on the local network segment. The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) in the trailer allows the receiving NIC to detect if the frame was corrupted during transmission.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>(b) Four justifications for installing a computer network:</p>

                                <li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> Allows multiple users to share expensive hardware (like printers, scanners, servers) and software licenses, reducing costs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Sharing and Centralized Storage:</strong> Enables easy sharing of files and information among employees. Centralized data storage simplifies backups, enhances data security, and ensures consistency.</li>
                                <li><strong>Improved Communication & Collaboration:</strong> Facilitates internal communication through email, instant messaging, and collaborative software, improving teamwork and efficiency.</li>
                                <li><strong>Centralized Management and Security:</strong> Simplifies administration tasks like software updates, user management, and security policy enforcement from a central point, enhancing overall network security and manageability.</li>

                                <li><strong>Access to New Versions & Updates:</strong> Provides rights to upgrade to the latest versions of the software released during the assurance period at no additional licensing cost, ensuring access to new features, performance improvements, and security enhancements.</li>
                                <li><strong>Support & Training Resources:</strong> Often includes access to technical support services, online training materials, deployment planning assistance, and sometimes other benefits like disaster recovery rights or home use programs, helping maximize the value of the software investment.</li>

                                <li><strong>Network Connectivity Issues:</strong> Problems with the server's network connection, DNS resolution failures (cannot find domains or MX records), or firewall blocking necessary ports (e.g., 25, 110, 143, 587, 993, 995).</li>
                                <li><strong>Service Failure:</strong> The core email services (like SMTP, POP3, IMAP services) on the server may have stopped running or crashed.</li>

                                <li><strong>Higher Speed than Dial-up:</strong> ISDN (Basic Rate Interface - BRI typically offered 128 kbps) provided significantly faster data rates than traditional analog modem dial-up connections, making it suitable for faster internet access or remote office connectivity before broadband became widespread.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reliable Digital Connection & Multiple Channels:</strong> It offered an end-to-end digital connection, generally more reliable than analog lines. BRI provided two 'B' channels (64 kbps each) for data/voice and one 'D' channel for signaling, allowing simultaneous voice and data calls or channel bonding for higher speed.</li>

                                <li><strong>Part (i) - Core:</strong> The central part of the fiber, typically made of highly pure glass (or sometimes plastic), through which the light signals travel. Its diameter is very small (e.g., 9 µm for single-mode, 50 or 62.5 µm for multi-mode).</li>
                                <li><strong>Part (ii) - Cladding:</strong> The layer of glass (or plastic) immediately surrounding the core. It has a lower refractive index than the core, causing light to be reflected back into the core via total internal reflection, thus guiding the light along the fiber.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Centralized Control (Hub-based):</strong> Unlike CSMA/CD, access is controlled by an intelligent hub. Nodes request permission to transmit from the hub.</li>
                                <li><strong>Priority Levels:</strong> Supports two priority levels (high and normal). High-priority requests (e.g., for time-sensitive data like video) are serviced before normal-priority requests.</li>
                                <li><strong>Round-Robin Polling:</strong> The hub polls nodes in a round-robin fashion within each priority level to grant transmission opportunities, preventing collisions and ensuring predictable access.</li>
                                <li><strong>Support for Ethernet and Token Ring Frames:</strong> Designed to carry both standard Ethernet frames and Token Ring frames, aiming for interoperability. (Operated at 100 Mbps).</li>

                                <li><strong>Adjacency Table (Neighbor Table):</strong> Contains information about the router's directly connected OSPF neighbors with whom it has formed an adjacency. It lists neighbor router IDs and their state (e.g., Full, Down).</li>
                                <li><strong>Link-State Database Table (Topology Table):</strong> Stores all Link-State Advertisements (LSAs) received from routers within the same OSPF area. This table represents the complete topology map of the area from the perspective of the router.</li>
                                <li><strong>Routing Table (Forwarding Database):</strong> While technically derived *from* the LSDB after running the SPF algorithm, the resulting best paths are stored here. It contains destination networks, the cost (metric) to reach them, and the next-hop router/interface to forward packets towards that destination.</li>

                            <p>(a) Three challenges for Internet connectivity in rural areas:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Infrastructure Deployment Cost & ROI (Provider Challenge):</strong> The cost to deploy broadband infrastructure (like fiber or fixed wireless) over large distances with low population density is very high. Providers face difficulty achieving a return on investment compared to densely populated urban areas.</li>
                                <li><strong>Geographic & Environmental Obstacles (Provider/User Challenge):</strong> Difficult terrain (mountains, forests), long distances, and lack of existing infrastructure (like utility poles) make deployment physically challenging and expensive. Weather can also impact wireless signal reliability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Affordability & Digital Literacy (User Challenge):</strong> Even where service is available, the cost might be prohibitive for lower-income rural residents. Additionally, users may lack the necessary digital skills or devices to effectively utilize the internet connection.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>(b) Four reasons for using subnets in an institutional network:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Improved Performance / Reduced Congestion:</strong> Subnetting breaks a large network into smaller broadcast domains. This reduces broadcast traffic within each subnet, leading to less congestion and better overall network performance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Subnets allow for the logical segmentation of the network (e.g., separating departments like Finance, HR, Student Labs). Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be applied between subnets to control traffic flow and restrict access to sensitive resources.</li>
                                <li><strong>Simplified Administration & Troubleshooting:</strong> Managing smaller network segments is easier. Network problems can often be isolated to a specific subnet, simplifying troubleshooting and reducing the impact of issues on the entire institution.</li>
                                <li><strong>Logical Organization & Addressing Efficiency:</strong> Allows the network to be organized logically based on departments, buildings, or function. It also enables more efficient use of the assigned IP address space.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li><strong>Packet Loss (Unreliability):</strong> UDP does not guarantee delivery. Packets can be dropped by routers due to congestion or errors, and UDP itself provides no mechanism to detect or retransmit lost packets. The application layer must handle this if reliability is needed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Out-of-Order Delivery:</strong> Packets may take different paths through the network and arrive at the destination in a different order than they were sent. UDP does not sequence packets, so the receiving application might receive data out of order.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Corruption (Limited Error Checking):</strong> While UDP has an optional checksum for header/data integrity, it's not mandatory (especially in IPv4) and doesn't guarantee detection of all errors. There's no mechanism for acknowledging correct receipt or requesting retransmission of corrupted data.</li>

                                <li><strong>Establish SSH Connection:</strong> SCP relies on SSH (Secure Shell) for security. The first step is to establish an authenticated and encrypted SSH connection between the client and the remote server.</li>

                                <li><strong>Data Transfer:</strong> The file data is transferred securely over the encrypted SSH channel. SCP handles the file transfer protocol details within this secure tunnel.</li>
                                <li><strong>Connection Closure:</strong> Once the transfer is complete, the SCP process finishes, and the underlying SSH connection may be closed (or kept open if used for other commands).</li>

                                <li><strong>Physical Connection Interface:</strong> Provides the physical port (e.g., RJ-45 for Ethernet, antenna for Wi-Fi) to connect the computer to the network medium (cable or airwaves). It handles the transmission and reception of electrical or radio signals.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Link Layer Functions:</strong> Formats outgoing data into Ethernet frames (or other appropriate frame types), adds the unique MAC address of the NIC, and performs error checking (like calculating FCS). It also processes incoming frames, checking the destination MAC address and FCS.</li>

                                <li><strong>Confidentiality (Encryption):</strong> Encrypts the data exchanged between the user's browser and the web server using SSL/TLS. This prevents eavesdroppers from reading sensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Integrity and Authentication:</strong> Ensures that the data hasn't been tampered with during transmission. The SSL/TLS certificate also helps authenticate the web server, verifying that the user is connecting to the legitimate website and not an imposter site (helps prevent phishing).</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li><strong>Cable Television (CATV) Distribution:</strong> Coaxial cable is still widely used for distributing television signals from the service provider to homes due to its good bandwidth capacity over long distances and effective shielding against interference.</li>
                                <li><strong>Broadband Cable Internet:</strong> Used in Hybrid Fiber-Coax (HFC) networks where fiber runs to a neighborhood node, and coaxial cable provides the final connection ("last mile") to individual homes for high-speed internet access (e.g., DOCSIS technology). Its shielding is better than UTP for carrying signals over longer residential drops.</li>

                                <li><strong>Dialog Control (Session Management):</strong> Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications. It determines whose turn it is to transmit (using tokens) and controls the flow of dialogue (e.g., half-duplex or full-duplex).</li>
                                <li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> Inserts checkpoints into the data stream. If a communication failure occurs, the session can resume from the last acknowledged checkpoint, avoiding the need to retransmit the entire data stream.</li>
                                <li><strong>Session Establishment & Termination:</strong> Handles the orderly setup and teardown of sessions, ensuring that both ends are ready to communicate and that the connection is closed gracefully when finished.</li>

                            <p>(c) Three tools for testing TCP/IP connection:</p>

                                <li><strong>Ping:</strong> Sends ICMP Echo Request packets to a target IP address or hostname and waits for Echo Replies. It verifies basic reachability (Layer 3 connectivity) and measures round-trip time (latency). Command: `ping <ip_address_or_hostname>`</li>
                                <li><strong>Traceroute (tracert on Windows):</strong> Shows the path (sequence of routers) that packets take to reach a destination host. It helps identify where connectivity breaks down or where high latency occurs along the path. Command: `traceroute <ip_address_or_hostname>` or `tracert <ip_address_or_hostname>`</li>
                                <li><strong>Ipconfig (Windows) / ifconfig or ip addr (Linux/macOS):</strong> Displays the TCP/IP configuration details of the local machine's network interfaces, including IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers. Useful for verifying the local host's configuration. Command: `ipconfig /all` or `ip addr show`</li>
                                *(Other tools like netstat, nslookup, telnet could also be mentioned)*

                                <li><strong>Improved Performance & Stability:</strong> Often results in better system performance and stability as there is no accumulated clutter (old drivers, registry entries, fragmented files) from previous versions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ensures Compatibility:</strong> Guarantees that only compatible drivers and system files for the specific hardware and OS version are installed, reducing potential conflicts.</li>
                                <li><strong>Opportunity for Reconfiguration:</strong> Provides a chance to re-evaluate and implement optimal system configurations, partitioning schemes, and security settings from scratch, rather than carrying over potentially outdated ones.</li>
