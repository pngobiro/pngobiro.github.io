                        <p>A repeater is an electronic device that operates only at the physical layer. Repeaters receive signals on the input ports, regenerate or amplify the bits, and forward them to the output ports.</p>
                        <p>For example, suppose we have a cable internet distribution system. Because of the high attenuation of coax cables over long distances, the signal received at a home 5 km away is almost indistinguishable from noise. By placing repeaters at 1-km intervals along the cable, each repeater gets a clean signal, amplifies it, and puts out a strong signal for the next km of cable.</p>
                        <p>A repeater can also interconnect LANs that use different types of media. For example, it can connect a coaxial-cable segment to a fiber-optic segment. In this case, it will not only regenerate the signal but also convert it from one type to another.</p>
                        <p>A repeater has a regenerative capability that can overcome the data rate, distance, and noise limitations of physical media. However, the device cannot help in an overloaded situation. If the traffic level is high, packet collisions and congestion still occur.</p>

                        <p>A hub is a multiport repeater; it is actually a repeater with multiple ports. A repeater is a two-port device; a hub is a multiport device.</p>
                        <p>If a packet arrives at a port, the hub regenerates and amplifies the electrical signal and broadcasts it to all other ports. All stations connected to other ports receive the broadcast packet. Hubs act as wiring concentrators in a star topology, but the topology is still logically a bus topology, where all stations share the same collision domain.</p>

                        <p>A bridge has filtering capability. It can check the destination address of a frame and decide if the frame should be forwarded or dropped. If the frame is to be forwarded, the decision must specify the port to which the frame should be forwarded. A bridge has a table that maps addresses to ports.</p>

                        <p>A switch is a multiport bridge; it is a bridge with multiple ports. However, bridges have become less popular today. They are being replaced by switches, which perform the same functions but more efficiently. A bridge with a few ports can connect a few LANs together. A switch with tens or hundreds of ports can connect many LANs together.</p>
                        <p>A switch, as a multiport bridge, can connect LANs and, at the same time, divide a LAN into segments. A segment is a group of devices or other segments connected by a switch port. In other words, a switch defines collision domains; each segment is a separate collision domain.</p>
