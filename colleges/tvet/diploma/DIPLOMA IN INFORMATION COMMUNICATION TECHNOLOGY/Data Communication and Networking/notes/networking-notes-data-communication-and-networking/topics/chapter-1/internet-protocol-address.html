                        <p>An IPv4 address is a 32-bit address that uniquely and universally defines the connection of a device (for example, a computer or a router) to the Internet. IPv4 addresses are unique. They are unique in the sense that each address defines one, and only one, connection to the Internet. Two devices on the Internet can never have the same address at the same time. The IPv4 addresses are universal in the sense that the addressing system must be accepted by any host that wants to be connected to the Internet.</p>

                        <p>A protocol such as IPv4 that defines addresses has an address space. An address space is the total number of addresses used by the protocol. If a protocol uses N bits to define an address, the address space is 2<sup>N</sup> because each bit can have two different values (0 or 1) and N bits can have 2<sup>N</sup> values. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, which means that the address space is 2<sup>32</sup> or 4,294,967,296 (more than 4 billion). This means that, theoretically, if there were no restrictions, more than 4 billion devices could be connected to the Internet.</p>

                        <p>There are two prevalent notations to show an IPv4 address: binary notation and dotted-decimal notation.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Binary Notation</h3>
                        <p>In binary notation, the IPv4 address is displayed as 32 bits. Each octet is often referred to as a byte. So it is common to hear an IPv4 address referred to as a 32-bit address or a 4-byte address. The following is an example of an IPv4 address in binary notation:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block"><code>01110101 10010101 00011101 00000010</code></pre>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Dotted-Decimal Notation</h3>
                        <p>To make the IPv4 address more compact and easier to read, Internet addresses are usually written in decimal form with a decimal point (dot) separating the bytes. The following is the dotted-decimal notation of the above address:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block"><code>117.149.29.2</code></pre>
                        <p><i>(Figure 19.1 shows an IPv4 address in both binary and dotted-decimal notation.)</i> Note that because each byte (octet) is 8 bits, each number in dotted-decimal notation is a value ranging from 0 to 255.</p>

                        <p>IPv4 addressing, at its inception, used the concept of classes. This architecture is called classful addressing. In classful addressing, the address space is divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E. Each class occupies some part of the address space. We can find the class of an address when given the address in binary notation or dotted-decimal notation. If the address is given in binary notation, the first few bits can immediately tell us the class of the address. If the address is given in decimal-dotted notation, the first byte defines the class. Both methods are shown in Figure 19.2.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>One problem with classful addressing is that each class is divided into a fixed number of blocks with each block having a fixed size as shown in Table 19.1.</p>
                        <p><i>(Table 19.1 showing classful addressing details)</i></p> <!-- Placeholder for table description -->
                        <p>Previously, when an organization requested a block of addresses, it was granted one in class A, B, or C. Class A addresses were designed for large organizations with a large number of attached hosts or routers. Class B addresses were designed for midsize organizations with tens of thousands of attached hosts or routers. Class C addresses were designed for small organizations with a small number of attached hosts or routers.</p>
                        <p>We can see the flaw in this design. A block in class A address is too large for almost any organization. This means most of the addresses in class A were wasted and were not used. A block in class B is also very large, probably too large for many of the organizations that received a class B block. A block in class C is probably too small for many organizations. Class D addresses were designed for multicasting. Each address in this class is used to define one group of hosts on the Internet. The Internet authorities wrongly predicted a need for 268,435,456 groups. This never happened and many addresses were wasted here too. And lastly, the class E addresses were reserved for future use; only a few were used, resulting in another waste of addresses.</p>
