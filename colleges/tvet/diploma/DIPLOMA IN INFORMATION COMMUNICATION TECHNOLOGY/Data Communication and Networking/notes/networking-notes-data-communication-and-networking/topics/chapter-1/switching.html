                        <p>A network is a set of connected devices. Whenever we have multiple devices, we have the problem of how to connect them to make one-to-one communication possible. One solution is to make a point-to-point connection between each pair of devices (a mesh topology) or between a central device and every other device (a star topology). These methods, however, are impractical and wasteful when applied to very large networks. The number and length of the links require too much infrastructure to be cost-efficient, and the majority of those links would be idle most of the time. Other topologies employing multipoint connections, such as a bus, are ruled out because the distances between devices and the total number of devices increase beyond the capacities of the media and equipment.</p>
                        <p>A better solution is switching. A switched network consists of a series of interlinked nodes, called switches. Switches are devices capable of creating temporary connections between two or more devices linked to the switch. In a switched network, some of these nodes are connected to the end systems (computers or telephones, for example). Others are used only for routing. <i>(Figure 8.1 shows a switched network.)</i></p>
                        <p><i>(Figure 8.1 showing a switched network)</i></p> <!-- Placeholder for image description -->
                        <p>The end systems (communicating devices) are labeled A, B, C, D, and so on, and the switches are labeled I, II, III, IV, and V. Each switch is connected to multiple links. Traditionally, three methods of switching have been important: circuit switching, packet switching, and message switching. The first two are commonly used today. The third has been phased out in general communications but still has networking applications. We can then divide today's networks into three broad categories: circuit-switched networks, packet-switched networks, and message-switched.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A circuit-switched network consists of a set of switches connected by physical links. A connection between two stations is a dedicated path made of one or more links. However, each connection uses only one dedicated channel on each link. Each link is normally divided into n channels by using FDM or TDM. <i>(Figure 8.3 shows a trivial circuit-switched network with four switches and four links. Each link is divided into n (n is 3 in the figure) channels by using FDM or TDM.)</i></p>
                        <p><i>(Figure 8.3 showing circuit-switched network)</i></p> <!-- Placeholder for image description -->
                        <p>The end systems, such as computers or telephones, are directly connected to a switch. We have shown only two end systems for simplicity. When end system A needs to communicate with end system M, system A needs to request a connection to M that must be accepted by all switches as well as by M itself. This is called the setup phase; a circuit (channel) is reserved on each link, and the combination of circuits or channels defines the dedicated path. After the dedicated path made of connected circuits (channels) is established, data transfer can take place. After all data have been transferred, the circuits are torn down.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Three Phases</h3>
                        <p>The actual communication in a circuit-switched network requires three phases: connection setup, data transfer, and connection teardown.</p>
                        <p><i>(Figure showing three phases of circuit switching)</i></p> <!-- Placeholder for image description -->
                        <h4>Setup Phase</h4>
                        <p>Before the two parties (or multiple parties in a conference call) can communicate, a dedicated circuit (combination of channels in links) needs to be established. The end systems are normally connected through dedicated lines to the switches, so connection setup means creating dedicated channels between the switches. For example, in Figure 8.3, when system A needs to connect to system M, it sends a setup request that includes the address of system M, to switch I. Switch I finds a channel between itself and switch IV that can be dedicated for this purpose. Switch I then sends the request to switch IV, which finds a dedicated channel between itself and switch III. Switch III informs system M of system A's intention at this time. In the next step to making a connection, an acknowledgment from system M needs to be sent in the opposite direction to system A. Only after system A receives this acknowledgment is the connection established.</p>
                        <h4>Data Transfer Phase</h4>
                        <p>After the establishment of the dedicated circuit (channels), the two parties can transfer data.</p>
                        <h4>Teardown Phase</h4>
                        <p>When one of the parties needs to disconnect, a signal is sent to each switch to release the resources.</p>

                <!-- Packet-Switched Networks -->
                <section class="content-section" id="packet-switching">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">

                        <span class="heading-text">2. Packet-Switched Networks</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In a Computer Network, the communication between two ends is done in blocks of data called packets. So instead of continuous communication the exchange takes place in the form of individual packets between the two computers. This allows us to make the switches function for both storing and forwarding because a packet is an independent entity that can be stored and sent later.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">a. Datagram Networks</h3>
                        <p>In data communications, we need to send messages from one end system to another. If the message is going to pass through a packet-switched network, it needs to be divided into packets of fixed or variable size. The size of the packet is determined by the network and the governing protocol. In packet switching, there is no resource allocation for a packet. This means that there is no reserved bandwidth on the links, and there is no scheduled processing time for each packet. Resources are allocated on demand. The allocation is done on a first-come, first-served basis. When a switch receives a packet, no matter what is the source or destination, the packet must wait if there are other packets being processed. As with other systems in our daily life, this lack of reservation may create delay. For example, if we do not have a reservation at a restaurant, we might have to wait.</p>
                        <p>In a datagram network, each packet is treated independently of all others. Even if a packet is part of a multipacket transmission, the network treats it as though it existed alone. Packets in this approach are referred to as datagrams. Datagram switching is normally done at the network layer. The switches in a datagram network are traditionally referred to as routers.</p>
                        <p><i>(Figure showing datagram network example)</i></p> <!-- Placeholder for image description -->
                        <p>In this example, all four packets (or datagrams) belong to the same message, but may travel different paths to reach their destination. This is so because the links may be involved in carrying packets from other sources and do not have the necessary bandwidth available to carry all the packets from A to X. This approach can cause the datagrams of a transmission to arrive at their destination out of order with different delays between them packets. Packets may also be lost or dropped because of a lack of resources. In most protocols, it is the responsibility of an upper-layer protocol to reorder the datagrams or ask for lost datagrams before passing them on to the application. The datagram networks are sometimes referred to as connectionless networks. The term connectionless here means that the switch (packet switch) does not keep information about the connection state. There are no setup or teardown phases. Each packet is treated the same by a switch regardless of its source or destination.</p>

                        <p>A virtual-circuit network is a cross between a circuit-switched network and a datagram network. It has some characteristics of both.</p>
