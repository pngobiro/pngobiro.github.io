                        <p>E-mail is such a common application that some websites today provide this service to anyone who accesses the site. Two common sites are Hotmail and Yahoo. The idea is very simple. Mail transfer from Alice's browser to her mail server is done through HTTP. The transfer of the message from the sending mail server to the receiving mail server is still through SMTP. Finally, the message from the receiving server (the Web server) to Bob's browser is done through HTTP.</p>
                        <p>The last phase is very interesting. Instead of POP3 or IMAP4, HTTP is normally used. When Bob needs to retrieve his e-mails, he sends a message to the website (Hotmail, for example). The website sends a form to be filled in by Bob, which includes the log-in name and the password. If the log-in name and password match, the e-mail is transferred from the Web server to Bob's browser in HTML format.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the standard mechanism provided by TCP/IP for copying a file from one host to another. Although transferring files from one system to another seems simple and straightforward, some problems must be dealt with first. For example, two systems may use different file name conventions. Two systems may have different ways to represent text and data. Two systems may have different directory structures. All these problems have been solved by FTP in a very simple and elegant approach.</p>
                        <p>FTP differs from other client/server applications in that it establishes two connections between the hosts. One connection is used for data transfer, the other for control information (commands and responses). Separation of commands and data transfer makes FTP more efficient. The control connection uses very simple rules of communication. We need to transfer only a line of command or a line of response at a time. The data connection, on the other hand, needs more complex rules due to the variety of data types transferred. However, the difference in complexity is at the FTP level, not TCP. For TCP, both connections are treated the same. FTP uses two well-known TCP ports: Port 21 is used for the control connection, and port 20 is used for the data connection.</p>
                        <p><i>(Figure 26.21 shows the basic model of FTP.)</i> The client has three components: user interface, client control process, and the client data transfer process. The server has two components: the server control process and the server data transfer process. The control connection is made between the control processes. The data connection is made between the data transfer processes.</p>
                        <p><i>(Figure 26.21 showing FTP model)</i></p> <!-- Placeholder for image description -->
                        <p>The control connection remains connected during the entire interactive FTP session. The data connection is opened and then closed for each file transferred. It opens each time commands that involve transferring files are used, and it closes when the file is transferred. In other words, when a user starts an FTP session, the control connection opens. While the control connection is open, the data connection can be opened and closed multiple times if several files are transferred.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Transmission Mode</h3>
                        <p>FTP can transfer a file across the data connection by using one of the following three transmission modes: stream mode, block mode, and compressed mode.</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="item-text"><b>Stream mode:</b> The default mode. Data are delivered from FTP to TCP as a continuous stream of bytes. TCP is responsible for chopping data into segments of appropriate size. If the data are simply a stream of bytes (file structure), no end-of-file is needed. End-of-file in this case is the closing of the data connection by the sender. If the data are divided into records (record structure), each record will have a 1-byte end-of-record (EOR) character and the end of the file will have a 1-byte end-of-file (EOF) character.</span>
                            </li>
                             <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚û°Ô∏è</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><b>Block mode:</b> Data can be delivered from FTP to TCP in blocks. In this case, each block is preceded by a 3-byte header. The first byte is called the block descriptor; the next 2 bytes define the size of the block in bytes.</span>
                            </li>
                             <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="item-text"><b>Compressed mode:</b> If the file is big, the data can be compressed. The compression method normally used is run-length encoding. In this method, consecutive appearances of a data unit are replaced by one occurrence and the number of repetitions. In a text file, this is usually spaces (blanks). In a binary file, null characters are usually compressed.</span>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol used mainly to access data on the World Wide Web. HTTP functions as a combination of FTP and SMTP. It is similar to FTP because it transfers files and uses the services of TCP. However, it is much simpler than FTP because it uses only one TCP connection. There is no separate control connection; only data are transferred between the client and the server. HTTP is like SMTP because the data transferred between the client and the server look like SMTP messages. In addition, the format of the messages is controlled by MIME-like headers. Unlike SMTP, the HTTP messages are not destined to be read by humans; they are read and interpreted by the HTTP server and HTTP client (browser). SMTP messages are stored and forwarded, but HTTP messages are delivered immediately. The commands from the client to the server are embedded in a request message. The contents of the requested file or other information are embedded in a response message. HTTP uses the services of TCP on well-known port 80.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">HTTP Transaction</h3>
                        <p><i>(Figure 27.12 illustrates the HTTP transaction between the client and server.)</i> Although HTTP uses the services of TCP, HTTP itself is a stateless protocol. The client initializes the transaction by sending a request message. The server replies by sending a response.</p>

                        <p>The formats of the request and response messages are similar; both are shown in Figure 27.13. A request message consists of a request line, a header, and sometimes a body. A response message consists of a status line, a header, and sometimes a body.</p>
                        <p><i>(Figure 27.13 showing HTTP message formats)</i></p> <!-- Placeholder for image description -->

                        <p>The first line in a request message is called a request line; the first line in the response message is called the status line. There is one common field, as shown in Figure 27.14.</p>
