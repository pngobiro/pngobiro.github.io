                        <p>The OSI model is based on a proposal developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO) as a first step toward international standardization of the protocols used in the various layers (Day and Zimmermann, 1983). It was revised in 1995 (Day, 1995). The model is called the ISO-OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model because it deals with connecting open systems‚Äîthat is, systems that are open for communication with other systems.</p>
                        <p>The OSI model is a layered framework for the design of network systems that allows communication between all types of computer systems. It consists of seven separate but related layers, each of which defines a part of the process of moving information across a network.</p>

                        <p>The OSI model is composed of seven ordered layers: physical (layer 1), data link (layer 2), network (layer 3), transport (layer 4), session (layer 5), presentation (layer 6), and application (layer 7). <i>(Figure below shows the layers involved when a message is sent from device A to device B.)</i> As the message travels from A to B, it may pass through many intermediate nodes. These intermediate nodes usually involve only the first three layers of the OSI model.</p>
