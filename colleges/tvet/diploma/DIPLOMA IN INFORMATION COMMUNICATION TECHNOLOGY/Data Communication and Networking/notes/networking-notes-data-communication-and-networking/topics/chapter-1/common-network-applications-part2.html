                        <p>One of the most popular Internet services is electronic mail (e-mail). The designers of the Internet probably never imagined the popularity of this application program. At the beginning of the Internet era, the messages sent by electronic mail were short and consisted of text only; they let people exchange quick memos. Today, electronic mail is much more complex. It allows a message to include text, audio, and video. It also allows one message to be sent to one or more recipients.</p>

                        <h4>User Agent</h4>
                        <p>The first component of an electronic mail system is the user agent. It provides service to the user to make the process of sending and receiving a message easier.</p>
                        <h5>Services Provided by a User Agent</h5>
                        <p>A user agent is a software package (program) that composes, reads, replies to, and forwards messages. It also handles mailboxes. <i>(Figure 26.11 shows the services of a typical user agent.)</i></p>

                                <span class="item-icon">‚úçÔ∏è</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><b>Composing Messages:</b> A user agent helps the user compose the e-mail message to be sent out. Most user agents provide a template on the screen to be filled in by the user. Some even have a built-in editor that can do spell checking, grammar checking, and other tasks expected from a sophisticated word processor. A user, of course, could alternatively use his or her favorite text editor or word processor to create the message and import it, or cut and paste it, into the user agent template.</span>
                            </li>

                                <span class="item-text"><b>Reading Messages:</b> The second duty of the user agent is to read the incoming messages. When a user invokes a user agent, it first checks the mail in the incoming mailbox. Most user agents show a one-line summary of each received mail. Each e-mail contains the following fields: 1. A number field. 2. A flag field that shows the status of the mail such as new, already read but not replied to, or read and replied to. 3. The size of the message. 4. The sender. 5. The optional subject field.</span>

                                <span class="item-text"><b>Replying to Messages:</b> After reading a message, a user can use the user agent to reply to a message. A user agent usually allows the user to reply to the original sender or to reply to all recipients of the message. The reply message may contain the original message and the new message.</span>
                            </li>
                             <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ü™Ô∏è</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><b>Forwarding Messages:</b> Replying is defined as sending a message to the sender or recipients of the copy. Forwarding is defined as sending the message to a third party. A user agent allows the receiver to forward the message, with or without extra comments, to a third party.</span>
                            </li>
                             <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">üì•</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><b>Handling Mailboxes:</b> A user agent normally creates two mailboxes: an inbox and an outbox. Each box is a file with a special format that can be handled by the user agent. The inbox keeps all the received e-mails until they are deleted by the user. The outbox keeps all the sent e-mails until the user deletes them. Most user agents today are capable of creating customized mailboxes.</span>

                                <span class="item-icon">‚å®Ô∏è</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><b>Command-Driven:</b> Command-driven user agents belong to the early days of electronic mail. They are still present as the underlying user agents in servers. A command-driven user agent normally accepts a one-character command from the keyboard to perform its task. For example, a user can type the character r, at the command prompt, to reply to the sender of the message, or type the character R to reply to the sender and all recipients. Some examples of command-driven user agents are mail, pine, and elm.</span>
                            </li>

                                <span class="item-icon">üñ±Ô∏è</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><b>GUI-Based:</b> Modern user agents are GUI-based. They contain graphical-user interface (GUI) components that allow the user to interact with the software by using both the keyboard and the mouse. They have graphical components such as icons, menu bars, and windows that make the services easy to access. Some examples of GUI-based user agents are Eudora, Microsoft's Outlook, and Netscape.</span>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Addresses</h3>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>To deliver mail, a mail handling system must use an addressing system with unique addresses. In the Internet, the address consists of two parts: a local part and a domain name, separated by an @ sign.</p>
                        <p><b>Local Part:</b> The local part defines the name of a special file, called the user mailbox, where all the mail received for a user is stored for retrieval by the message access agent.</p>
                        <p><b>Domain Name:</b> The second part of the address is the domain name. An organization usually selects one or more hosts to receive and send e-mail; the hosts are sometimes called mail servers or exchangers. The domain name assigned to each mail exchanger either comes from the DNS database or is a logical name (for example, the name of the organization).</p>
