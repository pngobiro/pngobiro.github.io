                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The actual mail transfer is done through message transfer agents (MTAs). To send mail, a system must have the client MTA, and to receive mail, a system must have a server MTA. The formal protocol that defines the MTA client and server in the Internet is called the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).</p>
                        <p><i>(Figure showing SMTP usage between sender, servers, and receiver)</i></p> <!-- Placeholder for image description -->
                        <p>SMTP is used two times, between the sender and the sender's mail server and between the two mail servers. SMTP simply defines how commands and responses must be sent back and forth.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Commands and Responses</h3>
                        <p>SMTP uses commands and responses to transfer messages between an MTA client and an MTA server <i>(see Figure 26.17)</i>.</p>
                        <p><i>(Figure 26.17 showing SMTP commands and responses)</i></p> <!-- Placeholder for image description -->
                        <h4>Commands</h4>
                        <p>Commands are sent from the client to the server. The format of a command is shown in Figure 26.18. It consists of a keyword followed by zero or more arguments. SMTP defines 14 commands. The first five are mandatory; every implementation must support these five commands. The next three are often used and highly recommended. The last six are seldom used.</p>

                        <h4>Responses</h4>
                        <p>Responses are sent from the server to the client. A response is a three digit code that may be followed by additional textual information. <i>(Table 26.8 lists some of the responses.)</i></p>

                        <p>The process of transferring a mail message occurs in three phases: connection establishment, mail transfer, and connection termination.</p>

                        <p>Post Office Protocol, version 3 (POP3) is simple and limited in functionality. The client POP3 software is installed on the recipient computer; the server POP3 software is installed on the mail server. Mail access starts with the client when the user needs to download e-mail from the mailbox on the mail server. The client opens a connection to the server on TCP port 110. It then sends its user name and password to access the mailbox. The user can then list and retrieve the mail messages, one by one.</p>
                        <p>POP3 has two modes: the delete mode and the keep mode. In the delete mode, the mail is deleted from the mailbox after each retrieval. In the keep mode, the mail remains in the mailbox after retrieval. The delete mode is normally used when the user is working at her permanent computer and can save and organize the received mail after reading or replying. The keep mode is normally used when the user accesses her mail away from her primary computer (e.g., a laptop). The mail is read but kept in the system for later retrieval and organizing.</p>

                        <p>Another mail access protocol is Internet Mail Access Protocol, version 4 (IMAP4). IMAP4 is similar to POP3, but it has more features; IMAP4 is more powerful and more complex.</p>
                        <p>POP3 is deficient in several ways. It does not allow the user to organize her mail on the server; the user cannot have different folders on the server. In addition, POP3 does not allow the user to partially check the contents of the mail before downloading. IMAP4 provides the following extra functions:</p>
