                    <h2>TYPES OF CONNECTIONS:</h2>
                    <p>A network is two or more devices connected through links. A link is a communications pathway that transfers data from one device to another. There are two possible types of connections: point-to-point and multipoint.</p>
                    <h3>Point-to-Point</h3>
                    <p>A point-to-point connection provides a dedicated link between two devices. The entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission between those two devices. Most point-to-point connections use an actual length of wire or cable to connect the two ends, but other options, such as microwave or satellite links, are also possible. When you change television channels by infrared remote control, you are establishing a point-to-point connection between the remote control and the television's control system.</p>
                    <h3>Multipoint</h3>
                    <p>A multipoint (also called multidrop) connection is one in which more than two specific devices share a single link. In a multipoint environment, the capacity of the channel is shared, either spatially or temporally. If several devices can use the link simultaneously, it is a <i>spatially shared</i> connection. If users must take turns, it is a <i>timeshared</i> connection.</p>

                <h2>üìö PHYSICAL TOPOLOGY:</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The term <i>physical topology</i> refers to the way in which a network is laid out physically. One or more devices connect to a link; two or more links form a topology. The topology of a network is the geometric representation of the relationship of all the links and linking devices (usually called nodes) to one another. There are four basic topologies possible: mesh, star, bus, and ring.</p>
                     <figure class="content-image">
                        <img src="../assets/diagrams/network_topologies_overview.png"
                             alt="Diagram illustrating the four basic network topologies: Mesh, Star, Bus, and Ring."
                             width="600" height="300">
                        <figcaption>Overview of Network Topologies</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <h3>1. Mesh:</h3>
                    <p>In a mesh topology, every device has a dedicated point-to-point link to every other device. The term <i>dedicated</i> means that the link carries traffic only between the two devices it connects. To find the number of physical links in a fully connected mesh network with n nodes, we first consider that each node must be connected to every other node. Node 1 must be connected to n - 1 nodes, node 2 must be connected to n - 1 nodes, and finally node n must be connected to n - 1 nodes. We need n(n - 1) physical links. However, if each physical link allows communication in both directions (duplex mode), we can divide the number of links by 2. In other words, we can say that in a mesh topology, we need n(n -1) /2 duplex-mode links. To accommodate that many links, every device on the network must have n - 1 input/output ports to be connected to the other n - 1 stations.</p>
                    <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The use of dedicated links guarantees that each connection can carry its own data load, thus eliminating the traffic problems that can occur when links must be shared by multiple devices.</li>
                        <li>A mesh topology is robust. If one link becomes unusable, it does not incapacitate the entire system.</li>
                        <li>There is the advantage of privacy or security. When every message travels along a dedicated line, only the intended recipient sees it. Physical boundaries prevent other users from gaining access to messages.</li>
                        <li>Point-to-point links make fault identification and fault isolation easy. Traffic can be routed to avoid links with suspected problems. This facility enables the network manager to discover the precise location of the fault and aids in finding its cause and solution.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Disadvantage of a mesh are related to the amount of cabling because every device must be connected to every other device.</li>
                        <li>Installation and reconnection are difficult.</li>
                        <li>The sheer bulk of the wiring can be greater than the available space (in walls, ceilings, or floors) can accommodate.</li>
                        <li>The hardware required to connect each link (I/O ports and cable) can be prohibitively expensive.</li>
                    </ol>

                             alt="Diagram illustrating Mesh topology."

                    </figure>

                    <h3>2. Star Topology:</h3>
                    <p>In a star topology, each device has a dedicated point-to-point link only to a central controller, usually called a hub. The devices are not directly linked to one another. Unlike a mesh topology, a star topology does not allow direct traffic between devices. The controller acts as an exchange: If one device wants to send data to another, it sends the data to the controller, which then relays the data to the other connected device .</p>
                    <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A star topology is less expensive than a mesh topology. In a star, each device needs only one link and one I/O port to connect it to any number of others.</li>
                        <li>Easy to install and reconfigure.</li>
                        <li>Far less cabling needs to be housed, and additions, moves, and deletions involve only one connection: between that device and the hub.</li>
                        <li>Other advantage include robustness. If one link fails, only that link is affected. All other links remain active. This factor also lends itself to easy fault identification and fault isolation. As long as the hub is working, it can be used to monitor link problems and bypass defective links.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
                    <p>One big disadvantage of a star topology is the dependency of the whole topology on one single point, the hub. If the hub goes down, the whole system is dead. Although a star requires far less cable than a mesh, each node must be linked to a central hub. For this reason, often more cabling is required in a star than in some other topologies (such as ring or bus).</p>

                    <h3>3. BUS:</h3>
                    <p>A bus topology is multipoint. One long cable acts as a backbone to link all the devices in a network. Nodes are connected to the bus cable by drop lines and taps. A drop line is a connection running between the device and the main cable. A tap is a connector that either splices into the main cable or punctures the sheathing of a cable to create a contact with the metallic core. As a signal travels along the backbone, some of its energy is transformed into heat. Therefore, it becomes weaker and weaker as it travels farther and farther. For this reason there is a limit on the number of taps a bus can support and on the distance between those taps.</p>
                    <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                    <p>Advantages of a bus topology include ease of installation. Backbone cable can be laid along the most efficient path, then connected to the nodes by drop lines of various lengths. In this way, a bus uses less cabling than mesh or star topologies. In a star, for example, four network devices in the same room require four lengths of cable reaching all the way to the hub. In a bus, this redundancy is eliminated. Only the backbone cable stretches through the entire facility. Each drop line has to reach only as far as the nearest point on the backbone.</p>
                    <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
                    <p>Disadvantages include difficult reconnection and fault isolation. A bus is usually designed to be optimally efficient at installation. It can therefore be difficult to add new devices. Signal reflection at the taps can cause degradation in quality. This degradation can be controlled by limiting the number and spacing of devices connected to a given length of cable. Adding new devices may therefore require modification or replacement of the backbone. In addition, a fault or break in the bus cable stops all transmission, even between devices on the same side of the problem. The damaged area reflects signals back in the direction of origin, creating noise in both directions.</p>

                    <h3>4. RING:</h3>
                    <p>In a ring topology, each device has a dedicated point-to-point connection with only the two devices on either side of it. A signal is passed along the ring in one direction, from device to device, until it reaches its destination. Each device in the ring incorporates a repeater. When a device receives a signal intended for another device, its repeater regenerates the bits and passes them along.</p>
                    <h4>Advantages:</h4>
                    <p>A ring is relatively easy to install and reconfigure. Each device is linked to only its immediate neighbors (either physically or logically). To add or delete a device requires changing only two connections. The only constraints are media and traffic considerations (maximum ring length and number of devices). In addition, fault isolation is simplified. Generally in a ring, a signal is circulating at all times. If one device does not receive a signal within a specified period, it can issue an alarm. The alarm alerts the network operator to the problem and its location.</p>
                    <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
                    <p>Unidirectional traffic can be a disadvantage. In a simple ring, a break in the ring (such as a disabled station) can disable the entire network. This weakness can be solved by using a dual ring or a switch capable of closing off the break. Ring topology was prevalent when IBM introduced its local-area network Token Ring. Today, the need for higher-speed LANs has made this topology less popular.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>üìö NETWORK CATEGORIES</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <h3>Local Area Networks (LAN):</h3>
                    <p>Local area networks, generally called LANs, are privately-owned networks within a single building or campus of up to a few kilometers in size. They are widely used to connect personal computers and workstations in company offices and factories to share resources (e.g., printers) and exchange information. LANs are distinguished from other kinds of networks by three characteristics:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Their size,</li>
                        <li>Their transmission technology, and</li>
                        <li>Their topology.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>LANs are restricted in size, which means that the worst-case transmission time is bounded and known in advance. Knowing this bound makes it possible to use certain kinds of designs that would not otherwise be possible. It also simplifies network management. LANs may use a transmission technology consisting of a cable to which all the machines are attached, like the telephone company party lines once used in rural areas. Traditional LANs run at speeds of 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps, have low delay (microseconds or nanoseconds), and make very few errors. Newer LANs operate at up to 10 Gbps.</p>

                    <h3>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):</h3>
                    <p>A metropolitan area network, or MAN, covers a city. The best-known example of a MAN is the cable television network available in many cities. This system grew from earlier community antenna systems used in areas with poor over-the-air television reception. In these early systems, a large antenna was placed on top of a nearby hill and signal was then piped to the subscribers' houses. At first, these were locally-designed, ad hoc systems. Then companies began jumping into the business, getting contracts from city governments to wire up an entire city. The next step was television programming and even entire channels designed for cable only. Often these channels were highly specialized, such as all news, all sports, all cooking, all gardening, and so on. But from their inception until the late 1990s, they were intended for television reception only. Cable television is not the only MAN. Recent developments in high-speed wireless Internet access resulted in another MAN, which has been standardized as IEEE 802.16.</p>

                    <h3>Wide Area Network (WAN):</h3>
                    <p>A wide area network, or WAN, spans a large geographical area, often a country or continent. It contains a collection of machines intended for running user (i.e., application) programs. These machines are called as hosts. The hosts are connected by a communication subnet, or just subnet for short. The hosts are owned by the customers (e.g., people's personal computers), whereas the communication subnet is typically owned and operated by a telephone company or Internet service provider. The job of the subnet is to carry messages from host to host, just as the telephone system carries words from speaker to listener. Separation of the pure communication aspects of the network (the subnet) from the application aspects (the hosts), greatly simplifies the complete network design. In most wide area networks, the subnet consists of two distinct components: transmission lines and switching elements. Transmission lines move bits between machines. They can be made of copper wire, optical fiber, or even radio links. In most WANs, the network contains numerous transmission lines, each one connecting a pair of routers. If two routers that do not share a transmission line wish to communicate, they must do this indirectly, via other routers. When a packet is sent from one router to another via one or more intermediate routers, the packet is received at each intermediate router in its entirety, stored there until the required output line is free, and then forwarded. A subnet organized according to this principle is called a store-and-forward or packet-switched subnet. Nearly all wide area networks (except those using satellites) have store-and-forward subnets. When the packets are small and all the same size, they are often called cells. The principle of a packet-switched WAN is so important. Generally, when a process on some host has a message to be sent to a process on some other host, the sending host first cuts the message into packets, each one bearing its number in the sequence. These packets are then injected into the network one at a time in quick succession. The packets are transported individually over the network and deposited at the receiving host, where they are reassembled into the original message and delivered to the receiving process. Not all WANs are packet switched. A second possibility for a WAN is a satellite system. Each router has an antenna through which it can send and receive. All routers can hear the output from the satellite, and in some cases they can also hear the upward transmissions of their fellow routers to the satellite as well. Sometimes the routers are connected to a substantial point-to-point subnet, with only some of them having a satellite antenna. Satellite networks are inherently broadcast and are most useful when the broadcast property is important.</p>
