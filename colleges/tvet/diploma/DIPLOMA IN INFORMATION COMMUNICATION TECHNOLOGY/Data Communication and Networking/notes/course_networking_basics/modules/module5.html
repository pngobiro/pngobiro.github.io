                    <h3>3. Fiber Optic Cable:</h3>
                    <p>A fiber-optic cable is made of glass or plastic and transmits signals in the form of light. To understand optical fiber, we first need to explore several aspects of the nature of light. Light travels in a straight line as long as it is moving through a single uniform If a ray of light traveling through one substance suddenly enters another substance (of a different density), the ray changes direction. Figure 7.10 shows how a ray of light changes direction when going from a more dense to a less dense substance.</p>
                     <figure class="content-image">

                        <figcaption>Figure 7.10 Bending of light ray</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>As the figure shows, if the angle of incidence I (the angle the ray makes with the line perpendicular to the interface between the two substances) is less than the critical angle, the ray refracts and moves closer to the surface. If the angle of incidence is equal to the critical angle, the light bends along the interface. If the angle is greater than the critical angle, the ray reflects (makes a turn) and travels again in the denser substance. Note that the critical angle is a property of the substance, and its value differs from one substance to another.</p>
                    <p>Optical fibers use reflection to guide light through a channel. A glass or plastic core is surrounded by a cladding of less dense glass or plastic. The difference in density of the two materials must be such that a beam of light moving through the core is reflected off the cladding instead of being refracted into it. See Figure 7.11.</p>

                    <p>Figure 7.14 shows the composition of a typical fiber-optic cable. The outer jacket is made of either PVC or Teflon. Inside the jacket are Kevlar strands to strengthen the cable. Kevlar is a strong material used in the fabrication of bulletproof vests. Below the Kevlar is another plastic coating to cushion the fiber. The fiber is at the center of the cable, and it consists of cladding and core.</p>

                    <h4>Applications</h4>
                    <p>Fiber-optic cable is often found in backbone networks because its wide bandwidth is cost-effective. Today, with wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), we can transfer data at a rate of 1600 Gbps. The SONET network provides such a backbone. Some cable TV companies use a combination of optical fiber and coaxial cable, thus creating a hybrid network. Optical fiber provides the backbone structure while coaxial cable provides the connection to the user premises. This is a cost-effective configuration since the narrow bandwidth requirement at the user end does not justify the use of optical fiber. Local-area networks such as 100Base-FX network (Fast Ethernet) and 1000Base-X also use fiber-optic cable.</p>
                    <h4>Advantages and Disadvantages of Optical Fiber</h4>
                    <h5>Advantages</h5>
                    <p>Fiber-optic cable has several advantages over metallic cable (twisted pair or coaxial).</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Higher bandwidth.</strong> Fiber-optic cable can support dramatically higher bandwidths (and hence data rates) than either twisted-pair or coaxial cable. Currently, data rates and bandwidth utilization over fiber-optic cable are limited not by the medium but by the signal generation and reception technology available.</li>
                        <li><strong>Less signal attenuation.</strong> Fiber-optic transmission distance is significantly greater than that of other guided media. A signal can run for 50 km without requiring regeneration. We need repeaters every 5 km for coaxial or twisted-pair cable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Immunity to electromagnetic interference.</strong> Electromagnetic noise cannot affect fiber-optic cables.</li>
                        <li><strong>Resistance to corrosive materials.</strong> Glass is more resistant to corrosive materials than copper.</li>
                        <li><strong>Light weight.</strong> Fiber-optic cables are much lighter than copper cables.</li>
                        <li><strong>Greater immunity to tapping.</strong> Fiber-optic cables are more immune to tapping than copper cables. Copper cables create antenna effects that can easily be tapped.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
                    <p>There are some disadvantages in the use of optical fiber.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Installation and maintenance.</strong> Fiber-optic cable is a relatively new technology. Its installation and maintenance require expertise that is not yet available everywhere.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unidirectional light propagation.</strong> Propagation of light is unidirectional. If we need bidirectional communication, two fibers are needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost.</strong> The cable and the interfaces are relatively more expensive than those of other guided media. If the demand for bandwidth is not high, often the use of optical fiber cannot be justified.</li>

                <h2>üìö UNGUIDED MEDIA: WIRELESS</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Unguided media transport electromagnetic waves without using a physical conductor. This type of communication is often referred to as wireless communication. Signals are normally broadcast through free space and thus are available to anyone who has a device capable of receiving them. Unguided signals can travel from the source to destination in several ways: ground propagation, sky propagation, and line-of-sight propagation, as shown in Figure 7.18. In ground propagation, radio waves travel through the lowest portion of the atmosphere, hugging the earth. These low-frequency signals emanate in all directions from the transmitting antenna and follow the curvature of the planet. Distance depends on the amount of power in the signal: The greater the power, the greater the distance. In sky propagation, higher-frequency radio waves radiate upward into the ionosphere where they are reflected back to earth. This type of transmission allows for greater distances with lower output power. In line-or-sight propagation, very high-frequency signals are transmitted in straight lines directly from antenna to antenna. Antennas must be directional, facing each other, and either tall enough or close enough together not to be affected by the curvature of the earth. Line-of-sight propagation is tricky because radio transmissions cannot be completely focused.</p>

                    <h3>1. Radio Waves</h3>
                    <p>Waves ranging in frequencies between 3 kHz and 1 GHz are called radio waves. Radio waves, for the most part, are omnidirectional. When an antenna transmits radio waves, they are propagated in all directions. This means that the sending and receiving antennas do not have to be aligned. A sending antenna sends waves that can be received by any receiving antenna. The omnidirectional property has a disadvantage, too. The radio waves transmitted by one antenna are susceptible to interference by another antenna that may send signals using the same frequency or band. Radio waves, particularly those waves that propagate in the sky mode, can travel long distances. This makes radio waves a good candidate for long-distance broadcasting such as AM radio. Radio waves, particularly those of low and medium frequencies, can penetrate walls. This characteristic can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. It is an advantage because, for example, an AM radio can receive signals inside a building. It is a disadvantage because we cannot isolate a communication to just inside or outside a building. The radio wave band is relatively narrow, just under 1 GHz, compared to the microwave band. When this band is divided into sub bands, the sub bands are also narrow, leading to a low data rate for digital communications.</p>

                    <h3>2. Microwaves</h3>
                    <p>Electromagnetic waves having frequencies between I and 300 GHz are called microwaves. Microwaves are unidirectional. When an antenna transmits microwave waves, they can be narrowly focused. This means that the sending and receiving antennas need to be aligned. The unidirectional property has an obvious advantage. A pair of antennas can be aligned without interfering with another pair of aligned antennas. The following describes some characteristics of microwave propagation:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Microwave propagation is line-of-sight. Since the towers with the mounted antennas need to be in direct sight of each other, towers that are far apart need to be very tall. The curvature of the earth as well as other blocking obstacles do not allow two short towers to communicate by using microwaves. Repeaters are often needed for long distance communication.</li>
                        <li>Very high-frequency microwaves cannot penetrate walls. This characteristic can be a disadvantage if receivers are inside buildings.</li>
                        <li>The microwave band is relatively wide, almost 299 GHz. Therefore wider sub bands can be assigned, and a high data rate is possible</li>
                        <li>Use of certain portions of the band requires permission from authorities.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Unidirectional Antenna</h4>
                    <p>Microwaves need unidirectional antennas that send out signals in one direction. Two types of antennas are used for microwave communications: the parabolic dish and the horn (see Figure 7.21). A parabolic dish antenna is based on the geometry of a parabola: Every line parallel to the line of symmetry (line of sight) reflects off the curve at angles such that all the lines intersect in a common point called the focus. The parabolic dish works as a funnel, catching a wide range of waves and directing them to a common point. In this way, more of the signal is recovered than would be possible with a single-point receiver. Outgoing transmissions are broadcast through a horn aimed at the dish. The microwaves hit the dish and are deflected outward in a reversal of the receipt path. A horn antenna looks like a gigantic scoop. Outgoing transmissions are broadcast up a stem (resembling a handle) and deflected outward in a series of narrow parallel beams by the curved head. Received transmissions are collected by the scooped shape of the horn, in a manner similar to the parabolic dish, and are deflected down into the stem.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <h3>3. Infrared</h3>
                    <p>Infrared waves, with frequencies from 300 GHz to 400 THz (wavelengths from 1 mm to 770 nm), can be used for short-range communication. Infrared waves, having high frequencies, cannot penetrate walls. This advantageous characteristic prevents interference between one system and another; a short-range communication system in one room cannot be affected by another system in the next room. When we use our infrared remote control, we do not interfere with the use of the remote by our neighbors. However, this same characteristic makes infrared signals useless for long-range communication. In addition, we cannot use infrared waves outside a building because the sun's rays contain infrared waves that can interfere with the communication.</p>
                    <h4>Applications</h4>
                    <p>The infrared band, almost 400 THz, has an excellent potential for data transmission. Such a wide bandwidth can be used to transmit digital data with a very high data rate. The Infrared Data Association (IrDA), an association for sponsoring the use of infrared waves, has established standards for using these signals for communication between devices such as keyboards, mice, PCs, and printers. For example, some manufacturers provide a special port called the IrDA port that allows a wireless keyboard to communicate with a PC. The standard originally defined a data rate of 75 kbps for a distance up to 8 m. The recent standard defines a data rate of 4 Mbps. Infrared signals defined by IrDA transmit through line of sight; the IrDA port on the keyboard needs to point to the PC for transmission to occur.</p>

                <h2>üìö SWITCHING</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>A network is a set of connected devices. Whenever we have multiple devices, we have the problem of how to connect them to make one-to-one communication possible. One solution is to make a point-to-point connection between each pair of devices (a mesh topology) or between a central device and every other device (a star topology). These methods, however, are impractical and wasteful when applied to very large networks. The number and length of the links require too much infrastructure to be cost-efficient, and the majority of those links would be idle most of the time. Other topologies employing multipoint connections, such as a bus, are ruled out because the distances between devices and the total number of devices increase beyond the capacities of the media and equipment.</p>
                    <p>A better solution is <i>switching</i>. A switched network consists of a series of interlinked nodes, called switches. Switches are devices capable of creating temporary connections between two or more devices linked to the switch. In a switched network, some of these nodes are connected to the end systems (computers or telephones, for example). Others are used only for routing. Figure 8.1 shows a switched network.</p>

                    <p>The end systems (communicating devices) are labeled A, B, C, D, and so on, and the switches are labeled I, II, III, IV, and V. Each switch is connected to multiple links. Traditionally, three methods of switching have been important: circuit switching, packet switching, and message switching. The first two are commonly used today. The third has been phased out in general communications but still has networking applications. We can then divide today's networks into three broad categories: circuit-switched networks, packet-switched networks, and message-switched.</p>

                    <h3>1. CIRCUIT-SWITCHED NETWORKS</h3>
                    <p>A circuit-switched network consists of a set of switches connected by physical links. A connection between two stations is a dedicated path made of one or more links. However, each connection uses only one dedicated channel on each link. Each link is normally divided into n channels by using FDM or TDM. Figure 8.3 shows a trivial circuit-switched network with four switches and four links. Each link is divided into n (n is 3 in the figure) channels by using FDM or TDM.</p>
                     <figure class="content-image">
                        <img src="../assets/diagrams/circuit_switched_network.png"
                             alt="Diagram illustrating A trivial circuit-switched network."

                    </figure>
                    <p>The end systems, such as computers or telephones, are directly connected to a switch. We have shown only two end systems for simplicity. When end system A needs to communicate with end system M, system A needs to request a connection to M that must be accepted by all switches as well as by M itself. This is called the setup phase; a circuit (channel) is reserved on each link, and the combination of circuits or channels defines the dedicated path. After the dedicated path made of connected circuits (channels) is established, data transfer can take place. After all data have been transferred, the circuits are torn down.</p>
                    <h4>Three Phases</h4>
                    <p>The actual communication in a circuit-switched network requires three phases: connection setup, data transfer, and connection teardown.</p>

                    <h3>2. PACKET SWITCHED NETWORK</h3>
                    <p>In a Computer Network, the communication between two ends is done in blocks of data called packets. So instead of continuous communication the exchange takes place in the form of individual packets between the two computers. This allows us to make the switches function for both storing and forwarding because a packet is an independent entity that can be stored and sent later.</p>
                    <h4>a. DATAGRAM NETWORKS</h4>
                    <p>In data communications, we need to send messages from one end system to another. If the message is going to pass through a packet-switched network, it needs to be divided into packets of fixed or variable size. The size of the packet is determined by the network and the governing protocol. In packet switching, there is no resource allocation for a packet. This means that there is no reserved bandwidth on the links, and there is no scheduled processing time for each packet. Resources are allocated on demand. The allocation is done on a first come, first-served basis. When a switch receives a packet, no matter what is the source or destination, the packet must wait if there are other packets being processed. As with other systems in our daily life, this lack of reservation may create delay. For example, if we do not have a reservation at a restaurant, we might have to wait. In a datagram network, each packet is treated independently of all others. Even if a packet is part of a multipacket transmission, the network treats it as though it existed alone. Packets in this approach are referred to as datagrams. Datagram switching is normally done at the network layer. The switches in a datagram network are traditionally referred to as routers.</p>
                     <figure class="content-image">

                    <h4>b. VIRTUAL-CIRCUIT NETWORKS</h4>
                    <p>A virtual-circuit network is a cross between a circuit-switched network and a datagram network. It has some characteristics of both.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>As in a circuit-switched network, there are setup and teardown phases in addition to the data transfer phase.</li>
                        <li>Resources can be allocated during the setup phase, as in a circuit-switched network, or on demand, as in a datagram network.</li>
                        <li>As in a datagram network, data are packetized and each packet carries an address in the header. However, the address in the header has local jurisdiction, not end-to-end jurisdiction. The reader may ask how the intermediate switches know where to send the packet if there is no final destination address carried by a packet.</li>
                        <li>As in a circuit-switched network, all packets follow the same path established during the connection.</li>
                        <li>A virtual-circuit network is normally implemented in the data link layer, while a circuit-switched network is implemented in the physical layer and a datagram network in the network layer. But this may change in the future.</li>
                    </ol>
