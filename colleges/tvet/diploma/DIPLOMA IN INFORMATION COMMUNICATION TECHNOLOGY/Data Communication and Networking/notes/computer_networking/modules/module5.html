        <h3>a) Creating a Network Test Plan</h3>
        <p>📚 To prepare a plan to test the network. The plan defines the scope, approach, criteria, schedule, responsibilities, resources, and procedures.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="define-objectives">
        <h4>i. Define Objectives</h4>
        <p>📚 Define the objectives of the test by identifying the areas of the network to be tested including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>📚 <strong>Volume Testing</strong>. Ensures that the network operates smoothly when subjected to production volumes of data over long periods of time.</li>
          <li>📚 <strong>Stress Testing</strong>. Ensures that the network operates smoothly when subjected to the maximum load expected in production, all at one time. A good rule of thumb is to subject the network to 25 percent more data and processing than is expected during peak loads.</li>
          <li>📚 <strong>Recovery Testing</strong>. Ensures that backup and recovery procedures are working properly.</li>
          <li>📚 <strong>Security Testing</strong>. Verifies that the network meets the security requirements.</li>
          <li>📚 <strong>Performance Testing</strong>. Verifies that performance criteria are met (e.g., response times).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="define-acceptance-criteria">
        <h4>ii. Define Acceptance Criteria</h4>

      </section>

      <section id="network-performance-testing-tools">
        <h3>b) Network Performance Testing Tools</h3>
        <p>📚 Whenever you suspect something wrong with the performance of a network, your best course of action is to run some tests to confirm that there is indeed an issue and also to help you locate it and, eventually, fix it. There are many network performance testing tools available. So many that picking the one that is the best fit for your specific need can turn out to be a hefty challenge.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="what-is-network-performance">
        <h3>c) What is network performance?</h3>
        <p>📚 Network performance refers to measures of service quality of a network as seen by the customer”. There are three essential elements to that definition. The first is the measures part. It established clearly that network performance is something one has to measure. The next important bit is the service quality of a network. Service quality is a generic concept but, as you'll see, a few specific metrics are associated with it. The last important part is the customer. We're not interested in network performance as a theoretical thing. What we need to measure is the true user experience.</p>
        <p>📚 Several different factors affect perceived network performance and are generally considered important. The first two are bandwidth and throughput but there is often some confusion between these two terms. Bandwidth refers to the carrying capacity of a network. As an analogy, think of it as the number of lanes in a highway. Throughput, on the other hand, refers to the actual usage of the available bandwidth. To keep our previous analogy, a four-lane highway has a bandwidth of 4 000 vehicles per hour but its current throughput could be only 400 vehicles per hours or 10% of its capacity.</p>
        <p>📚 Latency, delay, and jitter are more factor affecting the perceived performance of networks. Latency refers to the time data takes to travel from source to destination. It is mainly a function of the signal's travel time and processing time at any nodes it traverses. It is a physical limitation that cannot be reduced. Delay, on the other hand, can sometimes be improved. It has to do with the time it takes for networking equipment to process, queue, and forward data. Faster, more powerful equipment will generally add less delay to the transmission. As for jitter, it refers to the variation in packet delay at the receiving end of the conversation. Real-time or near-real-time traffic is particularly affected by it as it can cause data packets to arrive out of sequence. In the case of voice over IP, for example, this could result in unintelligible speech.</p>
        <p>📚 Many other factors can also affect network performance. The error rate is one of them. It refers to the number of corrupted bits expressed as a percentage or fraction of the total sent.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="testing-the-network">
        <h3>d) Testing the Network</h3>
        <p>📚 How does one go about measuring performance from a true user's perspective? Well, there is, of course, the possibility of having real users running tests but this can tend to be rather impractical. The next best thing is using a network performance testing system that uses probes deployed at strategic location throughout your network and that can run actual simulation tests between each other to measure true performance using specific types of traffic. This, however, can also tend to be impractical as it requires some preliminary setup. It won't be of much assistance to help troubleshoot a sudden issue.</p>
        <p>📚 In these cases, what you need is a quick and dirty solution. A simple application that you can quickly deploy or install at either end of the segment you need to test and that will let you manually configure and run simulation tests.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="testing-vs-monitoring">
        <h3>e) Testing vs monitoring</h3>
        <p>📚 Another important distinction to be made is the one between performance monitoring and performance testing. These are two similar concepts but there are a few differences. The basic idea is the same: simulating real user traffic and measuring the actual performance of the network. Where it differs is in how and when it is done. Monitoring systems run constantly and perform recurring tests between preconfigured locations and using predefined simulation models. A dashboard will typically be available to display the latest test results and reports can often be generated for various purposes.</p>
        <p>📚 Testing is different in that it is typically an ad-hoc process that is run manually whenever a problem is reported or suspected. Tests are also typically run between two specific points on the network where one suspects a problem is. The test will often help identify and pinpoint the problem.</p>

      <section id="network-testing-tools">
        <h3>f) Network testing tools</h3>
        <section id="clamp-meter">
          <h5>i. Clamp Meter</h5>
          <p>📚 A clamp meter is an electrical test tool that combines a basic digital multimeter with a current sensor.</p>
          <p>📚 Clamps measure current. Probes measure voltage. Having a hinged jaw integrated into an electrical meter allows technicians to clamp the jaws around a wire, cable or other conductor at any point in an electrical system, then measure current in that circuit without disconnecting/deenergizing it.</p>
          <p>📚 Beneath their plastic moldings, hard jaws consist of ferrite iron and are engineered to detect, concentrate and measure the magnetic field being generated by current as it flows through a conductor.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="voltmeter">
          <h5>ii. Voltmeter</h5>
          <p>📚 A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog-to-digital converter.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="cable-tester-signal-tester">
          <h5>iii. Cable Tester/ Signal Tester</h5>
          <p>📚 A cable tester is a device used to test the strength and connectivity of a particular type of cable or other wired assemblies. There are many different types of cable testers. Each of them can test a specific type of cable or wire (some may be able to test different types of cables or wires). A cable tester can test whether a cable or wire is set up properly, connected correctly, and the signal strength between the source and destination.</p>

        <section id="lan-speed-test">
          <h5>2. LAN Speed Test</h5>
          <p>📚 LAN Speed Test from TotuSoft is a simple but powerful tool for measuring file transfer, hard drive, USB Drive, and network speeds. All you need to do is pick a destination on the server where you want to test the WAN connection. The tool will then build a file in memory and transfer it both ways while measuring the time it takes. It then does all the calculations for you and gives you an evaluation of the transfer's performance.</p>
           <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/module4-lan-speed-test-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of LAN Speed Test interface" width="600" height="500">

        </section>

        <section id="lan-bench">
          <h5>3. LAN Bench</h5>
          <p>📚 Despite the fact that its developer's site no longer exists, LAN Bench from Zack Saw is still readily available for download from several software download websites. It is a free and portable TCP network benchmarking utility. The tool is based on Winsock 2.2, a rather old framework but one with minimal CPU usage. That way, you can be reasonably sure that poor CPU performance won't come and pollute your network performance test results. All the tool does is test the network performance between two computers but what it does, it does well.</p>
           <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/module4-lanbench-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of LAN Bench interface" width="300" height="400">
            <figcaption>Figure 69: LAN Bench</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>📚 You'll need to run LAN Bench on two computers at either end of the network segment you want to test. One instance runs as the server and the other one is the client. The server-side requires no configuration. All you need to do is click the Listen button. The tool's testing configuration is all done on the client side, before starting the test. You will need to specify the server's IP address and you can adjust several testing parameters such as the total duration of the test, the packet size used for testing, as well as the connection and transfer mode.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="netio-netio-gui">
          <h5>4. NetIO & NetIO-GUI</h5>
          <p>📚 NetIO-GUI is actually a free front end for the multi-platform command line utility NetIO. Together, they form a very potent performance testing tool. It can be used to measures ICMP response times as well as network transfer speeds for different packet sizes and protocols. All the results are stored in an SQLite database and can easily be compared. This Windows tool is available either as an installable software or as a portable tool.</p>
           <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/module4-netio-gui-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of NetIO-GUI interface" width="600" height="500">
            <figcaption>Figure 70: NetIO-GUI</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>📚 In order to run tests, you need two instances of the tool, one at either end. One side will run in client mode while the other will run in server mode. Using it is rather simple, once you have it running at both ends, you click the start button on the server (typically running at the far end) and, on the client, you simply enter the server's IP address and pick the protocol (TCP or UDP) that you want to use to run the test. You start the test and let NetIO test the connectivity using various packet sizes before it returns the test results.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="netstress">
          <h5>5. NetStress</h5>
          <p>📚 Initially created as an internal tool by Nuts About Nets, NetStress has since started being offered to the public. It is yet another free and simple network benchmarking tool. Like most other similar products, you'll have to run the tool on two computers at either end of the network that you need to test. It is somewhat easier to use than other tools because it can automatically find the receiver IP address.</p>
           <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/module4-netstress-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of NetStress interface" width="600" height="500">
            <figcaption>Figure 71: NetStress</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>📚 Running a test with NetStress is very simple, although some might not find it self-explanatory. What you need to do is click on the 0.0.0.0 next to Remote Received IP. You then select the IP address that is listed in the window and click OK. Doing that will enable the Start button. Once enabled, you simply click it and the tool starts testing and measuring the TCP and UDP throughput. An interesting option found in this tool the ability to modify the MTU size used for testing. Despite some quirks such as the inability to resize its full-screen window, NetStress is a pretty good tool.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="aida32">
          <h5>6. Aida32</h5>
          <p>📚 Aida32 is officially a discontinued product that has been replaced by Aida64 but this older version still very popular and easy to find. Aida is a hardware information and benchmarking tool that can perform many different tests. The reason this specific and older version has made it to our list is because it includes an excellent Network Benchmark tool which is no longer available in recent versions. Using the plugin is easy and it can be started from the tool's Plugin Menu</p>
           <figure>
            <img src="../assets/images/module4-aida-32-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of AIDA 32 interface" width="400" height="500">
            <figcaption>Figure 72: AIDA 32</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>📚 Aida32 tool is not very different in its operations from most others on this list and you'll need to run it at both ends of the path you want to test. On one of the computers, you need to select Master from the drop-down list that you'll find at the bottom of the tool's window. You then go to the Bandwidth tab and click the Start button. On the other computer, you select Slave instead of Master and enter the IP address of the master. Just like you did on the master, you go to the Bandwidth tab and click Start. Once the test completes, the Save button can be used to conveniently save the bandwidth chart in bitmap format.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="performancetest">
          <h5>7. PerformanceTest</h5>
          <p>📚 Pass Mark's Performance Test is a complete PC performance benchmarking software. It made it to our list because it features a pretty decent advanced network testing tool that one can use to run network performance tests. The too can run tests on both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. Furthermore, it will let users set the data block size used for testing. It will also allow you to enable UDP bandwidth throttling if you so desire. The network module is well-hidden within the PerformanceTest application. You can access it by clicking advanced and then Network from the tool's menu bar.</p>

          <li>📝 <strong>What is network performance?</strong>
            <p>Network performance refers to measures of service quality of a network as seen by the customer”. There are three essential elements to that definition. The first is the measures part. It established clearly that network performance is something one has to measure. The next important bit is the service quality of a network. Service quality is a generic concept but, as you'll see, a few specific metrics are associated with it. The last important part is the customer. We're not interested in network performance as a theoretical thing. What we need to measure is the true user experience.</p>
          </li>
          <li>📝 <strong>Create a distinction between network testing and network monitoring.</strong>
            <p>These are two similar concepts but there are a few differences. The basic idea is the same: simulating real user traffic and measuring the actual performance of the network. Where it differs is in how and when it is done. Monitoring systems run constantly and perform recurring tests between preconfigured locations and using predefined simulation models. A dashboard will typically be available to display the latest test results and reports can often be generated for various purposes.</p>
            <p>Testing is different in that it is typically an ad-hoc process that is run manually whenever a problem is reported or suspected. Tests are also typically run between two specific points on the network where one suspects a problem is. The test will often help identify and pinpoint the problem.</p>
