        <h3>a) What is Network Configuration?</h3>
        <p>📚 Network configuration allows a system administrator to set up a network to meet communication objectives. The process involves the following tasks.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>📚 Router configuration: Specifies the correct IP addresses and route settings, etc.</li>
          <li>📚 Host configuration: Sets up a network connection on a host computer/laptop by logging the default network settings, such as IP addressing, proxy, network name and ID/password, to enable network connection and communication.</li>
          <li>📚 Software configuration: Any network-based software, like an intrusion detection system (IDS), is allowed access and provided with the appropriate credentials to monitor network traffic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>📚 Moreover, network configuration includes Internet/network sharing, software/application installation and firewall installation/configuration.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="network-architecture">
        <h3>b) Network architecture</h3>
        <p>📚 Network architecture refers to the way network devices and services are structured to serve the connectivity needs of client devices.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>📚 Network devices typically include switches and routers.</li>
          <li>📚 Types of services include DHCP and DNS.</li>
          <li>📚 Client devices comprise end-user devices, servers, and smart things.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="ethernet-tcp-ip-suites">
        <h3>c) Ethernet and TCP/IP suites</h3>
        <p>📚 Ethernet is a layer 2 data link protocol that is widely used with the TCP/IP protocol, which resides at layers 3 and 4. To understand network communications, it is essential to learn about the protocol layers (see OSI model below).</p>
        <p>📚 The IP layer 3 breaks apart the data being transmitted into variable length packets, known as "Ethernet frames," up to 1,500 bytes long. Each frame has a header containing source and destination addresses and a trailer with error correction data.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="tcp-ip-ensures-complete-delivery">
        <h3>d) TCP/IP Ensures Complete Delivery</h3>
        <p>📚 Ethernet transmits the frames from one node to the next and only guarantees that if the frame arrives, it arrived intact. If a frame goes missing, it is none the wiser. However, the TCP part of TCP/IP ensures that the entire set of data has been delivered intact. For details about the protocols, see data link protocol, CSMA/CD, TCP/IP and Internet protocol</p>
      </section>

      <section id="network-protocols">
        <h3>e) Network protocols</h3>
        <p>📚 Network protocols are a set of rules, conventions, and data structures that dictate how devices exchange data across networks. In other words, network protocols can be equated to languages that two devices must understand for seamless communication of information, regardless of their infrastructure and design disparities.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="osi-model-how-network-protocols-work">
        <h3>b. The OSI model: How network protocols work</h3>
        <p>📚 To understand the nuances of network protocols, it's imperative to know about the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model first. Considered the primary architectural model for internet working communications, the majority of network protocols used today are structurally based on the OSI model.</p>
        <p>📚 The OSI model splits the communication process between two network devices into 7 layers. A task or group of tasks is assigned to each of these 7 layers. All the layers are self-contained, and the tasks assigned to them can be executed independently.</p>
        <p>📚 To put this into context, here is a representation of the communication process between two network devices following the OSI model:</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module3-osi-model.png" alt="Diagram of OSI Model Layers" width="600" height="500">
          <figcaption>Figure 52: OSI Model</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>📚 The seven layers in the OSI model can be divided into two groups: upper layers, including layers 7, 6, and 5, and lower layers, including layers 4, 3, 2, and 1. The upper layers deal with application issues, and the lower layers deal with data transport issues.</p>
        <p>📚 Network protocols divide the communication process into discrete tasks across every layer of the OSI model. One or more network protocols operate at each layer in the communication exchange.</p>

        <h3>c. TCP/IP model</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>📚 The TCP/IP model was developed prior to the OSI model.</li>
          <li>📚 The TCP/IP model is not exactly similar to the OSI model.</li>
          <li>📚 The TCP/IP model consists of five layers: the application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer and physical layer.</li>
          <li>📚 The first four layers provide physical standards, network interface, internetworking, and transport functions that correspond to the first four layers of the OSI model and these four layers are represented in TCP/IP model by a single layer called the application layer.</li>
          <li>📚 TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, and each of them provides specific functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>📚 Here, hierarchical means that each upper-layer protocol is supported by two or more lower-level protocols.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>📚 A network layer is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP model.</li>
            <li>📚 A network layer is the combination of the Physical layer and Data Link layer defined in the OSI reference model.</li>
            <li>📚 It defines how the data should be sent physically through the network.</li>
            <li>📚 This layer is mainly responsible for the transmission of the data between two devices on the same network.</li>
            <li>📚 The functions carried out by this layer are encapsulating the IP datagram into frames transmitted by the network and mapping of IP addresses into physical addresses.</li>
            <li>📚 The protocols used by this layer are ethernet, token ring, FDDI, X.25, frame relay.</li>

        <section id="internet-layer">
          <h5>ii. Internet Layer</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>📚 An internet layer is the second layer of the TCP/IP model.</li>
            <li>📚 An internet layer is also known as the network layer.</li>
            <li>📚 The main responsibility of the internet layer is to send the packets from any network, and they arrive at the destination irrespective of the route they take.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>📚 Following are the protocols used in this layer:</p>
          <section id="ip-protocol">
            <h6>IP Protocol</h6>
            <p>📚 IP protocol is used in this layer, and it is the most significant part of the entire TCP/IP suite.</p>
            <p>📚 Following are the responsibilities of this protocol:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>📚 <strong>IP Addressing</strong>: This protocol implements logical host addresses known as IP addresses. The IP addresses are used by the internet and higher layers to identify the device and to provide internetwork routing.</li>
              <li>📚 <strong>Host-to-host communication</strong>: It determines the path through which the data is to be transmitted.</li>
              <li>📚 <strong>Data Encapsulation and Formatting</strong>: An IP protocol accepts the data from the transport layer protocol. An IP protocol ensures that the data is sent and received securely, it encapsulates the data into message known as IP datagram.</li>
              <li>📚 <strong>Fragmentation and Reassembly</strong>: The limit imposed on the size of the IP datagram by data link layer protocol is known as Maximum Transmission unit (MTU). If the size of IP datagram is greater than the MTU unit, then the IP protocol splits the datagram into smaller units so that they can travel over the local network. Fragmentation can be done by the sender or intermediate router. At the receiver side, all the fragments are reassembled to form an original message.</li>
              <li>📚 <strong>Routing</strong>: When IP datagram is sent over the same local network such as LAN, MAN, WAN, it is known as direct delivery. When source and destination are on the distant network, then the IP datagram is sent indirectly. This can be accomplished by routing the IP datagram through various devices such as routers.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section id="arp-protocol">
            <h6>ARP Protocol</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>📚 ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol.</li>
              <li>📚 ARP is a network layer protocol which is used to find the physical address from the IP address.</li>
              <li>📚 The two terms are mainly associated with the ARP Protocol:
                <ul>
                  <li>📚 <strong>ARP request</strong>: When a sender wants to know the physical address of the device, it broadcasts the ARP request to the network.</li>
                  <li>📚 <strong>ARP reply</strong>: Every device attached to the network will accept the ARP request and process the request, but only recipient recognize the IP address and sends back its physical address in the form of ARP reply. The recipient adds the physical address both to its cache memory and to the datagram header</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section id="icmp-protocol">
            <h6>ICMP Protocol</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>📚 ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol.</li>
              <li>📚 It is a mechanism used by the hosts or routers to send notifications regarding datagram problems back to the sender.</li>
              <li>📚 A datagram travels from router-to-router until it reaches its destination. If a router is unable to route the data because of some unusual conditions such as disabled links, a device is on fire or network congestion, then the ICMP protocol is used to inform the sender that the datagram is undeliverable.</li>
              <li>📚 An ICMP protocol mainly uses two terms:
                <ul>
                  <li>📚 <strong>ICMP Test</strong>: ICMP Test is used to test whether the destination is reachable or not.</li>
                  <li>📚 <strong>ICMP Reply</strong>: ICMP Reply is used to check whether the destination device is responding or not.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>📚 The core responsibility of the ICMP protocol is to report the problems, not correct them. The responsibility of the correction lies with the sender.</li>
              <li>📚 ICMP can send the messages only to the source, but not to the intermediate routers because the IP datagram carries the addresses of the source and destination but not of the router that it is passed to.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section id="transport-layer">
          <h5>iii. Transport Layer</h5>
          <p>📚 The transport layer is responsible for the reliability, flow control, and correction of data which is being sent over the network.</p>
          <p>📚 The two protocols used in the transport layer are User Datagram protocol and Transmission control protocol.</p>

          <section id="user-datagram-protocol-udp">
            <h6>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>📚 It provides connectionless service and end-to-end delivery of transmission.</li>
              <li>📚 It is an unreliable protocol as it discovers the errors but not specify the error.</li>
              <li>📚 User Datagram Protocol discovers the error, and ICMP protocol reports the error to the sender that user datagram has been damaged.</li>
              <li>📚 UDP consists of the following fields:
                <ul>
                  <li>📚 <strong>Source port address</strong>: The source port address is the address of the application program that has created the message.</li>
                  <li>📚 <strong>Destination port address</strong>: The destination port address is the address of the application program that receives the message.</li>
                  <li>📚 <strong>Total length</strong>: It defines the total number of bytes of the user datagram in bytes.</li>
                  <li>📚 <strong>Checksum</strong>: The checksum is a 16-bit field used in error detection.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>📚 UDP does not specify which packet is lost. UDP contains only checksum; it does not contain any ID of a data segment.</li>
            </ul>

          <section id="transmission-control-protocol-tcp">
            <h6>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>📚 It provides a full transport layer services to applications.</li>
              <li>📚 It creates a virtual circuit between the sender and receiver, and it is active for the duration of the transmission.</li>
              <li>📚 TCP is a reliable protocol as it detects the error and retransmits the damaged frames. Therefore, it ensures all the segments must be received and acknowledged before the transmission is considered to be completed and a virtual circuit is discarded.</li>
              <li>📚 At the sending end, TCP divides the whole message into smaller units known as segment, and each segment contains a sequence number which is required for reordering the frames to form an original message.</li>
              <li>📚 At the receiving end, TCP collects all the segments and reorders them based on sequence numbers.</li>

        <section id="application-layer">
          <h5>iv. Application Layer</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>📚 An application layer is the topmost layer in the TCP/IP model.</li>
            <li>📚 It is responsible for handling high-level protocols, issues of representation.</li>
            <li>📚 This layer allows the user to interact with the application.</li>
            <li>📚 When one application layer protocol wants to communicate with another application layer, it forwards its data to the transport layer.</li>
            <li>📚 There is an ambiguity occurs in the application layer. Every application cannot be placed inside the application layer except those who interact with the communication system. For example: text editor cannot be considered in application layer while web browser using HTTP protocol to interact with the network where HTTP protocol is an application layer protocol.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>📚 Following are the main protocols used in the application layer:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>📚 <strong>HTTP</strong>: HTTP stands for Hypertext transfer protocol. This protocol allows us to access the data over the World Wide Web. It transfers the data in the form of plain text, audio, video. It is known as a Hypertext transfer protocol as it has the efficiency to use in a hypertext environment where there are rapid jumps from one document to another.</li>
            <li>📚 <strong>SNMP</strong>: SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. It is a framework used for managing the devices on the internet by using the TCP/IP protocol suite.</li>
            <li>📚 <strong>SMTP</strong>: SMTP stands for Simple mail transfer protocol. The TCP/IP protocol that supports the e-mail is known as a Simple mail transfer protocol. This protocol is used to send the data to another e-mail address.</li>
            <li>📚 <strong>DNS</strong>: DNS stands for Domain Name System. An IP address is used to identify the connection of a host to the internet uniquely. But, people prefer to use the names instead of addresses. Therefore, the system that maps the name to the address is known as Domain Name System.</li>
            <li>📚 <strong>TELNET</strong>: It is an abbreviation for Terminal Network. It establishes the connection between the local computer and remote computer in such a way that the local terminal appears to be a terminal at the remote system.</li>
            <li>📚 <strong>FTP</strong>: FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is a standard internet protocol used for transmitting the files from one computer to another computer.</li>

        <h3>f) Network Operating System</h3>
        <p>📚 An operating system (OS) is basically a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. Operating system is a crucial component of the system software in a computer system.</p>
        <p>📚 Network Operating System is one of the important type of operating system.</p>
        <p>📚 Network Operating System runs on a server and gives the server the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions. The basic purpose of the network operating system is to allow shared file and printer access among multiple computers in a network, typically a local area network (LAN), a private network or to other networks.</p>

        <h4>Types of network operating systems</h4>
        <p>📚 There are two basic types of network operating systems, the peer-to-peer NOS and the client/server NOS:</p>
        <section id="peer-to-peer-network-operating-systems">
          <h5>1. Peer-to-peer network operating systems</h5>
          <p>📚 Peer-to-peer network operating systems allow users to share network resources saved in a common, accessible network location. In this architecture, all devices are treated equally in terms of functionality. Peer-to-peer usually works best for small to medium LANs and is cheaper to set up.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="client-server-network-operating-systems">
          <h5>2. Client/server network operating systems</h5>
          <p>📚 Client/server network operating systems provide users with access to resources through a server. In this architecture, all functions and applications are unified under one file server that can be used to execute individual client actions regardless of physical location. Client/server tends to be most expensive to implement and requires a large amount of technical maintenance. An advantage to the client/server model is that the network is controlled centrally, makes changes or additions to technology easier to incorporate.</p>

      <section id="examples-network-operating-systems">
        <h4>Examples of network operating systems</h4>
        <p>📚 True network operating systems are categorized as software that enhances the functionality of operating systems by providing added network features. A few examples of these network operating systems and their service providers are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>📚 Artisoft's LANtastic- This is a simple, user-friendly NOS that supports most PC operating systems.</li>
          <li>📚 Banyan's VINES- This uses a client-server architecture to request specific functions and services.</li>
          <li>📚 Novell's NetWare- This was the first network operating system to be released and is designed based on XNS protocol architecture.</li>
          <li>📚 Microsoft's LAN Manager- This operates as a server application and was developed to run under the Microsoft OS. Now, most of the functionality of LAN Manager is included in the Windows OS itself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>📚 In addition, some multi-purpose operating systems, such as Windows NT and Digital's OpenVMS come with capabilities that enable them to be described as a network operating system. Further, the most popular operating systems like Windows, UNIX, Linux and Mac include built-in networking functions that may not require additional network services.</p>

        <h2>2.2.3.8 Model Answers to Self-Assessment</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>📝 <strong>What are Network protocols?</strong>
            <p>Network protocols are a set of rules, conventions, and data structures that dictate how devices exchange data across networks.</p>
          </li>
          <li>📝 <strong>Illustrate how network protocols work using the OSI model.</strong>
            <p>The OSI model splits the communication process between two network devices into 7 layers. A task or group of tasks is assigned to each of these 7 layers. All the layers are self-contained, and the tasks assigned to them can be executed independently.</p>
          </li>
          <li>📝 <strong>What is ARP and which two terms are associated with this protocol?</strong>
            <p>ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. ARP is a network layer protocol which is used to find the physical address from the IP address.</p>
            <p>The two terms are mainly associated with the ARP Protocol:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>ARP request</strong>: When a sender wants to know the physical address of the device, it broadcasts the ARP request to the network.</li>
              <li><strong>ARP reply</strong>: Every device attached to the network will accept the ARP request and process the request, but only recipient recognize the IP address and sends back its physical address in the form of ARP reply. The recipient adds the physical address both to its cache memory and to the datagram header</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>📝 <strong>What is a Network Operating System?</strong>
            <p>A network Operating system is one of the important type of operating system. Network Operating System runs on a server and gives the server the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions. The basic purpose of the network operating system is to allow shared file and printer access among multiple computers in a network, typically a local area network (LAN), a private network or to other networks.</p>
