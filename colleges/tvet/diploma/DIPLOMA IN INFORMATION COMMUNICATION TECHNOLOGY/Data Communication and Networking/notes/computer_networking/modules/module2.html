        <h3>a) Network connection media</h3>
        <p>📚 In network communications, a connection or transmission medium is a physical connection or an interface between the transmitter and the receiver. There are two major categories of transmission media, namely:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>📚 Wired or guided and</li>
          <li>📚 Wireless or unguided.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="wired-medium">
        <h4>Wired Medium</h4>
        <p>📚 There are three general classes of wired media types: coaxial cable, twisted pair and fiber optic cable.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="coaxial-cable">
        <h4>1. Coaxial Cable</h4>
        <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module2-network-cables.png" alt="Image of Network cables" width="600" height="300">
          <figcaption>Figure 41: Network cables</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>📚 Coaxial cable uses a single conductor in the middle of a cable. The central conductor is surrounded by an insulator called the dielectric. A conductive shield is put around the dielectric. This shield acts as the second conductor for the circuit as well serves to protect the inner conductor from interference. Coaxial cable for local area network (LAN) connections is obsolete. Coaxial cable is being used in some cases for delivering the last mile of service. For e.g., coaxial cables are being used by Cable TV networks to deliver high-speed service customer premises.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="unshielded-twisted-pair">
        <h4>2. Unshielded Twisted Pair</h4>
        <p>📚 Unshielded twisted pair cabling, or UTP cabling, is the most common type of network cabling. It consists of four twisted pairs of wire, each with a different number of twists per foot, all encased on one sheath. UTP cabling is graded according to category. Category 3 and 4 were replaced by Category 5 cabling by the year 2000. Category 5 is recommended for running Ethernet at speeds of 100 Mbps. Category 5e, was introduced to run gigabit Ethernet or 1000BaseT networks. Category 6 and Category 6a have since been introduced to give better performance at higher speeds. UTP cabling has an intrinsic impedance of 100 ohms.</p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="twisted-pair-cable">
        <h4>3. Twisted Pair Cable</h4>
        <p>📚 There are two types of shielded twisted pair wiring. In the 1980s and 1990s shielded twisted pair was promoted as the best wire type for Token Ring networks. This had an intrinsic impedance of 150 ohms. A new wiring trend is to use 100 ohm shielded twisted pair. The shielding reduces noise and increases the performance of the cable. These are sometimes called foiled twisted pair, or FTP (not to be confused with file transfer protocol) or sometimes called screened twisted pair, or ScTP. These types of cables are compatible with normal UTP.</p>

      <section id="multi-mode-fiber-optic">
        <h4>4. Multi-mode fiber Optic</h4>
        <p>📚 Fiber optic cable is sometimes called wave guide or light guide because it guides the light waves along the length of the cable. Multi-mode fiber is used for short cable runs, usually 1.6 mi (approximately 2 km) or less.</p>
         <figure>

        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="single-mode-fiber-optic-cable">
        <h4>5. Single Mode Fiber Optic Cable</h4>
        <p>📚 Single mode fiber optic cable can operate over much longer distances. Because the fiber only allows one mode of light to propagate, light pulses put on the fiber keep their shape much longer. This allows the light pulses to travel much further without interfering with other pulses. Single mode fiber is recommended for cable runs in excess of 1.6 mi.</p>
         <figure>

      <section id="wireless-transmission-media">
        <h4>Wireless Transmission Media</h4>
        <p>📚 Wireless transmission is a form of unguided media. Wireless communication involves no physical link established between two or more devices, communicating wirelessly. Wireless signals are spread over in the air and are received and interpreted by appropriate antennas.</p>
        <p>📚 When an antenna is attached to electrical circuit of a computer or wireless device, it converts the digital data into wireless signals and spread all over within its frequency range. The receptor on the other end receives these signals and converts them back to digital data.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="radio-transmission">
        <h4>1. Radio Transmission</h4>
        <p>📚 Radio frequency is easier to generate and because of its large wavelength it can penetrate through walls and structures alike. Radio waves can have wavelength from 1 mm 100,000 km and have frequency ranging from 3 Hz (Extremely Low Frequency) to 300 GHz (Extremely High Frequency). Radio frequencies are sub-divided into six bands.</p>
        <p>📚 Radio waves at lower frequencies can travel through walls whereas higher RF can travel in straight line and bounce back.The power of low frequency waves decreases sharply as they cover long distance. High frequency radio waves have more power.</p>

      <section id="microwave-transmission">
        <h4>2. Microwave Transmission</h4>
        <p>📚 Electromagnetic waves above 100 MHz tend to travel in a straight line and signals over them can be sent by beaming those waves towards one particular station. Because Microwaves travels in straight lines, both sender and receiver must be aligned to be strictly in line-of-sight.</p>
        <p>📚 Microwaves can have wavelength ranging from 1 mm 1 meter and frequency ranging from 300 MHz to 300 GHz.</p>
         <figure>

        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="infrared-transmission">
        <h4>3. Infrared Transmission</h4>
        <p>📚 Infrared wave lies in between visible light spectrum and microwaves. It has wavelength of 700-nm to 1-mm and frequency ranges from 300-GHz to 430-THz.</p>
        <p>📚 Infrared wave is used for very short range communication purposes such as television and it's remote. Infrared travels in a straight line hence it is directional by nature. Because of high frequency range, Infrared cannot cross wall-like obstacles.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="light-transmission">
        <h4>4. Light Transmission</h4>
        <p>📚 Highest most electromagnetic spectrum which can be used for data transmission is light or optical signaling. This is achieved by means of LASER.</p>
        <p>📚 Because of frequency light uses, it tends to travel strictly in straight line.Hence the sender and receiver must be in the line-of-sight. Because laser transmission is unidirectional, at both ends of communication the laser and the photo-detector needs to be installed. Laser beam is generally 1mm wide hence it is a work of precision to align two far receptors each pointing to lasers source.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module2-light-transmission.png" alt="Diagram of Light transmission setup" width="600" height="300">
          <figcaption>Figure 49: Light transmission</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>📚 Laser works as Tx (transmitter) and photo-detectors works as Rx (receiver).</p>
        <p>📚 Lasers cannot penetrate obstacles such as walls, rain, and thick fog. Additionally, laser beam is distorted by wind, atmosphere temperature, or variation in temperature in the path.</p>
        <p>📚 Laser is safe for data transmission as it is very difficult to tap 1mm wide laser without interrupting the communication channel.</p>

      <section id="how-to-connect-computers-to-a-network">
        <h4>c) How to connect computers to a network</h4>
        <p>📚 Connecting your computers to your home network grants access to the Internet, networked printers and attached devices and other computers on the network. Most networks in the home or workplace are Ethernet wired networks or Wi-Fi wireless networks. How you connect to a network and what equipment you need depends primarily on the network connection you're setting up.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="required-equipment">
        <h4>i. Required Equipment</h4>
        <p>📚 If you're setting up a wired network, you need an Ethernet modem, a router unless your modem has a built-in router -- and Ethernet cables. If you're setting up a wireless network, you still need an Ethernet modem and a wireless-enabled router, as well as an Ethernet cable to connect the two. You also need one wireless adapter per computer, unless your computer has a</p>
        <p>built-in wireless card.</p>
        <p>📚 If you're building a hybrid network involving both wired and wireless connections, a wireless router is the best choice, as they usually also have Ethernet ports. Some modems feature built-in wireless routers, making them a good all-in-one device choice if you have limited space.</p>

      <section id="network-devices-module2">
        <h4>d) Network Devices</h4>
        <p>📚 <strong>1. Hub</strong></p>
        <p>📚 A Hub is a hardware device that divides the network connection among multiple devices. When computer requests for some information from a network, it first sends the request to the Hub through cable. Hub will broadcast this request to the entire network. All the devices will check whether the request belongs to them or not. If not, the request will be dropped.</p>
        <p>📚 The process used by the Hub consumes more bandwidth and limits the amount of communication. Nowadays, the use of hub is obsolete, and it is replaced by more advanced computer network components such as Switches, Routers.</p>
        <p>📚 <strong>2. Switch</strong></p>
        <p>📚 A switch is a hardware device that connects multiple devices on a computer network. A Switch contains more advanced features than Hub. The Switch contains the updated table that decides where the data is transmitted or not. Switch delivers the message to the correct destination based on the physical address present in the incoming message.</p>
        <p>📚 <strong>3. Router</strong></p>
        <p>📚 A router is a hardware device which is used to connect a LAN with an internet connection. It is used to receive, analyze and forward the incoming packets to another network.</p>
        <p>📚 A router works in a Layer 3 (Network layer) of the OSI Reference model.</p>
        <p>📚 A router forwards the packet based on the information available in the routing table.</p>
        <p>📚 It determines the best path from the available paths for the transmission of the packet.</p>
        <p>📚 <strong>4. Cables and Connectors (media)</strong></p>
        <p>📚 Cable is a transmission media used for transmitting a signal.</p>
        <p>📚 There are three types of cables used in transmission:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>📚 Twisted pair cable</li>
          <li>📚 Coaxial cable</li>
          <li>📚 Fibre-optic cable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>📚 <strong>5. Ports</strong></p>
        <p>📚 A port is a physical docking point using which an external device can be connected to the computer. It can also be programmatic docking point through which information flows from a program to the computer or over the Internet.</p>
        <p>📚 A network port which is provided by the Transport Layer protocols of Internet Protocol suite, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Diagram Protocol (UDP) is a number which serving endpoint communication between two computers.</p>
        <p>📚 <strong>6. Computers</strong></p>
        <p>📚 Computers connected to a network can share files and documents with each other. Personal computers connected to a business network can choose which files and folders are available to share on the network.</p>

        <h2>2.2.2.8 Model answers to self-assessment</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>📝 <strong>Using suitable descriptions, identify the three general classes of wired media types</strong>
            <p>Three general classes of wired media types: coaxial cable, twisted pair and fiber optic cable.</p>
          </li>
          <li>📝 <strong>Demonstrate why single mode fiber optic cable can operate over much longer distances.</strong>
            <p>Because the fiber only allows one mode of light to propagate, light pulses put on the fiber keep their shape much longer. This allows the light pulses to travel much further without interfering with other pulses. Single mode fiber is recommended for cable runs in excess of 1.6 mi.</p>
          </li>
          <li>📝 <strong>2a If you're building a hybrid network involving both wired and wireless connections, which router is the best choice?</strong>
            <p>A wireless router is the best choice as they usually also have Ethernet ports. Some modems feature built-in wireless routers, making them a good all-in-one device choice if you have limited space.</p>
          </li>
          <li>📝 <strong>2b Demonstrate the procedure for creating a Home group</strong>
