        <h3>c) Network Topologies</h3>
        <p>üìö A network topology is the arrangement of computer devices in computer network to establish communication among them. It defines a layout of a network that means it determines how different nodes are connected and communicated together within a network.</p>
        <p>üìö Network topology can be according to logical aspect or on physical aspect. Physical topology describes placement of different components of the network while logical topology describes the data flow within a network instead of physical design.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="physical-logical-topology">
        <h4>Physical and Logical Topology</h4>
        <p>üìö There are two approaches to network topology: physical and logical. Physical network topology, as the name suggests, refers to the physical connections and interconnections between nodes and the network‚Äîthe wires, cables, and so forth. Logical network topology is a little more abstract and strategic, referring to the conceptual understanding of how and why the network is arranged the way it is, and how data moves through it.</p>
        <p>üìö Network topology can be categorize in 2 main categories on the basis of connection: Point to point and multi point.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="point-to-point-topology">
        <h4>Point to point topology</h4>

          <figcaption>Figure 29: Point to point Topology</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>üìö <strong>Point to Point topology</strong> is the simplest topology that connects two nodes directly together with a common link. The entire bandwidth of the common link is reserved for transmission between those two nodes. The point-to-point connections use an actual length of wire or cable to connect the two ends, but other options, such as satellite links, or microwaves are also possible.</p>
        <p>üìö <strong>Multipoint</strong>: This is a case where more than two specific devices share a single link.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="types-of-topology">
        <h4>i. Types of Topology</h4>
        <p>üìö There are five types of topology in computer networks. Hybrid topology is also common</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Star</li>
          <li>Bus</li>
          <li>Ring</li>
          <li>Tree</li>
          <li>Mesh</li>
          <li>Hybrid</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="star-topology">
        <h4>1. Star Topology</h4>
        <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module2-star-topology.png" alt="Diagram of Star Topology" width="600" height="300">
          <figcaption>Figure 29 Star topology</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>üìö A star topology, the most common network topology, is laid out so every node in the network is directly connected to one central hub via coaxial, twisted-pair, or fiber-optic cable. Acting as a server, this central node manages data transmission‚Äîas information sent from any node on the network has to pass through the central one to reach its destination‚Äîand functions as a repeater, which helps prevent data loss.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="advantages-star-topology">
        <h5>Advantages of Star Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö Star topologies are common since they allow you to conveniently manage your entire network from a single location. Because each of the nodes is independently connected to the central hub, should one go down, the rest of the network will continue functioning unaffected, making the star topology a stable and secure network layout.</p>
        <p>üìö Additionally, devices can be added, removed, and modified without taking the entire network offline.</p>
        <p>üìö On the physical side of things, the structure of the star topology uses relatively little cabling to fully connect the network, which allows for both straightforward setup and management over time as the network expands or contracts. The simplicity of the network design makes life easier for administrators, too, because it's easy to identify where errors or performance issues are occurring.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="disadvantages-star-topology">
        <h5>Disadvantages of Star Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö On the flipside, if the central hub goes down, the rest of the network can't function. But if the central hub is properly managed and kept in good health, administrators shouldn't have too many issues.</p>
        <p>üìö The overall bandwidth and performance of the network are also limited by the central node's configurations and technical specifications, making star topologies expensive to set up and operate.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="bus-topology">
        <h4>2. Bus Topology</h4>
        <p>üìö A bus topology orients all the devices on a network along a single cable running in a single direction from one end of the network to the other‚Äîwhich is why it's sometimes called a ‚Äúline topology" or "backbone topology.‚Äù Data flow on the network also follows the route of the cable, moving in one direction.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module2-bus-topology.png" alt="Diagram of Bus Topology" width="600" height="300">
          <figcaption>Figure 30 Bus toplolgy</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="advantages-bus-topology">
        <h5>Advantages of Bus Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö Bus topologies are a good, cost-effective choice for smaller networks because the layout is simple, allowing all devices to be connected via a single coaxial or RJ45 cable. If needed, more nodes can be easily added to the network by joining additional cables.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="disadvantages-bus-topology">
        <h5>Disadvantages of Bus Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö However, because bus topologies use a single cable to transmit data, they're somewhat vulnerable. If the cable experiences a failure, the whole network goes down, which can be time-consuming and expensive to restore, which can be less of an issue with smaller networks.</p>
        <p>üìö Bus topologies are best suited for small networks because there's only so much bandwidth, and every additional node will slow transmission speeds.</p>
        <p>üìö Furthermore, data is ‚Äúhalf-duplex,‚Äù which means it can't be sent in two opposite directions at the same time, so this layout is not the ideal choice for networks with huge amounts of traffic.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="ring-topology">
        <h4>3. Ring Topology - Single vs. Dual</h4>
        <p>üìö Ring topology is where nodes are arranged in a circle (or ring). The data can travel through the ring network in either one direction or both directions, with each device having exactly two neighbors.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module2-ring-topology.png" alt="Diagram of Ring Topology" width="600" height="300">
          <figcaption>Figure 31: Ring topology</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="pros-ring-topology">
        <h5>Pros of Ring Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö Since each device is only connected to the ones on either side, when data is transmitted, the packets also travel along the circle, moving through each of the intermediate nodes until they arrive at their destination. If a large network is arranged in a ring topology, repeaters can be used to ensure packets arrive correctly and without data loss.</p>
        <p>üìö Only one station on the network is permitted to send data at a time, which greatly reduces the risk of packet collisions, making ring topologies efficient at transmitting data without errors.</p>
        <p>üìö By and large, ring topologies are cost-effective and inexpensive to install, and the intricate point-to-point connectivity of the nodes makes it relatively easy to identify issues or misconfigurations on the network.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="cons-ring-topology">
        <h5>Cons of Ring Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö Even though it's popular, a ring topology is still vulnerable to failure without proper network management. Since the flow of data transmission moves unidirectionally between nodes along each ring, if one node goes down, it can take the entire network with it. That's why it's imperative for each of the nodes to be monitored and kept in good health. Nevertheless, even if you're vigilant and attentive to node performance, your network can still be taken down by a transmission line failure.</p>
        <p>üìö The question of scalability should also be taken into consideration. In a ring topology, all the devices on the network share bandwidth, so the addition of more devices can contribute to overall communication delays. Network administrators need to be mindful of the devices added to the topology to avoid overburdening the network's resources and capacity.</p>
        <p>üìö Additionally, the entire network must be taken offline to reconfigure, add, or remove nodes. And while that's not the end of the world, scheduling downtime for the network can be inconvenient and costly.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="dual-ring-topology">
        <h4>Dual-Ring Topology</h4>
        <p>üìö A network with ring topology is half-duplex, meaning data can only move in one direction at a time. Ring topologies can be made full-duplex by adding a second connection between network nodes, creating a dual ring topology.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module2-dual-ring-topology.png" alt="Diagram of Dual Ring Topology" width="600" height="300">
          <figcaption>Figure 32: Dual ring topology</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="advantages-dual-ring-topology">
        <h5>Advantages of Dual-Ring Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö The primary advantage of dual ring topology is its efficiency: because each node has two connections on either side, information can be sent both clockwise and counterclockwise along the network. The secondary ring included in a dual-ring topology setup can act as a redundant layer and backup, which helps solve for many of the disadvantages of traditional ring topology. Dual ring topologies offer a little extra security, too: if one ring fails within a node, the other ring is still able to send data.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="tree-topology">
        <h4>4. Tree Topology</h4>
        <p>üìö The tree topology structure gets its name from how the central node functions as a sort of trunk for the network, with nodes extending outward in a branch-like fashion. However, where each node in a star topology is directly connected to the central hub, a tree topology has a parent-child hierarchy to how the nodes are connected. Those connected to the central hub are connected linearly to other nodes, so two connected nodes only share one mutual connection. Because the tree topology structure is both extremely flexible and scalable, it's often used for wide area networks to support many spread-out devices.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module2-tree-topology.png" alt="Diagram of Tree Topology" width="600" height="300">
          <figcaption>Figure 33: Tree topology</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="pros-tree-topology">
        <h5>Pros of Tree Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö Combining elements of the star and bus topologies allows for the easy addition of nodes and network expansion. Troubleshooting errors on the network is also a straightforward process, as each of the branches can be individually assessed for performance issues.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="cons-tree-topology">
        <h5>Cons of Tree Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö As with the star topology, the entire network depends on the health of the root node in a tree topology structure. Should the central hub fail, the various node branches will become disconnected, though connectivity within‚Äîbut not between-branch systems will remain.</p>
        <p>üìö Because of the hierarchical complexity and linear structure of the network layout, adding more nodes to a tree topology can quickly make proper management an unwieldy, not to mention costly, experience. Tree topologies are expensive because of the sheer amount of cabling required to connect each device to the next within the hierarchical layout.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="mesh-topology">
        <h4>5. Mesh Topology</h4>
        <p>üìö A mesh topology is an intricate and elaborate structure of point-to-point connections where the nodes are interconnected. Mesh networks can be full or partial mesh. Partial mesh topologies are mostly interconnected, with a few nodes with only two or three connections, while full-mesh topologies are‚Äîsurprise!‚Äîfully interconnected.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module2-mesh-topology.png" alt="Diagram of Mesh Topology" width="600" height="300">
          <figcaption>Figure 34: Mesh topology</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="advantages-mesh-topology">
        <h5>Advantages of Mesh Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö Mesh topologies are reliable and stable, and the complex degree of interconnectivity between nodes makes the network resistant to failure. For instance, no single device going down can bring the network offline.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="disadvantages-mesh-topology">
        <h5>Disadvantages of Mesh Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö Mesh topologies are incredibly labor-intensive. Each interconnection between nodes requires a cable and configuration once deployed, so it can also be time-consuming to set up. As with other topology structures, the cost of cabling adds up fast, and to say mesh networks require a lot of cabling is an understatement.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="hybrid-topology">
        <h4>6. Hybrid Topology</h4>
        <p>üìö Hybrid topologies combine two or more different topology structures‚Äîthe tree topology is a good example, integrating the bus and star layouts. Hybrid structures are most commonly found</p>
        <p>üìö in larger companies where individual departments have personalized network topologies adapted to suit their needs and network usage.</p>

        </figure>
      </section>

      <section id="advantages-hybrid-topology">
        <h5>Advantages of Hybrid Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö The main advantage of hybrid structures is the degree of flexibility they provide, as there are few limitations on the network structure itself that a hybrid setup can't accommodate.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="disadvantages-hybrid-topology">
        <h5>Disadvantages of Hybrid Topology</h5>
        <p>üìö However, each type of network topology comes with its own disadvantages, and as a network grows in complexity, so too does the experience and know-how required on the part of the admins to keep everything functioning optimally. There's also the monetary cost to consider when creating a hybrid network topology.</p>

        <p>üìö A personal area network, or PAN, is a computer network that enables communication between computer devices near a person. It is a computer network organized around an individual for personal use only. PANs can be wired, such as USB or FireWire, or they can be wireless, such as infrared, ZigBee, Bluetooth and ultra-wideband. The range of a PAN typically is a few meters. Examples of wireless PAN, or WPAN, devices include cell phone headsets, wireless keyboards, wireless mice, printers, bar code scanners and game consoles.</p>
        <p>üìö Wireless PANs feature battery-operated devices that draw very little current. Sleep modes commonly are used to further extend battery life.</p>

        <h4>2. Local Area Network (LAN)</h4>
        <p>üìö A Local Area Network (LAN) is a group of computers and other devices that are connected together over a network and are all in the same location, within a single building like an office or home.</p>
        <p>üìö On a typical home or small office LAN, you might find a modem that provides an internet connection (and a basic firewall against intrusion from the internet), a router that lets other devices share that connection and connect to one another, and a Wi-Fi access point that lets devices access the network wirelessly. Sometimes, those functions are combined into a single device.</p>

        <h4>3. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)</h4>
        <p>üìö Functioning like a LAN, a WLAN provides wireless network communication over short distances using radio signals instead of traditional network cabling. Typically, a wireless local area network (WLAN) extends an existing wired local area network to devices not connected to the LAN.</p>

      <section id="metropolitan-area-network-man">
        <h4>4. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</h4>
        <p>üìö These types of networks are larger than LANs but smaller than WANs and incorporate elements from both types of networks. MANs span an entire geographic area (typically a town or city, but sometimes a campus). Ownership and maintenance is handled by either a single person or company (a local council, a large company, etc.).</p>

      <section id="wide-area-network-wan">
        <h4>5. Wide Area Network (WAN)</h4>
        <p>üìö A wide-area network (or WAN) is a computer network that connects smaller networks. Since WANs are not tied to a specific location, they allow localized networks to communicate with one another across great distances. They also facilitate communication and the sharing of information between devices from anywhere in the world.</p>
        <p>üìö WANs allow organizations to create unified networks so that employees, customers, and other stakeholders can work together online, regardless of location. Though WANs cover a large area, connections can be either wired or wireless. Wired WANs usually consist of broadband internet services and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), which is a form of data-forwarding technology used to control traffic flow and speed up connection, while wireless WANs normally include 4G/5G and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks.</p>

        <h4>e) Computer Network Components</h4>
        <p>üìö Computer networks components comprise both physical parts as well as the software required for installing computer networks. Some important physical network components are NIC, switch, cable, hub, router, and modem. Depending on the type of network that we need to install, some network components can also be removed. For example, the wireless network does not require a cable.</p>
        <p>üìö Following are the major components required to install a network:</p>
      </section>

      <section id="nic">
        <h4>1. NIC</h4>
        <p>üìö NIC stands for Network Interface Card is an adapter card that plugs into the system bus of a computer and allows the computer to send and receive signals on a network. A network interface card (NIC) is also known as a network adapter card or simply a network card.</p>

        <p>üìö <strong>Wired NIC</strong>: The Wired NIC is present inside the motherboard. Cables and connectors are used with wired NIC to transfer data.</p>
        <p>üìö <strong>Wireless NIC</strong>: The wireless NIC contains the antenna to obtain the connection over the wireless network. For example, laptop computer contains the wireless NIC.</p>

      <section id="hub">
        <h4>2. Hub</h4>
        <p>üìö A Hub is a hardware device that divides the network connection among multiple devices. When a computer network requests for some information from another in the network, it first sends the request to the Hub through a cable. The hub will broadcast this request to the entire network. All the devices will check whether or not the request belongs to them. If not, the request will be dropped.</p>
        <p>üìö The process used by the Hub consumes more bandwidth and limits the amount of communication. Nowadays, the use of hub is obsolete, and it is replaced by more advanced computer network components such as Switches and Routers.</p>

      <section id="switch">
        <h4>3. Switch</h4>
        <p>üìö A switch is a hardware device that connects multiple devices on a computer network. A Switch contains more advanced features than Hub. The Switch contains the updated table that decides where the data is transmitted or not. Switch delivers the message to the correct destination based on the physical address present in the incoming message. A Switch does not broadcast the message to the entire network like the Hub. It determines the device to whom the message is to be transmitted. Therefore, we can say that switch provides a direct connection between the source and destination. It increases the speed of the network.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>üìö A router is a hardware device which is used to connect a LAN with an internet connection. It is used to receive, analyze and forward the incoming packets to another network.</li>
          <li>üìö A router works in a Layer 3 (Network layer) of the OSI Reference model.</li>
          <li>üìö A router forwards the packet based on the information available in the routing table.</li>
          <li>üìö It determines the best path from the available paths for the transmission of the packet.</li>

      <section id="advantages-router">
        <h5>Advantages of Router:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>üìö <strong>Security</strong>: The information which is transmitted to the network will traverse the entire cable, but the only specified device which has been addressed can read the data.</li>
          <li>üìö <strong>Reliability</strong>: If the server has stopped functioning, the network goes down, but no other networks are affected that are served by the router.</li>
          <li>üìö <strong>Performance</strong>: Router enhances the overall performance of the network. Suppose there are 24 workstations in a network generates a same amount of traffic. This increases the traffic load on the network. Router splits the single network into two networks of 12 workstations each, reduces the traffic load by half.</li>

          <li>üìù <strong>What is a computer network?</strong>
            <p>A computer network is a set of computers connected together for the purpose of sharing resources. The most common resource shared today is connection to the Internet. Other shared resources can include a printer or a file server. The Internet itself can be considered a computer network.</p>
          </li>
          <li>üìù <strong>With an aid of a diagram, demonstrate a star topology.</strong>
            <p>A star topology, the most common network topology, is laid out so every node in the network is directly connected to one central hub via coaxial, twisted-pair, or fiber-optic cable. Acting as a server, this central node manages data transmission‚Äîas information sent from any node on the network has to pass through the central one to reach its destination‚Äîand functions as a repeater, which helps prevent data loss</p>

          <li>üìù <strong>With respect to the OSI reference model, from which layer does a router operate?</strong>
            <p>A router works in a Layer 3 (Network layer) of the OSI Reference model.</p>
          </li>
          <li>üìù <strong>What is POLAN?</strong>
            <p>POLAN uses optical splitters to split an optical signal from one strand of single mode optical fiber into multiple signals to serve users and devices.</p>
          </li>
          <li>üìù <strong>In a Network Interface Card, what is meant by a MAC address?</strong>
            <p>The MAC address or physical address is encoded on the network card chip which is assigned by the IEEE to identify a network card uniquely. The MAC address is stored in the PROM (Programmable read-only memory).</p>
