This paper consists of EIGHT questions.
Answer FIVE of the EIGHT question in the answer booklet provided.
All questions carry equal marks.
Candidates should answer the questions in English.

Candidates should check the question paper to ascertain that all the pages are printed as indicated and that no questions are missing.

Table 1
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Average Score & Remarks \\
\hline From 0 to 299 & Mean below average \\
\hline From 200 to 299 & Average mean \\
\hline From 300 to 399 & Good mean \\

'(d) (i) Write a Visual Basic statement that would display the value 40976 formatted to each of the following:
I. date;
II. currency.
(ii) The length of the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle is given by the formula $\mathrm{c}=\sqrt{\mathrm{a}^{2}+\mathrm{b}^{2}}$ where a and b are the perpendicular sides and c is the hypotenuse

Write a program in Visual Basic that would accept the values $a$ and $b$ through the use of a text box, compute the hypotenuse and display the results on a message box.
