(d) A company pays commission to sale representatives based on the criteria shown in Table1. Use it to answer the question that follows.
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline Sales & Commission Rate \\
\hline From 0 To 9999 & $2 \%$ \\
\hline From 10000 To 19999 & $5 \%$ \\
\hline From 20000 To 29999 & $10 \%$ \\
\hline From 30000 and above & $15 \%$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Table 1

Write a Visual Basic program that willaccept the sales amount through the use of an input box and compute the commission earned. The program should then output the commission in a message box. Use the select case control structure and attach the code to a form load event.
4. (a) Outline four advantages of using bubble algorithm in programming.
(b) Distinguish between $B O F$ and $E O F$ recordset object properties ADO control as used in a Visual Basic programming.

(d) The sum of the first 20 terms of the following series is to be computed.
$$7,17,27,37, \ldots$$

Write a Visual Basic program that uses a function to compute the sum of the series and display the result in a message box. Use While loop control structure and attach the code to a command button.
5. (a) Explain each of the following activities carried out during program development in Visual Basic programming:
(i) compilation;
(ii) debugging;
(iii) execution.
(b) Distinguish between For...next loop and For each...next loop program control structures as used in Visual Basic programming, giving the syntax in each case.
(c) Figure 2 shows a Visual Basic form used to add data in the three fields of the Authors table in a database.
