\section*{INSTRUCTIONS TO CANDIDATES}

This paper consists of EIGHT questions
Answer any FIVE of the EIGHT questions in the answeo booklet provided.
Candidate should answer the questions in English.

This paper consists of 7 printed pages.
Candidates should check the question paper to ascertain that all the pages are printed as indicated and that no questions are missing.
1. (a) Outline the function of each of the following tool box features in a Visual Basic program:
(i) pointer;
(ii) frame;
(iii) ole.
(b) Explain each of the following statements used in error trapping in a Visual Basic program:

(ii) On Error Resume Next;
(iii) On Error Goto 0 .
(c) Explain the function of each of the following IDE interface of a Visual Basic program:
(i) Form Window;
(ii) Property Window;
(iii) Form Layout window.
(d) Write a Visual Basic program that would accept a character through the use of a text box. The program should then change the background colour of the current form based on the captured character colour criteria shown in Table 1. Use If...Then...Else statement and attach the code to a command button.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Character & Form Colour \\
\hline R & Redo \\
\hline G & Green \\
\hline B & Blue \\
\hline Y & Yellow \\
\hline any other letter & not valid colour \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

2. (a) State the Visual Basic type conversion functions used to convert a string into each of the following types of data:
(i) Boolean data;
(ii) Currency data;
(iii) Date data;
(iv) Integer data.

(d) The vertical height (h) in metres of a particle projected vertically upwards with an initial velocity $100 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ with respect to time ( $t$ ) is obtained using the formula $h=100 t+4.9 \mathrm{t}^{2}$.
Write a Visual Basic program that prompts a user to enter the time (t) using input box function. The program should then use a function to compute the height in metres and display the results in a picture box. Attach the code to a command button.

Figure 1
Write a Visual Basic program for the delete event that should be able to check the existence of a record and then delete it from a database. The program should display appropriate messages and corresponding icons.
4. (a) Explain two properties of a text box control that must be set to enable it interact with a database file in a Visual Basic program.
(b) Outline the function of each of the following datagrid properties in a Visual Basic program.
(i) AllowArrows;
(ii) AllowDelete;
(iii) ColumnHeaders;
(iv) HeadLines.
(c) State a circumstance under which each of the following statements are used in a Visual Basic program:
(i) ReDim ;
(ii) Option base;
(iii) Preserve.
(d) Total sale made in a period of 5 years is required to be computed. Write a Visual Basic program that would capture each annual sale value in a text box and assign the values to an array. The program should then use the values in the array to compute the total sale and display the results on a label. Attach the code to a command button.
5. (a) Outline the function of each of the following methods of a recordset as used in a Visual Basic program:
(i) synchronize;
(ii) rowstatus;
(iii) edit;
(iv) update.
(b) (i) Explain the term finction call as used in Visual Basic programming language.
(ii) Classify each of the following Visual Basic operators as either Assignment Operators, or Comparison Operators or Arithmetic Operators.
(c) Explain the function of the following features in a menu editor of a Visual Basic program.
(i) separator bars;
(ii) access keys;
(iii) shortcut keys.
(d) Figure 2 shows a form designed in a Visual Basic program used to capture the preferred destination sites in Kenya by a tourist. Use it to answer the question that follows.

Figure 2
Write a Visual Basic program that uses conirol array check boxes for site options.
When a user clicks a command button, the text "Karibu Kenya" appears as the title and selected destination sites are displayed on the list box.
6. (a) Outline four controls that may enable a user to make a choice from a list of data in a Visual Basic program.
(b) Explain a circumstance under which each of the following methods may be used to retrieve data in a Visual Basic program.
(i) snapshot data object;
(ii) database data object.
