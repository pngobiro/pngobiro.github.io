Figure 1
Explain the use of the following fields as indicatod in Figure 1:
(i) Command type;
(ii) Table or stored Procedure Name;
(iii) Command text (SQL).
(d) Write a program in Visual Basic language that would generate the following output when executed.
\begin{tabular}{lllll} 
& & & 1 \\
& & & 1 & 2 \\
& & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\

```
Private Type Customer
CustomerName As String
AcctNo As Integer
