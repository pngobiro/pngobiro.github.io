(b) Distinguish between data control and database engine as used in a Visual Basic program.
(c) (i) Outline the use of a boolean flag in programming.
(ii) A company computes tax from employee's salary as follows:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline SALARY & TAX & MESSAGE \\
\hline Less than 10000 & No tax & No tax \\
\hline 10000 and 20000 & $10 \%$ & Lowest tax \\
\hline 21000 and 35000 & $15 \%$ & Middle tax \\
\hline Above 35000 & $20 \%$ & Highest tax \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

(a) (i) Outline three benefits of using control arrays in a Visual Basic program.
(ii) Distinguish betwcen a parameter and a local variable as used in a Visual Basic Program. Give an example in cach case.
(b) Describe three circumstances under which ADO cursors may be used during data connection.
(c) Table 2 shows remarks displayed when a letter is input into a computer. Use it to answer the question that tollows
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
No of letters \\
in a word
\end{tabular} & Remarks \\
\hline 0 & No word entered \\
\hline 1 & One letter word entered \\
\hline 2 & two letter word entered \\
\hline 2 & Three letter word entered \\
\hline 3 & More than three letters entered \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Table 2
