INSTRUCTIONS TO CANDIDATES
Answer any FIVE of the following EIGHT questions in the answer booklet provided.
All questions carry equal marks
Candidates should answer the questions in English.
1. (a) (i) Outline three factors that could be considered when setting control properties in a Visual Basic program.
(ii) Distinguish between an object and a control as used in Visual Basic program Environment
(b) (i) Describe the term menu editor as used in Visual Basic programming.
(ii) Describe two properties applied in a menu editor.
(c) (i) Distinguish between sentinel and flag controlled loops as used in programming.
(ii) Write a program in Visual Basic that would display even numbers between 10 and 20 on a form. Use a do while statement. Attach the code to a command button.
2. (a) State the prefix for each of the following Visual Basic tools:
(i) Timer;
(ii) Option Button;
(iii) Shape;
(iv) Horizontal ScrollBar.
(b) Describe three Project Explorer buttons used in a Visual Basic program.
(c) Figure 1 shows a list of numbers in an array. Use it to answer the question that follows.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline 11 & 12 & 17 & 19 & 21 & 25 & 26 & 28 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Figure 1
Perform a binary search on the array showing the steps, given that the search key is 28 .
(d) Write a program in Visual Basic that accepts a name of a person through the use of an input box. The program should then add the name to a list box through the use of a procedure. Attach the code to a command button.
(a) Outline four characteristics of a Visual Programming language.
(b) (i) Describe a sub procedure as used in a Visual programming.
(ii) Outline three characteristics of an event as used in Visual Basic programming.
(c) Distinguish between unload and hide methods as used in a Visual Basic program.
(d) A book supplier offers a discount of $10 \%$ when the total cost of books purchased is more than 10,000 . Write a program in Visual Basic that accepts the price of three books one at a time through an input box. The program computes total cost, discount if any and then displays the amount payable on a picture box. Attach the code to a command button.
(7 marks)
4. (a) The following are programming languages.

\section*{Visual Basic, PHP JavaScript, Visual C++, Python, lisp}

Categorise each language as either event driven or procedural programming languages.
(3 marks)
(b) Outline three properties of a user defined function.
(c) Explain three similarities between $A D O$ data control and data environment as used in Visual Basic programming.
(d) (i) Explain the use of ubound() as used in an array.
(ii) Write a program in Visual Basic that accepts five values in an array. The program then displays the smallest and the largest value on the form. Attach the code to a command button.
(6 marks)
(a) State the output generated when each of the following Visual Basic statement is executed.
(i) Mid ("Visual Environment", 3, 6)
(ii) InStr (1, "Visual Environment", "Environment")
(iii) Print Len ( "Visual Environment")
(iv) Print RTrim("Visual Environment ")
(b) Describe two values for an EOF action in a Visual Basic program.
(c) John, a programmer would like to include error handling messages in a Visual Basic program. Explain three approaches that he could consider.
(d) Table 1 shows details of Module 1 subjects. Use it to answer the question that follows:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Subject code & Subject name & Label colour \\
\hline 4 & ICT & Red \\
\hline 6 & Programming & Green \\
\hline 8 & Mathematics & Orange \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
Any other \\
number
\end{tabular} & Does not exist & White \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Write a program in Visual Basic that accepts the subject code through the use of a textbox. The program then displays the subject name on a label and changes the label background colour as indicated when a command button is clicked.
Use a select case statement.
(a) Outline three Recordset methods that enables navigation in a Visual Basic program.
(b) Describe three $A D O$ data locking options used in a Visual Basic program.
(c) Alice tried connecting a database table to a form. When she clicked the test connection button, a message "unsuccessful" was displayed. Explain three possible reasons that could lead to this.
(d) Write a program in Visual Basic that would accept the name of a person through the use of a text box. The program then displays "Hallo Nelly" on a message box() when the name entered is Nelly, otherwise it displays " unknown name" . Attach the code to a command button.
(a) Outline two keypress cvents and two mouse events in a Visual Basic program. (4 marks)
(b) Differentiate between Print $x, y$ and Picture I.Print $x, y$ statements as used in a Visual Basic program.
(c) Marion, a programmer would like to include err object method in a Visual Basic program. Explain two methods that she could consider .
(d) Write a program in Visual Basic that uses a procedure to capture the radius of a circle through the use of a textbox. The program then computes the area of a circle and volume of a sphere through a procedure and displays the results on a form. Attach the code to a command button.
(a) Outline four sorting lechniques that could be used in a Visual Basic program.
(b) Mary prefers using a binary tree to search for a record. Explain three challenges she could face.
(c) Figure 2 shows a user interface in a Visual Basic program. Use it to answer the question that follows.
