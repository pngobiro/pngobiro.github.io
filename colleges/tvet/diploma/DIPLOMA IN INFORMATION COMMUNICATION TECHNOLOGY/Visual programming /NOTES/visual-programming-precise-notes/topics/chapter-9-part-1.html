                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The ADO Data control uses Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) to quickly create connections between data-bound controls and data providers. Data-bound controls are any controls that feature a DataSource property. Data providers can be any source written to the OLE DB specification. You can also easily create your own data provider using Visual Basic's class module.</p>
                        <p>Although you can use the ActiveX Data Objects directly in your applications, the ADO Data control has the advantage of being a graphic control (with Back and Forward buttons) and an easy-to-use interface that allows you to create database applications with a minimum of code.</p>
                        <p>Several of the controls found in Visual Basic's Toolbox can be data-bound, including the CheckBox, ComboBox, Image, Label, ListBox, PictureBox, and TextBox controls. Additionally, Visual Basic includes several data-bound ActiveX controls such as the DataGrid, DataCombo, Chart, and DataList controls. You can also create your own data-bound ActiveX controls, or purchase controls from other vendors.</p>
                        <p>Previous versions of Visual Basic featured the intrinsic Data control and the Remote Data control (RDC) for data access. Both controls are still included with Visual Basic for backward compatibility. However, because of the flexibility of ADO, it's recommended that new database applications be created using the ADO Data Control.</p>
                        <p><strong>For More Information:</strong> A complete list of data-bound controls can be found in "Controls That Bind to the ADO Data Control." To find out how to use the intrinsic Data control or the Remote Data control, see "Using the Data Control" or "Using the Remote Data Control." For details about creating a data provider, see "Creating Data-Aware Classes."</p>

                        <p>To create a client, or front-end database application, add the ADO Data control to your forms just as you would any other Visual Basic control. You can have as many ADO Data controls on your form as you need. Be aware, however, that the control is a comparatively "expensive" method of creating connections, using at least two connections for the first control, and one more for each subsequent control.</p>
