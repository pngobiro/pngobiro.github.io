                        <p>In computing, a visual programming language (VPL) is any programming language that lets users create programs by manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually.</p>
                        <h3>Note:</h3>
                        <p>Visual programming language enables the development of software programs by eliminating textual software code with a series of visual graphics elements. VPL incorporates these graphical elements as the primary context of the language arranged in a systematic order. The graphics or icons included within a visual program serve as input, activities, connections and/or output of the program.</p>
                        <p>Visual language has a few types, such as icon-based languages, diagramming languages and form-based language. Visual languages should not be confused with GUI-based programming language as they only provide graphical program authoring services. However, their code/context is completely textual.</p>

                                <span class="item-text">(VPL) Any programming language that allows the user to specify a program in a two-(or more)dimensionsional way. Conventional textual languages are not considered two-dimensional since the compiler or interpreter processes them as one-dimensional streams of characters. A VPL allows programming with visual expressions - spatial arrangements of textual and graphical symbols.</span>

                                <span class="item-text">Visual Basic, Visual C++ and the entire Microsoft Visual family are not, despite their names, visual programming languages. They are textual languages which use a graphical GUI builder to make programming interfaces easier. The user interface portion of the programming environment is visual, the languages are not. Because of the confusion caused by the multiple meanings of the term "visual programming", Fred Lakin has proposed the term "executable graphics" as an alternative to VPL.</span>

Spreadsheets developed as computerized simulations of paper accounting worksheets. The program operates on data represented as cells of an array, organized in rows and columns. Each cell of the array is a model-view-controller element that may contain either numeric or text data, or the results of formulas that automatically calculate and display a value based on the contents of other cells. Spreadsheet users may adjust any stored value and observe the effects on calculated values. This makes the spreadsheet useful for "whatif" analysis since many cases can be rapidly investigated without manual recalculation. Modern spreadsheet software can have multiple interacting sheets, and can display data either as text and numerals, or in graphical form.</span></li>
