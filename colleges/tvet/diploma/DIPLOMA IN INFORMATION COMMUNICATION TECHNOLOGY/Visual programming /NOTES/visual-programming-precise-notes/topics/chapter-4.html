                        <p>The Problem which has to be implemented into a program must be thoroughly understood before the program is written. Problem must be analyzed to determine the input and output requirements of the program. A problem is created with these specifications.</p>

                        <p>With the problem statement obtained in the previous step, various methods available for obtaining the required solution are analyzed and the best suitable method is designed into algorithm.</p>
                        <p>To improve clarity and understandability of the program flow charts are drawn using the algorithms.</p>

                        <p><strong>Debugging</strong> is the process of locating and fixing or bypassing bugs (errors) in computer program code. Programs sometimes have small errors, called "bugs," in them. These bugs can be minor, such as not recognizing user input, or more serious, such as a memory leak that crashes the program.</p>
                        <p><strong>Compiling</strong> is the transformation from Source Code (human readable) into machine code (computer executable). A compiler is a program. A compiler takes the recipe (source code) for a new program (written in a high level language) and transforms this Code into a new language (Machine Language) that can be understood by the computer itself. This "machine language" is difficult to impossible for humans to read and understand (much less debug and maintain), thus the need for "high level languages" such as VB.</p>
