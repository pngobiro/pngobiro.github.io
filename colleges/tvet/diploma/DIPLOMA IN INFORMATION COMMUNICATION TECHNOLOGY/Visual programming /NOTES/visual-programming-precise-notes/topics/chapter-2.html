                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>An object is a combination of code and data that can be treated as a unit. An object can be a piece of an application, like a control or a form. An entire application can also be an object.</p>
                        <p>Each object in Visual Basic is defined by a class. A class describes the variables, properties, procedures, and events of an object. Objects are instances of classes; you can create as many objects you need once you have defined a class.</p>
                        <p>To understand the relationship between an object and its class, think of cookie cutters and cookies. The cookie cutter is the class. It defines the characteristics of each cookie, for example size and shape. The class is used to create objects. The objects are the cookies.</p>
                        <p>Two examples in Visual Basic might help illustrate the relationship between classes and objects.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The controls on the Toolbox in Visual Basic represent classes. When you drag a control from the Toolbox onto a form, you are creating an object - an instance of a class.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The form you work with at design time is a class. At run time, Visual Basic creates an instance of the form's class - that is, an object.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note: Control objects are predefined objects that can be created using the Visual Basic toolbox, such as text boxes, command buttons and other controls. No matter how many text boxes you create on a form, they all have the same properties and methods. Essentially, a class is a template from which an object is created, and specifies the properties and methods that will be common to all objects that are created from it. Each text box is therefore an instance of the class TextBox, for which you can set the properties or invoke the methods.</p>
                        <p>Essentially, a Visual Basic user interface consists of objects that you place on the screen and arrange in some semblance of organization so that the screen looks pretty.</p>
                        <p>The common elements of a Visual Basic user interface appear in Figure 1 and consist of the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The form window is your basic environment on which you place things that will be seen by the user.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The project explorer window shows the filenames of all of the form (.frm) and code (.bas) modules that are contained in your current project. You can think of this window as showing your .vbp project file's contents.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The properties window allows you to set any property of the object which is currently selected (i.e. highlighted) in the form window.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The form layout window simply shows the position of the form as it would appear on the screen to the user. I usually close the form layout window while developing a VB program.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The toolbox usually appears along the left edge of the screen. It contains the tools that you use to place controls on a form. You can double click a tool to cause a control to appear on the current form. You can also pass your mouse over each tool to see its name appear in a pop-up window.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The main Visual Basic window holds the menu bar (at the very top), the toolbar (just under the menu bar), and form location and size info.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The form location and size information appears at the right end of the toolbar and can be useful for design reasons.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The Help menu is a very useful and often overlooked repository of information. Use the online Help to learn about Visual Basic!</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Note:</h3>
                        <p>The Immediate window is a special window in which you can directly type Visual Basic commands and view and change variables and control values during a program's execution. It's used to debug and evaluate expressions, execute statements, print variable values, and so forth. It allows you to enter expressions to be evaluated or executed by the development language during debugging.</p>
                        <p>Code window is on which you write, display, and edit Visual Basic code. You can open as many Code windows as you have modules, so you can easily view the code in different forms or modules, and copy and paste between them.</p>
                        <h3>Steps for writing a Visual Basic project.</h3>
                        <p>You must always plan a program before you actually write it to be a successful programmer. Many students and professionals overlook this crucial necessity.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Design the user interface: You should storyboard the program by actually drawing pictures of the screen that the user will interact with during the program's execution. Show the forms and controls carefully and accurately. Do NOT assume that you will be able to "figure it out" when you sit down to type the code into the computer. It is highly recommended to name the forms and controls that you plan to use beforehand rather than to write them into the code as you type it as well.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Plan the properties: Since it is possible to highly customize the look and feel of a VB program (unlike older procedural programs), it is very important to write down your ideas and plans before typing the code into the computer. Your program will not have a commercial and professional appearance, otherwise.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Plan the code: Write out pseudocode that explains the procedural tasks that must be accomplished within your program before typing or even writing out actual Basic code. Pseudocode is English phrases that roughly explains how you plan to do things within your program. Do not use Basic keywords or perfect syntax during this planning phase.</span></li>
