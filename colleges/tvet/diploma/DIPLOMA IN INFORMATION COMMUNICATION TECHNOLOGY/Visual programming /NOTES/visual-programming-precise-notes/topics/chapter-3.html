                                    <strong>Object:</strong> An object is a combination of code and data that can be treated as a unit. An object can be a piece of an application, like a control or a form. An entire application can also be an object. Objects are things that you can program with, things that make programming easier. They contain a set of methods and properties that allow you to make the object do certain things without actually having to look at the object's code.
                                    <p>Objects let you declare variables and procedures once and then reuse them whenever needed.</p>
                                    <p>Each object in Visual Basic is defined by a class. A class describes the variables, properties, procedures, and events of an object. Objects are instances of classes; you can create as many objects as you need once you have defined a class.</p>
                                    <p>To understand the relationship between an object and its class, think of cookie cutters and cookies. The cookie cutter is the class. It defines the characteristics of each cookie, for example size and shape. The class is used to create objects. The objects are the cookies.</p>
                                    <p>Two examples in Visual Basic might help illustrate the relationship between classes and objects:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The controls on the Toolbox in Visual Basic represent classes. When you drag a control from the Toolbox onto a form, you are creating an object - an instance of a class.</span></li>
                                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The form you work with at design time is a class. At run time, Visual Basic creates an instance of the form's class - that is, an object.</span></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">2.</span>
                                <span class="item-text">
                                    <strong>Code:</strong> A key part of developing applications using Visual Basic is ensuring that the code is carefully structured. This involves segmenting the code into projects, modules and procedures so that it is easy to understand and maintain.
                                    <p>A complete Visual Basic application is typically contained in a single project. Within a project, code is placed in separate code files called modules, and within each module, the Visual Basic code is further separated into self-contained and re-usable procedures.</p>
                                    <p>Visual Basic procedures provide a way to break up code into logical and re-usable sections that can be called from other sections of Visual Basic code. For example, you might have a section of Visual Basic code that calculates the interest due on a loan. It is also possible that you need to perform this calculation from a number of different places in your application code. Rather than duplicating the code to perform this task at each code location where it is needed, it is more efficient to place the calculation code in a procedure, and then call that procedure each time it is needed.</p>
                                    <p>Visual Basic provides two types of procedures:</p>
                                    <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Functions</strong> - Functions are procedures which perform a task and return a value when completed.</span></li>
                                        <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Subroutines</strong> - Subroutines are procedures which perform a task but return no value when completed.</span></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>It is especially useful to be able to return values from functions. For example, the function may need to return the result of the task it performed (perhaps the result of a calculation). A function might also return a True or False value to indicate when the task was performed successfully. The Visual Basic code which called the function then acts based on the returned value.</p>
                                    <p>In the case of both subroutines and functions, values (known as parameters) may optionally be passed into the procedure.</p>
                                    <p>The syntax for a Visual Basic subroutine is as follows:</p>
                                    <pre><code class="language-vb">Scope Sub subroutineName(parameters)
    ' Code here
End Sub</code></pre>
                                    <p>The scope value is either Private or Public depending on whether the Subroutine is to be accessible from Visual Basic code outside of the current module. Sub is the Visual Basic keyword which indicates this is a Subroutine rather than a Function. subroutineName is the name of the Subroutine and is used when this specific procedure is to be called. The parameters value allows the parameters accepted by this Subroutine to be declared.</p>
                                    <p>The Public keyword indicates the scope. This defines whether this subroutine is accessible from Visual Basic code residing in other modules. Setting the scope to Private would make the Subroutine inaccessible to Visual Basic code outside the current module.</p>
                                    <p>The Sub keyword indicates that this is a Subroutine (as opposed to a Function) and as such, does not return a value on completion. Finally, the name of the Subroutine is provided. The parentheses are used to hold any parameters which may be passed through to the Subroutine when it is called. The End Sub code marks the end of the Subroutine. The Visual Basic code that constitutes the Subroutine is placed after the Subroutine declaration and the End Sub.</p>
                                </span>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Visual Basic uses building blocks such as Variables, Data Types, Procedures, Functions and Control Structures in its programming environment. This section concentrates on the programming fundamentals of Visual Basic with the blocks specified.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Modules</h3>
                        <p>Code in Visual Basic is stored in the form of modules. The three kinds of modules are Form Modules, Standard Modules and Class Modules. A simple application may contain a single Form, and the code resides in that Form module itself. As the application grows, additional Forms are added and there may be a common code to be executed in several Forms. To avoid the duplication of code, a separate module containing a procedure is created that implements the common code. This is a standard Module.</p>
                        <p>Class module (.CLS filename extension) are the foundation of the object oriented programming in Visual Basic. New objects can be created by writing code in class modules. Each module can contain:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Declarations</strong>: May include constant, type, variable and DLL procedure declarations.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Procedures</strong>: A sub function, or property procedure that contain pieces of code that can be executed as a unit.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are the rules to follow when naming elements in VB - variables, constants, controls, procedures, and so on:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">A name must begin with a letter.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">May be as much as 255 characters long (but don't forget that somebody has to type the stuff!).</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Must not contain a space or an embedded period or type-declaration characters used to specify a data type; these are ! # % $ & @</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Must not be a reserved word (that is part of the code, like Option, for example)</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The dash, although legal, should be avoided because it may be confused with the minus sign. Instead of First-name use First_name or FirstName.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Data Types</h3>
                        <p>By default Visual Basic variables are of variant data types. The variant data type can store numeric, date/time or string data. When a variable is declared, a data type is supplied for it that determines the kind of data they can store. The fundamental data types in Visual Basic including variant are integer, long, single, double, string, currency, byte and boolean. Visual Basic supports a vast array of data types. Each data type has limits to the kind of information and the minimum and maximum values it can hold. In addition, some types can interchange with some other types. A list of Visual Basic's simple data types are given below.</p>

                        <h4>1. Numeric</h4>
                        <div class="table-container">
                            <table class="content-table">
                                <tbody>
                                    <tr><td>Byte</td><td>Store integer values in the range of <span class="math-inline">$0-255$</span></td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>Integer</td><td>Store integer values in the range of <span class="math-inline">$(-32,768)-(+32,767)$</span></td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>Long</td><td>Store integer values in the range of <span class="math-inline">$(-2,147,483,468)-(+2,147,483,468)$</span></td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>Single</td><td>Store floating point value in the range of <span class="math-inline">$(-3.4 \times 10^{-38})-(+3.4 \times 10^{38})$</span></td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>Double</td><td>Store large floating value which exceeding the single data type value</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>Currency</td><td>Store monetary values. It supports 4 digits to the right of decimal point and 15 digits to the left</td></tr>

                            </table>
                        </div>

                        <h4>2. String</h4>
                        <p>Use to store alphanumeric values. A variable length string can store approximately 4 billion characters.</p>

                        <h4>3. Date</h4>
                        <p>Use to store date and time values. A variable declared as date type can store both date and time values and it can store date values 01/01/0100 up to 12/31/9999.</p>

                        <h4>4. Boolean</h4>
                        <p>Boolean data types hold either a true or false value. These are not stored as numeric values and cannot be used as such. Values are internally stored as -1 (True) and 0 (False) and any non-zero value is considered as true.</p>

                        <h4>5. Variant</h4>
                        <p>Stores any type of data and is the default Visual Basic data type. In Visual Basic if we declare a variable without any data type by default the data type is assigned as default.</p>

                        <p>A variable is an area of computer memory you use in your program. To use a variable, you must give it a name. There are rules you should, and usually must, follow when naming your variables:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Must begin with a letter</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Cannot have a period (the period is used to set a property; in other words, the period is an operator)</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Can have up to 255 characters. Please, just because it is allowed, don't use 255 characters.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Must be unique inside of the procedure or the module it is used in</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once a variable has a name, you can use it as you see fit. For example, you can assign it a value and then use the variable in your program as if it represented that value.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Variable Declaration</h3>
                        <p>In Visual Basic, it is a good practice to declare the variables before using them by assigning names and data types. They are normally declared in the general section of the code windows using the <code>Dim</code> statement. You can use any variable to hold any data, but different types of variables are designed to work efficiently with different data types.</p>
                        <p>The syntax is as follows:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">Dim VariableName As DataType</code></pre>
                        <p>If you want to declare more variables, you can declare them in separate lines or you may also combine more in one line, separating each variable with a comma, as follows:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">Dim VariableName1 As DataType1, VariableName2 As DataType2, VariableName3 As DataType3</code></pre>
                        <h4>Example</h4>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">Dim password As String
Dim firstnum As Integer
Dim secondnum As Integer
Dim total As Integer
Dim doDate As Date
Dim password As String, yourName As String, firstnum As Integer
</code></pre>
                        <p>Unlike other programming languages, Visual Basic actually doesn't require you to specifically declare a variable before it's used. If a variable isn't declared, VB will automatically declare the variable as a Variant. A variant is a data type that can hold any type of data.</p>
                        <p>For string declaration, there are two possible types, one for the variable-length string and another for the fixed-length string. For the variable-length string, just use the same format as above. However, for the fixed-length string, you have to use the format as shown below:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">Dim VariableName as String * n ' n defines the number of characters the string can hold</code></pre>
                        <h4>Example</h4>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">Dim yourName as String * 10
' yourName can hold no more than 10 Characters.
</code></pre>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Scope of Declaration</h3>
                        <p>Other than using the <code>Dim</code> keyword to declare the data, you can also use other keywords to declare the data. Three other keywords are <code>Private</code>, <code>Static</code> and <code>Public</code>. The forms are as shown below:</p>
                        <p>The above keywords indicate the scope of declaration. <strong>Private</strong> declares a local variable, or a variable that is local to a procedure or module. However, Private is rarely used; we normally use Dim to declare a local variable. The <strong>Static</strong> keyword declares a variable that is being used multiple times, even after a procedure has been terminated. Most variables created inside a procedure are discarded by Visual Basic when the procedure is finished; the static keyword preserves the value of a variable even after the procedure is terminated. <strong>Public</strong> is the keyword that declares a global variable, which means it can be used by all the procedures and modules of the whole program.</p>
