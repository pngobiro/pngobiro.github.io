                        <p>Control structures allow you to control the flow of your program's execution. If left unchecked by control-flow statements, a program's logic will flow through statements from left to right, and top to bottom. While some very simple programs can be written with only this unidirectional flow, and while some flow can be controlled by using operators to regulate precedence of operations, most of the power and utility of any programming language comes from its ability to change statement order with structures and loops.</p>
                        <p>Control structures form the basic entities of a "Visual programming language". Control structures are used to alter the flow of execution of the program. Why do we need to alter the program flow? The reason is "decision making"! In life, we may be given with a set of option like doing "Electronics" or "Computer science". We do make a decision by analyzing certain conditions (like our personal interest, scope of job opportunities etc.). With the decision we make, we alter the flow of our life's direction. This is exactly what happens in a VB program. We use control structures to make decisions and alter the direction of program flow in one or the other path(s) available.</p>

                        <p>A branch is a point at which your program must make a choice. With these data structures, it is now possible to make programs that can have multiple outcomes. You may be familiar with the first type from Algebra, an If-Then statement, or If P then <span class="math-inline">$Q$</span>. And they work pretty much the same. Another type is the Select Case, this may prove to be easier at times.</p>
                        <p>Another name for this concept is conditional clauses. Conditional clauses are blocks of code that will only execute if a particular expression (the condition) is true.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">If...Then Statement</h3>
                        <p>If...Then statements are some of the most basic statements in all of programming. Every language has them, in some form or another. In Visual Basic, the syntax for an If...Then statement is as follows:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">If (condition) Then (reaction)
End If</code></pre>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>condition</strong> - a set of test(s) that the program executes.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>reaction</strong> - the instructions that the program follows when the condition returns true. The condition returns true if it passes the test and returns false if it fails the test.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The condition can be anything from:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">If X = 1 Then
    MsgBox "X = 1"
End If</code></pre>
                        <p>to:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">If InStr(1, sName, " ") > 0 Then
    sName = """" & sName & """"
End If</code></pre>
                        <p>If there is only one reaction to the condition, the statement can also be expressed without the End If:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">If Y + 3 = 7 Then MsgBox "Y + 3 DOES = 7"</code></pre>
                        <p>There are also other parts to these statements to make them more complex. Two other terms that can be used are Else, and ElseIf.</p>
                        <p>Else will, if the condition is false, do whatever comes between the Else statement and the End If statement.</p>
                        <p>ElseIf will, if the condition directly proceeding it is false, check for another condition and go from there.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">If..Then..Else Statement</h3>
                        <p>The If..Then..Else statement is the simplest of the conditional statements. They are also called branches, as when the program arrives at an "If" statement during its execution, control will "branch" off into one of two or more "directions". An If-Else statement is generally in the following form:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">If condition Then
    statement
Else
    other statement
End If</code></pre>
                        <p>If the original condition is met, then all the code within the first statement is executed. The optional Else section specifies an alternative statement that will be executed if the condition is false. The IfElse statement can be extended to the following form:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">If condition Then
    statement
ElseIf condition Then
    other statement
ElseIf condition Then
    other statement
Else
    another statement
End If</code></pre>
                        <p>Only one statement in the entire block will be executed. This statement will be the first one with a condition which evaluates to be true. The concept of an If-Else-If structure is easier to understand with the aid of an example:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">Dim Temperature As Double
If Temperature >= 40.0 Then
    Debug.Print "It's extremely hot"
ElseIf 30.0 <= Temperature And Temperature <= 39.0 Then
    Debug.Print "It's hot"
ElseIf 20.0 <= Temperature And Temperature <= 29.0 Then
    Debug.Print "It's warm"
ElseIf 10.0 <= Temperature And temperature <= 19.0 Then
    Debug.Print "It's cool"
ElseIf 0.0 <= Temperature And Temperature <= 9.0 Then
    Debug.Print "It's cold"
Else
    Debug.Print "It's freezing"
End If</code></pre>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Optimizing hints</h3>
                        <p>When this program executes, the computer will check all conditions in order until one of them matches its concept of truth. As soon as this occurs, the program will execute the statement immediately following the condition and continue on, without checking any other condition for truth. For this reason, when you are trying to optimize a program, it is a good idea to sort your If..Then..Else conditions in order of descending likelihood. This will ensure that in the most common scenarios, the computer has to do less work, as it will most likely only have to check one or two branches before it finds the statement which it should execute. However, when writing programs for the first time, try not to think about this too much lest you find yourself undertaking premature optimization.</p>
                        <p>In Visual Basic Classic conditional statements with more than one conditional do not use shortcircuit evaluation. In order to mimic C/C++'s short-circuit evaluation, use ElseIf as described in the example above. In fact for complicated expressions explicit If..Then..Elself statements are clearer and easier to read than the equivalent short circuit expression.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Select Case</h3>
                        <p>Often it is necessary to compare one specific variable against several constant expressions. For this kind of conditional expression the Select Case is used. The above example is such a case and could also be written like this:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-vb">Select Case Temperature
    Case Is >= 40#
        Debug.Print "It's extremely hot"
    Case 30# To 39#
        Debug.Print "It's hot"
    Case 20# To 29#
        Debug.Print "It's warm"
    Case 10# To 19#
        Debug.Print "It's cool"
    Case 0# To 9#
        Debug.Print "It's cold"
    Case Else
        Debug.Print "It's freezing"
End Select</code></pre>
