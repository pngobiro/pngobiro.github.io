                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It wasn't many years ago that using a computer meant literally learning a new language. Innovations like the graphical user interface exposed basic elements like the filesystem to a wider audience, and the Internet has become increasingly democratized as user-friendly tools like Wordpress, Youtube and Soundcloud allow anyone to create, publish and distribute content without writing a line of code. Today an explosion of accessible prototyping kits is making it possible for amateurs and hobbyists to sink their teeth into the growing Internet of Things by cobbling together connected computing projects.</p>
                        <p>But when it comes to making that hardware do your bidding, most tinkerers will still encounter a "language barrier". Even the most user-friendly development boards need to be programmed; and even the simplest programming languages still look like alphabet soup to the uninitiated.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, some developers have started to step in and provide user-friendly, visual programming tools. These platforms abstract away the functions, variables and idiosyncratic syntax rules of the underlying code and give users a simple drag-and-drop interface for building apps out of discrete chunks of logic ("When this happens, do that") and widgets that can apply settings tailored to any specific piece of hardware.</p>
                        <p>Here's a roundup of visual programming platforms that have some application to the Internet of Things-either because they're tailor-made for programming sensors and embedded computers, or because they're general-purpose platforms for programming in the languages that are compatible with those devices.</p>

                            <li>Commercial /Enterprise Focused</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Visual languages have a fundamental set of problems:</p>
                        <h3>1. Visual Languages Aren't Extensible</h3>
                        <p>This is probably the capital sin of visual languages. They allow you to do a limited set of things easily, but edge cases are far too difficult, or even impossible to achieve. Tools should give us more power, instead of limiting us.</p>
                        <h3>2. Visual Languages Generate Slow Code</h3>
                        <p>Every developer who has faced performance problems knows how hard they are to diagnose and overcome. Visual languages are leaky abstractions, often generating slow code which is impossible to optimize.</p>
                        <h3>3. Visual Language Tools Can Be Terrible</h3>
                        <p>We live and breathe in our IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). When they are poor, they can make our lives miserable! Visual languages and IDEs should be designed together: our love or hate for a language is a direct measure of our love or hate for its tools.</p>
                        <h3>4. Visual Languages Lock You In</h3>
                        <p>Any technology decision brings a level of lock in. The fear of being locked into a dead-end is justifiable, given that most visual languages generate unreadable lower level code, only target niche segments, are supported by suicidal startups, or haven't left the research lab yet (where amazing recent work, like Bret Victor's, is being done). Real success stories, of people using it in large projects, are still rare, and these communities are still growing.</p>
                        <h3>5. You Are Neurologically Programmed to Reject It</h3>
                        <p>The problems in the previous sections are serious and, as visual language architects, we know it's our responsibility to continue our work to address them, removing these limitations.</p>
                        <p>But there are deeper reasons why you don't trust visual languages:</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/chapter-10-complexity.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating complexity and resistance to change" class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>The first is related to our love for complexity. Although we might say otherwise, we all do, according to the father of usability, Don Norman. Take musical instruments, for instance: musicians love them because they are hard to master. Think about legislation. Or even language: most poetry is hidden under complex sentences and words. We love the intellectual challenge of thinking difficult thoughts. Your mind is probably doing it right now, agreeing with these ideas, or checking if there is anything wrong or missing in them.</p>
                        <p>We need, however, to be careful with this, as we create deep moats against the rest of the world, and that brilliant xor swap algorithm I've coded today may be somebody else's nightmare next year.</p>
                        <p>Like Steve Jobs said: "Simple can be harder than complex. But it's worth it."</p>
                        <p>The second reason is even more primitive: it's fear of change. We take the time to acquire some expertise, and suddenly it seems our old weapons are no longer needed. But we're seeing it wrong:</p>
                        <p>Our weapons are not to be able to do a malloc, or pointer arithmetic; they are to be able to divide a problem into smaller parts, to understand the process of iterating on its solution, to detect strange code smells, to discuss a diagram on a whiteboard, to refactor systems into better architectures.</p>
                        <p>Those are our real weapons, the ones we've been sharpening for years, weapons that, with higher level languages, become even more deadly to any problem that might cross our path. Fear not: a great developer will always be more valuable than any tool he works with.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Let's face it: there's also social acceptance. We were here first, we bought the debut albums, we'd never be caught listening to the sellouts that make it easy for everyone.</p>
                        <h3>1. We've Been Here Before</h3>
                        <p>Because of these instinctive reactions, anything that aims to democratize computing is met with skepticism. HyperCard, Delphi, Visual Basic, COBOL. We, the "real" developers, are too quick to point out their faults, and mock them with no mercy until they die, instead of helping them improve. Even JavaScript almost had that same fate during the DHTML days.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/chapter-10-analogy.jpg" alt="Analogy for the evolution of user interfaces" class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>There is, however, an analogy that might better show us the future: The shift from text operating systems, like Unix and MS-DOS, to graphical user interfaces, like Mac or Windows, which suffered pushback from several computer experts at the time.</p>
                        <p>That evolution, which seems so inevitable today, brought us better graphic cards - which lead to better games, brought us the world wide web, brought us smartphones.</p>
                        <p>Can you imagine a world without these unbelievable things?</p>
                        <h3>2. So, Are We Finally Ready For It?</h3>
                        <p>Not sure: you may not, or you may feel we're not - it's fair either way. But try to understand your biases, and don't be afraid to give visual languages a shot: there are several organizations like mine, in different domains, challenging the way software is traditionally delivered, and pushing forward the state of the art.</p>
                        <p>And even if, after trying them out, you still don't see the bright future of visual programming, that's fine: consider keeping an open mind and come back later, otherwise you might just end up in the wrong side of history.</p>
