3. **Special Elements Inventory**:
   Special Elements (Approximate Counts from MMD):
   - Equations: Numerous inline ($...$) and some display ($$...$$ or similar). MathJax required. Complex notations like `\mp@subsup` present.
   - Tables: ~10+ (Simple lists, comparisons, property lists, UI mockups). Need careful HTML conversion.
   - Figures: ~15+ (Image URLs identified in MMD). Need download and local storage.
   - Code Blocks: Numerous VB code examples. Need `<pre><code>` formatting.
   - Complex Lists: Standard bulleted/numbered lists present.
   - Special Formatting: `\section*`, `\title{}`, `\author{}`, `\checkmark`, `\mathbf{}`, `\footnotetext{}`.

   Critical Sections (requiring special attention):
   - MMD Lines ~802, 827, 854, 883, 959, 971: Handle `\mp@subsup` notation.
   - MMD Lines ~887, 854: Correct apparent OCR errors (`yrt`, `çŸœ`).
   - MMD Line ~953: Correct `\sqrt{V}`.
   - MMD Lines ~1434-1473: Convert complex table representing UI output.
   - MMD Line ~1414: Check `|` in code block.
   - MMD Lines ~1722, 1942: Correct `\overline` OCR errors in code.
   - MMD Lines ~2012-2056: Reconstruct table with formatting issues.
   - MMD Lines ~2097-2171: Combine multi-page property table.
   - MMD Lines ~2234-2236: Remove `\author{}` block from code.
   - MMD Lines ~2302-2305: Remove leading line numbers from code.
   - General: Remove "Downloaded by..." lines and processing logs. Ensure verbatim text transfer.
