        <h2>📚 3.2 Virtual Memory</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Preceding sections talked about how to avoid memory fragmentation by breaking process memory requirements down into smaller bites ( pages ), and storing the pages non-contiguously in memory. However the entire process still had to be stored in memory somewhere.</li>
          <li>In practice, most real processes do not need all their pages, or at least not all at once, for several reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>Error handling code is not needed unless that specific error occurs, some of which are quite rare.</li>
              <li>Arrays are often over-sized for worst-case scenarios, and only a small fraction of the arrays are actually used in practice.</li>
              <li>Certain features of certain programs are rarely used, such as the routine to balance the federal budget. :-)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The ability to load only the portions of processes that were actually needed ( and only when they were needed ) has several benefits:
            <ul>
              <li>Programs could be written for a much larger address space ( virtual memory space ) than physically exists on the computer.</li>
              <li>Because each process is only using a fraction of their total address space, there is more memory left for other programs, improving CPU utilization and system throughput.</li>
              <li>Less I/O is needed for swapping processes in and out of RAM, speeding things up.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Figure below shows the general layout of virtual memory, which can be much larger than physical memory:</p>
        <p><img src="../assets/images/module5-virtual-memory-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing virtual memory that is larger than physical memory" width="600" height="300"></p>
        <ul>
          <li>🔍 page v</li>
          <li>🔍 virtual memory</li>
          <li>🔍 memory map</li>
          <li>🔍 physical memory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Figure below shows virtual address space, which is the programmer's logical view of process memory storage. The actual physical layout is controlled by the process's page table.</p>
        <p>Note that the address space shown in Figure is sparse - A great hole in the middle of the address space is never used, unless the stack and/or the heap grow to fill the hole.</p>

          <li>🔍 stack</li>
          <li>🔍 heap</li>

          <li>🔍 code</li>
          <li>🔍 0</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Virtual memory also allows the sharing of files and memory by multiple processes, with several benefits:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>System libraries can be shared mapping them into the virtual address space of more than one process.</li>
              <li>Processes can also share virtual memory by mapping the same block of memory to more than one process.</li>
              <li>Process pages can be shared during a fork( ) system call, eliminating the need to copy all of the pages of the original ( parent ) process.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>📚 Demand Paging</h2>
        <p>The basic idea behind demand paging is that when a process is swapped in, its pages are not swapped in all at once. Rather they are swapped in only when the process needs them. ( on demand. ) This is termed a lazy swapper, although a pager is a more accurate term.</p>

          <li>🔍 program B</li>
          <li>🔍 swap out</li>
          <li>🔍 swap in</li>
          <li>🔍 main memory</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📝 Basic Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>📚 The basic idea behind paging is that when a process is swapped in, the pager only loads into memory those pages that it expects the process to need ( right away. )</li>
          <li>📚 Pages that are not loaded into memory are marked as invalid in the page table, using the invalid bit. ( The rest of the page table entry may either be blank or contain information about where to find the swapped-out page on the hard drive. )</li>
          <li>📚 If the process only ever accesses pages that are loaded in memory ( memory resident pages), then the process runs exactly as if all the pages were loaded in to memory.</li>
        </ul>
