        <h2>📚 Address Generated by the CPU</h2>
        <p>The address generated by the CPU is called logical address or virtual address. The address seen by the memory unit i.e., the one loaded in to the memory register is called the physical address. Compile time and load time address binding methods generate some logical and physical address. The execution time addressing binding generate different logical and physical address. Set of logical address space generated by the programs is the logical address space. Set of physical address corresponding to these logical addresses is the physical address space. The mapping of virtual address to physical address during run time is done by the hardware device called memory management unit (MMU). The base register is also called re-location register. Value of the re-location register is added to every address generated by the user process at the time it is sent to memory.</p>

            <li>🔍 Relocation register</li>
            <li>🔍 Memory</li>
            <li>🔍 MMU</li>
          </ul>
        <p>The above figure shows that dynamic relocation which implies mapping from virtual addresses space to physical address space and is performed by the hardware at run time. Re-location is performed by the hardware and is invisible to the user dynamic relocation makes it possible to move a partially executed process from one area of memory to another without affecting.</p>

        <h2>✍️ Dynamic Loading:</h2>
        <p>For a process to be executed it should be loaded in to the physical memory. The size of the process is limited to the size of the physical memory. Dynamic loading is used to obtain better memory utilization. In dynamic loading the routine or procedure will not be loaded until it is called. Whenever a routine is called, the calling routine first checks whether the called routine is already loaded or not. If it is not loaded it cause the loader to load the desired program in to the memory and updates the programs address table to indicate the change and control is passed to newly called routine.</p>
        <p>💡 Advantage: Gives better memory utilization. Unused routine is never loaded. Do not need special</p>

        <h2>📝 Summary</h2>
        <p>This module explores dynamic memory management. The hardware device called memory management unit (MMU) maps virtual addresses to physical addresses during run time.Dynamic loading is a process that is loaded in to the physical memory only when it is called.</p>
