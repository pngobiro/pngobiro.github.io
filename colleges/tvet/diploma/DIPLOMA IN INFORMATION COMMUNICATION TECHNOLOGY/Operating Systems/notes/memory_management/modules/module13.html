        <h2>📚 Shared Memory in the Win32 API</h2>
        <p>Shared memory can be implemented via shared memory-mapped files ( Windows ), or it can be implemented through a separate process ( Linux, UNIX. )</p>
        <p>Windows implements shared memory using shared memory-mapped files, involving three basic steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a file, producing a HANDLE to the new file.</li>
          <li>Name the file as a shared object, producing a HANDLE to the shared object.</li>
          <li>Map the shared object to virtual memory address space, returning its base address as a void pointer ( LPVOID ).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is illustrated in below Figure</p>

        <h2>📚 Memory-Mapped I/O</h2>
        <p>All access to devices is done by writing into (or reading from ) the device's registers.</p>
        <p>Normally this is done via special I/O instructions.</p>
        <p>For certain devices it makes sense to simply map the device's registers to addresses in the process's virtual address space, making device I/O as fast and simple as any other memory access. Video controller cards are a classic example of this.</p>
        <p>Serial and parallel devices can also use memory mapped I/O, mapping the device registers to specific memory addresses known as I/O Ports, e.g. 0xF8. Transferring a series of bytes must be done one at a time, moving only as fast as the I/O device is prepared to process the data, through one of two mechanisms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Programmed I/O ( PIO ), also known as polling. The CPU periodically checks the control bit on the device, to see if it is ready to handle another byte of data.</li>
          <li>Interrupt Driven. The device generates an interrupt when it either has another byte of data to deliver or is ready to receive another byte.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>📝 Summary</h2>
        <p>Shared Memory and I/O are essential for operating systems. This module discussed shared memory, memory-mapped files in Windows and PIO along with Interrupt Driven operations.</p>
