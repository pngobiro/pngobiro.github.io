        <h2>📚 Page-Buffering Algorithms</h2>
        <p>There are a number of page-buffering algorithms that can be used in conjunction with the aforementioned algorithms, to improve overall performance and sometimes make up for inherent weaknesses in the hardware and/or the underlying page-replacement algorithms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain a certain minimum number of free frames at all times. When a page-fault occurs, go ahead and allocate one of the free frames from the free list first, to get the requesting process up and running again as quickly as possible, and then select a victim page to write to disk and free up a frame as a second step.</li>
          <li>Keep a list of modified pages, and when the the I/O system is otherwise idle, have it write these pages out to disk, and then clear the modify bits, thereby increasing the chance of finding a "clean" page for the next potential victim.</li>
          <li>Keep a pool of free frames, but remember what page was in it before it was made free. Since the data in the page is not actually cleared out when the page is freed, it can be made an active page again without having to load in any new data from disk. This is useful when an algorithm mistakenly replaces a page that in fact is needed again soon.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>📚 Applications and Page Replacement</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Some applications ( most notably database programs ) understand their data accessing and caching needs better than the general-purpose OS, and should therefore be given reign to do their own memory management.</li>
            <li>Sometimes such programs are given a raw disk partition to work with, containing raw data blocks and no file system structure. It is then up to the application to use this disk partition as extended memory or for whatever other reasons it sees fit.</li>
          </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>📚 Allocation of Frames</h2>
        <p>We said earlier that there were two important tasks in virtual memory management: a page-replacement strategy and a frame-allocation strategy. This section covers the second part of that pair.</p>
