<p>Outline four characteristics of a priority scheduling algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Priority scheduling assigns a priority level to each process.</p>
<p data-number="1">Processes with higher priorities are executed before processes with lower priorities.</p>
<p data-number="2">Processes with the same priority are typically executed in FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) order.</p>
<p data-number="3">Priority scheduling can be preemptive or non-preemptive.</p>
<p data-number="4">It may lead to starvation for low-priority processes if high priority process arrive continuously.</p>

<p>Distinguish between dumb and smart controllers.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Dumb Controller:</p>
<p>A dumb controller is a simple device controller that can only follow explicit instructions from the CPU. It has minimal processing power and relies entirely on the CPU for all decision-making.</p>
<p>Smart Controller:</p>
<p>A smart controller has its own processor and can perform some processing independently of the CPU. It can handle more complex tasks and offload some of the processing burden from the main CPU. Smart controller use cache memory.</p>

<p>Explain three circumstances under which an ostrich algorithm would be used to deal with deadlock in an operating system.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>The ostrich algorithm ignores potential deadlocks and pretends they do not exist.</p>
<p data-number="1">When deadlocks are very rare: If the probability of a deadlock occurring is extremely low, the cost of detection or prevention mechanisms may outweigh the impact of a potential deadlock.</p>
<p data-number="2">When the cost of deadlock recovery is low: If the system can easily recover from a deadlock (e.g., by rebooting), the overhead of deadlock prevention or detection might not be justified.</p>
<p data-number="3">When deadlock detection and prevention are too expensive: In systems where the computational cost of implementing deadlock detection or prevention algorithms is high, the ostrich algorithm might be a pragmatic choice.</p>

<p>Mary noted several caching issues while using an operating system. Explain two such issues that she could have noted.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Cache Coherency: This issue occurs when multiple caches exist (e.g., in a multi-core processor), and the data in one cache is modified without updating the other caches or main memory. This leads to inconsistencies.</p>
<p data-number="2">Cache Thrashing: Occurs when the cache is constantly being filled and emptied due to a working set of data that exceeds the cache's capacity. This results in frequent cache misses and significantly degrades performance.</p>

<p>Distinguish between seek time and latency as applied is disk drives.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Seek Time:</p>
<p>Seek time is the time it takes for the disk arm to move the read/write head to the correct track on the disk platter.</p>
<p>Latency (Rotational Latency):</p>
<p>Latency is the time it takes for the desired sector of the disk to rotate under the read/write head after the head is positioned on the correct track. It's the delay caused by the rotational speed of the disk.</p>

<p>Contiguous file allocation method is commonly used in operating systems. Outline four advantages of this file allocation method.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Contiguous file allocation involves storing file blocks in adjacent disk blocks.</p>
<p data-number="1">Simple Implementation: It's straightforward to implement because the operating system only needs to track the starting block and the length of the file.</p>
<p data-number="2">Fast Sequential Access: Sequential access is very fast since all blocks are contiguous, requiring minimal head movement.</p>
<p data-number="3">Good Read Performance: Excellent for read operations, especially for sequential reads.</p>
<p data-number="4">Minimal Overhead: Low metadata overhead, as only the starting address and length need to be stored.</p>

<p>Round Robin scheduling is a preemptive scheduling algorithm.</p>
<p data-number="1">Time Quantum/Time Slice: Each process is allocated a fixed time slice to execute.</p>

<p>Differentiate between maskable and non-maskable interrupts.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Maskable Interrupt:</p>
<p>A maskable interrupt is an interrupt that can be temporarily disabled or ignored by the CPU. The operating system can choose to delay the handling of a maskable interrupt if a higher-priority task is being executed.</p>
<p>Non-maskable Interrupt (NMI):</p>
<p>A non-maskable interrupt is a high-priority interrupt that cannot be ignored or disabled by the CPU. It signals a critical hardware error or event that requires immediate attention, such as a power failure or memory error.</p>

<div class="answer-content">
<p>Process swapping is the act of temporarily removing a process from main memory (RAM) and placing it on secondary storage (such as a hard disk) to free up memory for other processes. The swapped-out process can be brought back into memory later when needed.</p>

<p>Virtual memory does affect the performance of a system. Explain three disadvantages of implementing virtual memory in highly computational environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Overhead: Managing virtual memory adds overhead to the system, as the OS needs to translate virtual addresses to physical addresses and handle page faults.</p>
<p data-number="2">Thrashing: If the system spends more time swapping pages between memory and disk than executing processes, it is said to be thrashing. This drastically reduces performance.</p>
<p data-number="3">Increased Disk I/O: Virtual memory relies heavily on disk I/O for swapping pages, which is significantly slower than accessing RAM. This can slow down the overall system performance, especially in computationally intensive tasks that require frequent memory access.</p>

<p>Ready:</p>
<p>A process in the ready state is loaded in main memory and is waiting to be assigned to a processor for execution. It has all the resources it needs except the CPU.</p>
<p>Ready Suspended:</p>
<p>A process in the ready suspended state is not immediately available for execution. It has been swapped out of main memory to secondary storage (e.g., hard disk) but is still ready to run once it is loaded back into memory. This state helps to manage memory usage when there are more processes than can fit in RAM simultaneously.</p>

</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Inefficient Polling: Continuously checking the status of I/O devices (polling) wastes CPU cycles, especially when devices are slow or infrequent in their data transfer requests. This reduces overall throughput.</p>
<p data-number="2">Lack of Buffering: Insufficient buffering between the I/O device and memory can create bottlenecks. If data is not buffered effectively, the CPU or device may have to wait, reducing throughput.</p>
<p data-number="3">Incorrect Interrupt Handling: Inefficient or slow interrupt handling routines can significantly limit I/O throughput. If interrupt service routines are lengthy or poorly optimized, they can delay processing and reduce the overall data transfer rate.</p>

<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Be Descriptive and Specific: File names should clearly indicate the content of the file. Use specific and descriptive words that accurately reflect the file's purpose.</p>
<p data-number="2">Use Consistent Naming Conventions: Establish and follow a consistent naming convention within an organization or project. This makes it easier for users to understand and locate files.</p>
<p data-number="3">Keep Names Concise but Clear: Aim for a balance between brevity and clarity. File names should be short enough to be easily manageable but long enough to convey sufficient information.</p>
<p data-number="4">Avoid Special Characters and Spaces: Special characters (e.g., *, ?, /, \, :, &lt;, &gt;, |, ") and spaces can cause compatibility issues across different operating systems and applications.
