<p>Assuming that the system uses the SJF scheduling algorithm.</p>
<p>(i) Determine the average waiting time for the processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>To determine the average waiting time using SJF (Shortest Job First), we need to schedule the processes based on their run time, considering their arrival times.</p>
<p><strong>Scheduling with SJF (Non-Preemptive):</strong></p>
<p>1. At time 0, Process W arrives and runs (shortest job available).</p>
<p>2. At time 2, Processes X and Y arrive. Process W completes at time 2.</p>
<p>3. At time 2, choose the shortest job among X, Y, and Z (which arrives at time 3). Process X has the shortest run time (7).</p>
<p>4. At time 3, Process Z arrives. Process X continues to run (non-preemptive).</p>
<p>5. Process X runs for 7 units, completing at time 2 + 7 = 9.</p>
<p>6. At time 9, choose the shortest job among Y and Z. Process Z has the shortest run time (3).</p>
<p>7. Process Z runs for 3 units, completing at time 9 + 3 = 12.</p>
<p>8. Process Y runs for the remaining 20 units, completing at time 12 + 20 = 32.</p>
<p><strong>Gantt Chart:</strong></p>
<pre>                    Time: | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12| 13| ... | 31| 32|
                    -----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|---|---|
                    CPU: | W | W | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | Z | Z | Z | Y | Y | ... | Y | Y |
                    -----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|-----|---|---|
                    </pre>
<p><strong>Completion Times and Turnaround Times:</strong></p>
<p>W: Completion Time = 2, Turnaround Time = 2 - 0 = 2</p>
<p>X: Completion Time = 9, Turnaround Time = 9 - 2 = 7</p>
<p>Z: Completion Time = 12, Turnaround Time = 12 - 3 = 9</p>
<p>Y: Completion Time = 32, Turnaround Time = 32 - 2 = 30</p>
<p><strong>Waiting Times:</strong></p>
<p>Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Run Time</p>
<p>W: Waiting Time = 2 - 2 = 0</p>
<p>X: Waiting Time = 7 - 7 = 0</p>
<p>Z: Waiting Time = 9 - 3 = 6</p>
<p>Y: Waiting Time = 30 - 20 = 10</p>
<p><strong>Average Waiting Time:</strong> (0 + 0 + 6 + 10) / 4 = 16 / 4 = <strong>4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Average Waiting Time for the processes is 4 units.</strong></p>

<p>(b) Table 1 shows details of processes in a computer system. Use it to answer the questions that follow.</p>
<p>(ii) Explain one disadvantage of the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>One disadvantage of using the <strong>non-preemptive SJF scheduling algorithm</strong> in this system is the potential for <strong>starvation or longer waiting times for longer processes</strong>. If there is a continuous arrival of short processes, longer processes may get delayed indefinitely or experience very long waiting times as SJF always prioritizes shorter jobs. In this example, Process Y, being the longest job, has a significantly higher waiting time compared to shorter jobs, illustrating this potential disadvantage.</p>

</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><strong>External Fragmentation</strong>: Memory segmentation can suffer from <strong>external fragmentation</strong>. Over time, as segments are allocated and deallocated, the free memory space can become fragmented into smaller, non-contiguous holes. This can lead to a situation where there is enough total free memory, but it is not contiguous enough to allocate larger segments, causing allocation failures even when sufficient memory exists in aggregate.</p>
<p data-number="2"><strong>Segment Table Overhead and Complexity</strong>: Managing <strong>segment tables</strong> adds overhead. Each process needs a segment table to map logical addresses to physical addresses. Segment tables consume memory space and require management by the operating system. Furthermore, address translation using segment tables can be more complex and potentially slower than simpler techniques like paging, adding processing overhead.</p>
<p data-number="3"><strong>Variable Segment Sizes and Management Complexity</strong>: The <strong>variable size of segments</strong>, while offering flexibility, also adds to management complexity. The operating system needs to keep track of segments of different sizes, manage allocation and deallocation of variable-sized blocks, and handle the fragmentation issues that arise from variable-sized allocations. Managing variable-sized segments is more intricate than managing fixed-size pages in paging.</p>
<p data-number="4"><strong>Overhead of Segment Swapping (if used)</strong>: If the segmentation-based system uses swapping (moving segments to disk), <strong>swapping variable-sized segments</strong> can be more complex and potentially less efficient than swapping fixed-size pages. Managing and swapping segments of different sizes can introduce additional overhead in terms of disk I/O and memory management, especially if segment sizes are not optimally managed.</p>

<p>(d) James, a student with a certain college was carrying out an assignment about memory registers in computer systems. Describe two types of registers James would include in his report.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><strong>General-Purpose Registers (GPRs)</strong>: <strong>General-Purpose Registers (GPRs)</strong> are <strong>versatile registers</strong> used for a variety of purposes by the CPU. They are used to hold <strong>operands for arithmetic and logical operations, memory addresses, loop counters, and temporary data</strong> during program execution. GPRs are fundamental for data manipulation and processing within the CPU. Examples include registers like EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX (in x86 architecture) or R0, R1, R2, etc. (in ARM architecture). James should include GPRs as they are essential for general-purpose computation.</p>
<p data-number="2"><strong>Special-Purpose Registers</strong>: <strong>Special-Purpose Registers</strong> have <strong>specific, predefined functions</strong> within the CPU architecture. They are used for particular tasks and operations, and their usage is often restricted or controlled by the CPU. Examples include: * <strong>Program Counter (PC)</strong>: Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed. * <strong>Stack Pointer (SP)</strong>: Points to the top of the current stack in memory. * <strong>Instruction Register (IR)</strong>: Holds the current instruction being decoded and executed. * <strong>Status Register (Flags Register)</strong>: Contains status flags that reflect the result of arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., zero flag, carry flag, overflow flag). James should describe special-purpose registers as they are critical for controlling CPU operation, instruction flow, and managing program execution.</p>

<p>8. (a) Explain two advantages of dynamic linking as used in memory management.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><strong>Reduced Memory Footprint</strong>: <strong>Dynamic linking</strong> leads to a <strong>reduced memory footprint</strong> because shared libraries are loaded into memory only once, and <strong>shared among multiple processes</strong> that use them. Instead of each program having its own copy of library code, they all link to a single shared library in memory. This significantly saves memory, especially when many programs use the same libraries, resulting in more efficient memory utilization and allowing more programs to run concurrently.</p>
<p data-number="2"><strong>Easier Library Updates and Maintenance</strong>: Dynamic linking simplifies <strong>library updates and maintenance</strong>. When a shared library is updated (e.g., for bug fixes or security patches), the updated library can be replaced in one location, and <strong>all applications that use it automatically benefit from the update</strong> the next time they are executed, without needing to be recompiled or relinked. This simplifies software distribution, patching, and maintenance, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring consistency across applications.</p>

<p>(b) A certain company intends to deploy RAID technology as a backup strategy on their distributed system. Outline four levels of RAID technology the company could use to accomplish the task.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><strong>RAID 1 (Mirroring)</strong>: <strong>RAID 1</strong> mirrors data across two or more disks, providing <strong>data redundancy</strong>. Every piece of data is written to two or more disks simultaneously. If one disk fails, data is preserved on the other disk(s). RAID 1 is suitable for backup as it ensures data availability in case of disk failure and provides good read performance, but it reduces storage capacity by half (or more, depending on the number of mirrors).</p>
<p data-number="2"><strong>RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)</strong>: <strong>RAID 5</strong> stripes data across three or more disks and includes <strong>parity information</strong>. Parity data allows for data reconstruction if one disk fails. RAID 5 provides a balance between redundancy and storage efficiency, offering fault tolerance and good read performance, although write performance is slightly reduced due to parity calculations. It's a common choice for backup and general-purpose storage.</p>
<p data-number="3"><strong>RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity)</strong>: <strong>RAID 6</strong> is similar to RAID 5 but includes <strong>double parity</strong>, meaning it can tolerate the failure of up to two disks simultaneously without data loss. RAID 6 provides higher fault tolerance than RAID 5, making it suitable for critical backup systems where data availability is paramount, but it has slightly lower write performance and higher overhead due to double parity.</p>
<p data-number="4"><strong>RAID 10 (RAID 1+0, Mirroring and Striping)</strong>: <strong>RAID 10</strong> combines <strong>mirroring (RAID 1) and striping (RAID 0)</strong>. It creates mirrored pairs of disks (RAID 1) and then stripes data across these mirrored pairs (RAID 0). RAID 10 offers both high performance (due to striping) and high redundancy (due to mirroring). It provides excellent fault tolerance and fast read/write speeds, making it suitable for high-performance backup systems, but it is more expensive as it requires at least twice the storage capacity compared to the usable space.</p>

<p>(c) Alex, a systems analyst with a certain company was given a task of designing an operating system that would work with different hardware vendors. Describe three types of 1/0 communication techniques that he would use.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><strong>Programmed I/O (PIO)</strong>: <strong>Programmed I/O (PIO)</strong> is a simple I/O communication technique where data transfer between the CPU and I/O devices is <strong>directly controlled by the CPU</strong>. For each data byte or word transferred, the CPU executes I/O instructions to read or write data to device registers. PIO is straightforward to implement but is <strong>CPU-intensive</strong>, as the CPU is actively involved in every data transfer, limiting CPU parallelism and system performance, especially for high-speed I/O devices. PIO is suitable for low-data-rate devices or simple systems where CPU overhead is not a major concern.</p>
<p data-number="2"><strong>Interrupt-Driven I/O</strong>: <strong>Interrupt-Driven I/O</strong> improves upon PIO by allowing the <strong>CPU to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete</strong>. When an I/O device is ready to transfer data or has completed an operation, it sends an <strong>interrupt signal</strong> to the CPU. The CPU then suspends its current task, executes an <strong>interrupt handler</strong> to transfer data or handle the I/O event, and then resumes the interrupted task. Interrupt-driven I/O reduces CPU waiting time compared to PIO and improves system concurrency, but still involves CPU intervention for each data transfer, although less directly than PIO.</p>
<p data-number="3"><strong>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</strong>: <strong>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</strong> is the most efficient I/O communication technique for high-speed data transfer. DMA allows I/O devices to <strong>transfer data directly to or from main memory without constant CPU involvement</strong>. A <strong>DMA Controller</strong> manages the data transfer, freeing up the CPU to perform other tasks concurrently. The CPU initiates the DMA transfer by programming the DMA controller, and the controller then handles the data transfer independently. DMA significantly reduces CPU overhead for I/O operations, improving system performance, especially for high-bandwidth devices like disks and network interfaces. DMA is essential for efficient high-speed I/O in modern systems.</p>

<p><strong>Description of Components:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Platters</strong>: Hard disks contain one or more <strong>platters</strong>, which are rigid, circular disks coated with a magnetic material. Data is stored on both surfaces of each platter in concentric tracks and sectors.</p>
<p><strong>Spindle</strong>: The <strong>spindle</strong> is a central shaft that <strong>holds and rotates the platters</strong> at a constant speed. The platters spin around the spindle, enabling the read/write heads to access different parts of the disk surface.</p>
<p><strong>Read/Write Heads</strong>: <strong>Read/write heads</strong> are electromagnetic components that <strong>read data from and write data to the platters</strong>. Each platter surface has a corresponding read/write head. Heads are mounted on an actuator arm and float very close to the platter surface without touching it.</p>
<p><strong>Actuator Arm</strong>: The <strong>actuator arm</strong> is a mechanism that <strong>positions the read/write heads</strong> across the platters. It moves the heads radially across the disk surface to access different tracks and cylinders. The actuator arm is responsible for seek operations.</p>
<p><strong>Disk Controller</strong>: The <strong>disk controller</strong> is electronic circuitry that <strong>controls the operation of the hard disk</strong>. It interprets commands from the host computer, controls the actuator arm and spindle motor, manages data transfer, and performs error checking and correction. The controller acts as an interface between the disk and the computer's system bus.</p>
<p><strong>Enclosure</strong>: The <strong>enclosure</strong> is the protective casing that <strong>houses all the internal components</strong> of the hard disk, protecting them from dust, damage, and external interference.</p>
