<h3>1 (d) (6 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Paging is a significant technique used in memory management. Explain three advantages that paging could provide when implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Virtual Memory Implementation: Paging is essential for implementing virtual memory, allowing processes to run even if they are larger than physical memory. It enables the system to bring only necessary pages into RAM, keeping the rest on disk.</p>
<p data-number="2">Reduced External Fragmentation: Paging eliminates external fragmentation as memory allocation is done in fixed-size pages. Free pages can be allocated to any process, regardless of their physical location, making memory utilization more efficient.</p>
<p data-number="3">Efficient Memory Sharing: Paging facilitates sharing of code and data among processes. If multiple processes use the same code or libraries, the corresponding pages can be shared in physical memory, reducing memory footprint and improving system efficiency.</p>

<h3>2 (a) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Outline four types of Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfer mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Burst Mode DMA: In burst mode, DMA controller transfers a block of data in a continuous sequence. It gains control of the system bus and retains it until the entire block transfer is complete, leading to high-speed data transfer.</p>
<p data-number="2">Cycle Stealing DMA: In cycle stealing mode, DMA controller transfers data one byte or word at a time, relinquishing bus control after each transfer. CPU can interleave its operations with DMA transfers, allowing concurrent CPU and I/O activity, though at a reduced DMA transfer rate.</p>
<p data-number="3">Transparent DMA: In transparent DMA, DMA transfers occur when the CPU is not using the system bus, typically during CPU idle cycles or memory refresh cycles. DMA operations are transparent to the CPU, having minimal impact on CPU performance.</p>
<p data-number="4">Fly-by DMA: In fly-by DMA, data is transferred directly between two peripherals without going through main memory. DMA controller manages data flow directly from source device to destination device, reducing memory bandwidth usage and latency.</p>

<h3>2 (b) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Explain two features of the 3rd generation computer operating system.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Multiprogramming: Third-generation operating systems introduced multiprogramming, allowing multiple programs to reside in memory simultaneously. This enabled the CPU to switch between programs, increasing CPU utilization and system throughput by overlapping CPU and I/O operations.</p>
<p data-number="2">Time-Sharing: Time-sharing systems emerged, a logical extension of multiprogramming. They allowed multiple users to interact with the computer system concurrently. CPU time is divided and allocated to each user's process in time slices, providing interactive computing experience and responsiveness.</p>

<h3>2 (c) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Explain two circumstances under which memory overlay could be implemented in memory management.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Limited Memory Size: When the size of a program exceeds the available physical memory, memory overlay can be used to run the program. It divides the program into smaller segments (overlays), loading only necessary segments into memory at any given time, swapping segments in and out as needed.</p>
<p data-number="2">Simple Program Structure: Memory overlay is more feasible when programs have a relatively simple and modular structure. Programs that can be naturally divided into independent modules or phases that do not need to reside in memory simultaneously are suitable for overlay implementation.</p>

<p>When a user program processes a malicious task it causes a threat to the operating system. Explain four such threats.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Malware Installation: Malicious programs can install malware (viruses, worms, Trojans) onto the system. Malware can compromise system integrity, steal data, disrupt operations, or grant unauthorized access to attackers.</p>
<p data-number="2">Data Breach and Exfiltration: Malicious tasks can lead to data breaches, where sensitive information is accessed and exfiltrated without authorization. This can compromise confidential data, intellectual property, or personal information.</p>
<p data-number="3">Denial of Service (DoS): Malicious programs can launch denial-of-service attacks, overwhelming system resources (CPU, memory, network) to make the system or services unavailable to legitimate users. DoS attacks can disrupt critical operations and services.</p>
<p data-number="4">Privilege Escalation: Malicious tasks may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities to escalate privileges, gaining administrative or root access to the system. With elevated privileges, malicious programs can bypass security controls, modify system settings, or perform unauthorized actions, causing severe damage.</p>

<h3>3 (c) (6 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Computer operating systems access files using specific mechanism. Explain three file access mechanisms that could be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Sequential Access: In sequential access, files are accessed in a linear, ordered manner, from the beginning to the end. Operations like read and write proceed in sequence. This method is efficient for processing files in order, such as log files or batch processing, but inefficient for random access or frequent seeking.</p>
<p data-number="2">Direct/Random Access: Direct access allows accessing any file record directly without traversing from the beginning. Records are accessed based on their address or position. This method is suitable for applications requiring random data retrieval and updates, such as databases or indexed file systems, providing fast access to specific data records.</p>
<p data-number="3">Indexed Sequential Access: Indexed sequential access combines sequential and direct access methods. It uses an index to enable direct access to records based on key values, while also supporting sequential processing. Files are stored sequentially, and an index is maintained to locate records quickly. This method balances the advantages of both sequential and direct access, suitable for applications needing both ordered processing and indexed retrieval.</p>

This parallel access enhances read and write performance, reducing I/O latency and increasing throughput, beneficial for high-performance applications.</p>
<p data-number="2">Enhanced Reliability and Fault Tolerance: RAID levels like mirroring (RAID 1) and parity-based RAID (RAID 5, RAID 6) provide data redundancy. In case of a disk failure, data can be recovered or accessed from redundant copies or parity information, ensuring data availability and system resilience. This fault tolerance minimizes downtime and data loss.</p>
<p data-number="3">Increased Storage Capacity: RAID configurations like spanning (RAID 0) and concatenation can combine multiple physical disks into a single logical volume, increasing total storage capacity. RAID can aggregate storage space from multiple drives, providing larger volumes to accommodate growing data needs. While some RAID levels trade capacity for redundancy, others maximize usable storage.</p>

<p>Explain two divisions of addresses generated by the CPU.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Logical Address (Virtual Address): Logical addresses are generated by the CPU and are addresses within the process's virtual address space. They are independent of the physical memory layout and are translated to physical addresses by the Memory Management Unit (MMU). Logical addresses provide processes with a private and contiguous address space.</p>
<p>Physical Address: Physical addresses are the actual memory addresses in physical RAM. They are used to access physical memory locations. Logical addresses are mapped to physical addresses by the MMU, using techniques like paging or segmentation, to enable virtual memory and memory protection.</p>

<p>Explain two circumstances under which deadlocks could occur in process management.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Mutual Exclusion and Hold and Wait: Deadlock can occur when processes require exclusive access to resources (mutual exclusion) and hold allocated resources while waiting to acquire additional resources (hold and wait). If multiple processes hold resources and request resources held by others, a circular wait condition can arise, leading to deadlock.</p>
<p data-number="2">No Preemption and Circular Wait: Deadlock can occur when resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process (no preemption) and a circular wait condition exists. Circular wait happens when two or more processes are waiting for each other to release resources in a circular chain, preventing any process from proceeding and resulting in a deadlock.</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">User-Level I/O Libraries: This is the highest layer, consisting of user-level libraries and APIs that provide a device-independent interface for applications to perform I/O operations. Libraries abstract device-specific details, offering high-level functions like file I/O, network communication, and device access. Applications interact with these libraries without needing to know device-specific details.</p>
<p data-number="2">Device-Independent OS Core: This layer in the OS kernel provides a device-independent abstraction for I/O operations. It includes generic I/O functions, buffering, caching, and error handling mechanisms that are common across different device types. This layer translates device-independent requests from user-level libraries into device-specific requests for lower layers.</p>
<p data-number="3">Device Drivers: Device drivers are the lowest layer, directly interacting with hardware devices. Each device driver is specific to a particular type of device or device controller. Drivers implement device-specific I/O operations, handle hardware interrupts, and translate generic I/O requests from the OS core into device-specific commands. Device drivers encapsulate hardware-specific details, ensuring device independence for higher layers.</p>

<p>Differentiate between deterministic scheduling and non-feministic scheduling algorithms for processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Deterministic Scheduling Algorithms:</p>
<p>Deterministic scheduling algorithms make scheduling decisions based on predictable process characteristics, such as known burst times or arrival times. These algorithms aim to optimize performance metrics based on this prior knowledge. Examples include First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Shortest Job Next (SJN). Deterministic algorithms are predictable and can provide guarantees on performance metrics under known conditions.</p>
<p>Non-Deterministic Scheduling Algorithms:</p>
<p>Non-deterministic scheduling algorithms make scheduling decisions without complete prior knowledge of process characteristics. They adapt to dynamic system conditions and process behaviors. Examples include Priority Scheduling, Round Robin, and Multilevel Queue Scheduling. Non-deterministic algorithms are more flexible and adaptable to real-world scenarios with varying process demands but may offer less predictability compared to deterministic algorithms.</p>

<p>Explain two ways of enforcing mutual exclusion in operating systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Semaphores: Semaphores are synchronization primitives used to control access to shared resources and enforce mutual exclusion. A semaphore is an integer variable with atomic operations (P and V). Processes use P operation to request access and V operation to release access, ensuring only one process can access a critical section at a time. Semaphores can be binary (mutex) or counting.</p>
<p data-number="2">Mutex Locks (Mutual Exclusion Locks): Mutex locks are binary semaphores that provide mutual exclusion. A mutex lock has two states: locked and unlocked. A process acquires the lock before entering a critical section, making it locked. Only the process holding the lock can unlock it after exiting the critical section. Mutex locks ensure that only one process can execute a critical section at any given time, preventing race conditions.</p>

<p>Distinguish between multiple-partition allocation and single-partition allocation as applied in computer memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Single-Partition Allocation:</p>
<p>In single-partition allocation, main memory is divided into only two partitions: one for the operating system and one for a single user process. The entire user partition is allocated to a single process at a time. It is simple to implement but inefficient as it supports only one user process at a time and leads to memory wastage if the process is smaller than the partition.</p>
<p>Multiple-Partition Allocation:</p>
<p>In multiple-partition allocation, main memory is divided into several partitions, each capable of holding a process. Multiple processes can reside in memory concurrently. Partitions can be fixed-sized (static partitioning) or variable-sized (dynamic partitioning). Multiple partitioning improves memory utilization and allows multiprogramming by accommodating several processes simultaneously.</p>

</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Context Switching: The dispatcher is responsible for performing context switching, which involves saving the state of the current process (CPU registers, program counter, etc.) and loading the saved state of a new process to be executed. Context switching enables the CPU to switch between processes, supporting multitasking and time-sharing.</p>
<p data-number="2">Process Selection: The dispatcher selects the next process to be executed by the CPU from the ready queue, based on the scheduling algorithm implemented by the operating system. It determines which process gets CPU time allocation based on factors like priority, waiting time, or burst time, ensuring fair or prioritized process execution.</p>
<p data-number="3">CPU Allocation: The dispatcher allocates CPU time to the selected process, giving it control of the processor to execute its instructions. It sets up the execution environment for the process and starts its execution. CPU allocation is a core function of the dispatcher in enabling process execution and concurrency.</p>

<p>Explain two circumstance that would lead to external fragmentation in computer memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Dynamic Partitioning with Variable Size Allocation: External fragmentation is common in dynamic partitioning where memory is allocated in variable-sized blocks. Over time, as processes are allocated and deallocated, memory becomes fragmented into small, non-contiguous holes. Even if total free memory is sufficient, a large process may not be allocated memory if no single contiguous block is large enough.</p>
<p data-number="2">First-Fit or Best-Fit Allocation Algorithms: Using allocation algorithms like first-fit or best-fit in dynamic partitioning can exacerbate external fragmentation. First-fit tends to allocate memory from the first available large enough block, potentially leaving larger holes fragmented later. Best-fit, while trying to minimize internal fragmentation, can also contribute to external fragmentation by creating many small, unusable free blocks scattered across memory.</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Access Pattern: Consider the primary way files will be accessed: sequential, random, or indexed. Sequential access favors sequential file organization, while random access suits direct or indexed organization.</p>
<p data-number="2">File Size and Volume: Evaluate the size and number of files. For large files, contiguous or indexed sequential methods might be efficient. For numerous small files, indexed or linked methods may be more appropriate.</p>
<p data-number="3">Performance Requirements: Analyze performance needs for file operations like read, write, search, and update. High-performance applications may require indexed or direct access for faster retrieval, while batch processing might benefit from sequential organization.</p>
<p data-number="4">Data Volatility and Update Frequency: Consider how often files are updated or modified.

<p>Distinguish between static loading and dynamic loading in memory management.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Static Loading:</p>
<p>In static loading, the entire program and all its required libraries are loaded into memory before program execution begins. All necessary code and data are loaded at load time. Static loading results in faster program startup as all components are in memory but increases memory usage during the entire execution, even if some parts of the code are not immediately needed.</p>
<p>Dynamic Loading:</p>
<p>In dynamic loading, program modules or libraries are loaded into memory only when they are first needed during runtime. Modules are loaded on demand. Dynamic loading reduces initial memory footprint and startup time as only essential parts are loaded initially. It conserves memory by loading modules only when required but may introduce overhead during runtime when loading modules for the first time.</p>

<p>Outline four causes of thrashing in computer memory management.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Insufficient Physical Memory: Thrashing primarily occurs when the amount of physical RAM is insufficient to accommodate the working sets of active processes. When the total memory required by running processes exceeds available RAM, excessive page swapping occurs, leading to thrashing.</p>
<p data-number="2">High Degree of Multiprogramming: Increasing the number of processes in memory (degree of multiprogramming) beyond the system's memory capacity can lead to thrashing. With more processes competing for limited memory, working sets overlap, causing increased page faults and swapping.</p>
<p data-number="3">Global Page Replacement Algorithms: Using global page replacement algorithms, where a page fault in one process can cause page replacement from another process's frame, can contribute to thrashing. Global replacement may lead to processes continuously faulting on pages needed by other processes, increasing overall page fault rate.</p>
<p data-number="4">Small Page Size: Very small page sizes can exacerbate thrashing. Smaller pages increase the number of pages required to hold a process's working set. With more pages, page fault frequency may increase, especially if locality of reference is not strong, leading to higher swapping overhead and thrashing.</p>

<p>Distinguish between synchronous I/O and asynchronous I/O in computer devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Synchronous I/O (Blocking I/O):</p>
<p>In synchronous I/O, when a process initiates an I/O operation, it blocks or waits until the I/O operation is complete before proceeding with further execution. The process is suspended and remains idle while waiting for I/O completion. Synchronous I/O is simpler to program but can lead to CPU underutilization as processes wait for I/O.</p>
<p>Asynchronous I/O (Non-blocking I/O):</p>
<p>In asynchronous I/O, when a process initiates an I/O operation, it does not block. The process can continue with other tasks while the I/O operation is performed in the background. The process is notified upon I/O completion, typically through interrupts or callbacks. Asynchronous I/O allows for concurrent processing and better CPU utilization as processes can perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.</p>
