THE JOY OF BLILDING A CUSTOM HOME

\section*{TABLE OF CONTENTS}

\section*{Introduction}

Building a house is one of the most interesting projects one may have to undertake in your lifetime. From the joy of identifying the Suitable location, working with the architect to get the best design for your dream house, moving into the house and the learning experience in it is just fantastic.

\section*{Project Management Software}

However, it comes with a varicty of challenges, key among them keeping track of the project schedule to ensure
that it's finished on time, within budget and done to the right quality. Your best bet in managing the project schedule
is Project Management
software.

\section*{Duration of the Project}

How long does it take to build a house? Click here to go to the page with an example of a typical construction schedule for a large eustom home.

\section*{Will your house take this long to build?}

Probably not; most home building projects will take less time, but some will take even more For example:
1. The timeline for a smaller bouse, with few options and less detailed finishes, which has been built many times before by professional builders, might be as short as 8 to 12 weeks.
2. Timeline for a larger house, with more options, custom features, fancier finishes, and more owner involvement - especially if the owner has little construction experience - may very well take $1 / 1 / 2$ to 2 years to complete.
3. If you build your own house, and make the common mistake of moving in before every last detail is finished, well, you might be looking at decades instead of months or years.
