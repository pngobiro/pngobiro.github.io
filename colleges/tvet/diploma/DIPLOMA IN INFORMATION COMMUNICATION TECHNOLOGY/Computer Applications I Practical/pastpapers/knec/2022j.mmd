\section*{CLEANLINESS}

$\square$
leaning our environment is the best thing to do in order to stay hygienic and control the spread of pests and diseases. This can be achieved through sanitizing, disinfecting and sterilizing objects and surfaces.

Meaning of terms
Sanitization (eleaning) - This is a process of washing, cleaning or removing dirt, and eliminating dust, debris and germs on the surface.
Disinfection - This is a method of destroying unhealthy microorganisms and removing most organisms present on the surface, so that they cannot pass on infections.
Sterilization - This involves handling and killing of all microbial and forms of bacteria, fungi, and viruses present on an object's surface.

Sanitizing agents come in various forms; liquids, sprays, powders or granules. They are mainly used in areas such as the kitchen, dining area, office desk and playroom.

For disinfectants, one can use phenol, chlorine bleach, or hydrogen peroxide. Places that require to be disinfected in a home is typically toilets, swimming pools, sinks and diaper change areas.

Cleaning, disinfecting, and sanitizing are part of a broad approach to preventing infectious diseases. Though these terms are often used interchangeably, it is important to note that they are actually quite different.

There are various disinfectants in the market today. The table below shows some of them.
