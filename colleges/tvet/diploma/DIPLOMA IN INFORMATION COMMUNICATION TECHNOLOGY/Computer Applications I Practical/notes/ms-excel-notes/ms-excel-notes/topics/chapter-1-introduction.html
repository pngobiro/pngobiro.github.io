                <h2>Definition of a Spreadsheet</h2>
                <p>A Spreadsheet is a ledger sheet that lets the user enter, edit, and manipulate numerical data. It usually consists of a series of rows & columns in which data entries can be made.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="types">
                <h2>Types of Spreadsheets</h2>
                <p>There are 2 types of spreadsheets:</p>

                <h3>1. Manual spreadsheet</h3>
                <p>A Manual spreadsheet is ledger book with many sheets of papers divided into rows and columns for entering/writing data. The data is entered manually using a pen or pencil.</p>

                <h3>2. Electronic Spreadsheet</h3>
                <p>A computer program that looks like the manual ledger sheet with rows & columns for entering data that can be manipulated mathematically using of formulae.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="advantages">
                <h2>Advantages of Electronic Spreadsheets over Manual Worksheets</h2>
                <p>An electronic spreadsheet:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Has a large worksheet for data entry & manipulation as compared to manual worksheet.</li>
                    <li>Has inbuilt formulae called Functions that are non-existent in manual worksheets. These functions enable the user to quickly manipulate mathematical data.</li>
                    <li>Uses the power of the computer to quickly carry out operations.</li>
                    <li>Has better formatting & editing qualities than the manual worksheet.</li>
                    <li>Utilizes the large storage space available on computer storage devices to save & retrieve documents.</li>
                    <li>Can easily be modified in its form, while a manual spreadsheet involves a lot of manual calculations & are very difficult to amend.</li>
                    <li>The user can very quickly & efficiently perform complicated computations using the information stored in an electronic spreadsheet.</li>
                    <li>It is accurate in its calculations & allows automatic recalculation on formulae. When one value/figure is changed, the result of the formula is automatically adjusted by the computer to correspond with the different input.</li>
                    <li>It offers graphical representation of data leading to comprehensive decisions.</li>
                    <li>Replaces the pencil & paper approach of the manual operations of the worksheet.</li>
                    <li>It improves on the capabilities & speed of the Calculator.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Examples of Commonly Used Spreadsheet Packages</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>VisiCalc - this was the first type of spreadsheet to be developed for PCs.</li>
                    <li>Lotus 123 - this is an integrated software with spreadsheet module, graphs, and database.</li>
                    <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
                    <li>Corel Quattro-Pro</li>

                <h2>Components of a Spreadsheet</h2>
                <p>A spreadsheet has 3 main components:</p>
                
                <h3>Workbook</h3>
                <p>When working in any spreadsheet program, you use workbook files to hold your information. A Workbook is a file in a spreadsheet package that contains one or more worksheets. The worksheets are made up of rows & columns in which you work and store your data.</p>
                
                <h3>Database</h3>
                <p>Spreadsheet programs such as Excel have special features, which can be used to manage data values entered in the cells of the spreadsheet. These features, which are found on the Data menu, were incorporated in Excel but they belong to Database Management System software.</p>
                <p>Examples of such features include: Filtering of records, use of Forms, calculating of Subtotals, data validation, Pivot tables and Pivot chart reports.</p>
                
                <h3>Graphs/Charts</h3>
                <p>A Chart is a graphical/pictorial representation of data in a worksheet. Charts are used to summarize data in a worksheet in a pictorial form. They enable the users to present complex data elements from a worksheet in a simple format that they can understand.</p>
                <p>Examples of charts are: Pie charts, Line graphs, Bar charts, Histograms, Column charts, etc.</p>
