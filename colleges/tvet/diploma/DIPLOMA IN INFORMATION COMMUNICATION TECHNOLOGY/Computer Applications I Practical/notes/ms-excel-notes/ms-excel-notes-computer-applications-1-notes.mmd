\section*{SPREADSHEETS.}

\section*{Definition of a Spreadsheet.}

A Spreadsheet is a ledger sheet that lets the user enter, edit, and manipulate numerical data.
A Spreadsheet usually consists of a series of rows \& columns in which data entries can be made.

\section*{Types of Spreadsheets:}

There are 2 types of spreadsheets:

\section*{1). Manual spreadsheet:}

A Manual spreadsheet is ledger book with many sheets of papers divided into rows and columns for entering/writing data.
The data is entered manually using a pen or pencil.

\section*{2). Electronic Spreadsheet:}

A computer program that looks like the manual ledger sheet with rows \& columns for entering data that can be manipulated mathematically using of formulae.

\section*{Advantages of Electronic Spreadsheets over Manual Worksheets.}

An electronic spreadsheet:
1. Has a large worksheet for data entry \& manipulation as compared to manual worksheet.
2. Has inbuilt formulae called Functions that are non-existent in manual worksheets. These functions enable the user to quickly manipulate mathematical data.
3. Uses the power of the computer to quickly carry out operations.
4. Has better formatting \& editing qualities than the manual worksheet.
5. Utilizes the large storage space available on computer storage devices to save \& retrieve documents.
6. Can easily be modified in its form, while a manual spreadsheet involves a lot of manual calculations \& are very difficult to amend.
7. The user can very quickly \& efficiently perform complicated computations using the information stored in an electronic spreadsheet.
8. It is accurate in its calculations \& allows automatic recalculation on formulae. I.e., when one value/figure is changed, the result of the formula is automatically adjusted by the computer so as to correspond with the different input. For a manual spreadsheet, changing one value means rubbing the result \& writing the correct one again.
9. It offers graphical representation of data leading to comprehensive decisions.
10. Replaces the pencil \& paper approach of the manual operations of the worksheet. I.e., it enables the user to produce neat work because; all the work is edited on the screen and a final copy is printed. With a manual spreadsheet, neatness \& legibility of the work depends on the writer's hand-writing skills.
11. It improves on the capabilities \& speed of the Calculator.

\section*{Examples of the commonly used Spreadsheet packages}
- VisiCalc - this was the $1^{\text {st }}$ type of spreadsheet to be developed for PCs.
- Lotus 123 - this is an integrated software with spreadsheet module, graphs, and database.
- Microsoft Excel.
- Corel Quattro-Pro
- Microsoft Works Excel
- Super calculators.
- Multiplan.
- Vp-Planner.

\section*{Review Questions.}
1. Define a Spreadsheet.
2. Differentiate between the traditional analysis ledger sheet and an electronic spreadsheet.
3. Name three commonly spreadsheet packages.

\section*{COMPONENTS OF A SPREADSHEET}

A spreadsheet has 3 main components, namely;
(a). Workbook.
(b). Database.
(c). Graphs / Charts.

\section*{Workbook:}

When working in any spreadsheet program, you use workbook files to hold your information.
* A Workbook is a file in a spreadsheet package that contains one or more worksheets. The worksheets are made up of rows \& columns in which you work and store your data.
A Workbook allows the user to organize various kinds of related information in a single file.

\section*{Database:}

Spreadsheet programs such as Excel have special features, which can be used to manage data values entered in the cells of the spreadsheet.
These features, which are found on the Data menu, were incorporated in Excel but they belong to Database Management System software.
Examples of such features include: Filtering of records, use of Forms, calculating of Subtotals, data validation, Pivot tables and Pivot chart reports.

\section*{Example:}

If related data values are entered on the same row, they form a Record. Hence, a worksheet can be manipulated as a database that has data records entered in it.

\section*{Graphs/Charts:}

A Chart is a graphical/pictorial representation of data in a worksheet. Charts are used to summarize data in a worksheet in a pictorial form.
They enable the users to present complex data elements from a worksheet in a simple format that they can understand.
Charts make it easy for users to see comparisons, patterns, and trends in data, e.g., instead of having to analyse several columns of a worksheet, one can see at a glance whether sales are falling or rising.
Examples of charts are: Pie charts, Line graphs, Bar charts, Histograms, Column charts, etc.

\section*{Review Questions.}
1. Name and describe the three components of a spreadsheet.
2. Explain the following terms as used in spreadsheets.
i) Workbook.
ii) Chart.

\section*{Application areas of spreadsheets (Areas where Spreadsheets are used)}
1. Accounting.

Spreadsheets provide an easy \& streamlined means of financial management. They are mostly used by Accountants to record their daily transactions \& also keep financial records.
For example; a spreadsheet can be used to do the following:
- Record sales \& purchases.
- Calculate profits.
- Produce Invoices, and also compile financial statements.
- Prepare budgets.
- Assist the management of an organization to monitor the current state of payments from customers in relation to goods delivered.
- Detect aged debtors (i.e., those people who have owed you money for more than the period allowed in your terms of business.
- Track the value of assets over time (i.e., Appreciation and Depreciation).

Note. Most spreadsheet programs come with inbuilt functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, PRODUCT, etc, which enable the Accountant to carry out his/her daily accounting tasks easily.
2. Data management.

A spreadsheet enables information to be produced easily and kept up-to-date.
For example;
- It enables the user to create, edit, save, retrieve and print worksheet data \& records.
- It enables data to be arranged neatly in tabular structure.
- Related data can be typed on the same worksheet. If the data is on different worksheets, the worksheets can be linked so that the data can be accessed easily.
Some of the data management functions include:
- Sorting (i.e., arranging worksheet records in a particular order so as to easily access the data items).
- Filtering (i.e., displaying only the records that meet a given condition).
- Use of Forms to enter \& view records.
- Use of Total/Subtotal function.
3. Scientific Applications.

Spreadsheet programs can be used by Scientists \& Researchers to compile \& analyse their results.
4. Statistical analysis / Mathematical operations.

Spreadsheets provide a set of data analysis tools that can be used to develop complex statistical analyses. In addition, some of the tools generate charts.
Examples of statistical functions include:
- AVERAGE - used to calculate the mean of a set of values.
- MEDIAN - used to give the value in the middle of a set of values.

Such mathematical operations can be used by:
- Teachers to compile their students' marks and produce results.
- Clerks \& Secretaries to enable them easily create tables of figures and manipulate them quickly as required.
5. Forecasting (What if analysis).

The automatic recalculation feature makes it possible to use the "What if" analysis technique.
What if analysis is a feature in a spreadsheet that is used to find out the effect of changing certain values in a worksheet on other cells.

It involves changing the value of one of the arguments in a formula in order to see the difference the change would make on the result of the calculation.
This method can be used for financial forecasting, budgeting, cost analysis, etc.

\section*{Review Questions.}
1. Explain five application areas where spreadsheet software can be used.
2. Explain the concept of "What if" analysis.

\section*{Common features of Electronic spreadsheets.}

The following are the typical facilities provided by electronic spreadsheets:
1. Have the ability to create, edit, save \& retrieve worksheets.
2. Have inbuilt functions \& formulae which can be used to perform calculations.
3. Allows Automatic recalculation, i.e., when you change one value, the rest of the values in the spreadsheet are automatically recalculated by the computer to correspond with the different input. This enables you to play "what if" games with your system.
4. Have the ability to Sort and filter data (i.e., arrange data in a predefined order).
5. Have a Data validation facility, which ensures that the correct data is entered into the Spreadsheet.
6. Have a Chart facility that can be used to draw line graphs, Bar charts, histograms, etc.
7. Have the ability to format data (both text \& numeric data) using predefined formats.
8. Some Spreadsheets have a SOLVER facility that is used to uncover the best uses of scarce resources so that desired goals can be achieved.
9. Have the ability to adjust Column widths \& Row heights automatically.
10. Have the ability to hide and unhide rows \& columns, and also freeze panes.
11. They enable printing of worksheets within the shortest time possible.
12. They have pre-designed Templates for automating tasks.

A Template is a document that acts as a blueprint or outline for other documents of the same type. It contains the standard text, graphics \& formatting that will be used in all documents of this type.

This means that, all formulas and formatting for similar workbooks such as Invoices can be saved as templates and then be used to automate the task without having to create the workbook again.
13. Have the ability to summarize data using Consolidation and Pivot tables.

Consolidation allows the merging of several worksheets into a summary sheet, while still keeping the original worksheets intact. Consolidation adds together cells with the same coordinates in the various worksheets.

Pivot tables can be used to cross-tabulate large amounts of data.

\section*{Differences between an Electronic Spreadsheet and a Calculator}

An electronic spreadsheet: -
1. Has more memory than calculator.
2. Is able to perform complex logical operations, but a calculator cannot.
3. Uses the large storage capacity of the computer that a calculator does not have.
4. Has a large working area that a calculator does not have.

\section*{Review Questions.}

\section*{FINDING RECORDS.}

\section*{Purpose.}
$\sqrt{ }$ Suppose you wanted to view records that meet given conditions, you would have to sort the table according to the conditions so as to find out where those records appear in the list. Such conditions are referred to as 'Criteria'.
However, this method will require you to sort the table whenever you want to find something different.
Ms-Excel offers an easier solution to this through the Filter command on the Data menu.
1. Click on any cell in the table that contains the records you want to search for.
2. On the Data menu, choose Filter, then select AutoFilter from the submenu. A downward arrow appears on the right of each field name.
3. Click the down arrow on a column to display the conditions that can be set. Select a condition (Criteria) from that list.

Note. If the criteria you want is not in the list or if you want to enter two conditions, then perform the following steps:
(i). Select the column / field to search by clicking on the down arrow to the right of the field name.
The Custom AutoFilter dialog box appears.
(ii). In the Show rows where: box, select the conditions to use by clicking on the down arrow. The list includes 'is greater than'; 'is less than', etc.
(iii). Enter the Value to compare the contents of the field width. You could type or select it from a drop down list of values available in the database.
4. Click the $\mathbf{O K}$ button to complete the task.

Note. To redisplay the records, click on the down arrow to the right of the field name that you had selected, and select the option All.

\section*{Example:}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & A & B & C & D \\
\hline 1 & Date & Person & Item & Amount \\
\hline 2 & 26-Jan-97 & Morris & Bar & 95 \\
\hline 3 & 28-Mar-97 & Albert & Take Away & 136 \\
\hline 4 & 28-Jan-97 & Anne & Lunch & 53 \\
\hline 5 & 09-Mar-97 & Susan & Breakfast & 112 \\
\hline 6 & 12-Jun-97 & Jane & Snacks & 56 \\
\hline 7 & 12-Apr-97 & Richard & Snacks & 118 \\

\section*{PIVOT TABLES.}

\section*{Purpose.}
$\sqrt{ }$ A Pivot table helps us to summarize and analyze large amounts of existing data, from a list or table, using the format and calculation methods of your choice.
Suppose we wanted the daily totals for each of the sales persons along with the total sale for each day: A PivotTable can help us get that kind of information much more easily.
1. Select any cell in the list or table you want to summarize.
2. On the Data menu, select PivotTable and PivotChart Report...
3. This will activate Step 1 of the PivotTable Wizard. In this step, select the source of data MsExcel will use to create the Pivot Table. From the choices given, select Microsoft Excel list or Database.
Click on the Next button.
4. Step 2 of the Wizard shows you the range containing the list of data detected around the position of your cell pointer of Step 1. If necessary, change the range.
Click on the Next button.
5. Click the Layout... button to specify how you want the PivotTable to appear.
6. On the right hand side of the PivotTable and PivotChart Wizard - Layout dialog box, the Pivot Wizard shows the column titles (field names) found in your list.
- Drag the field name whose contents you want to summarize downward to the area marked ROW.
- Drag the field name whose contents you want to summarize across the PivotTable to the area marked COLUMN.
- Drag the field name that contains the data to be summarized into the area marked DATA.
7. Step 3 of 3 will be displayed again allowing you to specify a convenient location for the PivotTable. The PivotTable may be positioned either as a new worksheet or on the existing worksheet.
If you select Existing worksheet in this dialog box, then you must specify the cell where the top left corner of the PivotTable will be positioned.
8. To specify a name for the PivotTable, click on the Options button.
9. Click on the Finish button. Ms-Excel places the Pivot Table in the location you specified.

\section*{Refreshing Records in the PivotTable.}
1. Select a cell in the PivotTable.
2. On the PivotTable toolbar, click on the Refresh Data button.

Note. To refresh the PivotTable whenever you open the workbook, click Options on the PivotTable menu of the PivotTable toolbar. Under Data source options, select the Refresh on open checkbox.

\section*{CELL REFERENCES (Cell Addresses).}
* A Cell reference is the identity of a cell in a worksheet.
* A Reference identifies a cell or a range of cells on a worksheet and tells Ms-Excel where to look for the values or data you want to use in a formula.

\section*{Examples of Cell references.}
(i). Single cell reference.
(ii). Mixed cell reference.
(iii). Label cell reference.
(iv). Relative cell reference.
(v). Absolute cell reference.

\section*{REFERENCING OF CELLS.}

A cell is identified by use of the Column letter heading \& the Row number heading.
To refer to a cell, enter the column letter followed by the row number. For example, B2 refers to the cell at the intersection of column B \& row 2.

\section*{Examples of cell references.}

To refer to
The cell in column A \& row 10
The range of cells in column A \& rows 10 to 20

Type
A10
A10:A20
\begin{tabular}{ll} 
The range of cells in row 15 \& columns B to E & B15:E15 \\
All cells in row 5 & $5: 5$ \\
All cells in rows 5 to 10 & $5: 10$ \\
All cells in column H & H:H \\
All cells in columns H to J & H:J \\
The range of cells in columns A to E \& rows 10 to 20 & A10:E20
\end{tabular}

\section*{PERFORMING CALCULATIONS IN MS-EXCEL.}

\section*{USING WORKSHEET FUNCTIONS.}
* A Function is a special command, which you can type into a formula to perform arithmetic operations.
* A Worksheet function is a special inbuilt formula that performs an operation on the values that you provide.
* It is an inbuilt equation that is used for calculation.

A function performs operations or calculations using specific values, called arguments. The arguments can be either cell references or values or both.

\section*{Categories of Functions in Ms-Excel.}

Functions are grouped into broad categories by some common features particular to the function.

\section*{1. Financial functions.}

Analyze investments and securities; determine depreciation, calculate cash flows and loans, e.g. the PMT function.

\section*{2. Date \& Time functions.}

Calculate values that represent dates and times.
E.g., the TODAY function is used to return the current date according to the computer's internal clock.

\section*{3. Math \& Trigonometry functions.}

Can be used to perform simple mathematical operations, such as calculating Square roots (SQRT), rounding a number (ROUND), calculating the total value for a range of cells (SUM), etc.
They are also used to replace complex trigonometric calculations like Sine (SIN), Cosine (COS), etc.
E.g., ABS - gives the Absolute value of a number. The Absolute value of a number is the number without its sign.
Syntax: ABS(number)

\section*{4. Statistical functions.}

Perform calculations (statistical analysis) on ranges of data.
E.g., AVERAGE - calculates the average (arithmetic mean) of a set of values in a range. STDEV - Estimates Standard Deviation based on a sample. Standard Deviation is a measure of how widely values are dispersed from the Average value (Mean).
Syntax: STDEV(number1,number2,....)

\section*{5. Logical functions.}

Calculate the results of logical formulas. E.g., the IF Function.

\section*{6. Look up \& Reference functions.}

Finds or refers to the contents of a cell. For example, the VLOOKUP function.

\section*{7. Database functions.}

Perform statistical calculations and queries on database tables. For instance, DSUM will find the total of values in a particular field (column).

\section*{8. Information functions.}

Return information about cells, ranges, the operating system, and some Ms-Excel tools, or to mark places where information is missing or incorrect.
E.g., CELL - returns information about the formatting, location or contents of a cell.

\section*{CREATING MS-EXCEL FORMULAS.}

\section*{Purpose.}
$\sqrt{ }$ When you need to perform a calculation in Ms-Excel, you use a formula.
You can create simple formulas that can be used; lets say, to add the values in two cells, or you can create complex formulas that can calculate the Standard deviation of certain values. For example, the formula ' $=\mathbf{S U M}(\mathbf{D 1 : D 7})$ ' uses a function to add the values in the range D1:D7. It gives the same result as the formula ' $=\mathbf{D} 1+\mathbf{D} 2+\mathbf{D 3}+\mathbf{D 4}+\mathbf{D 5}+\mathbf{D 6}+\mathbf{D 7}$ '.

Before you write your formula in Ms-Excel, it is advisable to do the following;
(i). Decide what you want to be calculated, e.g., the Total Cost of items.
(ii). Note down the values in the worksheet required for the calculation and use them to write down the formula, e.g. Quantity * Price.
(iii). Substitute the values with their cell references, e.g. B3*D3.

\section*{Calculation operators in formulas.}

Operator - A sign or a symbol that specifies the type of calculation to perform on the elements of a formula.
Excel includes 4 different types of calculation operators:
(i). Arithmetic (Mathematical) operators.
(ii). Logical (Comparison) Logical operators.
(iii). Reference operators.
(iv). Text concatenation operators.

Arithmetic (Mathematical) operators.
Performs basic mathematical operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Division or Multiplication.

\section*{Arithmetic operator}
+ (Plus sign)
- (Minus sign)
* (Asterisk)
/ (Forward slash)
\% (Percent sign)

\section*{Meaning}

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Percent

Example.
$3+3$
3-1
3*3
3/3
$20 \%$

\section*{Logical (Comparison) operators.}

Compares two values and produces a logical value, either TRUE or FALSE.

Comparison
= (equal sign)
$>$ (greater than sign)
< (less than sign)
$>=$ (greater than or equal to sign)
$<=$ (less than or equal to sign)
<> (not equal to sign)

Meaning
Equal to
Greater than
Less than
Greater than or equal to
Less than or equal to
Not equal to

Example.
A1=B1
A1>B1
$\mathrm{A} 1<\mathrm{B} 1$
A1>=B1
A1<=B1
A1<>B1

\section*{Reference operators.}

Combine ranges of cells for calculations.
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Reference operator & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Meaning \\
$:$ (colon)
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Range operator; produces one \\
reference to all the cells between \\
two references, including the two
\end{tabular} \\
references.
\end{tabular}$\quad$\begin{tabular}{l} 
Example. \\
, (comma)
\end{tabular} \begin{tabular}{l} 
Union operator; combines multiple \\
references into one reference.
\end{tabular}$\quad$ SUM(B5:B9,D5:D9) $\quad$ (

\section*{Text concatenation operators.}

Use the ampersand (\&) to join one or more strings to produce a single piece of text.
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Text operator & Meaning & Example. \\
$\&$ (ampersand) & Connects two values to produce & "North" \& "wind" produces \\
& one continuous text value & "Northwind"
\end{tabular}

\section*{Creating a simple formula.}

A Formula in Ms-Excel always begins with an equal (=) sign. Ms-Excel uses this sign to differentiate between a Label (text) and a Formula. The equal sign tells Ms-Excel that the characters that follow constitute a formula.
Following the equal sign are the elements to be calculated called Operands or Arguments. The Arguments are separated by calculation operators, and enclosed by an opening \& closing parentheses (brackets).
1. Click on the cell in which you want to enter the formula.
2. Type the $=($ equal sign) to activate the Formula bar. The equal sign (=) tells Ms-Excel that you are entering a formula in the cell.
3. Type the formula directly into the Formula box.

To tell Ms-Excel where to find the data that will be used in the calculation, type a cell reference.
4. Press the ENTER key. Ms-Excel immediately calculates \& shows the result in the cell, while the formula is displayed in the Formula bar.

\section*{Notes.}
- A Formula can refer to other cells on the same worksheet.
- Ms-Excel calculates a formula from left to right, according to a specific order for each operator in the formula.
You can change the order of operations by using parenthesis. E.g., to calculate B4+25, then divide the result by the sum of the values in cells D5, E5 and F5, the formula would be: $=($ B4 +25 )/SUM(D5:F5)
In this example, the parentheses around the first part of the formula forces Ms-Excel to calculate B4+25 first, then divide the result by the sum of the values in cells D5, E5, and F5.

\section*{Creating a formula that contains a function.}
1. Click the cell where the result of the formula will be displayed.
2. On the Insert menu, click Function, (or click the Paste Function button on the toolbar).
3. Click a function from the Function Category list. When you select a function, a description of the function appears in the dialog box.
Click the OK button.
4. Type in the arguments to compute in the parentheses in the formula. To enter a range, use a Colon to separate the first \& the last cells in the range, or use a Comma to separate reference to individual cells.
5. After you complete the formula, click the OK button or press the ENTER key.

Note. The structure of a function begins with an Equal sign (=), followed by the Function name, \& the Arguments for the function. The Arguments are separated by commas or a colon, and enclosed in an opening \& closing parenthesis.

\section*{Performing Common Calculations.}

\section*{ADDING NUMBERS.}

\section*{Method 1.}

Type the numbers directly into a cell and press the ENTER key to display the results.
Example: cells D5, E5 \& F5 contain the values 5, $15 \& 20$. To add all the values in the range, type: =D5+E5+F5

\section*{-OR-}
$$=5+15+20$$

\section*{To Add all numbers in a contiguous row or column.}

You can insert a sum for a range of cells automatically using the AutoSum ( $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ ) button on the Standard toolbar.
1. Click a cell below the column of numbers or to the right of the row of numbers.
2. Click AutoSum on the Standard toolbar. Ms-Excel suggests a formula.
3. To accept the formula, press the ENTER. To change the suggested formula, select the range before pressing the ENTER key.

\section*{To Add numbers that are not in a contiguous row or column.}

Use the SUM function. SUM adds all the numbers in a range of cells.
Syntax: SUM(number1,number2,.....)
Number1,number2,... are the arguments for which you want the total value or sum.
Example 1: Cells A2, A3 \& A4 contain values -5, 15, and 30.

\section*{To add}

The numbers in the cells A2 to A4. The numbers in cells A2:A4, and 15. The values in cell A2, A4 and 2. 3 and 2
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Formula } \\
& =\text { SUM(A2:A4) } \\
& =\text { SUM(A2:A4, 15) } \\
& =\operatorname{SUM}(A 2, A 4,2) \\
& =\operatorname{SUM}(\mathbf{3 , 2})
\end{aligned}$$

Example 2:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ A } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ B } \\
\hline $\mathbf{1}$ & Salesperson & Invoice \\
\hline $\mathbf{2}$ & Buchanan & 15,000 \\
\hline $\mathbf{3}$ & Buchanan & 9,000 \\
\hline $\mathbf{4}$ & Suyama & 8,000 \\
\hline $\mathbf{5}$ & Suyama & 20,000 \\
\hline $\mathbf{6}$ & Buchanan & 5,000 \\
\hline $\mathbf{7}$ & Dodsworth & 22,500 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Formula
$=$ SUM (B2:B4)
$=$ SUM(B2:B3, B5)
$=\operatorname{SUM}(\mathrm{B} 2, \mathrm{~B} 5, \mathrm{~B} 7)$

\section*{Adds}
the values in cells B2, B3 and B4.
two invoices from Buchanan, \& 1 from Suyama
individual invoices from Buchanan, Suyama,\& Dodsworth.

\section*{SUBTRACTING NUMBERS.}

Type the formula ' $=\mathbf{1 0 - 5}$ ' in a cell to display the result 5 .
Example: cells A2, A3 \& A4 contain the values $15,000,9,000 \&-8,000$.
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Formula & Description & Result \\
$=$ A2-A3 & Subtracts 9,000 from 15,000 & 6,000 \\
=SUM(A2:A4) & Adds all nos. in the list, including negative nos. & 16,000
\end{tabular}

To calculate a running balance.
You can build a formula in a banking transaction to calculate your running balance.

\section*{Example 1.}

Assume that cell F6 contains the previous balance of 4,000/=, cell D7 contains the first transaction's deposit subtotal of 190,500, and cell E7 contains any cash-received amount of 50,000.
To calculate the current balance for the first transaction, enter the following formula in cell F7:
=SUM(F6,D7,-E7)

\section*{Example 2.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ A } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ B } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ C } \\
\hline $\mathbf{1}$ & Deposits & Withdrawals & Balance \\
\hline $\mathbf{2}$ & $\$ 1,000$ & $\$ 625$ & $=$ SUM(A2,-B2) \\
\hline $\mathbf{3}$ & 1000 & 740 & $=$ SUM(C2,A3,-B3) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{TO INCREASE OR DECREASE A NUMBER BY A PERCENTAGE.}

\section*{Example 1.}

Assume that cell F5 contains a numeric value of 30,000 . To increase the value stored in cell F5 by 5 percent;
$=$ F5* ${ }^{(1+5 \%)}$
If the percentage amount is stored in a cell, let say, cell F2:
$=\mathbf{F 5}$ * $\mathbf{( 1 + \$ \mathbf { F } \$ 2 ) = ( 3 1 , 5 0 0 ) ~}$
Note. The reference to F2 is an Absolute cell reference so that the formula can be copied to other cells without changing the reference to F2.

\section*{Example 2.}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|}
\hline & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ A } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ B } \\
\hline $\mathbf{1}$ & Number & Percent Increase \\
\hline $\mathbf{2}$ & 23 & $3 \%$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Formula & Description & Result \\
$=\mathrm{A} 2 *(1+5 \%)$ & Increases the no. in A2 by 5\% & 24.15 \\
$=\mathrm{A} 2 *(1+\mathrm{B} 2)$ & Increase the no. in A2 by the percent value in B2: 3\% & 23.69 \\
$=\mathrm{A} 2 *(1-\mathrm{B} 2)$ & Decrease the no. in A2 by the percent value in B2: 3\% & 22.31
\end{tabular}

\section*{MULTIPLYING NUMBERS.}

Use the asterisk (*) operator or the PRODUCT function.
PRODUCT multiplies all the nos. given as arguments and returns the product.
Syntax: PRODUCT(number1,number2,.....)
Number1,number2,... are the numbers you want to multiply.
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Formula & Description & Result \\
$=\mathbf{5 *} \mathbf{1 0}$ & & 50 \\
$=\mathbf{= A 2} \mathbf{2} \mathbf{B} \mathbf{2}$ & multiplies the contents in cells A2 and B2. & \\
$=(\mathbf{5}+\mathbf{2}) * \mathbf{3}$ & adds 5 and 2 together then multiplies the result by 3 & 21
\end{tabular}

Example: Using the values shown in the worksheet below, calculate the cost of the milk.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|c|c|}
\hline & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ A } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ B } & C & D \\
\hline $\mathbf{1}$ & Item & Quantity & Price & Total cost \\
\hline $\mathbf{2}$ & Milk & 26 Litres & 15.00 & \\
\hline $\mathbf{3}$ & Sugar & 19 Kgs & 48.90 & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The Total cost of the milk will be given by, Quantity* Price. Therefore, in cell D2, type the formula; $=\mathbf{B} 2^{*} \mathbf{C 2}$.
Note. If you omit ' $=$ ' symbol before B2, Ms-Excel will not recognize it as a formula and what you have typed will literally appear as ' $\mathrm{B} 2 * \mathrm{C} 2$ ', which will not yield the expected result.

To Multiply numbers in different cells using a formula.
Cells A2, A3 \& A4 contain the values 5, 15, 30.

To multiply
The numbers in cells A2 \& A3
All the numbers in the range
All the numbers in the range, and 2.

Formula
$=\mathrm{A} 2 * \mathrm{~A} 3$
$=$ PRODUCT(A2:A4)
$=$ PRODUCT(A2:A4,2)

\section*{DIVIDING NUMBERS.}

Type a formula such as $=\mathbf{1 0 / 5}$ in a cell to display the result 2 .
Example.
Cells A2 \& A3 contain values 15,000 and 12 .
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Formula & Description & Result \\
$=$ A2/A3 & Divides 15,000 by 12 & 1,250
\end{tabular}

\section*{GETTING THE SQUARE ROOT OF A NUMBER.}

Use the SQRT function. SQRT gives a positive square root of a specific number.
Syntax: SQRT(number)
Number - is the number for which you want the square root. If number is negative, SQRT returns the \#NUM! error value.
Example 1: Cell B2 contains the number 215; to get the square root, type:
=SQRT(215)
-OR-
$=S Q R T(B 2)$
Examples 2:
Formula
Description
Result
= SQRT(16)
4
$=$ SQRT(-16)
\#NUM!

\section*{RAISING A NUMBER TO A POWER.}

Use the POWER function. POWER gives the result of a no. raised to a power.
Syntax: POWER(number,power)
Number - is the base no. It can be any real number.
Power - is the exponent to which the base no. is raised.
Note. The up carat $\left({ }^{\wedge}\right)$ operator can be used instead of POWER to indicate to what power the base no. is to be raised.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Description & Formula & & Result \\
\hline 5 squared & =5^2 & -OR- =POWER(5,2) & 25 \\
\hline 5 cubed & =5^3 & -OR- =POWER(5,3) & 125 \\
\hline 4 raised to the power of 5/4 & $=4^{\wedge} 05 / 4$ & -OR- =POWER(4,5/4) & 5.656854 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{The PMT Function}

PMT calculates the payment on a loan (principal) at a given interest rate for a specified no. of payment periods (term).

\section*{Syntax: =PMT(Principal - Amount,Interest-Rate,Term)}

Principal and Terms are values. Interest is a decimal or percentage value greater than -1 .

\section*{Example;}

A businessman took out a Ksh. 800,000 loan for 4 years at an annual Interest Rate of $26 \%$, compounded monthly. If the monthly installments are paid on the last day of each month, determine the installment to be paid.

\section*{$=P M T(800000,0.26 / 12,48)$}

The Monthly installment is $26,973.85$
Note. The Interest is divided by 12 in order to get the monthly rate, and term (in years) is multiplied by 12 to convert it into months.

\section*{The FV Function}

FV calculates the future value of a fixed investment earning a fixed interest over a specified period.
E.g., let's say, you want to plan for your retirement in 20 years and decide to invest Ksh. 20,000 each year. If the investment pays $20 \%$ interest compounded annually, the formula would be:
$=\mathbf{F V}(\mathbf{2 0 \%}, \mathbf{2 0 , - 2 0 0 0 0 )}$
You would collect Ksh. 3,733,760 after 20 years.

\section*{ROUNDING OF NUMBERS.}

The ROUND function rounds a given number to a specified no. of digits.

\section*{Syntax: ROUND(number,num_digits)}

Number -is the no. you want to round.
num_digits - specifies the no. of digits to which you want to round the no.
Notes.
- If num_digits is greater than 0 (zero), then number is rounded to the specified no. of decimal places.
- If num_digits is 0 (zero), the number is rounded to the nearest Integer (whole no.).
- If num_digits is less than 0 (zero), then number is rounded to the left of the decimal point.

Example 1:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Formula & Description & Result \\
\hline =ROUND(2.15,1) & & 2.2 \\
\hline =ROUND(2.149,1) & & 2.1 \\
\hline $=$ ROUND (21.5,-1) & num_digits is less than 0 (zero), & 20 \\
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Example 2: Cells A2:A4 contain values 20.3, 5.9 and -5.9.} \\
\hline Formula & Description & Result \\
\hline $=$ ROUND(A2,0) & Rounds 20.3 down, because the fractional part is less than . 5 & 20 \\
\hline =ROUND(A3,0) & Rounds 5.9 up, because the fractional part is greater than .5 & 6 \\
\hline $=\mathrm{ROUND}(\mathrm{A} 4,0)$ & Rounds -5.9 down, because the fractional part is less than -. 5 & -6 \\
\hline =ROUND(-1.475,2) & & -1.48 \\

\section*{CALCULATE THE MEDIAN OF A GROUP OF NUMBERS.}

Median is the value at the center of an ordered range of nos.
Use the MEDIAN function. MEDIAN gives the number in the middle of a set of numbers.
Syntax: MEDIAN(number1,number 2,...)
Number1, number2, ... are numbers for which you want the median.
Notes.
- Cells with the value zero are included.
- If there is an even number of nos. in the set, then MEDIAN calculates the average of the two numbers in the middle.

Example: Cells A2:A7 contain values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

Description

\section*{LOGICAL FUNCTIONS}

Logical functions can be used either to test whether a condition is TRUE or FALSE or to check for multiple conditions.
For example, use the IF function to determine whether a condition is true or false. One value is returned if the condition is TRUE, and a different value is returned if the condition is FALSE.

NOT -Reverses the value of its argument. Use NOT when you want to make sure a value is not equal to one particular value.
If logical is FALSE, NOT returns TRUE; if logical is TRUE, NOT returns FALSE.

\section*{Syntax: NOT(logical)}

Logical - is a value or expression that can be evaluated to TRUE or FALSE.
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Formula & Description & Result \\
$=$ NOT(FALSE) & Reverses FALSE & TRUE \\
$=$ NOT( $1+1=2$ ) & Reverses an equation that evaluates to TRUE & FALSE
\end{tabular}

AND - Returns TRUE if all its arguments are TRUE; returns FALSE if one or more argument is FALSE.

Syntax: AND(logical1,logical2, ...)
Logical1, logical2, .. are the conditions you want to test that can be either TRUE or FALSE.
Note. The arguments must evaluate to logical values such as TRUE or FALSE, or the arguments must be references that contain logical values. If the specified range contains no logical values, AND returns the \#VALUE! error value.

\section*{Example 1.}

Formula
=AND(TRUE, TRUE)

Description
All arguments are TRUE
One argument is FALSE
All arguments evaluate to TRUE

\section*{Result}

TRUE
FALSE
TRUE
=AND(TRUE, FALSE)
$=\operatorname{AND}(2+2=4,2+3=5)$

Example 2. Cells A2:A3 contain values 50 and 104.
If A2 contains a number between 1 and 100 , then:
\begin{tabular}{ll} 
Formula & Result \\
$=$ AND(1<A2,A2<100) & TRUE
\end{tabular}

Suppose you want to display A3 if it contains a number strictly between 1 and 100, and you want to display a message if it is not. If A3 contains 104, then:

Formula
$=I F(A N D(1<A 3, A 3<100), A 3$, '"The value is out of range.'")
If A3 contains 50, then:

\author{
Formula Description \\ $=I F(A N D(1<A 2, A 2<100), A 2$, 'The value is out of range.' $)$
}

\section*{Result}
"The value is out of range".

OR - Returns TRUE if any argument is TRUE; returns FALSE if all arguments are FALSE.
Syntax: OR(logical1,logical2,...)
Logical1,logical2,... are conditions you want to test that can be either TRUE or FALSE.
Notes.
- The arguments must evaluate to logical values such as TRUE or FALSE, or references that contain logical values. If the specified range contains no logical values, OR returns the \#VALUE! error value.
- If a reference argument contains text or empty cells, those values are ignored.
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Formula & Description & Result \\
$=$ OR(TRUE) & One argument is TRUE & TRUE \\
$=O R(1+1=1,2+2=5)$ & All arguments evaluate to FALSE & FALSE \\
$=O R(T R U E, F A L S E, T R U E)$ & At least one argument is TRUE & TRUE
\end{tabular}

\section*{Example:}

Cells A2, A3 \& A4 contain the values 15, 9, and 8 .
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Formula & Description & Result \\
$=$ AND $(\mathrm{A} 2>\mathrm{A} 3, \mathrm{~A} 2<\mathrm{A} 4)$ & Is 15 greater than 9 and less than $8 ?$ & FALSE \\
$=\mathrm{OR}(\mathrm{A} 2>\mathrm{A} 3, \mathrm{~A} 2<\mathrm{A} 4)$ & Is 15 greater than 9 or less than $8 ?$ & TRUE \\
$=$ NOT(A2+A3=24) & Is 15 plus 9 not equal to $24 ?$ & FALSE
\end{tabular}

\section*{THE "IF" function.}

IF is used to conduct conditional tests on values and formulas.
It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values, depending on the result of the evaluation. If the condition is TRUE, IF returns one value. If the condition is FALSE, IF returns the other value.

\section*{Format: IF(Condition, Action-to-be-taken when condition is true, Action-to-be-taken when condition is false)}

Note. The condition is usually a logical formula.
E.g., A5=100 is a logical expression; if the value in cell A5 is equal to 100 , the expression evaluates to TRUE. Otherwise, the expression evaluates to FALSE.

\section*{Example 1.}

Cell A2 contains the value 50.
On a budget sheet, cell A5 contains a formula to calculate the current budget.
=IF(A2<=100,"Within budget'",'Over budget'")

If the result of the formula in A5 is less than or equal to 100 , then the function displays "Within budget". Otherwise, the function displays "Over budget".

\section*{Example 2.}
$=$ IF(A2=100,SUM(B5:B15),'"')
In this example, if the value in cell A 2 is 100 , then the condition is TRUE, and the total value for the range $\mathrm{B} 5: \mathrm{B} 15$ is calculated. Otherwise, condition is FALSE, an empty text ( $" '$ ) is returned that leaves the cell that contains the IF function blank.

\section*{Example 3.}

Suppose an expense worksheet contains in A2:A4 the data for "Actual Expenses" for January, February, and March: 1,500, 500 and 500. Cells B2:B4 contains the data for "Predicted Expenses" for the same periods: 900, 900, and 925.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{ A } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{ B } & C \\
\hline $\mathbf{1}$ & Actual Expenses & Predicted Expenses & \\
\hline $\mathbf{2}$ & 1500 & 900 & \\
\hline $\mathbf{3}$ & 500 & 900 & \\
\hline $\mathbf{4}$ & 500 & 925 & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

You can write a formula in cell $\mathrm{C} 2: \mathrm{C} 4$ to check whether you are over budget for a particular month, generating text for a message:
Formula
$=\mathrm{IF}(\mathrm{A} 2>\mathrm{B} 2$, "Over Budget","OK")
$=\mathrm{IF}(\mathrm{A} 3>\mathrm{B} 3$, "Over Budget","OK")

\section*{Description}

Checks whether the $1^{\text {st }}$ row is over budget Checks whether the $2^{\text {nd }}$ row is over budget

\section*{Result}

Over Budget OK

\section*{To check if a number is greater than or less than another number.}

Cell A2, A3 \& A4 contain the values 15,$000 ; 9,000$ and 8,000 .
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Formula & Description & Result \\
$=A 2>A 3$ & Is A2 greater than no. in A3? & TRUE \\
$=I F(A 3<=A 4$, "OK","Not OK") & Is A3 less than or equal to the no. in A4? & Not OK
\end{tabular}

\section*{NESTING FUNCTIONS WITHIN FUNCTIONS.}

You can use a function as one of the arguments of another function.
Note. When a function is used as an argument, it must return the same type of value that the argument uses.
For example, if the argument returns a TRUE or FALSE value, then the nested function must return a TRUE or FALSE. If it doesn't, Ms-Excel displays a \#VALUE error value.

\section*{Example 1.}
$=\mathbf{I F}(S U M(K 10: K 19)>=5000,10 \%, 5 \%)$
In this example, the SUM function is being nested. Assume that the result of the SUM function is 935 . Since the sum of the range K10:K19 is not greater than or equal to 5000 , the result is $5 \%$.

Example 2. Cells A2, A3 and A4 contain the values 45, 90, 78.
Suppose you want to assign letter grades to numbers referenced by the name AverageScore. See the table below.

\section*{If AverageScore is}

Greater than 89
From 80 to 89
From 70 to 79
From 60 to 69
Less than 60

\section*{Then return}

A
B
C
D
F

\section*{Formula}
=IF(A2>89,"A",IF(A2>79,"B", IF(A2>69,"C", IF (A2>59,"D","F"))))
=IF(A3>89,"A",IF(A3>79,"B", IF(A3>69,"C", IF(A3>59,"D","F"))))
$=\mathrm{IF}(\mathrm{A} 4>89, " \mathrm{~A} ", \mathrm{IF}(\mathrm{A} 4>79$, "B", IF(A4>69,"C",IF(A4>59,"D","F"))))

\section*{Description}

Assigns a letter grade to the first score

Assigns a letter grade to the second score

Assigns a letter grade to the third score

Result
F

A

C

In the above formula, the second IF statement is also the value_if_false argument to the first IF statement. Similarly, the third IF statement is the value_if_false argument to the second IF statement.
For example, if the first logical_test / condition (AverageScore>89) is TRUE, "A" is returned. If the first logical_test is FALSE, the second IF statement is evaluated, and so on.

\section*{EDIT/ CHANGE A FORMULA.}
1. Select the cell containing the formula you want to edit.
2. Click in the Formula bar, make the changes to the formula, then press the ENTER key.

Note. If formulas are not used, there will be no automatic recalculation when any of the numbers change.

\section*{Automatic recalculation:}

This means that, Spreadsheets are able to calculate values such as SUM, AVERAGES, PERCENTAGES, etc automatically without requiring the intervention of the user (or without putting the user into the hard task of thinking).

\section*{RELATIVE REFERENCES}

When you create a formula, cells or ranges of cells will be referred to based on their position relative to the cell that contains the formula. If cell B6 contains the formula $=\mathrm{A} 5$; Ms-Excel finds the value one cell above and one cell to the left of B6.
If the position of the cell that contains the formula changes, the reference is changed.
A Relative reference is a cell reference, which changes automatically when the formula is copied to another cell or range. It describes the location of a cell in terms of its distance (in rows and columns) from another cell.
Note. When you copy a formula containing relative references down or across from one cell to another, Ms-Excel adjusts the references in the pasted formula automatically to refer to a different cell that is the same no. of rows \& columns away from the formula.

\section*{Example 1:}

If the formula in cell B6 (i.e., =A5) (which is one cell above \& one cell to the left of B6) is copied to cell B7. Ms-Excel will adjust the formula in cell B 7 to $=\mathrm{A} 6$, which refers to the cell that is one cell above and one cell to the left of cell B7.

\section*{Example 2:}

If cell A3 contains the formula $=\mathrm{A} 1+\mathrm{A} 2$, and you copy cell A 3 to cell B 3 , the formula in cell B 3 becomes $=\mathrm{B} 1+\mathrm{B} 2$.

\section*{ABSOLUTE REFERENCES.}

In a formula, an Absolute cell reference is the exact address of a cell, regardless of the position of the cell that contains the formula.
An absolute cell reference takes the form $\$ \mathrm{~A} \$ 1, \$ \mathrm{~B} \$ 1$, etc.

The table below shows the different types of references.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Reference: & Effect on a cell reference \\
\hline A1 & Relative reference. \\
\hline \$A\$1 & Both rows and column references are absolute \\
\hline A\$1, B\$1 & Absolute row reference, i.e., only the row reference is absolute. \\
\hline \$A1, \$B1 & Absolute column reference, i.e., only the column reference is absolute. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Unlike relative references, Absolute references don't automatically adjust when you copy formulas across rows and down columns. For example, if you copy an absolute reference in cell B2 to cell B3, it stays the same in both cells.
Therefore, if you don't want Ms-Excel to adjust references when you copy a formula to a different cell, i.e., if a formula refers to a particular cell and you would like to copy it such that the subsequent copies of cell references still refer to that same cell reference, you must use Absolute referencing.

For example,
If your formula multiplies cell A5 with cell $\mathrm{C} 1(=\mathrm{A} 5 * \mathrm{C} 1)$, you can create an absolute reference to cell C 1 by placing a dollar sign (\$) before the parts of the reference that you don't want them to change.
To create an absolute reference to cell C 1 , for instance, add dollar signs to the formula as follows: =A5*\$C\$1.
Note. To enter the dollar sign in a cell reference; move the cell pointer in the cell reference to be made absolute, then press the function key $\mathbf{F 4}$ or the keyboard combination SHIFT+4.

\section*{Worked Example:}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & A & B & C & D & E & F & G & H \\
\hline 1 & \multicolumn{8}{|l|}{ABC Company Sales Performance Report} \\
\hline 2 & & & & & & & & \\
\hline 3 & Salesman & Target & Qtr1 & Qtr2 & Qtr3 & Qtr4 & Total & Commission \\
\hline 4 & Albert & 750 & 148 & 156 & 171 & 140 & 615 & =G4*\$A\$13 \\
\hline 5 & Carl & 650 & 122 & 131 & 153 & 118 & 524 & =G5*\$A\$13 \\
\hline 6 & Cornell & 800 & 211 & 243 & 246 & 250 & 950 & =G6*\$A\$13 \\
\hline 7 & Edwin & 700 & 129 & 150 & 92 & 218 & 589 & =G7*\$A\$13 \\
\hline 8 & Francis & 1,000 & 311 & 270 & 247 & 322 & 1,150 & =G8*\$A\$13 \\
\hline 9 & & & & & & & & \\
\hline 10 & Totals & 3,900 & 921 & 950 & 909 & 1,048 & 7,728 & $=\mathrm{G10}$ * $\mathrm{A} \$ 13$ \\
\hline 11 & & & & & & & & \\
\hline 12 & Commission Rate & & & & & & & \\
\hline 13 & 15\% (or 0.15) & & & & & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

To get the commission for each salesperson, the formula $=\mathbf{G} 4 * \mathbf{A} \$ \mathbf{1 3}$ is entered in cell H4. The dollar sign (\$) indicates an absolute reference to the cell A13. This means that, whenever the commission rate formula is copied, it always refers to cell A13.
When the formula $=\mathrm{G} 4 * \$ \mathrm{~A} \$ 13$ is copied down to H 10 , the results will be as shown.
1. Determine which cell reference is to be absolute, e.g., in the example above cell A13.
2. Type the dollar sign (\$) just before the part of the cell reference that you want to remain exactly the same when you copy the formula to another cell.
3. Copy the formula to the rest of the cells.

\section*{FORMULAS AND ERROR VALUES.}

If a formula cannot properly evaluate a result, Ms-Excel will display an error value. For example, error values can be as a result of using text where a formula expects a numeric value, deleting a cell that is referenced by a formula, or using a cell that is not wide enough to display the result.

\section*{1. \#\#\#\#\#}

\section*{Causes.}
- This error value occurs when the cell contains a number, date or time that is wider than the cell.

\section*{-OR-}
- It occurs when the cell contains a date or a time formula that produces a negative result.

\section*{Suggested action.}
(i). Increase the width of the column by dragging the boundary between the column headings.
(ii). Apply a different number format in the cell to make the number fit within the existing cell width. E.g., decrease the no. of decimal places after the decimal point.
(iii). Ensure that the data and time formulas are correct. When you subtract dates and times, make sure you build the formula correctly.
If a formula has a result of a negative value, you can display the value by formatting the cell with a format that is not a date or time format.
1. Click Cells on the Format menu, click the Number tab, then select a format that is not a date or time format.

\section*{2. \#N/A}

The \#NA error value occurs when a value is not available to a function or formula.

\section*{Possible cause}
(i). Omitting 1 or more arguments in a function
(ii). Using a custom worksheet function that is not available

\section*{Suggested action}

Enter all arguments in the function.
Make sure the function is working properly

\section*{3. \#DIV/0!}

This error value occurs when you enter a formula that contains a division by zero (0). E.g., =5/0. It may also occur when you divide a cell by another cell that is blank.

\section*{Suggested action.}
(i). Change the divisor to a number other than zero.

\section*{4. \#NULL!}

The \#NULL! error value occurs when you specify an intersection of two areas that do not intersect. i.e., using an incorrect range operator or using an incorrect cell reference.

\section*{Suggested action.}
(i). Use the correct range operator. For instance, to refer to two areas that don't intersect, use the Comma.
E.g. if the formula sums two ranges, separate the two ranges with a comma.
$=$ SUM(A1:A9,C1:C6).
(ii). Check for typing errors in the reference to the ranges.

\section*{5. \#NAME?}

The \#NAME? error value occurs when Ms-Excel doesn't recognize text in a formula.

\section*{Possible cause}
(i). Deleting a name used in the formula, or using a name that does not exist
(ii). Misspelling the name of a function
(iii). Omitting a colon (:) in a range reference
(iv). Entering text in a formula without enclosing the text in double quotation marks ("). Ms-Excel tries to interpret your entry as a name even though you intended it to be used as text.

\section*{Suggested action}

Make sure the name exists.

Correct the spelling.
Make sure all range references in the formula use a colon.
E.g. $=$ SUM(A1:A5)

Enclose text in the formula in double quotation marks.
E.g. the following formula joins a piece of text "The total amount is" with the value in cell B5:
$=$ "The total amount is" \& B5

\section*{6. \#NUM!}

This occurs when a problem occurs with a number in a formula or function. E.g., Entering a formula that produces a number to a number that is too large or too small to be represented in Ms-Excel.

\section*{Suggested action}
(i). Change the formula so that its result is between $-1 * 10^{307}$ and $1 * 10^{307}$.

\section*{7. \#VALUE!}

The \#VALUE error value occurs when the wrong type of argument or operand is used.

\section*{8. \#REF!}

The \#REF error value occurs when a cell reference is not valid. For instance, deleting cells referred to by other formulas, or pasting moved cells over cells referred to by other formulas.

\section*{Suggested action}
(i). Change the formulas, or restore the cells on the worksheet by clicking Undo immediately after you delete or paste the cells.

\section*{Exercise.}
1. You have entered a formula to add the contents of B5 and C4 in cell F5. What will it become when you copy it to cell H8?

\hline =\$E12-D\$14*\$F\$2 & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{DATA SORTING.}

Sorting is the process of arranging data within a range in a particular order.

\section*{Purpose.}
$\sqrt{ }$ Sorting helps in arranging data in some order of priority, i.e., from lowest to highest or from highest to lowest.
$\checkmark$ It also helps to quickly locate the highest or lowest value in a list.
When you sort, Ms-Excel rearranges rows, columns, or individual cells by using the sort order that you specify. You can sort a list in Ascending (1-9, A-Z) or Descending order (9-1, Z-A). You can perform a sort based on the contents of one or more columns.
Note. The data is sorted in reference to columns.
To sort rows in ascending or descending order based on the contents of one column.
1. Click a cell in the column by which you want to sort. The column on which the list is arranged is known as the Key.
2. To arrange the data from lowest to highest, click on the Sort Ascending button on the toolbar. To arrange the data from highest to lowest, click on the Sort Descending button on the toolbar.
-Or-
On the Data menu, click Sort. In the Sort by box, click the column you want to sort and then choose the sort order.

\section*{To sort rows based on the contents of two or more columns.}
1. Click a cell in the list you want to sort.
2. On the Data menu, click Sort to display the Sort dialog box.
3. Under Sort By, specify the first column by which you want to sort, then choose the sort order by clicking on the Ascending or Descending box.
4. You can add up to two keys in the Then By boxes according to your need.

Assume that you need to sort by more than 3 columns, i.e., your list contains employee information and you need to organize it by Department, Title, Last Name, and First Name, sort the list twice. Click First Name in the first Sort by box and then sort the list. Click Department in the second Sort by box, click Title in the first Then by box, and click Last Name in the second Then by box, and then sort the list.
5. Select any other sort options you want, then click OK to perform the sort.

\section*{Sort columns based on the contents of rows.}
1. Click a cell in the list you want to sort.
2. On the Data menu, click Sort.
3. Click the Options button.
4. Under Orientation, click Sort left to right, then click OK.
5. In the Sort by and Then by, click the rows you want to sort.

\section*{Examples:}
(i). A teacher may arrange pupil's records according to the marks scored in a test, starting with the highest to the lowest in order to assign class positions.
(ii). An Accountant may arrange a list of financial records according to the date of the transaction and customer name in order for him to be able to quickly locate any record using the transaction date and name of customer.
(iii). Arranging a telephone list according to alphabetical order of last name in order to easily locate a name and phone number. If there are several people with similar last names, you can specify two keys such that the records are arranged in order of first name as well.

\section*{LINKING WORKSHEETS.}

\section*{Purpose.}
$\sqrt{ }$ Sheets are normally independent. If a change in a value in one sheet is intended to affect other values in different sheets, it is advisable to link the sheets so that Ms-Excel will automatically update the affected values if you make any changes.
Alternatively, you can calculate the new values and manually make the changes to all the other sheets. This would be unreliable \& cumbersome especially if this is to be done for many values in many large worksheets.
1. When typing in a formula that refers to a cell in another sheet, include the name of the sheet before that particular cell reference separated by a colon.

\section*{Example 1:}

The formula =G6*Sheet1!B6 (instead of =G6*B6) will refer to B6 in Sheet 1 rather than in the current sheet.

\section*{Example 2:}

Typing the formula $=$ Salesinfo!A10 in cell A10 of Sheet2 will cause the contents of cell A10 in the Sheet named Salesinfo to be also the contents of A10 in Sheet2.

\section*{Exercise.}
1. How would you display the contents of the cell B45 of worksheet named Price in the cell B5 of worksheet named Sales such that the two cells always display the same value?

\section*{CREATING CHARTS.}

\section*{Purpose.}
$\sqrt{ }$ Charts are used to present data effectively. They make relationships among numbers easy for users to see because they turn numbers into shapes that can be compared to one another. For instance, rather than having to analyze several columns on worksheet numbers, you can see at a glance whether sales are falling or rising over quarterly periods, or how the actual sales compare to the projected sales.

\section*{Different Types of Charts and their uses.}
(i). Line Chart: A Line graph is used to show trends.
(ii). Bar Chart: - It can be used to show comparison of Sales and Target.
(iii). A Stacked Bar Chart: - It can be used to show the distribution of sales by month and compare the performance of salesmen.
(iv). A Pie Chart: shows the distribution of sales.
