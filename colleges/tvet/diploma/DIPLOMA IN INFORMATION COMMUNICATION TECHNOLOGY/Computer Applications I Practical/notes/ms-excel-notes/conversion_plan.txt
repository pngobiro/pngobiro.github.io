Special Elements Inventory:
- Equations: Present in formula sections, LaTeX notation
- Tables: Multiple throughout the document, especially in examples
- Code Blocks: None identified
- Complex Lists: Multiple nested lists in features and procedures sections
- Mathematical Expressions: Throughout formulas and functions sections

Critical Sections:
1. Mathematical Formulas (Lines 1001-1500)
   - Requires careful handling of LaTeX notation
   - MathJax implementation needed

2. Tables (Throughout document)
   - Complex formatting needed
   - Must preserve alignment and structure

3. Charts Section (Lines 1751-2139)
   - Visual elements need proper representation
   - Step-by-step instructions must be preserved exactly

Cross-Chunk Navigation Planning:
Navigation Structure:
