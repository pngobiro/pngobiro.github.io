1. Click the arrow next to the Zoom box on the Standard toolbar (or click Zoom on the View menu).
2. Click the zoom setting you want from the drop-down list.

\section*{SAVING DOCUMENTS.}

\section*{Purpose.}
$\sqrt{ }$ You save a document in order to use it at a later time, perhaps a few hours or even years later.
$\sqrt{ }$ If done periodically, say after every 1 minute, saving helps to prevent data loss in case of power failure.

\section*{Using the 'Save' command.}

The Save command can be used when you are saving a new document for the first time or when saving changes to an open document.

\section*{Using the 'Save As...' command.}

Save As can be used if you want to:
Name and save a new document or template.
Save a document or template on a different disk drive or in a different folder.
Make a copy of an existing document or template with a new name, leaving the original document unchanged.

\section*{To name and save a new document for the first time.}
1. On the File menu, select Save or Save As (or press CTRL+'S') to display the Save As dialog box.
2. In the File name box, type a name for the document.
3. To store the document in a different folder or drive, select a different location to save in by clicking the down facing arrow next to the Save in list box.
4. To save the file in a different format or type, click the down arrow on the right of Save as type list box, and choose a file type.
5. Click the Save button.

After you name and save a document once, the Save \& Save As commands function differently.

\section*{To save changes to an existing document.}
1. Click Save on the Standard toolbar (or on the File menu or press CTRL+S).

\section*{Save a copy of a document with a new name or in a different location.}
1. Open the document you want to make a copy of.
2. On the File menu, click Save As.
3. In the File name box, enter a new name for the file.

To save the copy in a different folder or drive, click a different location in the Save in list. 4. Click on the Save button.

Note. Changing a document's name or location using Save As creates a new copy of the document, so two copies of the same document exist: one with the old name or location and one with the new. The copies are completely separate, and the work you do on one document has no effect on the other.

\section*{Saving files automatically when you are working.}

\section*{Purpose.}
$\sqrt{ }$ You can set up Ms-Word so that it saves your files at the frequency that you specify in order to safeguard against accidental loss of a file due to power failure.
1. On the Tools menu, choose Options. In the resulting dialog box, click the Save tab, then select the Save AutoRecover info every checkbox.
2. In the Minutes box, enter the interval for how often you want to save files.

The more frequently your files are saved, the more information is recovered if there is a power failure or similar problem while a file is open.
Note. AutoRecover is not a replacement for regularly saving your files. If you don't save the recovery file after opening it, the file is deleted and your unsaved changes are lost.
Tip. You can speed up saving a file by turning on fast saves,
1. On the Tools menu, click Options, then click the Save tab.
2. Select the Allow fast saves checkbox, and then continue to save as you work on the file.

\section*{Protecting a document using a Password.}
* A Password is a secret word or phrase by which you protect or lock your document so that no one will be able to open or print the file without knowing the password.
* A Password is a combination of characters that prevents other users from opening and changing a document without permission.
Use of Passwords is a security method used to restrict access to computer systems and sensitive files that may be confidential in nature. Otherwise, if a document is protected by a password, only the person who knows the password can open the document or edit it.
For example, Passwords can be used to:
(i). Prevent unauthorized users from opening a document at all.
(ii). Allow other users to open the document but only make changes to it. If someone makes changes to a password-protected document, that person can save the document only by giving it a different file name.
- A password can contain any combination of letters, numerals, spaces, and symbols, and it can be up to 15 characters long.
- As you type the password, Ms-Word displays an asterisk (*) for each character that you type to ensure confidentiality.
1. Create or open the document you want to protect with a password.
2. On the File menu, click Save As to display the Save As dialog box.
3. Click the down arrow on the Tools button, click Security Options.
4. Under the File sharing options for this document section, type a password under Password to open. This prompts the user to enter password when opening a document.
5. If you wish, type in another password under Password to modify. This prevents the user from making changes to a document unless the user enters the correct password.
6. Click OK.

Ms-Word prompts you to confirm the password. Re-type the password again, then click OK.
7. To save the document, choose $\mathbf{O K}$.

\section*{Notes.}
- After creating a password, write it down and keep it in a secure place. If the password is lost, you cannot open or gain access to the password-protected file.
- If you protect a document with a password, you must provide the correct password each time you open the file.
- Passwords are case-sensitive, so if you vary the capitalization when you assign the password, then you must type the same capitalization when entering the password.

\section*{FILE PROPERTIES}

Document properties are details about a file that help to identify it - e.g. a descriptive title, the author name, the subject, and keywords that identify topics or other important information in the file, such as file size and the dates when the files were created \& last modified.

\section*{Setting document properties for the active document,}
1. On the File menu, click Properties.
2. Click on the Summary tab, then edit the values for standard properties, such as Title and Author.

Note. If you want to be reminded to set document properties for every file you create, you can have Ms-Word automatically display the Properties dialog box when you save files for the first time.
1. On the Tools menu, choose Options, then click the Save tab.
2. Select or clear the Prompt for document properties checkbox.

\section*{Troubleshoot saving documents}

\section*{- When I try to save a document, I get a message that mv file is too large.}

If a document is too large to save, divide it into smaller parts, i.e., cut part of the document \& paste it into a new document, then save each part individually.
- When I trv to save changes to a document, Iget a message that the document is read-onlv.

You can't make changes to a read-only document. To save any changes made, save the document with a new name or use the same name but save the document in a different folder.

\section*{- When I save a document, the file is saved with an additional file name extension.}

When you save a document with a file name extension other than the default extension for that type of file, Ms-Word adds the default extension to your file name - e.g. an Ms-Word document file name may appear as Budget.abc.doc.
The extension is used to identify the type of file and which program should be used to open the file.

\section*{- The file I saved contains two periods in the file name.}

When you save a document with a file name that ends with a period - e.g. Sales. - MsWord adds a period and the default file name extension to your file name. E.g. a Word document file name may appear as Sales..doc.
To save a document with the default extension for that file type, do not type the period following the file name. The period is automatically added when you save the file.
- I saved changes by using AutoRecover, and I don't see them in the recovery file.

AutoRecover had not yet have saved the changes to the recovery file before Ms-Word unexpectedly shut down.
The amount of new information that the recovery file contains depends on how frequently Ms-Word saves the recovery file. E.g., if the recovery file is saved every 15 minutes, up to 15 minutes of work can be lost if a power failure or similar problem occurs.

\section*{Closing a document.}

Closing a document means unloading the current active document from memory so that the user can create or open another without necessarily exiting from Ms-Word.
1. On the File menu, click Close.

\section*{OPENING A SAVED DOCUMENT.}

Blocking of text refers to selecting a group of text e.g., a word, sentence or paragraph, in order to work with it as a whole.

\section*{Importance.}
$\sqrt{ }$ The purpose of selecting text is to enable the user perform a number of editing or formatting operations on the selected block of text.
Some of the operations that may need blocking include: moving, copying, deleting, inserting and overtyping, formatting.
Ms-Word provides a number of ways of selecting a block of text. You can either select a block of text using the Mouse or Keyboard.

\section*{Select text and graphics using the Mouse.}
- To select a graphic, click the graphic.
- To select any amount of text, drag over the text.

\section*{Restoring deleted text.}

To restore text that has just been deleted, click Undo from the Edit menu (or on the Standard toolbar).

\section*{TYPING OVER EXISTING TEXT.}

\section*{Typing Modes.}

There are 2 typing modes in a word processor that assist the user in typing or editing text documents. These are;
(i). Insert mode.
(ii). Overtype (Type over) mode.

\section*{Insert mode}

This is the default typing mode in most word processors. In Insert mode, Ms-Word inserts characters as you type, and any new text you enter in the middle of a line is inserted between existing texts, characters or words.
The Insert mode pushes existing text away as new characters are inserted at the location of the cursor without replacing it.

\section*{Overtype mode}

To Overtype is to replace existing characters as you type.
Therefore, if Overtype mode is turned on, tying new text between existing words or characters automatically replaces the existing text by deleting it.
Overtype mode deletes the current text at the cursor position and replaces the existing characters with new text.

\section*{Methods of switching between Overtype $\mathcal{\&}$ Insert mode.}

\section*{Method 1.}

Double-click the OVR label on the Status bar to turn Overtype on or off.

\section*{Method 2.}

\section*{Method 3.}

On the Tools menu, click Options, then click the Edit tab. Select or clear the Overtype mode checkbox.

\section*{COPYING OF TEXT AND OBJECTS.}

Copying text means making a duplicate of the text or object.

\section*{Importance.}
$\sqrt{ }$ Copying reduces the effort \& time taken to repeat the same information in other parts of the document.
If a section is repeated several times in the document, you can save time by copying the first occurrence of the text rather than typing it over again.
$\sqrt{ }$ If the section appears several times but with a few differences, you can copy it and then make minor changes to each copy, rather than type everything all over again.
$\sqrt{ }$ Facilitates the transfer of information between different Ms-Word files.
$\sqrt{ }$ Facilitates the transfer of information between Ms-Word and other Windows applications.
1. Select the text or item you want to copy.

To copy multiple items that aren't next to each other; select one item, hold down CTRL, then click the other items.
2. Click Copy on the Standard toolbar or Edit menu (or press CTRL+C).

Ms-Word places a copy of the selection in the Clipboard.
3. Click where you want the copy of the text to appear. To copy the item to another document, switch or open the document.
4. Click Paste on the Standard toolbar or Edit menu (or press CTRL+V).

\section*{MOVING TEXT \& GRAPHICS WITHIN A DOCUMENT.}

Moving of text means relocating text from one place in a document to another (or changing the position of text or an object in a document).

\section*{Purpose.}
$\sqrt{ }$ After typing in a document, you may need to shift some text or paragraphs to other locations in the document in order for the document to be more logically organized.

\section*{Method 1: Drag-and-Drop editing.}
1. Select the text you want to move.
2. Point to the selection, press \& hold down the left mouse button.
3. While still holding down the left mouse button, move the mouse pointer to the required location.
The dimmed insertion point that moves in the document shows you the position to which the selected text will be transferred when you release the left mouse button.
4. Then release the mouse button.

Note. Drag-and-drop editing is suitable when you are moving text over a short distance, e.g., within one page. It is clumsy to use when moving text across several pages.

\section*{Method 2: Cut and Paste.}

To move text to a distant page, say from page 1 to page 50, use the Cut and Paste method.
1. Select the text you want to move.
2. Click Cut on the Standard toolbar or Edit menu (or press CTRL+X).

Ms-Word will place whatever you had selected into a temporary storage area within the computer called the 'Clipboard' from where it is available to any application in Windows.
3. Click where you want the cut text to be placed. To move the item to another document, open or switch to the document.
4. Click Paste on the Standard toolbar or Edit menu (or press CTRL+V).

Ms-Word inserts the contents of the clipboard at the position of the cursor.
Note. In Moving, all the selected text is transferred to a new location, while in Copying, the original text is left intact.

Question. Explain how a paragraph can be moved from one place to another using a Word processor.

\section*{FINDING \& REPLACING TEXT IN A DOCUMENT.}

The Find and Replace features are used to search for a specific word or phrase that you want to review or edit and automatically replace with other text.
When you need to search for a word or phrase in a large document, use the Find command. In case you wish to replace a word or phrase, use the Replace option.

\section*{Importance of using Find and Replace.}

\section*{PROOFREADING.}

Proofreading refers to checking whether the document has typographical or grammar errors.

\section*{Importance.}
$\sqrt{ }$ To remove mistakes and improve document wording selections.
Ms-Word provides the following tools for proofreading a prepared document; Spelling and grammar checker, Thesaurus, AutoComplete and AutoCorrect.

\section*{CHECKING SPELLINGS \& GRAMMAR IN A DOCUMENT.}

Ms-Word has the ability to check spellings within your document as you type or edit the document.
The Spelling and grammar checker is an inbuilt tool that helps the user to correct spelling errors and incorrect grammar structures. The words you type in are compared to those in its dictionary. However, the checker can only recognize errors of those words whose correct spelling is in its dictionary. This implies that, a correctly spelt word used wrongly cannot be detected.
For example; if you mistype a word but the result is not a misspelling (e.g., typing "from" instead of "form" or "there" instead of "their"), the spelling checker will not mark the word. To identify those types of problems, the document should be carefully proof-read just before and after printing.

\section*{Importance.}
$\sqrt{ }$ The grammar checker provides a quick \& convenient way to find many common grammatical errors.
$\sqrt{ }$ It also identifies mistakes in your document and offers suggestions that could be more effective, and user-friendly. In some cases, the grammar checker offers suggestions on how you can rewrite sentences.
Ms-Word uses wavy red underlines to indicate possible spelling mistakes \& wavy green underlines to indicate possible grammatical mistakes.

\section*{Check spelling \& grammar automatically as you type.}
1. Make sure automatic spelling and grammar checking are turned on.
2. Type in the document.

When the spelling checker encounters a word it doesn't recognize, it determines the words in its dictionary that are similarly spelled and displays a list of those words with the most likely match highlighted.
3. Right-click a word with a wavy red or green underline, to get a list of correct alternative words to choose from.
4. From the list, click the correct command or the spelling alternative you want.

\section*{Turn on or off automatic spelling \& grammar checking.}
1. On the Tools menu, click Options, then click the Spelling \& Grammar tab.
- To turn automatic spelling checking on or off, select or clear the Check spelling as you type checkbox.
- To turn automatic grammar checking on or off, select or clear the Check grammar as you type checkbox.

\section*{Check spelling \& grammar all at once.}

You can choose to check the spelling \& grammatical errors at once, and then confirm each correction. This option is useful if you want to proofread the whole document after you have finished typing or editing it.
1. Click Spelling and Grammar button on the Standard toolbar (or Press F7).

\section*{-OR-}

On the Tools menu, select Spelling and Grammar.
When Ms-Word finds a possible spelling or grammatical problem, it highlights it and then displays a list of similarly spelled words.
2. Choose a button in the Spelling and Grammar dialog box to make your changes.
(a). Change - accepts the current selection in the Suggestions box.

When the selected error is a repeated word, this button changes to Delete so you can easily remove the second instance of the word.
(b). Change All - corrects all the occurrences of the misspelled word.
(c). If the intended word is not in the Suggestions box, you can correct spelling and grammar directly in the document while the Spelling and Grammar dialog box is still displayed. Click in the document \& type your correction, and then click Resume to continue checking the spelling and grammar.
(d). Ignore Once - Leaves the highlighted error unchanged (if the highlighted word is a valid word) \& finds the next spelling or grammar error.
This button changes to Resume if you click in the document to make a change in the document.
(e). Ignore All - retains all the occurrences of the same word or phrase in the document from another language, e.g., a Kiswahili.
(f). Add - Adds the highlighted word in the Suggestions box to the Custom dictionary.
(g). Explain - gives a detailed explanation of a grammar flag.
(h). Ignore Rule-Leaves all instances of the highlighted error unchanged throughout the document and continues to check the document.
3. When the Spelling and grammar check is complete, Ms-Word displays a message to that effect. To return to your document when you finish checking on grammar, click OK.
Note. There are two types of dictionaries that are used by a spell checker program:
* Main (Standard) dictionary.
- Custom dictionary.

\section*{LOOKING UP FOR WORDS USING THESAURUS.}

\section*{Purpose.}

\section*{TEXT ALIGNMENT}

Text Alignment refers to how text is positioned (lined up) in a paragraph relative to the left, right, or centre of the page.

\section*{Types of text alignment.}

There are 4 ways in which text can be aligned;
(a). Left alignment.

This is the default alignment.
Lines of text are lined up evenly along the left margin, but unevenly at the right margin.
E.g., in a left-aligned paragraph, the left edge of the paragraph is flush with the left margin.
(b). Right alignment.

Lines of text are lined up evenly along the right margin, but unevenly at the left margin.
(c). Center alignment.

The lines of text are centered unevenly between the left \& right margins.
(d). Justification.

Lines of text are arranged evenly along the left \& right margin.
The Justify option expands the spaces in each line so that the text is aligned evenly along both the left \& right margins.

\section*{Changing the space between lines or paragraphs.}

\section*{Line spacing:}
* Line spacing refers to the vertical distance between two lines of text in a paragraph.
* The amount of space from the bottom of one line of text to the bottom of the next line. Line spacing determines the amount of vertical space between two lines of text in a paragraph. If a line contains a large text character, graphic, or formula, Ms-Word increases the spacing for that line so that it can be accommodated.

\section*{Types of line spacing.}
(i). Single line spacing.

Single line spacing accommodates the largest font in that line, leaving a small amount of extra space between the lines, which varies depending on the font used.
(ii). 1.5 line spacing.

It is $11 / 2$ times that of single line spacing.
(iii). Double line spacing.

It is twice that of single line spacing.
(iv). At least.

This is the minimum line spacing that is needed to fit the largest font or graphic on the line.
(v). Exactly.

It is a fixed line spacing that Ms-Word does not adjust.
(vi). Multiple line spacing.

It is a line spacing that is increased or decreased by a $\%$ that you specify, e.g. setting line spacing to 1.2 will increase the space by $20 \%$.
Paragraph spacing determines the amount of space above or below a paragraph. When you press ENTER to start a new paragraph, the spacing is carried over to the next paragraph. However, you can change the settings for each paragraph.

\section*{Changing line or Paragraph spacing.}

\section*{Method 1.}

\section*{Creating Paragraph Indents.}

Indentation refers to moving the text away from the margin.

Page margins determine the distance (or the space) between the text \& the edge of the page, while paragraph Indents and alignment determines the distance of the paragraph from either the left or right margins.

\section*{Types of paragraph indents.}

\section*{(i). Left indent.}
(ii). Right indent.

\section*{(iii). First-line indent.}

This is a type of indent where only the first line of the paragraph is indented.
(iv). Hanging indent.

This is a type of indent where the first line of the paragraph extends to the left of the paragraph, but the other lines of a paragraph are indented more than the first line (i.e., they 'hang' below the first line).
(v). Negative indent (also known as an outdent): - pulls the paragraph out towards the left margin.

\section*{Changing the right indent of an entire paragraph.}
1. Select the paragraph you want to change its right indent.
2. On the horizontal ruler, drag the Right Indent marker to the position where you want the text to end.

\section*{Setting tab stops $\&$ Tab spacing.}

Tabs are used to indent the first line of a paragraph or to create columnar data.
Tab spacing: - is a short distance moved by the text cursor when the Tab key on the Keyboard is pressed. It is used to align text on the page.
Tab stop: - is a location on the horizontal ruler that indicates how far a certain text is indented or where to begin a column of text.
By default, the tab stop is set at 0.5 of an inch.

\section*{Importance.}
$\sqrt{ }$ Tab stops enable the user to line up text to the left, move the text to the right, or center it.
$\checkmark$ Tabs also allow easy entry of tabulated data.
$\sqrt{ }$ The user can also automatically insert specific characters, such as periods or dashes, called
Tab leaders, before the tabs.
Tab leaders - are characters usually dots or hyphens, that fill the space between words separated by tabs. They are intended to draw the reader's eye across a line, as in Tables of Contents.
There are 3 types of Tab leaders:
- Solid leader lines $\qquad$ ).
- Dotted leader lines $\qquad$ ).
- Dashed Leader lines (--------).
1. Select the paragraph in which you want to set a tab stop.
2. On the Format menu, click Tabs. This opens the Tabs dialog box.

7. Click the Set button, then choose OK.

Once you no longer need the Tab stops, open the Tabs dialog box, then click the Clear All button.

\section*{Setting tabs using the Horizontal Ruler.}

The easiest way to set tabs is by using the ruler. On the left corner of the horizontal ruler (at the point of intersection between the horizontal \& vertical rulers) is a tab alignment button that lets the user select the type of tab.
The table below shows various tab alignment buttons.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Button & Name & Purpose (explanation for each button) \\
\hline$\llcorner$ & Left tab & Text is left aligned \\
\hline$\perp$ & Centre tab & Text is centered \\
\hline $\boldsymbol{I}$ & Bar tab & Inserts a vertical line at tab stop and align text to the right of the line \\
\hline$\lrcorner$ & Right tab & Text is right aligned \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

To set the tab using the ruler;
1. Select the paragraph in which you want to set a tab stop.
2. Click the tab button at the far left of the horizontal ruler until it changes to the required type of tab: Left, Center or Right.
3. Set the tab stop by clicking where you want it to be on the ruler.
4. Drag the tab stop.

\section*{HYPHENATION OF TEXT.}

If a certain word is too long to fit on the end of a line, Ms-Word moves the word to the beginning of the next line. However, you can use the hyphenation feature to insert hyphens in order to:
$\sqrt{ }$ Give your documents a polished and professional look.
$\sqrt{ }$ You can also hyphenate text to eliminate gaps in justified text or to maintain even line lengths especially when you have a document with narrow columns.
You can insert Optional hyphens or Non-breaking hyphens or you can let Ms-Word hyphenate all or part of a document for you.
Optional hyphen - A hyphen that is used to control where a word or phrase breaks. An optional hyphen breaks a word if it falls at the end of a line. If the word or phrase falls at the beginning or middle of a line, the hyphen doesn't appear in the printed document.
Non-breaking hyphens - A hyphen that is used to prevent a hyphenated word, number or phrase from breaking if it falls at the end of a line. For example, you can prevent 555-0123 from breaking; instead, the entire item moves to the beginning of the next line.
There are 2 ways of inserting hyphens into a document. You can;
- Hyphenate text manually.
- Hyphenate text automatically.

\section*{(a). Hyphenate a document Automatically.}

When you turn on automatic hyphenation, Ms-Word automatically scans the whole document and inserts hyphens where they are needed. If you later edit the document and change line breaks, Ms-Word rehyphenates the document.
1. On the Tools menu, select Language, then click Hyphenation.
2. Select the Automatically hyphenate document checkbox.
3. In the Hyphenation zone box, enter the amount of space to leave between the end of the last word in a line and the right margin.
To reduce the no. of hyphens, make the hyphenation zone wider. To reduce the unevenness of the right margin, make the hyphenation zone narrower.
4. Click the OK button.

\section*{(b).Hyphenate a document Manually.}

In Manual hyphenation, Ms-Word searches the document for the words to hyphenate, and then asks the user to confirm whether to include a hyphen and where to position it.
If you later edit the document and change line breaks, Ms-Word doesn't rehyphenate the document but displays and prints only the optional hyphens that still fall at the ends of lines.
1. To hyphenate part of document, select the text you want to hyphenate. To hyphenate the entire document, make sure no text is selected.
2. On the Tools menu, select Language, then click Hyphenation.
3. Click Manual.
4. If Ms-Word identifies a word or phrase to hyphenate, and proposes a location to insert a hyphen. Click Yes to insert the hyphen in the location Ms-Word proposes. Otherwise, to insert the hyphen in another part of the document, use the Arrow keys or Mouse to move the insertion point to that location, then click Yes.

\section*{To Remove Hyphenation.}
1. If you used automatic hyphenation, click on Tools, select Language, then click Hyphenation.
2. Clear the Automatically hyphenate document checkbox.

\section*{SECTIONS \& SECTION BREAKS}

A Break is used to identify where a section, a column or a page ends and the beginning of next. This allows the user to apply more than one paragraph or page format in the same document especially when it comes to page layout, size, different margins, etc.
A Section break is a mark that you insert to show the end of a section. Section breaks divide the document into sections, and then each section is formatted as needed.
A Section is a portion of a document in which one can set certain page formatting options.

\section*{Types of formatting elements you can set for sections.}

\section*{MAIL MERGING}

Mail merging is the process of generating personalized letters or documents by combining a standard document, e.g., a letter, with a list of addresses, and producing several copies of the standard document, but addressed to different recipients.
The standard document (letter) is referred to as the 'Main Document' and the list of addresses is referred to as the 'Data Source'.

\section*{Importance of mail merging.}
$\sqrt{ }$ Mail merge enables the user to send out the same document to several recipients at once.
$\sqrt{ }$ Combining of letters saves time when printing.
$\sqrt{ }$ The mailing list used in a Mail merge can be re-used on another document (unlike Copy \& Pasting).

\section*{The Mail merge process.}

The Mail merge process consists of 4 main steps:
1. Create the Main document or Open an existing Main document.

Main document is the common document or letter that is to be sent to all the people on the mailing list. It is sometimes known as the Form letter.
The Main document contains the text \& graphics that are the same for each version of the merged document, e.g., the return address or salutation.
2. Create the Data source or Open an existing Data source, with individual recipient information.

Data source (or Addresses file) is a file of data records of the people that will receive the form letter.

The Data source contains the information or data that varies in each copy of a merged document. E.g., the list of names \& addresses you want to use in a mail merge.
3. Add Merge fields in the main document.

Merge field is a placeholder that you insert in the main document. It helps Ms-Word insert the name or information that is stored in a particular data field.
4. Merge or combine data from the Data source with the Main document to create a new, merged document.
Therefore, in a mail merge, there are three files created:
1. The primary file (Main document).
2. The secondary file (Data source).
3. Merged file.
