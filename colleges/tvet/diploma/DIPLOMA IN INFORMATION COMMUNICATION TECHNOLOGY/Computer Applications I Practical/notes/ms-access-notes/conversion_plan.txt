Document Structure Analysis:

Document Hierarchy:
1. Microsoft Access Introduction
   1.1 Starting Microsoft Access
   1.2 Features of Microsoft Access Window
2. Database Components
   2.1 Data and Tables
   2.2 Fields and Records
3. Database Design
   3.1 Design Principles
   3.2 Database Structure Planning
4. Creating MS-Access Database
   4.1 Database Files
   4.2 Creation Methods
5. Database Tables
   5.1 Table Structure
   5.2 Field Data Types
   5.3 Creating Tables
   5.4 Working with Tables

Chunking Plan:
- index.html (Table of Contents)
- topics/chapter-1-introduction.html (~200 lines, Introduction to MS Access)
- topics/chapter-2-components.html (~250 lines, Database Components)
- topics/chapter-3-design.html (~200 lines, Database Design)
- topics/chapter-4-creation.html (~200 lines, Creating Databases)
- topics/chapter-5-tables-part-1.html (~250 lines, Table Basics and Structure)
- topics/chapter-5-tables-part-2.html (~250 lines, Working with Tables)

Special Elements Inventory:
- Equations: 2 - Pages: 1-10
- Tables: 3 - Pages: 1-10
- Figures: 1 (QR code) - Page: 1
- Code Blocks: None in first section
- Complex Lists: Multiple throughout document

Critical Sections (requiring special attention):
- Tables with complex layouts (need proper HTML table structure)
- Mathematical symbols (need MathJax configuration)
- Lists with multiple levels of nesting
- Field property tables with specific formatting
