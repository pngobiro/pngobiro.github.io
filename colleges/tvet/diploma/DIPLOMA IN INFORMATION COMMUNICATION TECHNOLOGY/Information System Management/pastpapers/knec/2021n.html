                            <h5>(a) Circumstances for Effective Change Programme via IS:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Clear Business Need & Vision:</strong> When there is a well-defined business problem or opportunity that the IS directly addresses, coupled with a clear vision from leadership about how the IS will enable the desired change.</li>
                                <li><strong>Strong User Involvement & Management Support:</strong> When end-users are actively involved in the design and implementation, and top management provides consistent support, resources, and communication, fostering acceptance and managing resistance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Appropriate Technology & Implementation Strategy:</strong> Selecting technology that fits the organizational context and using a suitable implementation approach (e.g., phased rollout, adequate training) that minimizes disruption and maximizes user adoption.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5>(b) (i) Socio-technical View:</h5>
                            <p>The socio-technical view emphasizes that the performance of an information system is optimized only when both the social system (people, structure, tasks, culture) and the technical system (hardware, software, networks) are designed to work harmoniously together. It recognizes the interdependence between technology and people in achieving organizational goals.</p>

                            <h5>(b) (ii) Factors to Consider When Using IS for Decision Making:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Information Quality:</strong> The accuracy, timeliness, relevance, completeness, and reliability of the data and information provided by the system are crucial for making sound decisions. Poor quality information leads to poor decisions.</li>
                                <li><strong>System Capabilities & Limitations:</strong> Understanding what the system can and cannot do, the models it uses, its assumptions, and its limitations is essential to interpreting results correctly and avoiding over-reliance on potentially flawed outputs.</li>
                                <li><strong>User Skills & Interpretation:</strong> The decision-maker's ability to understand the information presented, use the system's analytical tools effectively, and apply appropriate judgment and context to the system's output.</li>
                            </ol>

                        <div class="answer-content">
                            <h5>(a) Differences between CPM and PERT:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Time Estimates:</strong> CPM typically uses a single, deterministic time estimate for each activity, assuming certainty. PERT uses three time estimates (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic) to calculate an expected time, acknowledging uncertainty (probabilistic).</li>
                                <li><strong>Focus:</strong> CPM is primarily activity-oriented and often focuses on the trade-off between project cost and time. PERT is more event-oriented and better suited for projects with high uncertainty, focusing on time and probability analysis.</li>
                                <li><strong>Application:</strong> CPM is often used in industries with predictable activities (e.g., construction), while PERT is favored for R&D projects or those with novel tasks where time estimates are less certain.</li>
                            </ol>
                             *(Note: Only two differences were required)*

                            <h5>(b) (i) Adaptive System Maintenance:</h5>
                            <p>Adaptive maintenance involves modifying an information system to cope with changes in its external environment. This includes changes in business rules, government regulations, hardware platforms, operating systems, or interfaces with other systems. The goal is to keep the system functional and relevant as its surrounding context evolves.</p>

                            <h5>(b) (ii) Attributes of an ICT Project (Technical Institute):</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Defined Scope & Objectives:</strong> The project should have clear, specific, and measurable goals outlining what it aims to achieve for the institute (e.g., implement a new student portal, upgrade network infrastructure).</li>
                                <li><strong>Temporary Endeavor:</strong> An ICT project has a defined start and end date, unlike ongoing operations. It aims to create a unique product, service, or result within that timeframe.</li>
                                <li><strong>Resource Constraints:</strong> Projects operate within specific constraints, including budget limitations, available personnel (staff, students, faculty), equipment, and time schedules.</li>
                            </ol>
                             *(Note: Only two attributes were required)*

                                <li><strong>Accessibility & Collaboration:</strong> Allows team members and stakeholders to access project information (plans, status, documents) from anywhere with an internet connection, facilitating remote work and collaboration across different locations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Real-time Updates & Communication:</strong> Provides a central platform for real-time updates on task progress, issue tracking, and communication, improving transparency and coordination.</li>
                                <li><strong>Centralized Document Management:</strong> Offers a single repository for storing and sharing project-related documents, ensuring everyone works with the latest versions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reduced Software Installation/Maintenance:</strong> As a web-based solution, it typically requires no client-side installation and updates are managed centrally by the provider, reducing IT overhead.</li>
                            </ol>
                             *(Note: Only three reasons were required)*

                            <h5>(a) Results of Automating Workflow Procedures:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Increased Efficiency & Speed:</strong> Tasks are completed faster with less manual intervention, reducing processing times.</li>
                                <li><strong>Improved Consistency & Accuracy:</strong> Automated processes follow predefined rules consistently, reducing errors associated with manual work.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reduced Operational Costs:</strong> Lower labor costs due to automation and reduced errors/rework.</li>
                                <li><strong>Better Monitoring & Control:</strong> Workflow systems often provide visibility into process status, bottlenecks, and performance metrics.</li>
                            </ol>
                             *(Note: Only two results were required)*

                            <h5>(b) Types of Decisions at Each Management Level:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Strategic Level (Top Management):</strong> Unstructured decisions concerning long-term goals, overall strategy, resource allocation, and organizational direction. Examples: Entering new markets, major investments, organizational restructuring.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tactical Level (Middle Management):</strong> Semi-structured decisions focused on implementing strategies defined by top management. Examples: Developing departmental budgets, creating marketing plans, deciding on resource allocation within the department, scheduling production.</li>
                                <li><strong>Operational Level (Lower Management/Supervisors):</strong> Structured decisions related to day-to-day operations and ensuring tasks are performed efficiently according to predefined rules. Examples: Handling customer complaints based on policy, managing inventory levels, assigning daily tasks to employees.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5>(c) Time Estimates for Activities (Certain Start/Finish):</h5>
                            <p>If the start and finish times of a project are known with certainty, this implies a deterministic approach, likely CPM rather than PERT. In traditional CPM, only one time estimate is typically used for each activity:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Duration Estimate:</strong> The single, most likely estimate of the time required to complete the activity based on historical data or expert judgment.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>However, if the question implies using PERT's framework despite certainty (which is unusual), Janet would still need the three estimates for calculation, even if the range is narrow:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Optimistic Time (t<sub>o</sub>):</strong> The minimum possible time.</li>
                                <li><strong>Most Likely Time (t<sub>m</sub>):</strong> The realistic time under normal conditions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Pessimistic Time (t<sub>p</sub>):</strong> The maximum possible time if delays occur.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><i>(Context suggests CPM's single estimate is more appropriate if start/finish are certain, but PERT estimates are listed if the question implies that specific technique despite the certainty premise).</i></p>

                            <h5>(b) (ii) Factors Influencing High Maintenance Cost Estimate:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>System Age & Complexity (Legacy Systems):</strong> Older systems, especially those with complex, poorly documented code or outdated technology, are often significantly more difficult and expensive to maintain.</li>
                                <li><strong>Poor Initial Development Quality:</strong> Systems developed with poor design, inadequate testing, or insufficient documentation will likely have more bugs and require more effort to modify or enhance later.</li>
                                <li><strong>Frequency & Scope of Changes:</strong> A system requiring frequent updates due to rapidly changing business requirements or regulations will naturally incur higher maintenance costs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lack of Skilled Personnel:</strong> Difficulty in finding or retaining personnel with expertise in the specific (potentially older) technologies used by the system can drive up maintenance costs.</li>
                            </ol>
                             *(Note: Only three factors were required)*

                            <h5>(c) Mechanisms for Dealing with Personnel & IS Ethics:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Clear Policies & Codes of Conduct:</strong> Establishing and communicating clear policies regarding acceptable use, data privacy, intellectual property, and consequences for unethical behavior.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ethics Training & Awareness Programs:</strong> Regularly educating employees about ethical responsibilities, potential risks, security best practices, and relevant laws/regulations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Monitoring & Auditing:</strong> Implementing monitoring systems (with appropriate disclosure) and conducting audits to detect policy violations or unethical activities.</li>
                            </ol>
                             *(Note: Only two mechanisms were required)*
