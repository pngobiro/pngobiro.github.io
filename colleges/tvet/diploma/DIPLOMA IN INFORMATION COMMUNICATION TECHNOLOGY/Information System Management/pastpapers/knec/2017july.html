                            <p><strong>(a) Issues Affecting IS Maintenance Cost:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Quality of Initial Development:</strong> Poorly designed, poorly documented, or bug-ridden systems are significantly more expensive to maintain over their lifecycle.</li>
                                <li><strong>Personnel Skills and Availability:</strong> The cost and availability of skilled personnel familiar with the specific technologies or programming languages used in the system can greatly impact maintenance expenses.</li>

                                <li><strong>(i) Critical Path Identification:</strong> The critical path is the sequence of activities that determines the longest duration to complete the project. It consists of activities with zero float (slack). To identify it, one would need to calculate the Early Start (ES), Early Finish (EF), Late Start (LS), and Late Finish (LF) times for all activities based on the diagram's structure and activity durations (which are not provided in the OCR text for this figure).</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Float Time for Activity K:</strong> Float (or slack) is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the project completion date. It is calculated as LS - ES or LF - EF. To calculate the float for activity K, its ES, EF, LS, and LF times must first be determined from the full network analysis.</li>

                                <li><strong>Product/Service Differentiation:</strong> Using IS (e.g., CRM, data analytics, CAD/CAM) to create unique products or services, enhance quality, provide superior customer service, or personalize offerings in ways competitors cannot easily replicate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Niche Market Focus:</strong> Employing targeted IS (e.g., specialized databases, focused marketing systems) to serve a specific market segment exceptionally well, understanding and meeting their unique needs better than broad-market competitors.</li>
