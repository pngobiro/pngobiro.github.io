                            <p><strong>(a) Types of Systems:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Knowledge Management System (KMS):</strong> A system designed to support the creation, capture, storage, retrieval, sharing, and utilization of organizational knowledge and expertise. It helps organizations leverage their collective intelligence, improve decision-making, and foster innovation. Examples include document repositories and expert directories.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Supply Chain Management (SCM) System:</strong> A system managing the flow of goods, data, and finances from raw material procurement to final product delivery. It aims to optimize efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance collaboration among supply chain partners.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><strong>Reliability and Consistency:</strong> The system must accurately record every transaction and maintain data integrity (ACID properties). Errors can be very costly.</li>
                                <li><strong>High Performance/Throughput:</strong> It needs to process a large volume of transactions quickly and efficiently to avoid delays, especially in customer-facing scenarios.</li>
                                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Robust measures are essential to protect sensitive financial and personal data from unauthorized access, fraud, and breaches.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>(c) Technical vs. Behavioral Approaches:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Technical Approach:</strong> Focuses on the technology, mathematical models, and physical capabilities (hardware, software, networks). Emphasizes optimization using computer science and operations research.</li>
                                <li><strong>Behavioral Approach:</strong> Concentrates on human and organizational aspects â€“ implementation challenges, user adoption, training, ergonomics, social/ethical impacts. Draws from sociology, psychology, etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>(d) Negative Impacts of Information Systems for Zilpa's Report:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Job Displacement/Deskilling:</strong> Automation can replace human roles or reduce the skill level required for certain tasks, potentially leading to unemployment or reduced job satisfaction.</li>
                                <li><strong>Health Issues:</strong> Prolonged use can cause physical problems like Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI), Computer Vision Syndrome (eyestrain), and contribute to stress or burnout.</li>
                                <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> The collection and storage of vast amounts of data increase the risk of privacy violations through breaches, surveillance, or misuse of personal information.</li>

                                <li><strong>High Cost:</strong> Custom-developed (tailored) software is typically much more expensive than off-the-shelf packages due to the significant development effort involved.</li>
                                <li><strong>Long Development Time:</strong> Building software from scratch takes considerable time, which might not align with the company's immediate needs or project timelines.</li>
                                <li><strong>Higher Risk:</strong> Custom development carries inherent risks, including potential bugs, delays, budget overruns, and the possibility that the final product may not fully meet requirements despite the effort. Off-the-shelf software is often proven and tested.</li>

                                <li><strong>Direct End User:</strong> An individual who directly interacts with the computer system by inputting data or commands and receiving output (e.g., a data entry clerk using an accounting system, a programmer using a development tool).</li>
                                <li><strong>Indirect End User:</strong> An individual who uses the output or reports generated by a computer system but does not operate the system themselves (e.g., a manager reading a sales summary report, a customer receiving an automated bill).</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><strong>(i) Short range goals, plans and tactics:</strong> Corresponds to the <strong>Tactical Level</strong> (Middle Management). Information Requirement Example: Departmental performance reports, budget variance analysis, resource allocation data, sales forecasts.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Day to day plans and supervisory task:</strong> Corresponds to the <strong>Operational Level</strong> (Lower Management/Supervisors). Information Requirement Example: Detailed transaction data, daily/weekly production schedules, inventory levels, employee attendance records.</li>
