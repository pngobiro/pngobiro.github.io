                        <h4>Answer</h4>
                        <div class="answer-content">
                            <h5>(a) Master File vs. Transaction File:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Master File:</strong> Contains relatively permanent or semi-permanent data about key entities (e.g., customers, products, employees). It's updated periodically by transaction files. Example: A customer master file holds customer names, addresses, credit limits.</li>
                                <li><strong>Transaction File:</strong> Contains data about individual events or business activities that occur over a period. It's used to update master files. Example: A sales transaction file holds details of each sale (customer ID, product sold, quantity, date).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Essentially, master files store the current state, while transaction files record the changes to that state.</p>

                            <h5>(b) Advantages of Database Management Systems (DBMS):</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Reduced Data Redundancy:</strong> Centralized data storage minimizes duplication of data across different applications, improving consistency.</li>
                                <li><strong>Improved Data Integrity & Consistency:</strong> DBMS enforces data constraints and rules, ensuring data accuracy and reliability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Enhanced Data Security:</strong> Provides mechanisms for access control, user authentication, and backups to protect data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Independence:</strong> Separates data storage from application programs, allowing changes to data structure without modifying applications extensively.</li>
                                <li><strong>Improved Data Sharing & Access:</strong> Allows multiple users and applications to access and share data concurrently in a controlled manner.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5>(c) PERT Time Estimates:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Optimistic Time (t<sub>o</sub>):</strong> The minimum possible time required to accomplish an activity, assuming everything proceeds exceptionally well.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Most Likely Time (t<sub>m</sub>):</strong> The most realistic time required to accomplish an activity under normal conditions.</li>
                                <li><strong>(iii) Pessimistic Time (t<sub>p</sub>):</strong> The maximum possible time required to accomplish an activity, assuming significant delays or problems occur.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These are used to calculate the Expected Time (t<sub>e</sub>) = (t<sub>o</sub> + 4t<sub>m</sub> + t<sub>p</sub>) / 6.</p>

                            <h5>(d) Limitations of PERT Technique:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Subjectivity of Time Estimates:</strong> The accuracy of PERT relies heavily on the subjective estimates (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic) provided, which can be biased or inaccurate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Can become complex and unwieldy for very large projects with numerous activities and dependencies.</li>
                                <li><strong>Focus on Time, Not Cost:</strong> PERT primarily focuses on time scheduling and may not adequately integrate cost considerations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Assumption of Unlimited Resources:</strong> The basic PERT model often assumes resources are readily available, which may not be realistic.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5>(a) Early Warning Mechanism:</h5>
                            <p>An early warning mechanism within an MIS is a feature or process designed to automatically detect and alert managers to potential problems, critical deviations from plans, or emerging risks based on predefined rules or thresholds applied to monitored data. This allows for timely intervention before the issue escalates significantly.</p>

                            <h5>(b) Disadvantages of Using Questionnaires:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Low Response Rate:</strong> Often, a significant portion of questionnaires sent out are not returned, leading to potentially non-representative data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Misinterpretation:</strong> Respondents may misunderstand questions due to wording or lack of context, and there is no opportunity for the researcher to clarify.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inflexibility:</strong> Once distributed, the questions cannot be changed or adapted based on respondent answers or emerging themes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Superficiality/Lack of Depth:</strong> Closed-ended questions may not capture the complexity of opinions, and open-ended questions may receive brief or incomplete answers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Potential for Dishonesty/Bias:</strong> Respondents might provide socially desirable answers or deliberately inaccurate information.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5>(c) Qualities of Good User Documentation:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Clarity and Simplicity:</strong> Written in clear, concise language appropriate for the target user, avoiding technical jargon where possible.</li>
                                <li><strong>Accuracy and Completeness:</strong> Provides correct information covering all necessary aspects of the program's features, installation, usage, and troubleshooting.</li>
                                <li><strong>Accessibility and Organization:</strong> Well-structured with a logical flow, clear headings, table of contents, index, and possibly search functionality (if digital) for easy navigation and information retrieval.</li>
                                <li><strong>Task-Oriented:</strong> Focuses on helping users accomplish specific tasks with the software, often using step-by-step instructions and examples.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5>(d) Reasons for Training New Employees on MIS:</h5>
                            <ol>
