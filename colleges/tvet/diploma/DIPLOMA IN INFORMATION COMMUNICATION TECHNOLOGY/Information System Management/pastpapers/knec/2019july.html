                                <li><strong>(i) Coordination:</strong> MIS facilitates coordination by providing shared databases, communication platforms (email, messaging), and integrated systems (like ERP) that allow different departments and individuals to access common information, share updates in real-time, and align their activities.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Planning:</strong> MIS provides historical data, forecasting tools, and analytical capabilities (e.g., reports, dashboards) that help managers analyze trends, predict future conditions, set objectives, and allocate resources more effectively during the planning process.</li>
                                <li><strong>(iii) Control:</strong> MIS supports control by generating performance reports that compare actual results against planned targets (budgets, schedules, KPIs). This allows managers to identify deviations, investigate causes, and take timely corrective actions.</li>

                                <li><strong>(i) Socio-technical Approach:</strong> Focuses on the interaction between the social system (people, tasks, structure) and the technical system (technology, tools). It aims to jointly optimize both systems to improve overall organizational performance and employee well-being, recognizing their interdependence.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Behavioral Approach:</strong> Focuses on changing the attitudes, behaviors, and interpersonal skills of individuals and groups within the organization.

                                <li><strong>Real-time Processing:</strong> Data is processed immediately as a transaction occurs, providing instant updates to system records. This allows for immediate feedback and response. Example: Airline reservation systems, ATM transactions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> Data is collected over a period and processed together in a group or "batch". Updates to records are delayed until the batch is processed. Example: Processing payroll checks at the end of the month, generating monthly billing statements.</li>

                            <h5>(d) Risks of Cloud Computing:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities:</strong> Entrusting sensitive data to a third-party provider introduces risks related to unauthorized access, data breaches, or shared infrastructure vulnerabilities if the provider's security measures are inadequate.</li>
                                <li><strong>Vendor Lock-in & Dependency:</strong> Migrating data and applications away from a specific cloud provider can be difficult and costly, creating dependency on the vendor's pricing, policies, and viability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Compliance & Legal Risks:</strong> Ensuring the cloud provider complies with relevant industry regulations and data residency laws (especially for cross-border data storage) can be complex.</li>
                                <li><strong>Downtime & Availability Issues:</strong> Dependence on the provider's infrastructure means that outages or performance issues on their end can disrupt the organization's access to its systems and data.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> The budget available for acquisition, implementation, and ongoing maintenance (custom development is usually more expensive upfront than off-the-shelf).</li>
                                <li><strong>Time Availability:</strong> How quickly the system is needed (off-the-shelf is faster to deploy than custom development).</li>
                                <li><strong>Uniqueness of Business Needs:</strong> The extent to which organizational requirements are specific or unique (favors custom development) versus standard (favors off-the-shelf).</li>
                                <li><strong>Availability of Suitable Packages:</strong> Whether appropriate ready-made software exists in the market that meets the core requirements.</li>

                            <h5>(a) (i) Components of an Information System Plan:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Alignment with Business Strategy:</strong> How the IS plan supports overall organizational goals and strategies.</li>
                                <li><strong>IS Architecture:</strong> The blueprint for the organization's data, applications, and technology infrastructure.</li>
                                <li><strong>Project Portfolio:</strong> A list of prioritized IS projects to be undertaken, including scope, objectives, and timelines.</li>

                            <h5>(a) (ii) Reason Not to Connect MIS to Internet:</h5>
                            <p><strong>Security Concerns:</strong> Connecting an internal MIS, especially one containing sensitive financial or operational data, directly to the public internet significantly increases its exposure to external threats like hacking, malware, denial-of-service attacks, and data breaches. Keeping it isolated ("air-gapped") or strictly limiting external connections enhances security.</p>

                            <h5>(b) Value Chain vs. Value System:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Value Chain (Porter):</strong> A model that views an organization as a series of primary and support activities that add value to its products or services. Primary activities include inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing & sales, and service. Support activities include infrastructure, HR, technology development, and procurement. MIS can support and optimize activities within this internal chain.</li>
                                <li><strong>Value System:</strong> A larger concept encompassing the value chains of an organization, its suppliers, distributors, and customers. It recognizes that value creation involves multiple organizations working together. MIS can be used to coordinate and optimize activities across this entire system (e.g., through SCM or CRM systems linking different entities).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(c) Causes for Employee Resistance to New IS (Kombi Company):</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Fear of Job Loss/Change:</strong> Employees may fear that the new system will automate their tasks, leading to redundancy, or significantly change their job roles and required skills.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lack of Perceived Benefit/Need:</strong> If employees don't understand why the change is necessary or how the new system will benefit them or the organization, they are less likely to embrace it.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inadequate Training/Support:</strong> Insufficient training or lack of readily available support can lead to frustration, errors, and a negative perception of the new system.</li>
                                <li><strong>Disruption of Routines/Comfort Zone:</strong> People are often comfortable with existing routines, and a new system forces them to learn new processes, which can be perceived as inconvenient or difficult.</li>
                                <li><strong>Poor Communication/Lack of Involvement:</strong> If the implementation process lacks clear communication or fails to involve users, it can lead to rumors, mistrust, and resistance.</li>
                            </ol>
                             *(Note: Only three causes were required)*

                            <h5>(d) Classification of Workplace Issues:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use of assigned access privileges for personal gain: **Moral & potentially Legal** (Depending on specific actions and company policy/laws regarding fraud or data misuse).</li>
                                <li>Installing copyrighted software without license: **Legal & Moral** (Violates copyright law and ethical principles).</li>
                                <li>Requesting a fee for a job award: **Moral & Legal** (Bribery/corruption, likely illegal and unethical).</li>
                                <li>Employer failing to pay dues: **Legal & Moral** (Violates labor laws/contracts and ethical obligations).</li>
                            </ul>
