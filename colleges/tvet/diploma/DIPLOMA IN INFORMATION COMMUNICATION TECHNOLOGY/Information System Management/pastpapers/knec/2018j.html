                            <p><em>(Requires the actual time values (Optimistic, Most Likely, Pessimistic) from Table 2 to calculate Expected Times (Te) and Variances (σ²) for each activity, determine the critical path, calculate the total variance for the critical path, find the standard deviation (σ), and then use the Z-score formula (Z = (Due Date - Expected Completion Time) / σ) to find the probability using a standard normal distribution table. The "highest pessimistic time" likely refers to the sum of pessimistic times along a path, or potentially the pessimistic estimate for the final project duration, which needs clarification. Without the table data, the calculation cannot be performed.)</em></p>
