                            <p><strong>(a) Modes of Data Processing:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Real-time Transaction Processing:</strong> Data is processed immediately as each transaction occurs. The system's records are updated instantaneously, reflecting the current state (e.g., airline reservation systems, ATM withdrawals).</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Batch Processing:</strong> Transactions are collected over a period (e.g., end of day/week) and processed together in a single run (batch). Suitable for non-critical tasks where immediate updates are not required (e.g., payroll processing, generating monthly bills).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>(b) Efficiency vs. Effectiveness in MIS:</strong></p>

                                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Refers to how well the system uses resources (time, cost, personnel) to perform its tasks. An efficient system does things right, minimizing waste and maximizing output with given inputs (e.g., processing transactions quickly, using minimal storage).</li>
                                <li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Refers to how well the system achieves its intended goals or meets user requirements. An effective system does the right things, providing accurate, relevant, and timely information that supports business objectives and decision-making.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>(c) Top-Down Budgeting Approach:</strong></p>

                                        <li><strong>Strategic Alignment:</strong> Ensures the overall project budget aligns with the organization's strategic goals and financial constraints as set by senior management.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Faster Process:</strong> Can be quicker to establish an overall budget figure compared to building it up from detailed task estimates (bottom-up).</li>

                                        <li><strong>Less Accurate/Realistic:</strong> Budgets set by top management without detailed input from those performing the work may be unrealistic or insufficient for actual project needs.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Reduced Buy-in:</strong> Team members may feel less ownership or commitment to a budget imposed from above without their input.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                            <p><strong>(a) Differences Between Strategic and Tactical Plans:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Time Horizon:</strong> Strategic plans focus on the long term (typically 3-5 years or more), while tactical plans focus on the shorter term (usually 1 year or less) to implement parts of the strategic plan.</li>
                                <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Strategic plans are broad, covering the entire organization and its overall direction, while tactical plans are narrower, focusing on specific departments, functions, or projects.</li>
                                <li><strong>Level of Detail:</strong> Strategic plans are high-level, outlining major goals and objectives, while tactical plans are more detailed, specifying actions, resources, and timelines required to achieve specific targets.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Poor Planning/Unclear Objectives:</strong> Objectives that are vague, unrealistic, not communicated effectively, or lack clear action plans are difficult to achieve.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inadequate Resources:</strong> Lack of sufficient funding, personnel, skills, technology, or time needed to execute the plans required to meet objectives.</li>
                                <li><strong>Failure to Adapt to External Changes:</strong> Not recognizing or responding effectively to changes in the market, competition, technology, regulations, or economic conditions that impact the organization's ability to achieve its goals.</li>

                                <li><strong>(i) Network Diagram Construction:</strong> A diagram would be drawn showing nodes (representing events or start/end of activities) and arrows (representing activities with their durations). Arrows would connect nodes based on the precedence relationships (e.g., arrow for C starts from the end node of A; arrows for D start from end nodes of B and C).

                                <li><strong>(ii) Critical Path Identification:</strong> To find the critical path, calculate the Early Start (ES), Early Finish (EF), Late Start (LS), and Late Finish (LF) times for each activity. The critical path consists of activities with zero float (LS - ES = 0 or LF - EF = 0). It represents the longest path through the network, determining the minimum project duration. (Cannot be calculated accurately with missing durations for A and D).</li>
