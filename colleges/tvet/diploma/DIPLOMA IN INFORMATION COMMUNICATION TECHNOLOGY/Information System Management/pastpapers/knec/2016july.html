                                <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Mobile devices are often more vulnerable to theft, loss, malware, and insecure Wi-Fi connections, increasing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to company systems.</li>
                                <li><strong>Integration Issues:</strong> Integrating mobile applications and data seamlessly with existing backend enterprise systems can be complex and costly.</li>

                                <li><strong>Change in Strategic Priorities:</strong> The organization's strategic goals may shift, making the project no longer relevant or a high priority compared to other initiatives, leading to its cancellation or indefinite postponement.</li>

                                <li><strong>System Complexity and Age:</strong> Older, more complex systems, or those built with outdated technology, are often harder and more expensive to maintain due to lack of documentation, scarcity of skilled personnel, and integration challenges.</li>
                                <li><strong>Frequency and Type of Maintenance:</strong> The amount of corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance required directly impacts cost. Systems requiring frequent changes or fixing many bugs will be more costly to maintain.</li>

                                <li><strong>Downsizing (in IT context):</strong> Refers to migrating applications from larger computers (mainframes, minicomputers) to smaller, networked platforms (like client-server systems or PCs), often aiming to reduce hardware and maintenance costs. It's an implementation strategy, not primarily a planning methodology like CSF.</li>
