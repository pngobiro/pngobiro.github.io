                            <li>The pre-specific processing of day to day transactions, known as data processing or transaction processing and the production of regular reports analysis and information for planning control and decision making directly by the computer.</li>

                        <p>Both produce management information. The key difference is that the pre specified systems supply pre- determined outputs and reports so there is less flexibility.</p>
                        <p>This means that great care must be taken in analyzing and determining management's real information. On the other hand, with the end user computing there is more flexibility and interaction so that the emphasis becomes one of supporting the end user rather than the production of a specified report.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The socio-technical view of organizations was developed by Trist and the Tavistock Institute and arose from consideration that any production system requires both a technological organization, i.e. the equipment, processes, methods, etc. and a work organization relating to those who carry out the necessary tasks to each other, i.e. the social system. Based on this view an organization is not just a technical or social system but is the structuring of human activities round various technologies.</p>
                        <p>The technologies involved determine the technical sub-systems and vary widely. Consider, for example, the differing skills, procedures, machinery, equipment and the layout of facilities required in an electronics company, a car manufacturer, a hospital or a computer bureau.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the technical sub-system, every organization has a social subsystem which consists of the aspirations, expectations, interactions and value systems of the members. The two sub-systems - the technical and the social -cannot be looked at separately but must both be considered as interrelating within the organization. Socio-technical theory suggests that the organization consists of four interrelated elements - tasks, people, structure and technology as shown in Figure below:</p>

                        <p>More traditional approaches to Organizations and their problems have tended to concentrate on one or other of the sub-systems with little or no recognition of the other.</p>

                        <p>The study of information systems deals with issues and insights contributed from technical and behavioral disciplines.</p>
                        <p>The technical approach emphasizes mathematically based, normative models to study information systems, as well as the physical technology and formal capabilities of these systems. The behavioral approach, a growing part of the information systems field, does not ignore technology, but tends to focus on non-technical solutions concentrating instead on changes in attitudes, management and organizational policy, and behavior.</p>
                        <p>MIS combines the work of computer science, management science, and operations research with a practical orientation toward developing system solutions to real-world problems and managing information technology resources. It is also concerned with behavioral issues surrounding the development, use, and impact of information systems, which are typically discussed in the fields of sociology, economics, and psychology</p>
                        <p>In the sociotechnical view of systems, optimal organizational performance is achieved by jointly optimizing both the social and technical systems used in production. Adopting a sociotechnical systems perspective helps to avoid a purely technological approach to information systems.</p>
                        <p>Technology must be changed and designed, sometimes even "de-optimized," to fit organizational and individual needs. Organizations and individuals must also be changed through training, learning, and planned organizational change to allow technology to operate and prosper. Information systems are sociotechnical systems. Although they are composed of machines, devices, and "hard" physical technology, they require substantial social, organizational, and intellectual investments to make them work properly. Since problems with information systems-and their solutions-are rarely all technical or behavioral, a multidisciplinary approach is needed.</p>
