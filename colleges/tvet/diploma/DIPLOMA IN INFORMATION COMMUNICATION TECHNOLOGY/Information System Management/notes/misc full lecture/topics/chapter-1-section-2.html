                        <p>MIS consists of three words, that is Management, Information and System. On the basis of these three words MIS can be defined as a system, which supplies information to Management. Actually, MIS is a process of providing necessary information to management. It helps planning, controlling and in taking different managerial decisions. MIS is the structured, formal, systematic part of communication system. MIS is an assemblage of personnel and facilities, organized into an integrated system by which relevant, adequate and timely information is supplied to the executives. $n^{6}$</p> <!-- Note: MathJax will handle $n^6$ -->
                        <p>It is to be mentioned that in respect of a large enterprise, MIS can be built around electronic computers. MIS is not new, but only its computerization is new. Before the invention of computer, MIS techniques had existed to supply operations. The computer adds added one or more dimensions such as speed, accuracy and increased volume of data.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Any telecommunications and/or computer related equipment or interconnected system or sub-systems of equipment that is used in the acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission or reception of voice and/or data, and includes software, firmware and hardware.</p>
                        <p>Also, a MIS is an IS that provides information to the management to enable them plan, coordinate, control monitor and make decision by providing routine, summarizes and exceptional report.</p>
                        <p>The focus is on the design and operation of the MIS which means that the information system is viewed as a means of processing data, i.e. the routine facts and figures of the organization, into information which is then used for decision making. It is changes in decision behavior which distinguish data from information.</p>
                        <p>The Figure 1.1 summarizes this approach.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>This means that MISs are qualitatively different from data processing systems and that management involvement and interaction between information specialists and management are the key features of successful MIS design.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, MIS can be defined as:</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote definition-block"> <!-- Added definition-block class -->
                          <p>A system to convert data from internal and external sources into information and to communicate that information, in an appropriate form, to managers at all levels in all functions to enable them to make timely and effective decisions for planning, directing and controlling the activities for which they are responsible.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>To be successful an MIS must be designed and operated with due regard to organization and behavioral principles as well as technical factors. Management must be informed enough to make an effective contribution to systems design and information specialists (systems analysts, accountants, operations researchers and others) must become more aware of managerial functions and needs so that, jointly, more effective MISs are developed.</p>
