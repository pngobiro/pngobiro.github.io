                        <p>These are the basic business systems serving the operational level of the organization. A TPS is a computerized system that performs and records the daily routine transactions necessary to conduct the business e.g. sales order entry, invoicing, hotel bookings, payroll and shipping data. At this level tasks, resource and goals are predefined and are highly structured e.g. the products that are out of stock and the slow moving stock.</p>
                        <p>TPS are central to an organization such that if there is a failure it can bring the organization to a standard still. The information inputs for the TPS are in the form of transactions and events. Processing involves sorting, listing, merging and updating.</p>
                        <p>The information output are detailed reports which are given to the operational staffs and supervisors.</p>
                        <p>It provides the input data for many other systems. T.P.S is critical to the success of any organization since they support the level operations such as purchasing of raw materials. Billing customers and preparing the payroll etc.</p>
                        <p>The objectives of T.P.S are:</p>

                        <p>T.P.S can also be based on a client /server and internet technologies. Innovations such as online transactions processing (OLTP) can serve many people by allowing suppliers to enter the TPS and look at the inventory level.</p>

The knowledge workers are the people who have the responsibility of creating or finding new sources of information. This includes engineer doctors, scientist and programmers. Processing involves modeling and simulations. The information outputs are models and graphics for professional and technical staff.</p>
                        <p><b>Office Automation system</b> are computer system this include word processors, emails and scheduling system, designed to increase the productivity of the data workers in the office.</p>
                        <p>Data workers have less formal qualifications and tend to process information a lot is already available. This includes secretariat, accounts, filling clerks or managers whose jobs include the use, manipulation or dissemination of information.</p>
                        <p>Information inputs are documents and schedule - processing includes, delegation scheduling and communication. The outputs are clerical schedules and the mails for clerical workers.</p>
