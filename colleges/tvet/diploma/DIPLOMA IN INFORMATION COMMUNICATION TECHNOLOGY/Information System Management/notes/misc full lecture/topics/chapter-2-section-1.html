                        <p>Information system has been defined in terms of two perspectives: one relating to its function; the other relating to its structure. From a functional perspective; an information system is a technologically implemented medium for the purpose of recording, storing, and disseminating linguistic expressions as well as for the supporting of inference making.</p>
                        <p>From a structural perspective; an information system consists of a collection of people, processes, data, models, technology and partly formalized language, forming a cohesive structure which serves some organizational purpose or function. The functional definition has its merits in focusing on what actual users - from a conceptual point of view- do with the information system while using it. They communicate with experts to solve a particular problem. The structural definition makes clear that IS are socio-technical systems, i.e., systems consisting of humans, behavior rules, and conceptual and technical artifacts.</p>
                        <p>An information system can be defined technically as a set of interrelated components that collect (or retrieve), process, store, and distribute information to support decision making and control in an organization. In addition to supporting decision making, coordination, and control, information systems may also help managers and workers analyze problems, visualize complex subjects, and create new products.</p>
                        <p>Three activities in an information system produce the information that organizations need to make decisions, control operations, analyze problems, and create new products or services. These activities are inputting, processing and outputting. Input captures or collects raw data from within the organization or from its external environment. Processing converts this raw input into a more meaningful form. Output transfers the processed information to the people who will use it or to the activities for which it will be used. Information systems also require feedback, which is output that is returned to appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate or correct the input stage.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Control is the process of ensuring that operations proceed according to plan and at the most basic level-this is done by comparing the actual results or output of the system against a target and using any differences found to adjust the input side of the system so as to bring activities in line with the target. In practice the target may be termed a norm, a budget a standard, a performance or stock level and so on.</p>
                        <h4>Types of Control Systems</h4>
                        <p>There are basically two types of control system: the open loop system and the closed loop control systems.</p>

                        <!-- START: open-loop-control -->
                        <section class="content-section" id="open-loop-control">
                             <h4 class="subsection-heading">(i) Open loop control system</h4>
                             <div class="content-card">
                                 <p>Input → Process → Output</p>
                                 <!-- <p><smiles>[Mg]</smiles></p> Omitted smiles tag -->
                                 <p>This is a simple open loop control system. Its operation is very simple, when an input signal directs the control</p>
                                 <figure>
                                     <img src="../assets/images/chapter2-section1-open-loop-examples.jpg" alt="Text examples of open loop control systems: machines, light switches, gas ovens, etc." class="content-image">

                                 </figure>
                                 <p>The drawback of an open loop control system is that it is incapable of making automatic adjustments. Even when the magnitude of the output too big or too small, the system will not make the appropriate adjustments. For this reason, an open loop control system is not suitable for use as a complex control system. Sometimes it may even require monitoring and response from the user.</p>

                        </section>
                        <!-- END: open-loop-control -->

                        <!-- START: closed-loop-control -->
                        <section class="content-section" id="closed-loop-control">
                             <h4 class="subsection-heading">(ii) Closed loop control system</h4>
                             <div class="content-card">
                                 <p>Sometimes, we may use the output of the control system to adjust the input signal. This is called feedback. Feedback is a special feature of a closed loop control system. A closed loop control system compares the output with the expected result or command status, and then it takes appropriate control actions to adjust the input signal. Therefore, a closed loop system is always equipped with a sensor, which is used to monitor the output and compare it with the expected result.</p>
                                 <p>The diagram shows a simple closed loop system. The output signal is fed back to the input to produce a new output. A well-design system can often increase the accuracy of the output.</p>
                                 <figure>

                                 </figure>
                                 <h5>Feedback</h5>
                                 <p>This is the gathering of information on past performance from the output of a system, department or process and using it to govern future performance by adjusting the input size of the system.</p>
                                 <p>Feedback can be divided into positive feedback and negative feedback.</p>
                                 <h6>(i) Positive Feedback</h6>
                                 <p>This causes a system to amplify an adjustment or an action. It acts in the same direction as the measured deviation i.e. this reinforces the way the system is moving and if thought to be beneficial.</p>
                                 <p>If an advertisement increased the sales further advertisements may be considered.</p>
                                 <h6>(ii) Negative Feedback</h6>
                                 <p>This is feedback seeking fluctuation around a norm or a standard. The corrective action is on the opposite side of the deviation e.g. production quantities below the plan may require an increase in labor.</p>
                                 <p>One advantage of using the closed loop control system is that it is able to adjust its output automatically by feeding the output signal back to the input.</p>
                                 <p>In a closed loop control system, the controlled variable (output) of the system is sensed at every instant of time, feedback and compared with the desired input resulting in an error signal. This error signal directs the control elements in the system to do the necessary corrective action such that the output of the system is obtained as desired.</p>
                                 <p>The feedback control system takes into account the disturbances also and makes the corrective action.</p>
                                 <p>These control systems are accurate, stable and less affected by noise. But these control systems are sophisticated and hence costly. They are also complicated to design for stability, give oscillatory response and feedback brings down the overall gain of the control system</p>

It will be realized that the basic system described is relatively mechanistic and is therefore not necessarily suitable for all facets of the organization's activities.</p>

                                 <p>Where a self-regulating feedback system is not able to control a process adequately it may be feasible to use feed forward. This is where monitoring at some early stage of a system or process may indicate that an adjustment should be made at a later stage of the process, prior to the final output. Feed forward is not an automatic process and requires management intervention for it to operate successfully and, consequently, it does not have the degree of 'automatic' control inherent in a feedback system.</p>
