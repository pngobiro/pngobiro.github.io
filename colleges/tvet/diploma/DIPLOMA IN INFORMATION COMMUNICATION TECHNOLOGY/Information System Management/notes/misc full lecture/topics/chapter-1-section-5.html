                        <p>The systems approach is a method or framework which helps us to analyze and explore the operation and interactions which exist in the systems around us. In other words; this is an approach to problem solving e.g. trying to structure an organization or analyze an information system. It involves trying to establish the objectives of the system through considering the relationship with its environment, identifying its component and the interaction features of the system.</p>

                        <p>To be successful and to remain in existence, organizations must be flexible and adapt to change. This means change not only in the Organization's relationship with the external environment but also in its internal methods and structures. Successful Organizations are characterized by their internal openness and their readiness to accept that yesterday's methods and products are very unlikely to be suitable for tomorrow. Recognizing the need for change, initiating change and managing change successfully are the hallmarks of good quality management. Organizations do not automatically adjust to change.</p>
                        <p>Adaptation only occurs as a result of management decisions and action. Successful change is change that is planned and considered. This means that the effects on the Organization as a whole must be considered when making a change to part of the Organization. It will be recalled that a key element of the systems approach is that changes in parts of a system affect the system as a whole. Thus, to make successful changes one must be aware of the interactions which exist in the Organization.</p>
                        <p>Systems theory recognizes that open systems can achieve their objectives in a variety of ways using varying inputs, processes and methods. This is known as equifinality.</p>

                            <li><b>Holism or synergy</b>- All systems are composed of interrelated parts or sub-systems and the system can only be explained as a whole (Holism or synergy). This is known as holism or synergy. Holism states that any whole is more than the sum of its individual parts. When the appropriate parts are combined, properties appear from the whole which the parts alone do not possess. These are known as emergent properties. Examples of emergent properties are:
                                <ul class="enhanced-list nested-list">
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Taste: a property of water not the constituent hydrogen and oxygen atoms.</span></li>
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Growth: a property arising from the combination of seeds and soil.</span></li>
                                    <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Obsolescence (Uselessness): likely to arise from consideration of financial, technical and personnel factors. A machine may still work but may be too expensive or dangerous to run or may no longer be required for current production.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Systems are hierarchical</b> in that the parts of sub-systems are made up of other smaller parts. For example, the accounting systems of an organization may be a sub-system of the information system which is itself a sub-system of the planning system, which is a sub-system of the organization as a whole. Progressing down the hierarchy increases the detail but reduces the area whilst moving upwards provides a successively broader view.</li>
                            <li><b>The parts of a system cannot be altered without affecting other parts.</b> Many organizational problems stem from ignoring this principle. For example, a departmental procedure or form might be changed without considering the ripple effects on the other departments affected, with dire consequences.</li>
                            <li><b>The sub-systems should work towards the goal of their higher systems</b> and not pursue their own objectives independently. If sub-systems pursue their own objectives to the determent of higher objectives (organization), this condition is known as sub-optimally i.e. they aren't performing optimally.</li>
                            <li><b>Organizational systems contain both hard and soft properties.</b> Hard properties are those that can be assessed in some objective way. Examples are; the number of components in a storage bin, the amount of PAYE tax a person will pay. The soft aspects of a system are a matter of individual values or taste. They cannot be assessed by any objective standard or measuring process. Examples are: the appearance of a product, the suitability of a person for a job, any problem containing a political element and so on.</li>

                        <p>This is the tight connection between sub-components e.g. resources and facilities need to be finely balanced, parts and documentation must be available and there must be good flow of information. The solution is to decouple or looser or reduce the intensity of interactions so that the sub-systems can operate with a degree of independence.</p>
                        <p>Decoupling can be done in the following three ways:-</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>The use of inventories, buffers or waiting lives consisting of stock or work in progress (W.I.P) e.g. in a computer system a printer has a buffer.</li>
                            <li>Have extra and flexible resources e.g. have extra personnel for several jobs e.g. Benetton clothing inc. it provides undyed goods and other dyes then before shipment.</li>
                            <li>Standardization - The existence of standard specifications an procedures to ease communications e.g. when the receiving sub-system knows what to expect. However decoupling has its own cost.</li>
