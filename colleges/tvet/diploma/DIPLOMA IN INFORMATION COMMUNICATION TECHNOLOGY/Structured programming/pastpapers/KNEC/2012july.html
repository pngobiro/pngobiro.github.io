                            <h5>(a) (i) Types of Program Errors</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Syntax Errors:</strong> Violations of the programming language's grammar rules (e.g., missing semicolons, misspelled keywords). Detected by the compiler/interpreter.</li>
                                <li><strong>Runtime Errors:</strong> Errors that occur during program execution (e.g., division by zero, accessing invalid memory, file not found). Cause program crashes or abnormal termination if not handled.</li>
                                <li><strong>Logical Errors:</strong> Errors in the program's logic that cause it to produce incorrect or unexpected results, even if it runs without crashing (e.g., using the wrong formula, incorrect conditional logic).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(a) (ii) Hardware Requirements for Programming Software</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Processor (CPU):</strong> Needs sufficient processing power (speed, cores) to handle compilation, execution, and potentially IDE operations smoothly. Minimum requirements vary by software.</li>
                                <li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> Requires enough RAM to load the operating system, the programming environment (IDE), the compiler/interpreter, and the program being developed/run without excessive swapping to disk.</li>
                                <li><strong>Storage (Hard Drive/SSD):</strong> Needs sufficient disk space to install the programming tools (compiler, IDE, libraries) and store source code files, project files, and compiled executables.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(b) Robust vs. Legible Program</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Robust Program:</strong> Designed to handle unexpected inputs or error conditions gracefully without crashing. It anticipates potential problems (e.g., invalid user input, file errors) and includes error handling mechanisms.</li>
                                <li><strong>Legible Program:</strong> Written in a clear, understandable, and well-formatted way. Uses meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, comments, and modular structure to make the code easy for humans to read, understand, and maintain.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(c) Escape Sequence in C</h5>
                            <p>An escape sequence is a sequence of characters starting with a backslash (`\`) used within string or character literals to represent special characters that are difficult or impossible to type directly or have special meaning.</p>
                            <p><strong>Example:</strong> The sequence `\n` represents the newline character. When used in `printf`, it moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line.</p>
                            <pre><code class="language-c">
printf("Hello\nWorld!");
                            </code></pre>
                            <p>Output:</p>
                            <pre>
Hello
World!
                            </pre>
                            <p>Other examples include `\t` (tab), `\\` (backslash), `\"` (double quote).</p>

                            <h5>(d) Pascal Program: Currency Conversion</h5>
                            <pre><code class="language-pascal">

                            <h5>(a) Identifier Definition</h5>
                            <p>An identifier is a user-defined name given to entities like variables, constants, functions, procedures, types, etc., in a program. It allows the programmer to refer to these entities symbolically in the code. Identifiers must follow specific naming rules defined by the programming language (e.g., starting with a letter, containing only letters, numbers, and underscores).</p>

                            <h5>(b) (i) Structure Chart</h5>
                            <p>A structure chart is a top-down diagram used in program design that shows the overall architecture of a program. It illustrates how different modules (functions or procedures) are organized and how they relate to each other, including the flow of data and control between them. It helps visualize the program's hierarchy and decomposition into smaller, manageable parts.</p>

                            <h5>(b) (ii) Flowchart Advantages and Disadvantages</h5>
                            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Visual Clarity:</strong> Provides a clear graphical representation of program logic and flow, making it easy to understand, especially for simple algorithms.</li>
                                <li><strong>Effective Communication:</strong> Serves as a good communication tool between programmers and non-technical stakeholders to explain program logic.</li>
                                <li><strong>Debugging Aid:</strong> Can help in tracing the logic flow and identifying errors during the design or debugging phase.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Time-Consuming & Complex:</strong> Can become very large, complex, and difficult to draw/maintain for complex programs. Modifications can be tedious.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lack of Detail:</strong> May not capture all the nuances or details of the implementation compared to pseudocode or actual code.</li>
                                <li><strong>Non-Standard Symbols (Historically):</strong> While standards exist, variations in symbol usage could sometimes lead to ambiguity.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(c) (i) Control Structures for Reading Text File Records</h5>
                            <p>To read all records from a text file until the end is reached, the following control structures are commonly used:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>While Loop:</strong> A `while not EOF(fileVariable) do ...` loop continues reading records as long as the end-of-file marker has not been reached.</li>
                                <li><strong>Repeat...Until Loop:</strong> A `repeat ... until EOF(fileVariable)` loop can also be used, although it processes the loop body at least once, which might require careful handling if the file could be empty.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(c) (ii) Pascal Segment Output</h5>
                            <p>Given x = 0:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Outer loop (i) runs from 1 to 5.</li>
                                <li>Inner loop (j) runs from x (0) to 3.</li>
                                <li>y is initialized to 0.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>i=1:
                                    <ul>

                            <p>A symbolic constant in C is a name given to a constant value, typically defined using the `#define` preprocessor directive. The preprocessor replaces every occurrence of the symbolic constant's name in the code with its defined value *before* compilation begins. It's a form of text substitution.</p>
                            <p>Example: `#define PI 3.14159`</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>I. Modular Design:</strong> Breaking down a large program into smaller, independent, and reusable modules (like functions or procedures). Each module performs a specific task, making the program easier to design, code, test, debug, and maintain. It promotes code organization and reusability.</li>
                                <li><strong>II. Bottom-Up Design:</strong> A design approach where individual low-level modules or components are designed and implemented first. These components are then combined and integrated to build larger modules and eventually the complete system. It focuses on building blocks and then assembling them.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><strong>Procedure:</strong> A block of code designed to perform a specific task or action. It does *not* return a value directly to the point where it was called. It can modify parameters passed by reference (VAR parameters). Declared using the `procedure` keyword.</li>
                                <li><strong>Function:</strong> A block of code designed to perform a calculation or task and *return a single value* of a specific data type to the point where it was called. The function name itself is used within the function body to assign the return value. Declared using the `function` keyword, followed by the parameters and the return type (e.g., `: integer`).</li>

After executing the body, it evaluates the specified `UNTIL` condition. If the condition is `FALSE`, the loop repeats, executing the body again. If the condition is `TRUE`, the loop terminates, and program execution continues with the statement following the `UNTIL` keyword.</p>

                                <li><strong>Code Optimization:</strong> Compilers often perform optimizations during the translation process, potentially making the code run faster or use fewer resources.</li>
                                <li><strong>Early Error Detection:</strong> The compiler checks the entire source code for syntax errors before execution, catching many errors early.</li>

Works on both sorted and unsorted lists. Time complexity is O(n) in the worst/average case.</li>
                                <li><strong>Binary Search:</strong> Requires the list to be **sorted**. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half. It compares the target value to the middle element; if they don't match, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half. Much faster for large, sorted lists. Time complexity is O(log n).</li>

                            <h5>(a) Pascal Terms</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>I. Compound Statement:</strong> A sequence of zero or more statements enclosed within the keywords `BEGIN` and `END`. It allows multiple statements to be treated as a single unit, typically used within control structures like `IF`, `WHILE`, `FOR`.</li>
                                <li><strong>II. Comment:</strong> Text included in the source code that is ignored by the compiler but provides explanations or annotations for human readers. In Pascal, comments are enclosed in `(* ... *)` or `{ ... }`.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(b) (i) Function of `main()` in C</h5>
                            <p>The `main()` function is the mandatory starting point for execution in every C program. When a C program is run, the operating system calls the `main()` function first. All other functions are typically called directly or indirectly from `main()`. It defines the primary logic and flow of the program.</p>

                            <h5>(b) (ii) Pointer Arithmetic Results</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>I. `ptr++`:</strong> This is the **postfix increment** operator applied to a pointer `ptr`. It increments the pointer to point to the *next memory location* appropriate for the data type it points to (e.g., moves forward by `sizeof(datatype)` bytes). The value of the expression `ptr++` itself is the *original* address stored in `ptr` *before* the increment.</li>
                                <li><strong>II. `ptr--`:</strong> This is the **postfix decrement** operator applied to a pointer `ptr`. It decrements the pointer to point to the *previous memory location* appropriate for the data type it points to (e.g., moves backward by `sizeof(datatype)` bytes). The value of the expression `ptr--` itself is the *original* address stored in `ptr` *before* the decrement.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(c) Errors in C Program Segment</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Missing Header:</strong> Standard library functions (like potentially `printf` if it were used) require including header files (e.g., `#include <stdio.h>`). The comment suggests it was intended but missing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Incorrect Type:</strong> `integer` is not a standard C keyword for declaring integer types; it should be `int`.</li>
                                <li><strong>Undeclared/Uninitialized Variable `n`:</strong> The loop condition `i<n` uses a variable `n` which is declared but never given a value, leading to undefined behavior.</li>
                                <li><strong>Missing Loop Body:</strong> The `for` loop has an empty body (just a semicolon `;` on line 648 in the corrected interpretation, or completely missing in the original OCR). While syntactically allowed, it likely indicates a logical error or incomplete code.</li>
                                <li><strong>(Potential) Undeclared `j`, `y`:</strong> The commented-out line `int i, j, y;` suggests `j` and `y` might have been intended but were removed or not used in the final loop structure shown. If they were meant to be used, they are undeclared in the current scope.</li>
                            </ol>
                            *(Identified more than four potential issues based on standard C and context)*

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>I. Endless Loop (Infinite Loop):</strong> A loop whose condition for termination is never met, causing it to execute indefinitely until manually interrupted or the program runs out of resources. Often caused by logical errors in the loop's condition or update statement.</li>
                                <li><strong>II. Nested Loop:</strong> A loop structure where one loop is placed inside the body of another loop. The inner loop executes completely for each single iteration of the outer loop. Used for tasks involving multi-dimensional data or repetitive actions within repetitions.</li>
                                <li><strong>III. Branching Loop:</strong> This is not standard terminology. It likely refers to a loop that contains branching statements like `if-else` or `switch` within its body, allowing different actions based on conditions during each iteration. Alternatively, it might loosely refer to using `break` or `continue` statements to alter the normal flow of the loop.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(a) (ii) C `switch` Statement Syntax</h5>
                            <pre><code class="language-c">
switch (expression) {
    case constant_expression_1:
        // statements for case 1
        break; // Optional: exits the switch
    case constant_expression_2:
        // statements for case 2
        break;
    // ... more cases
    default: // Optional: executes if no other case matches
        // statements for default case
        break;
}
                            </code></pre>
                            <p>The `expression` must evaluate to an integral type (int, char). Each `case` label must be a unique constant integral value. Execution falls through to the next case if `break` is omitted.</p>

                            <h5>(b) Formal Parameter</h5>
                            <p>A formal parameter is a variable declared in the header (signature) of a function or procedure. It acts as a placeholder that receives a value (or a reference/address) passed from the calling part of the program when the function/procedure is invoked. The actual value/variable passed during the call is called an argument (or actual parameter).</p>
                            <p>Example (Pascal): In `procedure PrintSum(a, b: integer);`, `a` and `b` are formal parameters.</p>

                            <h5>(c) Use of Extreme Data in Testing</h5>
                            <p>Extreme data (also known as boundary value data) is used during program testing to check the program's behavior at the edges or limits of valid input ranges. This is crucial because errors often occur at these boundaries.</p>
                            <p>Circumstances:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Testing conditions right at the minimum or maximum allowed values (e.g., if input must be 1-100, test with 1 and 100).</li>
                                <li>Testing values just inside and just outside the valid range (e.g., test with 0, 1, 100, 101 for the 1-100 range).</li>
                                <li>Testing with empty or null inputs if applicable (e.g., empty string, zero value).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This helps ensure the program handles edge cases correctly and doesn't fail unexpectedly at the limits.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>6% to those members whose shares exceed kshs. 50,000 and have been members for 6 months</li>
                            <li>4% to those members whose shares do not exceed kshs. 50,000 and have been members for 6 months.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Write a pseudo code to represent the program logic. (6 marks)</p>
                        <p>(d) Write a C program to produce the following output. Use for loop.</p>

                            <h5>(a) (i) Index (Program Documentation)</h5>
                            <p>In program documentation (like a user manual or technical reference), an index is an alphabetical list of keywords, topics, function names, or concepts mentioned in the document, along with the page numbers where they can be found. It helps users quickly locate specific information within the documentation.</p>

                            <h5>(a) (ii) Signed vs. Unsigned Integers (C)</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Signed Integers (`int`, `short`, `long`, `long long`):</strong> Can represent both positive and negative whole numbers, plus zero. A portion of the bits (usually the most significant bit) is used to store the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative). This limits the maximum positive value compared to unsigned integers of the same size.</li>
                                <li><strong>Unsigned Integers (`unsigned int`, `unsigned short`, etc.):</strong> Can only represent non-negative whole numbers (zero and positive values). All bits are used to represent the magnitude of the number, allowing them to store larger positive values than their signed counterparts of the same size.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(b) Reasons for Dry Running Procedures with Stack Overflow</h5>
                            <p>A "Stack Overflow" error typically occurs due to excessive function calls, often from infinite or very deep recursion, consuming all available space on the call stack.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Detect Infinite Recursion:</strong> Dry running (manually tracing the execution step-by-step) the procedures suspected of causing the overflow can help identify if a recursive function fails to reach its base case, leading to endless calls that fill the stack.</li>
                                <li><strong>Identify Deep Call Chains:</strong> Tracing the sequence of procedure/function calls can reveal unexpectedly deep nesting or long chains of calls (even without recursion) that might exhaust stack memory, especially if large local variables are declared within those functions.</li>
                            </ol>

                        <div class="answer-content">
                            <h5>(a) (i) Advantages of Quick Sort</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Fast Average Performance:</strong> Generally performs very well on average, with a time complexity of O(n log n), making it one of the fastest comparison-based sorts for typical data.</li>
                                <li><strong>In-Place Sorting (Mostly):</strong> It typically requires only a small, logarithmic amount of auxiliary memory for the recursion stack (O(log n) space), making it memory-efficient compared to sorts like Merge Sort which require O(n) auxiliary space.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(a) (ii) Modulation vs. Demodulation</h5>
                            <p><em>(Note: This topic relates more to data communications than typical structured programming)</em></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Modulation:</strong> The process of varying one or more properties (amplitude, frequency, or phase) of a periodic waveform (the carrier signal) with a modulating signal (typically containing information) to transmit that information. Essentially, encoding information onto a carrier wave suitable for transmission over a medium.</li>
                                <li><strong>Demodulation:</strong> The reverse process of extracting the original information-bearing signal (the modulating signal) from the modulated carrier wave received at the destination.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(b) Justification for Using Data Files</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Data stored in files remains available even after the program terminates, unlike data stored only in RAM (variables), which is lost. This allows data to be saved and reused across multiple program runs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Large Data Volumes:</strong> Files can store much larger amounts of data than can typically fit into the computer's main memory (RAM) at one time.</li>
                                <li><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> Files provide a standard way for different programs or different users to share or exchange data.</li>
                            </ul>
                            *(Any two)*

                            <h5>(c) (i) Advantages of Using Subprograms</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> Breaks down a complex program into smaller, manageable, and logical units, making the code easier to understand, develop, and organize.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Subprograms written for a specific task can be called multiple times from different parts of the program (or even used in other programs), reducing code duplication.</li>
                                <li><strong>Easier Debugging/Testing:</strong> Individual subprograms can be tested and debugged independently, simplifying the process of finding and fixing errors.</li>
                                <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Hides the implementation details of a task behind a simple interface (the subprogram call), allowing programmers to use the functionality without needing to know the specifics of how it works.</li>
                            </ul>
                            *(Any three)*

                            <h5>(c) (ii) Comma Operator in C</h5>
                            <p>The comma operator (`,`) links two or more expressions into a single expression, where the value of the entire comma-separated expression is the value of the rightmost expression. The expressions are evaluated from left to right.</p>
                            <p>It is most commonly used in `for` loops to include multiple initialization or update steps.</p>
                            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                            <pre><code class="language-c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int i, j;
    // Using comma operator in for loop update section
    for (i = 0, j = 10; i < j; i++, j--) {
        printf("i=%d, j=%d\n", i, j);
    }

    // Comma operator in a regular expression
    int x = (printf("Assigning... "), 5); // Prints "Assigning... " and assigns 5 to x
    printf("x = %d\n", x); // Prints x = 5

    return 0;
}
                            </code></pre>
                            <p>In the `for` loop, `i++, j--` are evaluated sequentially in each iteration. In the assignment to `x`, `printf` is executed first, and then `5` is evaluated and becomes the result of the whole expression, which is assigned to `x`.</p>
