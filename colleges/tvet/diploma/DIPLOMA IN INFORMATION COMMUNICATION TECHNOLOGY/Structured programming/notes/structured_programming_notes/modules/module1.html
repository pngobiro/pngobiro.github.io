                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><b>1. HEADER FILE</b> - A header file is a file with extension .h which contains C function declarations
to be shared between several source files. A header file is used in a program by including it with
the use of the preprocessing directive #include, which comes along with the compiler.
#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>
                    <p><b>2. EXPRESSION</b> ‚Äì These are statements that return a value. Expressions combine variables and
constants to create new values or logical conditions which are either true or false e.g.
x + y,
x &lt;= y etc</p>
                    <p><b>3. KEYWORD</b> - A keyword is a reserved word in C. Reserved words may not be used as constants
or variables or any other identifier names. Examples include auto, else, Long, switch, typedef
,break etc</p>
                    <p><b>4. IDENTIFIER</b> - A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-
defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore _ followed by zero
or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9). C does not allow punctuation characters such as
@, $, and % within identifiers.</p>
                    <p><b>5. COMMENT</b> - These are non-executable program statements meant to enhance program
readability and maintenance- they document the program.</p>
                    <p><b>6. FUNCTION</b> - A function is a group of statements, enclosed within curly braces, which together
perform a task.</p>
                    <p><b>7. STATEMENT</b>- Statements are expressions, assignments, function calls, or control flow
statements which make up C programs. Statements are terminated using a semicolon.</p>
                    <p><b>8. SOURCE CODE</b> ‚Äì Program instructions in their original form. C source code files have an
extension .c</p>
                    <p><b>9. OBJECT CODE</b> ‚Äì Code produced by a compiler from source code and exists in machine
readable language.</p>
                    <p><b>10. EXECUTABLE FILE</b> ‚Äì Refers to a file in a format that a computer can directly execute and is
created by a compiler.</p>
                    <p><b>11. STANDARD LIBRARY</b> ‚Äì Refers to a collection of precompiled functions/routines that a
program can use. The routines are stored in object format and contain descriptions of functions to
perform I/O, string manipulations, mathematics etc.</p>
                    <p><b>12. SIGNED INTEGER</b> ‚Äì This is an integer that can hold either positive or negative numbers.</p>
                    <p><b>13. COMPILER</b> ‚Äì This is a program that translates source code into object code.</p>
                    <p><b>14. PREPROCESSOR COMMAND</b> - The C preprocessor modifies a source file before handing it
over to the compiler for instance by including header files with #include as I #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>
                    <p><b>15. LINKER/Binder/Link Editor</b> ‚Äì This is a program that combines object modules to form an
executable program. The linker combines the object code, the start up code and the code for</p>

file.</p>
                    <p><b>16. OPERATOR</b> - A symbol that represents a specific action. For example, a plus sign (+) is an
operator that represents addition. The basic mathematic operators are + addition, - subtraction,*
multiplication,/ division</p>
                    <p><b>17. OPERAND</b> - Operands are the objects that are manipulated by operators in expressions. For
example, in the expression 5 + x, x and 5 are operands and + is an operator. All expressions have
at least one operand.</p>
                    <p><b>18. EXPRESSION</b> ‚Äì This is a statement that returns a value. For example, when you add two
numbers together or test to see whether one value is equal to another.</p>
                    <p><b>19. VARIABLE</b> - A variable is a memory location whose value can change during program
execution. Variable declaration must have a type, which defines what values that variable can
hold.</p>
                    <p><b>20. Data type</b> ‚Äì The data type of a variable etc determines the size and layout of the variable's
memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that
can be applied to the variable.</p>
                    <p><b>21. CONSTANT</b> - a constant is a value that never changes during program execution.</p>
                    <p><b>22. WHITESPACE</b> - A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a
blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments.
Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify
where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the
following statement:</p>
                    <p>int age;</p>
                    <p>There must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the
compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement</p>

                <h2>üìö HISTORY OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><b>First-Generation Programming Languages ‚Äì Machine Language</b></p>
                    <p>A first-generation of programming languages includes machine-level programming languages.
These languages were introduced in the 1940s and had the following characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Instructions were entered directly in binary format (1s and 0s) and therefore they were
tedious and error prone. Programmers had to design their code by hand then transfer it to a
computer using a punch card, punch tape or flicking switches.</li>
                        <li>Instructions were executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU) i.e. they
were executed very fast.</li>
                        <li>Memory management was done manually.</li>
                        <li>Programs were very difficult to edit and debug.</li>
                        <li>Used to code simple programs only.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Second-Generation Programming Languages (2GL) ‚Äì Low Level Programming
Languages/Assembly Languages</b></p>
                    <p>They were introduced to mitigate the error prone and excessively difficult nature of binary
programming.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduced in the 1950s</li>
                        <li>Improved on first generation by providing human readable source code which must be
compiled/assembled into machine code (binary instructions) before it can be executed by
a CPU</li>
                        <li>Specific to platform architecture i.e. 2GL source code is not portable across processors
or processing environments.</li>
                        <li>Designed to support logical structure and debugging.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By using codes resembling English, programming becomes much easier. The use of these
mnemonic codes such as <code>LDA</code> for load and <code>STA</code> for store means the code is easier to read and write.
To convert an assembly code program into object code to run on a computer requires an <b>Assembler</b>
and each line of assembly can be replaced by the equivalent one line of object (machine) code:</p>
                    <p><b>Assembly Code Machine Code</b></p>
                    <p>LDA A 000100110100</p>
                    <p>ADD #5 001000000101</p>
                    <p>Assembler</p>
                    <p>STA A 001100110100</p>
                    <p>JMP #3 010000000011</p>
                    <p>Such languages are sometimes still used for kernels and device drivers, i.e. the core of the operating
system and for specific machine parts. More often, such languages are used in areas of intense
processing, like graphics programming, when the code needs to be optimized for performance.</p>
                    <p>Almost every CPU architecture has a companion assembly language. Most commonly used are the
assembly languages today like Autocoder for IBM mainframe systems, Linoreum, MACRO -11,etc.</p>
                    <p><b>Third-Generation Languages (3GL) ‚Äì High-Level Languages</b></p>
                    <p>Third generation languages are the primary languages used in general purpose programming today.
They each vary quite widely in terms of their particular abstractions and syntax. However, they all
share great enhancements in logical structure over assembly languages.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduced in the 1950s</li>
                        <li>Designed around ease of use for the programmer (Programmer friendly)</li>
                        <li>Driven by desire for reduction in bugs, increases in code reuse</li>
                        <li>Based on natural language</li>
                        <li>Often designed with structured programming in mind</li>
                        <li>The languages are architecture independent e.g. C, Java etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Examples:</p>
                    <p>Most Modern General Purpose Languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, Basic, COBOL, Lisp and ML.</p>
                    <p><b>Fourth Generation Languages</b></p>
                    <p>Fourth-generation programming languages are high-level languages built around database systems.
They are generally used in commercial environments.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improves on 3GL and their development methods with higher abstraction and statement
power, to reduce errors and increase development speed by reducing programming
effort. They result in a reduction in the cost of software development.</li>
                        <li>A 4GL is designed with a specific purpose in mind. For example languages to query
databases (SQL), languages to make reports (Oracle Reports) etc.</li>
                        <li>4GL are more oriented towards problem solving and systems engineering.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Examples: Progress 4GL, PL/SQL, Oracle Reports, Revolution language, SAS, SPSS, SQ</p>
                    <p><b>Fifth Generation Languages</b></p>
                    <p>Improves on the previous generations by skipping algorithm writing and instead provide
constraints/conditions.</p>

                <h2>üìö PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>A programming paradigm is a fundamental style of computer programming, a way of building the
structure and elements of computer programs. There are four main paradigms:</p>
                    <p><b>a) Unstructured Programming</b></p>
                    <p>In unstructured programs, the statements are executed in sequence (one after the other) as written.
This type of programming uses the GoTo statement which allows control to be passed to any other
section in the program. When a GoTo statement is executed, the sequence continues from the target
of the GoTo. Thus, to understand how a program works, you have to execute it. This often makes it
difficult to understand the logic of such a program.</p>
                    <p><b>b) Structured Programming</b></p>
                    <p>The approach was developed as a solution to the challenges posed by unstructured/procedural
programming. Structured programming frequently employs a <b>top-down design model</b>, in which
developers break the overall program structure into separate subsections. A defined function or
set of similar functions is coded in a separate module or sub-module, which means that <b>code can be
loaded into memory more efficiently</b> and that <b>modules can be reused in other programs</b>. After
a module has been tested individually, it is then integrated with other modules into the overall
program structure.</p>
                     <figure class="content-image">
                        <img src="../assets/images/placeholder-600x300.jpg"
                             alt="Placeholder Image for Programming Paradigms"
                             width="600" height="300">
                        <figcaption>Different Programming Paradigms</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Program flow follows a simple hierarchical model that employs looping constructs such as "for,"
"repeat," and "while." Use of the "GoTo" statement is discouraged.</p>
                    <p>Most programs will require thousands or millions of lines of code. (Windows 2000 ‚Äì over 35
millions lines of code). The importance of splitting a problem into a series of self-contained
modules then becomes obvious. A module should not exceed 100 lines, and preferably short enough
to fit on a single page or screen.</p>
                    <p>Examples of structured programming languages include:</p>
                    <p>C</p>
                    <p>Pascal</p>
                    <p>Fortran</p>
                    <p>Cobol</p>
                    <p>ALGOL</p>
                    <p>Ada</p>
                    <p>dBASE etc.</p>
                    <p><b>c) Object-oriented programming (OOP)</b></p>
                    <p>This is a programming paradigm that represents concepts as "objects" that have data fields
(attributes that describe the object) and associated procedures known as methods. Objects, which
are usually instances of classes, are used to interact with one another to design applications and
computer programs.</p>
                    <p><b>d) Visual Programming</b></p>
                    <p>A visual programming language uses a visual representation (such as graphics, drawings, animation
or icons, partially or completely). A visual language manipulates visual information or supports
visual interaction, or allows programming with visual expressions</p>
                    <p>A VPL allows programming with visual expressions, spatial arrangements of text and graphic
symbols, used either as elements of syntax or secondary notation. For example, many VPLs (known
as dataflow or diagrammatic programming) are based on the idea of "boxes and arrows", where
boxes or other screen objects are treated as entities, connected by arrows, lines or arcs which
represent relations. An example of visual programming languages is Microsoft Visual Basic which
was derived from BASIC and enables the rapid application development (RAD) of graphical user
interface (GUI) applications.</p>
                    <p>Programming in VB is a combination of visually arranging components or controls on a form,
specifying attributes and actions for those components, and writing additional lines of code for
more functionality.</p>
                    <p><b>e) Internet Based Programming</b></p>
                    <p>This is programming oriented to the development of internet applications using languages and tools
such as PHP, ASP, Perl, JavaScript, HTML, Java etc.</p>
