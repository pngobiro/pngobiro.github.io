                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>A <b>sub-program</b> is a series of C statements that perform a specific task in a program. A
subprogram can be called within another procedure. Every C program has at least one
function, which is <code>main()</code>. A C program can be divided up into separate functions.</p>
                    <p>A <b>function declaration</b> tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and
parameters. A <b>function definition</b> provides the actual body of the function.</p>
                    <p>The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can
call. For example, function <code>strcat()</code> to concatenate two strings, function <code>memcpy()</code> to
copy one memory location to another location and many more functions.</p>
                    <p>A function is known with various names like a method or a sub-routine or a
procedure, etc. However, a <b>function</b> returns a value while a <b>procedure</b> doesn't: it just
executes commands.</p>
                    <p><b>A Subprogram is:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a part of a program that performs one or more related tasks</li>
                        <li>has its own name</li>
                        <li>written as an independent part of the program</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Benefits of using sub-procedures in programming are:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sub-programs help to break programs into several but logical sections. The
smaller programs/routines make <b>programming</b>, <b>debugging</b> and subsequent
<b>maintenance</b> easier.</li>
                        <li>They also help in <b>coding repeated operations</b> such as frequently used
calculations, text etc thus making programming less repetitive and faster.</li>
                        <li>Procedures used in one program can act as building blocks for other programs
with slight modifications i.e. <b>code re-use</b>.</li>
                        <li>Programmers working on large projects can divide the workload by making
different functions.</li>

                <h2>üìö TYPES OF FUNCTIONS</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Basically, there are two types of functions in C on basis of whether it is defined by
user or not.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Library function</b></li>
                        <li><b>User defined function</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>LIBRARY FUNCTION</b></p>
                    <p>Library functions are the in-built function in C programming system. For example:</p>
                    <pre><code>printf()
- printf() is used for displaying output in C.

scanf()
- scanf() is used for taking input in C.
</code></pre>
                    <p><b>USER DEFINED FUNCTION</b></p>
                    <p>C allows programmers to define their own function according to their requirements
known as user defined functions.</p>
                    <p><b>How user-defined function works in C Programming?</b></p>
                     <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
void function_name() {
}

int main(){
    function_name();
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>As mentioned earlier, every C program begins from <code>main()</code> and program starts
executing the codes inside <code>main ()</code> function. When the control of program reaches to
<code>function_name()</code> inside <code>main ()</code> function. The control of program jumps to <code>void
function_name()</code> and executes the codes inside it. When, all the codes inside that
user-defined function are executed, control of the program jumps to the statement just
after <code>function_name()</code> from where it is called. Analyze the figure below for
understanding the concept of function in C programming.</p>

                <h2>üìö DEFINING A FUNCTION</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows:</p>
                     <pre><code>return_type function_name ( parameter list )
{
    body of the function
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>A <b>function definition</b> in C programming language consists of a <b>function header</b> and a
<b>function body</b>. Here are all the parts of a function:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Return Type:</b> A function may return a value. The <b>return_type</b> is the data type of
the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations
without returning a value. In this case, the <b>return_type</b> is the keyword <code>void</code>.</li>
                        <li><b>Function Name:</b> This is the actual name of the function. The function name and
the parameter list together constitute the <b>function signature</b>.</li>
                        <li><b>Parameters:</b> A <b>parameter</b> is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you
pass a value to the formal parameter. This value is referred to as <b>actual
parameter</b> or <b>argument</b>. The <b>parameter list</b> refers to the type, order, and
number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function
may contain no parameters.</li>
                        <li><b>Function Body:</b> The function body contains a collection of statements that define
what the function does.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><b>Example</b></p>
                    <p>Following is the source code for a function called <code>max()</code>. This function takes two
parameters <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code> and returns the maximum between the two:</p>
                     <pre><code>/* function returning the max between two numbers */
int max(int num1, int num2)
{
    /* local variable declaration */
    int result;

    if (num1 > num2)
        result = num1;
    else
        result = num2;

    return result;
}
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </section>

                <h2>üìö FUNCTION DECLARATIONS</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>A <b>function declaration</b> tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the
function. The actual <b>body of the function</b> can be defined separately.</p>
                    <p>A function declaration has the following parts:</p>
                     <pre><code>return_type function_name( parameter list );
</code></pre>
                    <p>For the above defined function <code>max()</code>, following is the function declaration:</p>
                     <pre><code>int max(int num1, int num2);
</code></pre>
                    <p>Parameter names are not important in function declaration; only their type is required,
so the following is also valid declaration:</p>
                     <pre><code>int max(int, int);
</code></pre>
                    <p>Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you
call that function in another file. In such case you should declare the function at the
top of the file calling the function.</p>

                <h2>üìö CALLING A FUNCTION</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To
use a function, you will have to <b>call</b> that function to perform the defined task.</p>
                    <p>When a program calls a function, program control is transferred to the called function.
A called function performs defined task, and when its <code>return</code> statement is executed or
when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns program control back to
the main program. Therefore, the calling program is <b>suspended</b> during execution of
the called subprogram.</p>
                    <p>To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with
function name, and if function returns a value, then you can store returned value. For
example:</p>
                     <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* function declaration */
int max(int num1, int num2);

int main ()
{
    /* local variable definition */
    int a = 100;
    int b = 200;
    int ret;

    /* calling a function to get max value */
    ret = max(a, b);

    printf( "Max value is : %d\\n", ret );

    return 0;
}

/* function returning the max between two numbers */
int max(int num1, int num2)
{
    /* local variable declaration */
    int result;

    if (num1 > num2)
        result = numl;
    else
        result = num2;

    return result;
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>The <b>formal parameters</b> behave like other local variables inside the function and are
created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.</p>
                    <p>While calling a function, there are two ways that arguments can be passed to a
function:</p>
                     <table>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>
                                <th>Call Type</th>
                                <th>Description</th>
                            </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td><b>Call by value</b></td>
                                <td>This method copies the actual value of an argument into the
formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes
made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on
the argument.</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td><b>Call by reference</b></td>
                                <td>This method copies the address of an argument into the
formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to
access the actual argument used in the call. This means that
changes made to the parameter affect the argument.</td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <p>By default, C uses <b>call by value</b> to pass arguments. In general, this means that code
within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function and above
mentioned example while calling <code>max()</code> function used the same method.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>These refer to groups of data elements that are organized in a single unit so that
they can be used more efficiently as compared to the simple data types such as
integers and strings. An example of a data structure is the <b>array</b>. Ordinary variables
store one value at a time while an array will store more than one value at a time in a
single variable name.</p>
                    <p>Data structures are important for grouping sets of similar data together and passing
them as one. For example, if you have a method that prints a set of data but you don't
know when writing the procedure how large that set is going to be, you could use an
array to pass the data to that method and loop through it.</p>
                    <p>Data structures can be classified using various criteria.</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><b>Linear</b>
                            <p>In linear data structures, values are arranged in linear fashion. A linear data structure
traverses the data elements sequentially. The elements in the structure are adjacent to
one another other and every element has exactly two neighbour elements to which it is
connected. Arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues are examples of linear data
structures.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Non-Linear</b>
                            <p>The data values in this structure are not arranged in order but every data item is
attached to several other data items in a way that is specific for reflecting
relationships. Tree, graph, table and sets are examples of non-linear data structures.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Homogenous</b>
                            <p>In this type of data structures, values of the same types of data are stored, as in an
array.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Non-homogenous</b>
                            <p>In this type of data structures, data values of different types are grouped, as in

                    <p>An <b>array</b> is a named list of elements, all with the same data type. It is better defined as
a consecutive group of memory locations all of which have the same name and the
same data type. Arrays store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same
type.</p>
                    <p>Instead of declaring individual variables, such as <code>number0</code>, <code>number1</code>, ..., and
<code>number99</code>, you declare one array variable such as <code>numbers</code> and use <code>numbers[0]</code>,
<code>numbers[1]</code>, and ..., <code>numbers[99]</code> to represent individual variables. A specific element
in an array is accessed by an <b>index</b>.</p>
                    <p>All arrays consist of <b>contiguous memory locations</b>. The lowest address corresponds to
the first element and the highest address to the last element.</p>

                <h2>üìö DECLARING ARRAYS</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>To declare an <b>array</b> in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the
number of elements required by an array as follows:</p>
                     <pre><code>type arrayName [ arraySize ];
</code></pre>
                    <p>This is called a <b>single-dimensional array</b>. The <b>arraySize</b> must be an integer constant
greater than zero and <b>type</b> can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-
element array called <code>balance</code> of type <code>double</code>, use this statement:</p>
                     <pre><code>double balance[10];
</code></pre>
                    <p>Now <code>balance</code> is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.</p>

                <h2>üìö INITIALIZING ARRAYS</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>You can <b>initialize</b> an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as
follows:</p>
                     <pre><code>double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 17.0, 50.0};
</code></pre>
                    <p>The number of values between braces <code>{ }</code> can not be larger than the number of
elements that we declare for the array between square brackets <code>[ ]</code>. Following is an
example to assign a single element of the array:</p>
                    <p>If you omit the <b>size of the array</b>, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is
created. Therefore, if you write:</p>
                     <pre><code>double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 17.0, 50.0};
</code></pre>
                    <p>You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example.</p>
                     <pre><code>balance [4] = 50.0;
</code></pre>
                    <p>The above statement assigns element number 5th in the array a value of 50.0. Array
with 4th index will be 5th ie. last element because all arrays have 0 as the index of
their first element which is also called <b>base index</b>. Following is the pictorial
representation of the same array we discussed above:</p>

                <h2>üìö ACCESSING ARRAY ELEMENTS</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>An <b>element</b> is accessed by <b>indexing</b> the array name. This is done by placing the index
of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example:</p>
                     <pre><code>double salary = balance[9];
</code></pre>
                    <p>The above statement will take 10th element from the array and assign the value to
<code>salary</code> variable. Following is an example which will use all the above mentioned three
concepts viz. declaration, assignment and accessing arrays:</p>
                     <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main ()
{
    int n[ 10 ]; /* n is an array of 10 integers */
    int i,j;

    /* initialize elements of array n to 0 */
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++ )
    {
        n[ i ] = i + 100; /* set element at location i to i
                           + 100 */
    }

    /* output each array element's value */
    for (j = 0; j < 10; j++ )
    {
        printf("Element[%d] = %d\\n", j, n[j] );
    }
    return 0;
}

                    <p>In the <b>bubble sort</b>, as elements are sorted they gradually "bubble" (or rise) to their
proper location in the array, like bubbles rising in a glass of soda. The bubble sort
repeatedly compares <b>adjacent elements</b> of an array. The first and second elements
are compared and swapped if out of order. Then the second and third elements are
compared and swapped if out of order. This sorting process continues until the last
two elements of the array are compared and swapped if out of order.</p>
