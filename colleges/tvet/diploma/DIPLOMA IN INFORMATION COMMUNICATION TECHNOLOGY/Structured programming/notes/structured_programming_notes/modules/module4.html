                    <p>An <b>executable file</b> is a file containing ready to run machine code. C accomplishes this in two
steps.</p>

                        <li><b>Compiling</b>-The compiler converts the source code to produce the intermediate <b>object code</b>.</li>
                        <li>The <b>linker</b> combines the intermediate code with other code to produce the executable file.
You can compile individual modules and then combine modules later.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Linking</b> is the process where the object code, the start up code and the code for library routines
used in the program (all in machine language) are combined into a single file- the executable file.</p>

                    <p><b>NB/ An interpreter</b> unlike a compiler is a computer program that directly executes,
i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming, without previously compiling
them into a machine language program.</p>
                    <p>If the compiled program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is
different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is known as a <b>cross-
compiler</b>.</p>
                    <p>A program that translates from a low level language to a higher level one is a
<b>decompiler</b>.</p>
                    <p>A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a <b>source-

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>There is a minimal set of library functions that should be supplied by all C compilers, which your
program may use. This collection of functions is called the <b>C standard library</b>. The standard library
contains functions to perform disk I/O (input/ output), string manipulations, mathematics and much
more. When your program is compiled, the code for library functions is automatically added to your
program. One of the most common library functions is called <code>printf()</code> which is a general purpose
output function. The quoted string between the parenthesis of the <code>printf()</code> function is called an
argument.</p>
                    <pre><code>Printf(‚ÄúThis is a C program\\n‚Äù)

                    <p>The <code>\n</code> at the end of the text is an <b>escape sequence</b> tells the program to print a new line as part of
the output.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>In the C programming language, data types refer to a system used for declaring variables or
functions of different types. A <b>data type is</b>, therefore, a <b>data storage format</b> that can contain a
specific type or range of values. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in
storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.</p>
                    <p>The basic data types in C are as follows:</p>
                    <table>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>

                <h2>üìö USING C'S DATA TYPE MODIFIERS</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The five basic types (int, float, char,double and void) can be modified to your specific need using
the following specifiers.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Signed</b>
                            <p>Signed Data Modifier implies that the data type variable can store positive values as well as
negative values.</p>
                            <p>The use of the modifier with integers is redundant because the default integer declaration
assumes a signed number. The signed modifier is used with char to create a small signed
integer. Specified as signed, a char can hold numbers in the range -128 to 127.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Unsigned</b>
                            <p>If we need to change the data type so that it can only store positive values, "unsigned" data
modifier is used.</p>
                            <p>This can be applied to char and int. When char is unsigned, it can hold positive numbers in
the range 0 to 255.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Long</b>
                            <p>Sometimes while coding a program, we need to increase the Storage Capacity of a variable
so that it can store values higher than its maximum limit which is there as default.</p>
                            <p>This can be applied to both int and double. When applied to int, it doubles its length, in
bits, of the base type that it modifies. For example, an integer is usually 16 bits long.
Therefore a <b>long int</b> is 32 bits in length. When long is applied to a double, it roughly
doubles the precision.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Short</b>
                            <p>A "short" type modifier does just the opposite of ‚Äúlong‚Äù. If one is not expecting to see high
range values in a program.</p>
                            <p>For example, if we need to store the "age" of a student in a variable, we will make use of
this type qualifier as we are aware that this value is not going to be very high</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The type modifier precedes the type name. For example this declares a <b>long integer</b>.</p>
                    <pre><code>long int age;
</code></pre>

                    <p>Declaring a variable tells the compiler to reserve space in memory for that particular variable. A
<b>variable definition</b> specifies a data type and the variable name and contains a list of one or more
variables of that type .Variables can be declared at the start of any block of code. A declaration
begins with the <b>type</b>, followed by the name of one or more variables. For example,</p>
                    <pre><code>Int high, low;
int  i, j, k;
char c, ch;
float f, salary;

                    <p>Variables can be initialized when they are declared. This is done by adding an equals sign and the
required value after the declaration.</p>
                    <pre><code>Int high = 250;    /*Maximum Temperature*/

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The Programming language C has two main variable types :</p>

                    <p>A local variable is a variable that is declared inside a function.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Local variables scope is confined within the block or function where it is defined. Local
variables must always be defined at the top of a block.</li>
                        <li>When execution of the block starts the variable is available, and when the block ends the
variable 'dies'.</li>

                    <p>Global variable is defined at the top of the program file and it can be visible and modified by any
function that may reference it. Global variables are declared outside <b>all</b> functions.</p>

                    <p>Every variable has a name and a value. The name identifies the variable and the value stores data.
Every variable name in C must start with a letter; the rest of the name can consist of letters,
numbers and underscore characters. C is case sensitive i.e. it recognizes upper and lower case
characters as being different. You cannot use any of C's keywords like main, while, switch etc as
variable names,</p>
                    <p>Examples of legal variable names:</p>
                    <pre><code>X    result    outfile    x1    out_file    etc
</code></pre>
                    <p>It is conventional in C not to use capital letters in variable names. These are used for names of
constants.</p>

declaration for something in order to compile a file into an object file, expecting that the linker can
find the definition from another file. If no source file ever defines a symbol, but it is declared, you
will get errors at link time complaining about undefined symbols. In the following short code, the
definition of variable x means that the storage for the variable is that it is a global variable.</p>

                    <p>Variables can also be initialized during program execution (run time). The <code>scanf()</code> function is used
to read values from the keyboard. For example, to read an integer value use the following general

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><b>Type casting</b> is a way to convert a variable from one data type to another. For example, if you want
to store a long value into a simple integer then you can type cast long to int. You can convert values
from one type to another explicitly using the <b>cast operator</b> as follows:</p>
                    <pre><code>(type_name) expression
</code></pre>
                    <p>Consider the following example where the cast operator causes the division of one integer variable
by another to be performed as a floating-point operation:</p>
                    <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main()
{
    int sum = 17, count = 5;
    double mean;

    mean =  (double) sum / count;
    printf("Value of mean is %d \\n", mean );
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
                    <pre><code>Value of mean : 3.400000
</code></pre>
                    <p>It should be noted here that the cast operator has precedence over division, so the value of <code>sum</code> is
first converted to type <code>double</code> and finally it gets divided by <code>count</code> yielding a double value.</p>
                    <p>Type conversions can be <b>implicit</b> which is performed by the compiler automatically, or it can be
specified <b>explicitly</b> through the use of the <b>cast operator</b>. It is considered good programming
practice to use the cast operator whenever type conversions are necessary.</p>
