                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>This refers to the stages that form the framework for planning and controlling the creation of an
information system. Several approaches to program development have been devised and the System
Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is one of the most popular. The SDLC is a methodology that
aims at producing a high quality system that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches
completion within times and cost estimates, works efficiently and is inexpensive to maintain
and cost-effective to enhance.</p>
                    <p><b>1) Project planning, feasibility study:</b> The fundamental process of understanding why a
system should be built and determining how the project team will go about building it. It
should also establish a clear understanding of the current system. It involves</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><b>Technical feasibility study:</b> can the system be built</li>
                        <li><b>Economic feasibility study:</b> will the system provide business value, and what are the
risks?</li>
                        <li><b>Organizational feasibility study:</b> if built, will it be used.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><b>2) Systems analysis, requirements definition:</b> the phase identifies the users of the system,
what the system will do. It involves</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><b>Analysis of the old system</b> and ways to design the new system</li>
                        <li><b>Requirement gathering</b>. Various tools for collecting information are used. These
include interviews, questionnaires, observation etc.</li>
                        <li><b>Development of the new system proposal document.</b></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><b>3) Systems design:</b> describes how the system will operate, in terms of hardware, software,
network infrastructure, user interface, forms and reports that will be used, the specific
programs, databases and files that will be needed. Design phase steps include;</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><b>Design strategy:</b> method of development, in-house, outsourced, or purchased</li>

will do.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><b>4) System Implementation:</b> The real code is written here.</p>
                    <p><b>5) Integration and testing:</b> Brings all the pieces of the project together into a special testing
environment, then checks for errors, bugs and interoperability.</p>
                    <p><b>6) Acceptance, installation, deployment:</b> The final stage of initial development, where the
software is put into use and runs actual business.</p>
                    <p><b>7) Maintenance:</b> What happens during the rest of the software's life: changes, correction,
additions, and moves to a different computing platforms etc. This step, perhaps most
important of all, goes on seemingly forever.</p>
                    <p>The SDLC is a cycle i.e. iterative in that a new requirement might initiate the whole process
again.</p>

                <h2>üìö STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING DESIGN CONCEPTS</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><b>1. TOP-DOWN DESIGN</b></p>
                    <p>A <b>top-down approach</b> (also known as <b>stepwise design</b> or <b>deductive reasoning</b>, and in many cases
used as a synonym of analysis or decomposition) is essentially the breaking down of a system to
gain insight into its compositional sub-systems. In a top-down approach an overview of the system
is formulated, specifying but not detailing any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then
refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire
specification is reduced to base elements. Top- down approach starts with the big picture. It breaks
down from there into smaller segments.</p>
                    <p><b>Top-down design</b> (also called " <b>Modular programming</b> " and "<b>stepwise refinement</b>") therefore, is
a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into
independent modules such that each module is designed to execute only one aspect of the desired
functionality.</p>
                    <p><b>ADVANTAGES OF MODULAR PROGRAMMING</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allows a problem to be split in stages and for a team of programmers to work on the
different modules thereby reducing program development time.</li>
                        <li>Program modification and debugging is easier since changes can be isolated to specific
modules.</li>
                        <li>Modules can be tested and debugged independently.</li>
                        <li>Since a module performs a specific and well defined task, it is possible to develop and place
commonly used modules in a user library so that they can be accessed by different
programs. This is also called code reuse. (E.g. Validation, Uppercase, Text color etc.)</li>
                        <li>If a programmer cannot continue through the entire project, it is easier for another
programmer to continue working on self-contained modules.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>2. BOTTOM-UP DESIGN</b></p>
                    <p>A <b>bottom-up approach</b> (also known as <b>inductive reasoning</b>, and in many cases used as a synonym
of synthesis) is the piecing together of systems to give rise to larger systems, thus making the
original systems sub-systems of the emergent system. In a bottom-up approach the individual base
elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to
form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete
top-level system is formed.</p>
                    <p>With this approach, there is more user and business awareness of the product. Benefits are
also realized in the early phases of development.</p>
                    <p><b>3. MONOLITHIC DESIGN</b></p>
                    <p>The monolithic design philosophy is that the application is responsible not just for a particular task,
but can perform every step needed to complete a particular function</p>
                    <p>A monolithic application describes a software application which is designed without modularity.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><b>1. Pseudo-code</b></p>
                    <p><b>Pseudo-code</b> is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program
or other algorithm and is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. Pseudo-code is a
way to describe the algorithm in order to transform the algorithm into real source code.</p>
                    <p>For example, the Pseudo-code for comparing three numbers might be written:</p>
                    <p>Begin</p>
                    <p>If A is greater than B</p>
                    <p>And if A is greater than C, A is the Biggest</p>
                    <p>Otherwise C is the Biggest</p>
                    <p>Otherwise</p>
                    <p>If B is greater than C B is the Biggest</p>
                    <p>Otherwise C is the Biggest</p>
                    <p>End</p>
                    <p>Pseudo-code cannot be compiled nor executed, and there are no real formatting or syntax rules. It is
simply one step - an important one - in producing the final code</p>
                    <p><b>2. Algorithm</b></p>
                    <p>This refers to an established, computational procedure for solving a problem in a finite number of
steps. Algorithms can be expressed in any language including natural languages such as English.
Algorithm means a method/ logic for solving a given problem.</p>
                    <p><b>An algorithm to find the largest among three different numbers entered by user.</b></p>
                    <p>Step 1: Start</p>
                    <p>Step 2: Declare variables a, b and c.</p>
                    <p>Step 3: Read variables a, b and c.</p>
                    <p>Step 4: If a&gt;b</p>
                    <p>If a&gt;c</p>
                    <p>Display a is the largest number.</p>
                    <p>Else</p>
                    <p>Display c is the largest number.</p>
                    <p>Else</p>
                    <p>If b&gt;c</p>
                    <p>Display b is the largest number.</p>
                    <p>Else</p>
                    <p>Display c is the greatest number.</p>
                    <p>Step 5: Stop</p>
                    <p><b>3. Flowchart</b></p>
                    <p>A <b>flowchart</b> is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm or process, showing the steps as
boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows. This diagrammatic
representation illustrates a solution to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in designing and
documenting complex processes or programs. Like other types of diagrams, they help to visualize
what is going on and thereby help the viewer to understand a process, and perhaps also find
flaws/errors, bottlenecks, and other less-obvious features within it.</p>
                    <p><b>SYMBOLS USED IN FLOWCHART</b></p>
                    <p>Different symbols are used for different states in flowcharts. The table below describes all the
symbols that are used in making flowchart</p>

                    <p><b>STRUCTURE CHARTS (module chart, hierarchy chart)</b></p>
                    <p>A <b>structure chart</b> is a top-down modular design tool, constructed of squares representing the
different modules in the system, and lines that connect them. A structure chart is a graphic depiction
of the decomposition of a problem. It is a tool to aid in software design but is particularly helpful on
large problems.</p>
                    <p>A structure chart illustrates the partitioning of a problem into sub-problems and shows the
hierarchical relationships among the parts. A classic "organization chart" for a company is an
example of a structure chart.</p>
                    <p>The top of the chart is a box representing the entire problem, the bottom of the chart shows a
number of boxes representing the less complicated sub-problems (e.g. Phone Bill System).</p>
                    <p>A structure chart is NOT a flowchart. It has nothing to do with the logical sequence of tasks. It does

                    <p><b>Decision tables</b> provide a handy and compact way to represent complex business logic. In a
decision table, business logic is well divided into <b>conditions</b>, <b>actions</b> (decisions) and <b>rules</b> for
representing the various components that form the business logic.</p>
                    <p>There is one row for each condition and each vertical column for each combination of values and
resulting actions. <b>Conditions</b> are the factors to consider when making certain business decision.
<b>Actions</b> are the possible actions to take when certain business decision is made.</p>
                    <p>Each vertical column of a decision table is called a <b>rule</b> and each rule symbolizes the combinations
of condition(s) and action(s) that form the business decision. If constructed properly, the decision</p>
