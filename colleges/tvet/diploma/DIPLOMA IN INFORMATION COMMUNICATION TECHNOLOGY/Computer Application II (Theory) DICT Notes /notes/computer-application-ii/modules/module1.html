<h2>Fundamentals of accounting</h2>
<h3>Definition of accounting</h3>
<p>It is a systematic process of identifying, recording, measuring, classifying, verifying, summarizing,
interpreting and communicating financial information. It reveals profit or loss for a given period, and the
value and nature of a firm's assets, liabilities and owners' equity. Accounting provides information on
the.</p>

<h3>Basic Accounting Principles</h3>
<p>Accounting assumptions and principles provide the bases in preparing, presenting and
interpreting general-purpose financial statements.</p>

<p>The basic principles that accountants follow include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Accrual ‚Äì Income is recognized when earned regardless of when collected, and expenses are
  recognized when incurred regardless of when paid.</li>
  <li>Going Concern ‚Äì Also known as continuing concern concept or continuity assumption, it means
  that a business entity will continue to operate indefinitely.</li>
  <li>Accounting Entity Concept ‚Äì A specific business enterprise is treated as one accounting entity,
  separate and distinct from its owners.</li>
  <li>Time Period Assumption ‚Äì The indefinite life of an enterprise is subdivided into time periods or
  accounting periods which are usually of equal length for the purpose of preparing financial
  reports.</li>
  <li>Monetary Unit Assumption ‚Äì Transactions are recorded in terms of money (quantifiability). The
  currency used has a stable purchasing power (stability).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Elements of Accounting</h3>
<p>The elements of accounting pertain to assets, liabilities, and capital. Assets are resources owned
by a company; liabilities are obligations to creditors and lenders; and capital refers to the interest
of the owners in the business after deducting all liabilities from all assets (or, what is left for the
owners after all company obligations are paid).</p>
<p><b>Assets:</b> Assets can be classified as current or non-current. An asset is considered current if it is for sale,
if it can be realized within 12 month from the end of the accounting period or within the company's
normal operating cycle if it exceeds 12 months. In addition, cash is generally considered current asset.</p>

<p>Current assets include: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, Accounts Receivable,
Inventories, and Prepaid Expenses. Assets that do not meet the criteria to be classified as current
are, by default, non-current assets. Examples of non-current assets are: Long-term Investments;
Property, Plant and Equipment; and Intangibles.</p>

<p><b>Liabilities:</b> Liabilities can also be classified as current or non-current. A liability is considered current of
they are payable within 12 months from the end of the accounting period, or within the company's
normal operating cycle if the cycle exceeds 12 months.</p>

<p>Current liabilities include: Accounts Payable, Short-term Notes Payable, Tax Payable, Accrued
Expenses, and other short-term obligations. Non-current liabilities include those that do not meet
the above criteria. Examples of non-current liabilities are: Loans Payable and Bonds Payable
which are long-term in nature, and Deferred Tax Liabilities.</p>
<p><b>Capital:</b> Capital refers to the interest of the owner/s of the business. The owner's interest is the value of
total assets left after all liabilities to creditors and lenders are settled. Capital is increased by
contributions by the owner/s and income. It is decreased by withdrawals by owners (dividends in
corporations) and expenses.</p>
<p><b>Income:</b> Income refers to an increase in assets or decrease in liability, and an increase in capital other
than that arising from contributions made by owner/s. Examples of income accounts include: Sales,
Service Revenue, Professional Fees, Interest Income, Rent Income, and others.</p>
<p><b>Expense:</b> Expenses result in decrease in assets or increase in liabilities, and decrease in capital other
than those arising from withdrawals of the owner/s. Some examples are: Cost of Sales, Salaries Expense,
Rent Expense, Utilities Expense, Delivery Expense, and others.</p>

<h2>Accounting Equation</h2>
<p>The accounting equation shows the relationships between the accounting elements: assets,
liabilities and capital. The basic accounting equation is:</p>
<p><b>Assets = Liabilities + Capital</b></p>

<p>It shows that assets owned by a company are coupled with claims by creditors and lenders, and
by the owners of the business.</p>
<p>When business transactions take place, the values of the elements in the accounting equation
change. Nonetheless, the equation always stays in balance. This is due to the two-fold effect of
transactions. The total change on the left side is always equal to the total change on the right.
Thus, the resulting balances of both sides are equal.</p>
<p>The accounting equation may be rewritten as:</p>
<p>Liabilities = Assets - Capital, or Capital = Assets - Liabilities.</p>
<p>The capital element may also be spread-out into its components, and thus resulting into the
expanded accounting equation:</p>
<p>Assets = Liabilities + Capital - Withdrawals + Income - Expenses</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Assets = Liabilities + (Capital, beginning + Additional Contributions - Withdrawals +
Income - Expenses)</p>

<h2>Double Entry Accounting System</h2>
<p>The double entry accounting system recognizes a two-fold effect in every transaction. Thus,
business transactions are recorded in at least two accounts.</p>
<p>Under the double entry accounting system, transactions are recorded through debits and credits.
Debit means left. Credit means right. The effect of recording in debit or credit depends upon the
normal balance of the account debited or credited.</p>

<p>The general rules are: to increase an asset, you debit it; to decrease an asset, you credit it. The
opposite applies to liabilities and capital: to increase a liability or a capital account, you credit
it; to decrease a liability or a capital account, you debit it. Expenses are debited when incurred,
and income is credited when earned.</p>

<h2>The Accounting Cycle</h2>
<p>The accounting cycle is a sequence of steps in the collection, processing, and presentation of
accounting information. It is made up of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Identifying and analyzing business transactions and events</li>
  <li>Recording transactions in the journals</li>
  <li>Posting journal entries to the ledger</li>
  <li>Preparing an unadjusted trial balance</li>
  <li>Recording and posting adjusting entries</li>
  <li>Preparing an adjusted trial balance</li>
  <li>Preparing the financial statements</li>
  <li>Recording and posting closing entries</li>
  <li>Preparing a post-closing trial balance</li>
</ol>

<p>Reversing entries may be prepared at the beginning of the new accounting period to enable a
smoother recording process. In this step, some adjusting entries are simply reversed.
Nevertheless, reversing entries are optional.</p>

<h2>Bookkeeping vs Accounting</h2>
<p>It is very common for non-accountants to think that bookkeeping and accounting are of the same
thing. Although they both involve the process of recording the financial transactions of a
business, bookkeeping and accounting are two different topics.</p>
<p>Bookkeeping is the process of recording, in chronological order, the daily transactions of a
business entity. It forms part of the accounting information system.</p>
<p>Accounting is an information system ‚Äì includes the process of recording, classifying,
summarizing, reporting, analyzing and interpreting the financial condition and performance of a
business ‚Äì in order to communicate it to stakeholders for business decision making.</p>

<h3>Illustration</h3>
<p>To provide a clear understanding of the difference between bookkeeping and accounting, take a
look at this sample illustration.</p>
<p>Imagine there‚Äòs one piece of apple pie divided into 6 slices. Each slice was given a
corresponding name as recording, classifying, summarizing, reporting, analyzing, and
interpreting. The whole one piece of apple pie is called the accounting information system which
represents accounting. On the other hand, bookkeeping represents one slice of the apple pie
which is recording.</p>

<img src="../assets/images/accounting_process.png" alt="The Accounting Process Diagram" width="600" loading="lazy">

<h2>Bookkeeping and Transaction Entry system</h2>
<p>Systematic recording of financial aspects of business transactions in appropriate books of
account</p>
<p>Bookkeeping is the recording, on a day-to-day basis of the financial transactions and information
pertaining to a business.</p>

<p>Entry systems: Two common bookkeeping systems used by businesses and other organizations are the
single-entry bookkeeping system and the double-entry bookkeeping system. Single-entry bookkeeping
uses only income and expense accounts, recorded primarily in a revenue and expense journal. Singleentry bookkeeping is adequate for many small businesses. Double-entry bookkeeping requires posting
(recording) each transaction twice, using debits and credits.</p>

<h3>Single-entry system</h3>
<p>The primary bookkeeping record in single-entry bookkeeping is the cash book, which is similar
to a checking (cheque) account register but allocates the income and expenses to various income
and expense accounts. Separate account records are maintained for petty cash, accounts payable
and receivable, and other relevant transactions such as inventory and travel expenses. These
days, single entry bookkeeping can be done with DIY bookkeeping software to speed up manual
calculations.</p>
<h3>Double-entry system</h3>
<p>A double-entry bookkeeping system is a set of rules for recording financial information in a
financial accounting system in which every transaction or event changes at least two different
nominal ledger accounts.</p>

<p>Double-entry bookkeeping, in accounting, is a system of bookkeeping so named because every
entry to an account requires a corresponding and opposite entry to a different account. For
instance, recording earnings of $100 would require making two entries: a debit entry of $100 to
an account called "Cash" and a credit entry to an account called "Income."</p>

<p>In the double-entry accounting system, two accounting entries are required to record each
financial transaction. These entries may occur in asset, liability, income, expense, or capital
accounts. Recording of a debit amount to one or more accounts and an equal credit amount to
one or more accounts results in total debits being equal to total credits for all accounts in the
general ledger. If the accounting entries are recorded without error, the aggregate balance of all
accounts having positive balances will be equal to the aggregate balance of all accounts having
negative balances. Accounting entries that debit and credit related accounts typically include the
same date and identifying code in both accounts, so that in case of error, each debit and credit
can be traced back to a journal and transaction source document, thus preserving an audit trail.</p>
<p>The rules for formulating accounting entries are known as "Golden Rules of Accounting". The
accounting entries are recorded in the "Books of Accounts". Regardless of which accounts and
how many are impacted by a given transaction, the fundamental accounting equation A = L + OE
will hold, i.e. assets equals liabilities plus owner's equity.</p>

<h2>Ledgers</h2>
<p>A ledger is a record of accounts. These accounts are recorded separately showing their
beginning/ending balance.</p>
<p>A journal lists financial transactions in chronological order without showing their balance but
showing how much is going to be charged in each account.</p>
<p>A ledger takes each financial transaction from the journal and records it into the corresponding
account for every transaction listed. The ledger also sums up the total of every account which is
transferred into the balance sheet and income statement. There are 3 different kinds of ledgers
that deal with book-keeping. Ledgers include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sales ledger, which deals mostly with the accounts receivable account. This ledger
  consists of the financial transactions made by customers to the business.</li>
  <li>Purchase ledger is a ledger that goes hand and hand with the Accounts Payable account.
  This is the purchasing transaction a company does.</li>
  <li>General ledger representing the original 5 main accounts: assets, liabilities, equity,
  income, and expenses</li>
</ul>

<p>The ledger is a special book in which transactions are recorded. In other words, a book in which
accounts are kept.</p>

<p>The ledger differs from other books in the way columns are drawn to record transactions as
follows:</p>

<img src="../assets/images/ledger_structure.png" alt="Ledger Structure" width="600" loading="lazy">

<h3>Types of ledger:</h3>
<p>In a real business, there are so many accounts to keep and each account may need lots of space to
record transactions for the whole accounting year. For this reason, a business usually keeps, not
one, but several ledgers. These ledgers are classified into three types:</p>

<h4>Sales Ledger</h4>
<p>The book (or set of books) in which the personal accounts of credit customers are kept.</p>
<p>A credit customer is also called a debtor.</p>
<p>The balance of a customer‚Äòs account shows the amount that the customer owes the business.
Therefore, the total of balances in the sales ledger is the total amount the business is owed by its
credit customers. This amount is called trade receivables or accounts receivables.</p>
<p>Trade receivables is shown as a current asset in the balance sheet.</p>

<h4>Purchases Ledger</h4>
<p>The book (or set of books) in which the personal accounts of credit suppliers are kept.</p>
<p>A credit supplier is also called a creditor.</p>
<p>The balance of a supplier‚Äòs account shows the amount that the business owes the supplier.
Therefore, the total of balances in the purchases ledger is the total amount the business owes by
its credit suppliers. This amount is called trade payables or accounts payables.</p>
<p>Trade payables is shown as a current liability in the balance sheet.</p>

<h4>General Ledger</h4>
<p>The book (or set of books) in which all other accounts are kept.</p>

<h3>Account categories and debits and credits</h3>
<p>The kind of impact (debit or credit) that a transaction makes on each ledger account depends on
which of five chart of account categories the accounts belong to.</p>

<p>First, there are the so-called "balance sheet" account categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Asset accounts:</b> Things of value that are owned and used by the business.
  Example: Cash on hand
  Example: Accounts receivable</li>
  <li><b>Liability accounts:</b> Debts that are owed by the business.
  Example: Accounts payable
  Example: Salaries payable</li>
  <li><b>Equity accounts:</b> The owner's claim to business assets.
  Example: Owner capital
  Example: Retained earnings</li>
</ol>
<p>Secondly, there are the so-called "income statement" account categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Revenue accounts:</b> The amounts earned from the sale of goods and services, or investment
  income, or extraordinary income.
  Example: Product sales revenues
  Example: Interest earned revenues</li>
  <li><b>Expense accounts:</b> Costs incurred in the course of business.
  Example: Direct labor costs
  Example: Advertising expenses</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, even a small organization may list a hundred or more such accounts as the basis
for its accounting system, and very large and complex organizations may use many
more. Nevertheless, for bookkeeping and accounting purposes, all named accounts fall into one
of the five categories above.</p>

<p>Every financial transaction brings as a journal entry, then becomes a ledger entry, with at least
two equal and offsetting account changes. The change in one account is called a debit (DR) and
the change in another account called a credit (CR). Whether a debit or a credit increases or
decreases the account balance depends on the kind of account involved, as shown in Exhibit
below:</p>

<img src="../assets/images/debit_credit_rules.png" alt="Debit Credit Rules" width="800" loading="lazy">

<h2>Recording Transactions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Credit an entry in the right hand column of an account; credits increase liability, income, and
  equity accounts and decrease asset and expense accounts</li>
  <li>Debit an entry in the left hand column of an account to record a debt; debits increase asset and
  expense accounts and decrease liability, income, and equity accounts</li>
  <li>Account A registry of pecuniary transactions; a written or printed statement of business
  dealings or debts and credits, and also of other things subjected to a reckoning or review</li>
</ul>

<h3>T Accounts</h3>
<p>The simplest ledger account structure is shaped like the letter T. The account title and account
number appear above the T. Debits (abbreviated Dr.) always go on the left side of the T, and
credits (abbreviated Cr.) always go on the right.</p>

<img src="../assets/images/t_account.png" alt="T Account Structure" width="400" loading="lazy">

<p>Accountants‚Äò record increases in asset, expense, and owner's drawing accounts on the debit side,
and they record increases in liability, revenue, and owner's capital accounts on the credit side. An
account's assigned normal balance is on the side where increases go because the increases in
any account are usually greater than the decreases. Therefore, asset, expense, and owner's
drawing accounts normally have debit balances. Liability, revenue, and owner's capital accounts
normally have credit balances. To determine the correct entry, identify the accounts affected by a
transaction, which category each account falls into, and whether the transaction increases or
decreases the account's balance. You may find the following chart helpful as a reference.</p>

<p>Occasionally, an account does not have a normal balance. For example, a company's checking
account (an asset) has a credit balance if the account is overdrawn.</p>

<p>The way people often use the words debit and credit in everyday speech is not how accountants
use these words. For example, the word credit generally has positive associations when used
conversationally: in school you receive credit for completing a course, a great hockey player may
be a credit to his or her team, and a hopeless romantic may at least deserve credit for trying.
Someone who is familiar with these uses for credit but who is new to accounting may not
immediately associate credits with decreases to asset, expense, and owner's drawing accounts. If
a business owner loses $5,000 of the company's cash while gambling, the cash account, which is
an asset, must be credited for $5,000. (The accountant who records this entry may also deserve
credit for realizing that other job offers merit consideration.) For accounting purposes, think of
debit and credit simply in terms of the left‚Äêhand and right‚Äêhand side of a T account.</p>

<h3>Working Example of Account transaction</h3>
<p>Suppose, for example, that a company acquires assets valued at $100,000. The journal entry for
the acquisition will show that an asset account increases $100,000, perhaps asset account
"factory manufacturing equipment." Because this is an asset account, its balance increase is
called a debit. However, the balance sheet may now be temporarily out of balance until there is
an offsetting credit of $100,000 to another account, somewhere in the system. This could be, for
instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A credit of $100,000 to another asset account, reducing that account value by $100,000. This
  could be the asset account "cash on hand."</li>
  <li>If instead of cash, the asset purchase is financed with a bank loan, the offsetting transaction in
  the journal entry could be a credit to a liability account such as "bank loans payable," increasing
  that account value by $100,000.</li>
</ul>

<p>The debit and the credit from the acquisition will be shown together in the journal entry, but
when transferred to the ledger, they will each impact a different account summary (see the
journal and ledger entry examples below).</p>
<p>When the journal entry is complete, the basic accounting equation holds and the balance sheet
stays balanced:</p>
<p>Assets = Liabilities + Equities</p>
<p>And, for the account journal entries that follow from a single transaction:</p>
<p>Debits = Credits</p>
<p>The bookkeeper or accountant dealing with journal and ledger entries faces one complication,
however, in that not all accounts work additively with each other on the primary financial
accounting reports‚Äîespecially on the income statement and balance sheet. There are cases
where one account offsets the impact of another account in the same category. These are the
contra accounts that "work against" other accounts in their own categories. In some cases, the
contra accounts reverse the debit and credit rules in Exhibit 3 above.</p>

<p>For example, an "accounts receivable" account and an "allowance for doubtful accounts"
account are both asset accounts. Accounts receivable is said to carry a debit balance, meaning
that debits to this account increase the account balance. "Allowance for doubtful accounts,"
however, is a contra asset account that ultimately reduces the impact (balance) contributed by
"accounts receivable." "Allowance for doubtful accounts" carries a credit balance, meaning that
its value is increased by a credit transaction. When these journal entries make their way into the
ledger and then the financial reports, the balance sheet result is a "net accounts receivable" less
than the "accounts receivable" value.</p>
<p>In any case, the bookkeeper or accountant working with journal entries needs to have a complete
knowledge of the organization's chart of accounts and a solid command of double entry
bookkeeping rules‚Äîor else, accounting software that provides clear guidance and good error
checking.</p>

<h3>Bookkeeping Basics to Remember</h3>
<p>When recording an Accounting transaction or journal entry in accounting software such as
QuickBooks Pro or Sage Accounting (Peachtree), program, one account is debited and another
account is credited. In some cases, two accounts may receive the debit or credit. But the total
amount of the debit must equal the total amount of the credit.</p>

<p>For some transactions, the Accounting software available today automatically chooses one of the
accounts to either debit and credit, and the user need only select the other account. For instance,
when writing a check, the software knows to credit Cash (or Checking), and the user just needs
to know which account should receive the debit. However, when posting journal entries, one
must know which accounts both debit and credit.</p>

<p>Now, let's begin!</p>

<p>If you're new to Accounting or Bookkeeping, check out some of our beginners' tutorials on the
right sidebar - especially accounting: Making Sense of Debits and Credits.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Owner invests $5,000 in the company.</h4>
<p>Analysis: Since money is deposited into the
checking account, Cash is debited (the balance increased by $5,000). What account receives a
credit? An Equity account called Owner‚Äòs Equity or Capital Contribution. Since Equity accounts
are ‚Äónegative‚Äò accounts, crediting this Equity account increases its balance by $5,000.</p>
<p>Debit Cash (increase its balance)</p>
<p>Credit Owner‚Äòs Equity (increases its balance)</p>

<h4>Example 2: The Company borrowed $8,000 from a bank.</h4>
<p>Analysis: Since the money will be
deposited into the checking account, Cash is debited (the balance increased by $8,000.) The
account to receive the credit is a Liability account called Loans Payable (you may create a
separate account or sub-account for each loan). Liability accounts are credit accounts, so
crediting the Liability account increases its negative balance by $8,000 (move to the left on the
number line).</p>
<p>Debit Cash (increases its balance)</p>
<p>Credit Loans Payable (increases its balance)</p>

<h4>Example 3: Your bank charges you a $14 a month statement fee.</h4>
<p>Analysis: This transaction
is entered via a journal entry each month when the statement fee is identified on the bank
statement. Since money was removed from the checking account, Cash must be credited (the
balance decreased by $14). The Expense account called Bank Service Charges will receive the
debit.</p>
<p>Debit Bank Fees (increases its balance)</p>
<p>Credit Cash (decreases its balance)</p>

<h4>Example 4: You pay $540, via check, on the $8,000 loan acquired in Example 2.</h4>
<p>Of this
amount, $500 is applied to the principal, and $40 is loan interest. Analysis: Since a check is
being written, the Accounting software will automatically credit Cash. In this case the debit is
split between two accounts. To reflect the $500 that has been applied to the loan balance, debit
the loan account. (Since it is a liability account, a debit will reduce it's balance, which is what
you want.) The $40 interest paid is an expense, so debit the expense account called Interest.
Remember that even though the debit is split between two accounts, the total debit must always
equal the total credit.</p>
<p>Debit Loans Payable $500 (decreases its balance)</p>
<p>Debit Interest Expense $40 (increases its balance)</p>
<p>Credit Cash $540 (decreases its balance)</p>

<h4>Example 5: the Company wrote a check for $8,500 of equipment.</h4>
<p>Analysis: Since a check
was written, QBP will automatically credit Cash. We will debit an Asset account called
Equipment or something similar. Note: Remember, if you purchase an item for more than about
$500, you should depreciate the item; not expense it. ($500 is a "rule of thumb," but I am not
suggesting you use it.) So the Asset account receives the debit instead of an expense account. To
record the depreciation, journal entries would be entered for one or more years. Always consult
with your Accountant when purchasing company assets.</p>
<p>Debit Equipment (increases its balance)</p>
<p>Credit Cash (decreases its balance)</p>
<p>[Remember: A debit adds a positive number and a credit adds a negative number. But you
NEVER put a minus sign on a number you enter into QBP.]</p>

<h4>Example 6: the Company wrote a check for $318 of office supplies.</h4>
<p>Analysis: Since a check
was written, QBP will automatically credit Cash. We debit the Expense account called Office.</p>
<p>Debit Office (increases its balance)</p>
<p>Credit Cash (decreases its balance)</p>

<h4>Example 7: the Company purchased $300 of office supplies on credit and you entered a bill
into QBP.</h4>
<p>Analysis: When you enter a bill, QBP automatically credits the Liability account
called Accounts Payable. And since you purchased office supplies, the Office expense account is
debited.</p>
<p>Debit Office (increase its balance)</p>
<p>Credit Accounts Payable (increases its balance)</p>

<h4>Example 8: You paid the bill for $300 of office supplies purchased in Example 7.</h4>
<p>Analysis:
When the bill was entered, Office was debited and A/P was credited. Now as we write a check to
pay the bill, QBP will automatically credit Cash. And QBP will debit Accounts Payable - in
effect, reversing the earlier credit.</p>
<p>Debit Accounts Payable (decreases its balance)</p>
<p>Credit Cash (decrease its balance)</p>

<h4>Example 9: the Company paid $450 cash for Product A - a COGS part.</h4>
<p>Analysis: When you
write the check, QBP will automatically credit Cash. In the check window, choose the COGS
account from the Expenses tab, or choose an Item from the Items tab and then the COGS account
associated with the Item will be debited.</p>
<p>Debit COGS (increase its balance)</p>
<p>Credit Cash (decrease its balance)</p>

<h4>Example 10: the Company sold Product A for $650 cash.</h4>
<p>Analysis: When you enter the cash
sale, QBP automatically debits Cash (or you could choose to deposit to Undeposited Funds - see
Example 14). You will have to choose an Item for the sale ‚Ä¶ it might be ‚ÄïProd A income‚Äñ and
associated with the Sales account.</p>
<p>Debit Cash (increases its balance)</p>
<p>Credit Sales (increases its balance)</p>

<h4>Example 11: the Company sold Product A for $650 on credit.</h4>
<p>Analysis: When you create an
invoice, you must specify an Item for each separate charge on the invoice. QBP will
automatically credit the revenue account(s) associated with these Items. And QBP automatically
debits the Invoice amount to A/R.</p>
<p>Debit Accounts Receivable (increases the balance)</p>
<p>Credit Sales (increases the balance)</p>

<h4>Example 12: the Company received a payment for the $650 invoice above.</h4>
<p>Analysis: When
you created the invoice, QBP automatically debited the A/R account. When you post the invoice
payment, QBP will automatically credit A/R - in effect reversing the earlier debit. QBP will debit
Cash.</p>
<p>Debit Cash (increases the balance)</p>
<p>Credit A/R (decreases the balance)</p>

<h4>Example 13: The owner‚Äôs writes himself a check for $1,000.</h4>
<p>Analysis: Since a check was
written, QBP will automatically credit Cash. The account you chose for the debit is and Equity
account called Draw (Sole Proprietor) or Distribution (Corporation). Note: These are the only
non-contra Equity accounts that are positive accounts and receive debits.</p>
<p>Debit Owner‚Äòs Draw (increases its balance)</p>
<p>Credit Cash (decrease its balance)</p>
