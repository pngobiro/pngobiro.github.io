                    <p>You have ten minutes to read through the instructions and questions before starting the examination.</p>
                    <p>Any problem with the computer should be reported to the invigilator immediately.</p>
                    <p>Direct any question(s) to the invigilator only. Conversing with fellow students may lead to disqualification.</p>
                    <p>Write your name and index number on the rewritable CD.</p>
                    <p>Type your name as a header on each sheet of paper used.</p>
                    <p>This paper consists of TWO tasks. Perform the TWO tasks.</p>
                    <p>Each task carries <strong>20</strong> marks.</p>
                    <p>Read the instructions of each task carefully.</p>
                    <p>Print on one side of the paper(s) only and use a fresh sheet of paper for each task.</p>
                    <p>Hand over your printout and the Rewritable CD to the invigilator at the end of the examination.</p>
                    <p><em>This paper consists of 5 printed pages. Candidates should check the question paper to ascertain that all the pages are printed as indicated and that no questions are missing.</em></p>

                                    <li>Use the appropriate command (e.g., `UNITS`) to set the drawing units to Millimeters.</li>
                                    <li>Within the same command or a related settings dialog, set the precision for linear units to 0 decimal places.</li>

                                    <li>Open the layer management tool (e.g., `LAYER` command).</li>
                                    <li>Create a new layer named "Outline". Set its line weight property to 0.80 mm.</li>
                                    <li>Create another new layer named "Dimension". Set its line weight property to 0.20 mm.</li>
                                    <li>Ensure the "Outline" layer is set as the current layer for drawing the main figure.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(c) Drawing and Dimensioning:</strong></p>

                                    <li><strong>Drawing the Block (Outline Layer):</strong> Use drawing commands (e.g., `LINE`, `PLINE`, `RECTANGLE`, potentially 3D commands like `EXTRUDE` or `BOX` if creating a true 3D model, or orthographic projection techniques if drawing 2D views) to replicate the geometry shown in Figure 1, adhering strictly to the provided dimensions. Ensure all lines representing the main object are on the "Outline" layer.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Dimensioning (Dimension Layer):</strong> Set the "Dimension" layer as the current layer. Use appropriate dimensioning commands (e.g., `DIMLINEAR`, `DIMALIGNED`, `DIMRADIUS`, `DIMDIAMETER`) to add all necessary dimensions to the drawing as indicated in Figure 1, ensuring they clearly communicate the size and shape of the object. Place dimensions neatly and avoid overcrowding.</li>

                                    <li>Use the `SAVE` or `SAVEAS` command.</li>
                                    <li>Navigate to the KNECEXAM folder created on the desktop.</li>
                                    <li>Enter the filename "wooden block" and save the drawing file (e.g., as a .dwg or .dxf file depending on the software).</li>

                                    <li>Use the `PLOT` or `PRINT` command.</li>
                                    <li>Configure the plot settings: select a printer/plotter, choose paper size, set plot scale (e.g., 1:1 or fit to page), define plot area (e.g., Extents or Window), and potentially configure line weights if not using layer-based settings.</li>
                                    <li>Preview the plot to ensure correctness.</li>
                                    <li>Send the plot to the printer (this step is usually done after the exam).</li>
