</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Lucy's decision to choose in-house software development likely stems from specific organizational needs and strategic considerations.</p>
<p data-number="1"><b>Customization and Specific Requirements:</b> In-house software development allows for complete customization of the software to precisely meet the company's specific requirements and unique business processes. Off-the-shelf software may not fully address specialized needs or may require modifications. In-house development enables tailoring the software to fit the organization's exact workflows and functionalities, providing a highly customized solution.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Intellectual Property and Competitive Advantage:</b> In-house software development enables the company to retain full intellectual property rights and control over the software. Owning the software source code and design provides a competitive advantage, allowing for proprietary features, unique innovations, and preventing competitors from easily replicating the software solution. Intellectual property ownership and differentiation can be strategic drivers for in-house development.</p>
