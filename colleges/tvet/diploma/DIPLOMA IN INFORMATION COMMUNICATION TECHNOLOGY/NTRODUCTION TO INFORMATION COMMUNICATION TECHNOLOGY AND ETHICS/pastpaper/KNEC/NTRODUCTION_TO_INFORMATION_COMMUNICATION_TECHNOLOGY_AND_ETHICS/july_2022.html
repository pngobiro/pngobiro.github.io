<div class="sub-question">
<p class="sub-question-text">(b) Describe three characteristics of data bus in a computer central processing unit (CPU). <span class="marks">(6 marks)</span></p>
<div class="answer-box">
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Width: The data bus width determines the number of bits that can be transferred simultaneously. A wider data bus (e.g., 64-bit) allows for faster data transfer compared to a narrower one (e.g., 32-bit), improving processing speed.</li>
<li>Speed: Data buses operate at a specific clock speed, measured in Hertz (Hz). Higher clock speeds mean faster data transfer rates, contributing to quicker communication between the CPU and other components.</li>
<li>Direction: Data buses can be unidirectional or bidirectional. A bidirectional data bus allows data to flow in both directions between the CPU and memory or peripherals, enabling efficient communication for both reading and writing data.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-question">
<p class="sub-question-text">(c) Distinguish between a <em>switch</em> and a <em>bridge</em> computer network device. <span class="marks">(4 marks)</span></p>
<div class="answer-box">
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Both switches and bridges are used to connect network segments, but they differ in functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bridge:</strong> Operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It forwards data packets based on MAC addresses. Bridges typically have fewer ports and are used to connect two network segments, reducing collision domains. They learn MAC addresses and filter traffic, but are less sophisticated than switches.</li>
<li><strong>Switch:</strong> Also operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) but is more advanced than a bridge. Switches have multiple ports and can connect many network devices. They learn MAC addresses and forward traffic only to the port where the destination MAC address is located, significantly reducing collisions and improving network efficiency. Switches offer higher port density and faster performance compared to bridges.</li>
</ul>

<div class="sub-question">
<p class="sub-question-text">(d) A supervisor uses reactive techniques to manage workplace conflicts. Explain three likely outcomes of this technique. <span class="marks">(6 marks)</span></p>
<div class="answer-box">
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Reactive conflict management involves addressing conflicts after they have arisen. Three likely outcomes of using reactive techniques are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Escalation of conflict: By delaying intervention, minor conflicts can escalate into more significant issues. Employees may feel ignored or that their concerns are not valued, leading to increased frustration and animosity.</li>
<li>Decreased productivity and morale: Unresolved conflicts can disrupt workflow, reduce team collaboration, and lower employee morale. Employees may become disengaged, and the work environment can become tense and unproductive.</li>
<li>Damage to relationships: Reactive approaches often deal with symptoms rather than root causes. This can lead to superficial resolutions, and underlying issues remain, damaging interpersonal relationships and trust among team members over time.</li>
</ol>

</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sub-question">
<p class="sub-question-text">(d) An organisation uses avoid-avoid conflict resolution strategy. Explain three problems associated with this strategy. <span class="marks">(6 marks)</span></p>
<div class="answer-box">
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Avoid-avoid conflict resolution involves ignoring or sidestepping conflict situations rather than addressing them directly. Three problems associated with this strategy are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unresolved issues fester and worsen: Avoiding conflict does not make it disappear. Underlying issues remain unaddressed and can escalate over time, leading to more significant and complex problems later on.</li>
<li>Reduced trust and communication: When conflicts are avoided, it can create a climate of mistrust and poor communication. Employees may feel their concerns are not valued, leading to decreased openness and honesty in interactions.</li>
<li>Missed opportunities for growth and improvement: Conflict, when managed constructively, can be an opportunity for learning and improvement. Avoidance prevents the organisation from identifying root causes of problems, making necessary changes, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.</li>
</ol>
