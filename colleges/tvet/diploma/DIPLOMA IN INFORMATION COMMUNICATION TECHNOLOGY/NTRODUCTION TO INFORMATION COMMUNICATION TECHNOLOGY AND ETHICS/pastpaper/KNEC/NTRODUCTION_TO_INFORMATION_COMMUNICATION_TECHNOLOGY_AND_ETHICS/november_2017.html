<h3>1. (c) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Distinguish between multiprogramming and multiprocessing as used in computer systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Multiprogramming and multiprocessing are both techniques for enhancing computer efficiency but differ in their execution approach.</p>
<p><b>Multiprogramming:</b> Multiprogramming is an operating system technique that allows multiple programs to reside in main memory simultaneously. The CPU switches between these programs, executing a portion of each in turn. However, at any given instant, only one program is actively being executed by a single CPU. The goal is to maximize CPU utilization by keeping it busy when one program is waiting for I/O operations.</p>
<p><b>Multiprocessing:</b> Multiprocessing is a hardware technique that uses multiple CPUs (processors) within a single computer system. These CPUs can execute multiple processes or threads concurrently and simultaneously. This allows for true parallel processing, where different parts of a program or different programs can run at the exact same time, leading to significant performance improvements for computationally intensive tasks and overall system throughput.</p>

<p data-number="3"><b>Back and Neck Pain (Musculoskeletal Disorders - MSDs):</b> Poor posture, prolonged sitting, and non-ergonomic workstations contribute to back and neck pain and other Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs). Incorrect chair height, lack of back support, and improper monitor placement lead to strained muscles and spinal stress. MSDs from prolonged computer work can cause chronic pain, reduced mobility, and decreased quality of life, necessitating ergonomic assessments, posture correction, and regular breaks for movement and stretching.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Sedentary Lifestyle and Related Health Risks:</b> Prolonged computer work often involves a sedentary lifestyle with extended periods of sitting and minimal physical activity. A sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. Lack of physical activity, combined with prolonged sitting, negatively impacts overall health and well-being. Encouraging regular breaks, promoting physical activity, and incorporating movement into the workday are essential to mitigate these risks for computer operators.</p>

<p data-number="1"><b>User-Friendly and Intuitive:</b> GUIs are designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making computers easier to learn and use, especially for non-technical users. GUIs use visual elements like icons, menus, and windows that are easily recognizable and understandable, allowing users to interact with the computer in a more natural and visually oriented way. This reduces the learning curve and makes computing accessible to a wider range of users without specialized command-line knowledge.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Multitasking and Visual Organization:</b> GUIs facilitate multitasking and provide a visual organization of applications and files through windows and icons. Users can easily switch between multiple applications, manage open files, and organize their work visually using windows and icons. This visual organization enhances productivity and allows users to manage complex tasks and workflows more efficiently compared to text-based interfaces.</p>
