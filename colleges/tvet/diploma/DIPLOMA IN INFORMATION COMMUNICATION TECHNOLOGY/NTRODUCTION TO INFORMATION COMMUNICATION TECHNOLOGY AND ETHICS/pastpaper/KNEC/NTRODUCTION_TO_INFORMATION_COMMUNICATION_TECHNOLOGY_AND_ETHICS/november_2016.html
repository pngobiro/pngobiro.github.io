<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">

<p data-number="1"><b>Resource Constraints and Budget Limitations:</b> CSR initiatives require financial resources, staff time, and logistical support.

Balancing CSR activities with core business objectives and financial sustainability can be a challenge.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Measuring Impact and Demonstrating ROI:</b> Quantifying the impact of CSR initiatives and demonstrating a clear Return on Investment (ROI) can be challenging. Measuring social impact, community benefits, or long-term outcomes of CSR programs may be complex and difficult to assess quantitatively.
