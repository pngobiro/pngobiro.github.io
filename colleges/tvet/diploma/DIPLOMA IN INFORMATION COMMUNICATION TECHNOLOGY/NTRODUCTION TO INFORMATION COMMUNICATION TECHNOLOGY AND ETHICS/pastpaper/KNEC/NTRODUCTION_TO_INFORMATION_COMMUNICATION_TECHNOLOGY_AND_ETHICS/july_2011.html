<div class="question-content">
<p>(b) Distinguish between integrated software and software suites.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Integrated Software:</b></p>
<p>Integrated software refers to a single application that combines multiple functionalities and tools from different software categories into one unified program. It is designed as a single, cohesive unit where various modules or components are tightly integrated and share data seamlessly within the application. Integrated software aims to provide a comprehensive solution for diverse tasks within a single application environment.</p>
<p><b>Software Suites:</b></p>
<p>Software suites are collections of separate, standalone software applications that are bundled together and sold as a package. Each application within a software suite is a distinct program designed for a specific purpose (e.g., word processing, spreadsheet, presentation). While applications in a suite are designed to work together and may offer some level of integration, they remain separate programs that are launched and operated independently.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>The core difference lies in the level of integration and structure. Integrated software is a single application with combined functionalities, whereas software suites are bundles of separate applications. Integrated software offers seamless data sharing within one program, while suites consist of distinct programs that may have interoperability but are not inherently unified as a single application. Integrated software is a singular, comprehensive tool, while software suites are collections of individual applications bundled for convenience and sometimes cost-effectiveness.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>(c) Outline four differences between primary and secondary storage in a computer system.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Volatility:</b> Primary storage (RAM) is volatile memory, meaning it loses stored data when power is turned off. Secondary storage (Hard Disk, SSD) is non-volatile, retaining data even when power is removed. Volatility is a key distinction in how they retain data; primary storage is temporary, while secondary storage is permanent.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Access Speed:</b> Primary storage (RAM) offers much faster data access speeds compared to secondary storage. RAM allows for rapid reading and writing of data, enabling quick CPU access for processing. Secondary storage devices have slower access times due to mechanical components (HDDs) or interface limitations, resulting in slower data retrieval and storage operations.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Cost per Gigabyte:</b> Primary storage (RAM) is significantly more expensive per gigabyte compared to secondary storage. RAM is designed for high-speed performance, which increases its manufacturing cost. Secondary storage, especially HDDs, offers much lower cost per gigabyte, making it more economical for storing large volumes of data.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Purpose and Usage:</b> Primary storage (RAM) is used for temporary storage of data and instructions that the CPU is actively processing. It serves as the main working memory of the computer. Secondary storage is used for long-term, persistent storage of data, applications, and files, even when the computer is powered off. Primary storage is for active processing, while secondary storage is for data archiving and long-term retention.</p>
