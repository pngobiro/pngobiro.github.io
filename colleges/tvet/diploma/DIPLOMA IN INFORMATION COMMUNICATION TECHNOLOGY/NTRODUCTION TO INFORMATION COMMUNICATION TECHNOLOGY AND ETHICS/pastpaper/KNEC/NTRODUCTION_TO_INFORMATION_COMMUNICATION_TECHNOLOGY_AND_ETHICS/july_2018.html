<h3>1. (a) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Outline four limitations of touch screen as an output device.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Touch screens, while versatile input and output devices, have certain limitations when used primarily as output devices. These include:</p>
<p data-number="1"><b>Limited Tactile Feedback:</b> Touch screens lack physical buttons or keys, providing no tactile feedback to the user. This can make it difficult for users to interact with the output without looking directly at the screen, and can be less efficient for tasks requiring precise or repeated interactions.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Fingerprint Smudges and Obstruction:</b> As output devices, touch screens are prone to fingerprint smudges, which can reduce screen clarity and visibility of the displayed information. Furthermore, the user's fingers or stylus can obstruct part of the screen, making it difficult to view the entire output, especially during interaction.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Durability and Cleaning:</b> Touch screens, being exposed surfaces, are more susceptible to scratches and damage compared to output devices that are protected behind a screen. They also require frequent cleaning to remove smudges and maintain optimal visibility, adding to maintenance overhead.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Cost and Complexity:</b> Touch screen technology is generally more expensive to implement than traditional display-only output devices. Integrating touch functionality adds complexity in terms of hardware and software, potentially increasing the overall cost of the system.</p>

<h3>1. (b) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Describe each of the following ethical issues in regard to computer technology: (i) patent rights; (ii) trademark.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Ethical issues surrounding patent rights and trademarks in computer technology are crucial for innovation and fair competition.</p>
<p><b>(i) Patent Rights:</b> Patent rights in computer technology ethically pertain to the exclusive rights granted to inventors for their inventions, typically software algorithms, hardware designs, or technological processes. The ethical issue arises in balancing the inventor's right to profit from their creation and society's need for access and further innovation. Overly broad patents or aggressive patent enforcement can stifle competition and hinder technological progress. Ethically, the patent system should incentivize genuine innovation without creating monopolies that impede broader societal benefit or fair use.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Trademark:</b> Trademarks in computer technology relate to brand names, logos, and symbols used to identify and distinguish goods and services. Ethically, trademarks are intended to protect consumers from confusion and ensure fair market practices. The ethical concerns arise when trademarks are used to unfairly compete, create confusion through similar branding, or when companies engage in cybersquatting or domain name disputes. Ethical trademark practices involve respecting established brands, avoiding deceptive similarity, and using trademarks to build genuine brand reputation rather than to mislead consumers or unfairly impede competitors.</p>

<h3>1. (d) (6 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Explain three ways in which one would improve low personal self esteem at the place of work.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Improving low personal self-esteem in the workplace requires a multifaceted approach focusing on individual empowerment and positive workplace culture.</p>
<p data-number="1"><b>Seek and Accept Constructive Feedback:</b> Individuals with low self-esteem often fear criticism, but proactively seeking and accepting constructive feedback is crucial for professional growth and building confidence.

<h3>2. (b) (6 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Describe how each of the following are used to threaten the privacy of personal data through computer technology: (i) cookies; (ii) electronic profile; (iii) spyware;</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Cookies, electronic profiles, and spyware are computer technologies that can significantly threaten the privacy of personal data.</p>
<p><b>(i) Cookies:</b> Cookies are small text files that websites store on a user's computer. While some cookies are essential for website functionality (e.g., remembering login details), others, particularly tracking cookies, are used to monitor browsing activity across multiple websites. These tracking cookies collect data about user preferences, browsing habits, and online behavior without explicit consent, creating detailed profiles that can be used for targeted advertising, price discrimination, or even sold to third parties, thus violating user privacy.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Electronic Profile:</b> Electronic profiles are comprehensive collections of personal data aggregated from various online and offline sources. These profiles can include browsing history, purchase records, social media activity, location data, and demographic information. Data brokers and companies create and utilize these profiles to categorize individuals and make inferences about their interests, beliefs, and behaviors. This aggregation of data, often without user knowledge or consent, creates detailed digital dossiers that can be used for surveillance, manipulation, and discriminatory practices, posing a significant threat to individual privacy.</p>
<p><b>(iii) Spyware:</b> Spyware is malicious software secretly installed on a user's computer or device without their knowledge or consent. Once installed, spyware can monitor user activity, capture keystrokes (including passwords and financial information), collect browsing history, access emails and messages, and even activate cameras and microphones. This data is then transmitted to a third party, often for malicious purposes like identity theft, financial fraud, or corporate espionage. Spyware represents a severe privacy threat as it operates covertly, collecting highly sensitive personal information without the user's awareness or ability to control it.</p>

<h3>2. (c) (6 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Biometric devices have been used to control access to highly secured data control rooms. Explain three ways in which this has been achieved.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Biometric devices enhance security in data control rooms by providing robust and reliable methods for access control.</p>
<p data-number="1"><b>Fingerprint Scanning:</b> Fingerprint scanners are widely used biometric devices for access control. They operate by capturing and analyzing the unique patterns of ridges and valleys on a person's fingertip. In data control rooms, fingerprint scanners are integrated into door access systems. Only authorized personnel whose fingerprints are registered in the system database are granted entry. This method is highly effective because fingerprints are unique to each individual and difficult to forge, ensuring only pre-approved individuals can physically access sensitive areas.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Iris Recognition:</b> Iris recognition technology analyzes the unique patterns in the iris, the colored part of the eye. Iris patterns are highly complex and stable over time, making them an exceptionally reliable biometric identifier. Iris scanners used for data control room access capture a high-resolution image of the iris and compare it to stored templates. This method offers a high level of security due to the uniqueness and difficulty in replicating iris patterns. It provides a non-contact and hygienic access control solution, suitable for sensitive environments.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Facial Recognition:</b> Facial recognition systems identify individuals by analyzing and comparing facial features from an image or video feed to a database of enrolled faces. In data control rooms, facial recognition can be used as a primary or secondary authentication method. Cameras at entry points capture facial images of individuals seeking access, and the system verifies their identity against authorized personnel. Facial recognition offers a convenient and non-intrusive access control method, especially when combined with other biometric or traditional security measures for multi-factor authentication.</p>

<h3>3. (a) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Outline two differences between a worm and a virus as used in computer security.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Computer worms and viruses are both types of malware, but they differ in their propagation and operational mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>Propagation Mechanism:</b> A primary difference is in how they spread. Computer viruses require a host program to attach themselves to and rely on user action (like opening an infected file or program) to propagate. In contrast, computer worms are self-replicating and can spread independently across networks without needing a host program or user intervention. Worms exploit network vulnerabilities to automatically propagate to other systems, making them capable of rapid and widespread dissemination.</p>
<p><b>Operational Impact:</b> While both can be destructive, their typical operational impacts differ. Viruses often focus on corrupting or deleting files on the infected host system and may remain dormant until a specific condition is met or a trigger event occurs. Worms, on the other hand, primarily focus on replicating and spreading, often consuming network bandwidth and system resources in the process. This network congestion and resource depletion can lead to system slowdowns, denial-of-service conditions, and can be exploited to carry secondary payloads like viruses or backdoors.</p>

<p>Explain two types of random access memory of a computer system.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Random Access Memory (RAM) is essential for computer operation, providing fast, temporary storage for actively used data. Two primary types of RAM are:</p>
<p><b>Static RAM (SRAM):</b> SRAM utilizes flip-flops to store each bit of data. It is characterized by its speed and low power consumption in idle mode, making it significantly faster than DRAM. SRAM does not require constant refreshing to retain data, which contributes to its speed. However, SRAM is more expensive and less dense than DRAM, meaning it stores fewer bits per unit area. SRAM is typically used for CPU caches where speed is paramount, despite the higher cost and lower density.</p>
<p><b>Dynamic RAM (DRAM):</b> DRAM uses capacitors to store each bit of data. Unlike SRAM, DRAM requires periodic refreshing (recharging the capacitors) to maintain data integrity, as capacitors leak charge over time. DRAM is slower than SRAM but is significantly cheaper and offers higher density, allowing for larger amounts of memory in a smaller physical space and at a lower cost. DRAM is the primary type of RAM used in main system memory due to its balance of performance, cost, and capacity.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>A commercial bank has offices in several floors of a building and other branches within the same city. The company intends to install a computer network to link all their offices. With the aid of a diagram, describe the most appropriate type of network for the company.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>For a commercial bank with offices in a multi-story building and branches within a city, a combination of network topologies is most appropriate to efficiently link all locations.</p>
<p><b>Network Type: Combination of LAN and MAN.</b></p>
<p><b>Diagram:</b> (Unfortunately, I am unable to create visual diagrams directly in this text-based format. However, I can describe the network structure to be visualized.)</p>
<p><b>Description:</b></p>
<p><b>Local Area Network (LAN) within each office building and branch:</b> Within each building (headquarters and branches), a Local Area Network (LAN) should be implemented. This LAN would typically utilize a star topology, with each computer and network device connecting to a central switch or router. Ethernet cabling or Wi-Fi would be used for connectivity within each location. The LAN would facilitate resource sharing (printers, file servers) and communication among employees within that specific office or branch.</p>
<p><b>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) connecting buildings and branches across the city:</b> To connect the headquarters building and the geographically dispersed branches within the city, a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) is required. A MAN would interconnect the LANs at each location, enabling communication and data sharing between branches and headquarters. Technologies like fiber optic cables or leased lines would be used to create the MAN infrastructure, providing high-speed and reliable connectivity across the metropolitan area. A central router or network infrastructure at the headquarters would manage the MAN and facilitate communication between all locations.</p>
<p><b>Justification:</b> This hybrid LAN/MAN approach is most suitable because:</p>
<p data-number="1"><b>Scalability and Manageability:</b> LANs within each location offer localized control and management, while the MAN provides city-wide connectivity, allowing for scalable network expansion as the bank grows.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Cost-Effectiveness:</b> LAN infrastructure within buildings is cost-effective and easy to deploy. Utilizing a MAN for inter-branch connectivity optimizes bandwidth and cost for wider area communication compared to extending LANs across the city.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Performance and Reliability:</b> Fiber optic MAN connections provide high bandwidth and reliability for inter-branch data transfer, essential for banking operations, while LANs ensure fast local network performance within each office.</p>
<p>In essence, the diagram would visually represent separate star topology LANs at each branch and headquarters, interconnected via a backbone representing the MAN, possibly using fiber optic lines, with a central point of connection and routing at the headquarters.</p>
