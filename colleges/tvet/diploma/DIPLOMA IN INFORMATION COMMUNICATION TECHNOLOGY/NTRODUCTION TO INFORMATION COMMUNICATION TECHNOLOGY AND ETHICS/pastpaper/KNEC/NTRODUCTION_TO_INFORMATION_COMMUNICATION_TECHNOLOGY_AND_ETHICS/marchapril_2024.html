</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Policy:</b></p>
<p>In ICT data protection, a policy is a high-level, formal document that outlines an organization's overarching stance and mandatory requirements regarding data protection. It defines the principles, objectives, and governance framework for data protection, setting the mandatory rules and expectations for data handling across the organization. Policies are authoritative and non-negotiable, establishing the 'what' and 'why' of data protection.</p>

<p>Differentiate between single-mode and multi-mode fibre optic cables.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Single-Mode Fiber Optic Cables:</b></p>
<p>Single-mode fiber optic cables are designed to transmit a single ray or mode of light through a very narrow glass core (around 9 microns in diameter). They are optimized for long-distance data transmission with minimal signal loss and high bandwidth capacity. Single-mode fibers use laser light sources and are typically more expensive due to their precision manufacturing.</p>
<p><b>Multi-Mode Fiber Optic Cables:</b></p>
<p>Multi-mode fiber optic cables have a larger core diameter (typically 50 or 62.5 microns) that allows multiple modes or rays of light to travel simultaneously. They are used for shorter-distance data transmission, such as within buildings or campuses. Multi-mode fibers use LED light sources and are generally less expensive than single-mode fibers but have lower bandwidth and higher signal attenuation over long distances.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>The primary difference is the core diameter and mode of light transmission. Single-mode fibers have a narrow core for a single light mode and long-distance, high-bandwidth transmission, while multi-mode fibers have a larger core for multiple light modes and shorter-distance applications. Single-mode is for long distances and higher cost, multi-mode for shorter distances and lower cost.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>Differentiate between leasing and outsourcing methods of software acquisition.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Leasing Software:</b></p>
<p>Leasing software, also known as software subscription, involves acquiring software access rights for a specific period through a recurring fee, typically monthly or annually. The software vendor retains ownership, and the lessee gains the right to use the software and receive updates and support during the lease term. Leasing often includes cloud-based software solutions and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models.</p>
<p><b>Outsourcing Software Acquisition:</b></p>
<p>Outsourcing software acquisition involves contracting a third-party company to develop, customize, or manage software solutions for an organization. The organization delegates software-related tasks, such as development, maintenance, and support, to an external provider, focusing on their core business functions while relying on external expertise for software needs. Outsourcing can include custom software development or managed software services.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>Leasing is about renting software usage rights, whereas outsourcing is about delegating software-related work to an external provider. Leasing focuses on access and usage, outsourcing on development and management. Leasing typically involves standardized software, while outsourcing can include custom solutions. Ownership remains with the vendor in leasing, while outsourcing can involve custom software ownership agreements.</p>
