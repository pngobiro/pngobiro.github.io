<div class="question-content">
<p>Annete a computer teacher noticed that a student in her class had a problem of low self esteem. Explain three causes of this problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><strong>Negative Feedback and Criticism:</strong> Consistent negative feedback or excessive criticism, especially in academic settings, can significantly erode a student's self-esteem. If a student frequently receives criticism without balanced positive reinforcement, they may internalize these negative messages and develop a belief in their inadequacy, leading to low self-esteem.</p>
<p data-number="2"><strong>Social Comparison and Peer Pressure:</strong> Students often compare themselves to their peers, particularly in academic performance and social acceptance. If a student perceives themselves as falling short compared to their classmates, or if they experience negative peer pressure and social exclusion, it can lead to feelings of inadequacy and lower their self-esteem. Social dynamics in the classroom can significantly impact a student's self-perception.</p>
<p data-number="3"><strong>Lack of Success and Achievements:</strong> A consistent lack of perceived success or achievements in academic tasks can contribute to low self-esteem. If a student struggles to meet academic expectations, faces repeated failures, or lacks opportunities to experience success, they may develop a diminished sense of competence and self-worth. Experiencing academic setbacks without adequate support to overcome them can be particularly damaging to self-esteem.</p>

<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><strong>Supercomputers:</strong></p>
<p>Supercomputers are the most powerful type of computers, designed for extremely high-speed processing and massive computational tasks. They are characterized by their ability to perform trillions of calculations per second (teraflops and petaflops). Supercomputers utilize parallel processing architectures with thousands of processors working in tandem to solve complex problems.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Application: Scientific Research and Complex Simulations.</strong> Supercomputers are primarily used in scientific research, engineering, and areas requiring intensive computation, such as weather forecasting, climate modeling, nuclear research, drug discovery, and complex simulations like aerodynamic testing and quantum mechanics calculations. They are essential for pushing the boundaries of scientific and engineering knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Mainframe Computers:</strong></p>
<p>Mainframe computers are large, powerful computers designed for processing very large volumes of data and handling thousands of transactions concurrently. While powerful, they are generally less computationally intensive than supercomputers but excel in reliability, security, and input/output operations for large-scale data processing and transaction management.</p>
<p><strong>Area of Application: Enterprise Data Processing and Transaction Management.</strong> Mainframes are widely used by large organizations like banks, insurance companies, and government agencies for critical applications such as processing financial transactions, managing customer databases, handling airline reservations, and managing large-scale data warehousing.

Implementing multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple verification factors (e.g., password and a code from a mobile device) before granting access. These measures significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised or weak credentials.</p>
<p data-number="2"><strong>Employ Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Organizations should use Access Control Lists and Role-Based Access Control to manage and restrict data access. ACLs define permissions for specific files or resources, while RBAC assigns access rights based on job roles and responsibilities. By implementing these controls, organizations ensure that users only have access to the data necessary for their job functions, minimizing the potential for unauthorized data exposure or breaches.</p>
<p data-number="3"><strong>Regular Security Audits and Monitoring:</strong> Conducting regular security audits and implementing continuous monitoring systems are crucial for detecting and preventing unauthorized access. Security audits assess vulnerabilities and compliance with security policies, while monitoring systems track user activities and system logs for suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts. Proactive monitoring and auditing enable timely detection and response to potential security threats and policy violations, enhancing overall data security.</p>

<p>Differentiate between RAM-and ROM as used in computers.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong></p>
<p>RAM is volatile memory used for temporary storage of data and instructions that the CPU is currently processing. Data in RAM is lost when the computer is powered off. RAM is read-write memory, meaning data can be both written to and read from RAM. It is crucial for the computer's active operations, providing fast access to data needed for running applications and the operating system.</p>
<p><strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory):</strong></p>
<p>ROM is non-volatile memory used for permanent storage of data that is typically written during manufacturing and is not meant to be altered by the user. Data in ROM is retained even when power is off. ROM is primarily read-only, meaning data can be read from ROM but not easily written to or changed. It stores essential firmware, like BIOS, needed for booting up the computer.</p>
<p><strong>Differentiation:</strong></p>
<p>The key distinction lies in volatility and data modification. RAM is volatile, temporary, and read-write, used for active processing. ROM is non-volatile, permanent, and read-only (or mostly read-only), used for storing fixed, essential instructions. RAM is for working memory, while ROM is for permanent boot instructions.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>Nicholson bought a computer software package on a DVD which he intends to use in his computer. Explain three benefits of installing the software on the computer hard disk instead of running the software directly from the DVD.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1">Faster Software Loading and Execution: Installing software on the hard disk allows for significantly faster loading and execution times compared to running it directly from a DVD. Hard disks, especially Solid State Drives (SSDs), offer much quicker data access speeds than DVD-ROM drives. Software installed on the hard disk can be accessed and run almost instantaneously, enhancing performance and user experience.</p>
<p data-number="2">Improved Software Responsiveness and Performance: Software runs more smoothly and responsively when installed on the hard disk. The faster data access reduces delays and lag associated with accessing data from a DVD, leading to improved software performance, smoother operation, and enhanced user interaction. Applications installed on the hard disk can utilize system resources more efficiently, resulting in better overall performance.</p>
<p data-number="3">Reduced Wear and Tear on DVD-ROM Drive and DVD Media: Running software directly from a DVD requires constant reading from the DVD-ROM drive and continuous spinning of the DVD media. This constant activity can lead to increased wear and tear on both the DVD-ROM drive and the DVD disc itself, potentially shortening their lifespan. Installing software on the hard disk eliminates the need to continuously use the DVD-ROM drive and DVD, reducing hardware wear and extending the longevity of both the drive and media.</p>
