<div class="question-content">
<p>Wireless Internet is prone to unauthorized user access. Explain three measures that could be used to mitigate this problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>To mitigate unauthorized access to wireless internet networks, several robust security measures can be implemented.</p>
<p data-number="1"><b>Strong Encryption Protocols (WPA3/WPA2):</b> Utilize strong encryption protocols such as Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) or Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). WPA3 and WPA2 encryption methods secure wireless communication by encrypting data transmitted over the network, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized users to intercept and decrypt wireless traffic, thus preventing eavesdropping and unauthorized access.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Strong Password and Access Control:</b> Implement a strong and unique password for the Wi-Fi network and regularly change it. Use a complex password that combines uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Additionally, enable access control features such as MAC address filtering to restrict network access to only authorized devices. Strong passwords and access control mechanisms prevent unauthorized users from easily guessing or cracking the Wi-Fi password and gaining network access.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Disable WPS and Enable Firewall:</b> Disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) as it is known to have security vulnerabilities that can be exploited for unauthorized access.
