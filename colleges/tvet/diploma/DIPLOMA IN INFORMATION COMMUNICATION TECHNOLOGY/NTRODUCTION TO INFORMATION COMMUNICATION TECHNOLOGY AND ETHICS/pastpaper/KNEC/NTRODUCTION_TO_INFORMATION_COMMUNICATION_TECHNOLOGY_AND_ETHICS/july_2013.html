<div class="question-content">
<p>Distinguish between personal responsibility and corporate social responsibility as used in ICT and ethics.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><strong>Personal Responsibility:</strong></p>
<p>Personal responsibility in ICT and ethics refers to the ethical obligations and accountability of individual ICT users or professionals. It emphasizes the moral duty of individuals to act ethically in their use of technology, including respecting intellectual property, protecting privacy, and using technology responsibly.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Social Responsibility:</strong></p>
<p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in ICT and ethics pertains to the broader ethical obligations of organizations operating in the ICT sector. It extends beyond legal compliance and focuses on a company's commitment to ethical and sustainable practices. CSR includes environmental sustainability, ethical sourcing of materials, fair labor practices, and contributing positively to the community through technology.</p>
<p><strong>Key Differences:</strong> Personal responsibility is focused on individual conduct, while corporate social responsibility addresses organizational-level ethics and societal impact.

<h3>2. (b) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Distinguish between peer-to-peer and client-server as used in computer networks.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><strong>Peer-to-Peer Network:</strong></p>
<p>In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, computers act as both clients and servers. There is no central server; instead, each computer (peer) can directly share resources and communicate with other computers on the network. P2P networks are characterized by decentralized control and ease of setup, often used for file sharing and small networks.</p>
<p><strong>Client-Server Network:</strong></p>
<p>In a client-server network, there are dedicated servers that provide resources and services, and clients that request and utilize these services. Servers are centralized and manage network resources, security, and access. Client-server networks are designed for scalability, security, and centralized administration, commonly used in enterprise environments and the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Key Differences:</strong> Peer-to-peer networks are decentralized with no dedicated servers, while client-server networks are centralized with dedicated servers. P2P is simpler to set up and less secure, whereas client-server is more complex but offers better security and scalability.</p>

<p>Kudu intends to acquire a printer using the lease method. Explain three circumstances that may have contributed to this method of acquisition.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
