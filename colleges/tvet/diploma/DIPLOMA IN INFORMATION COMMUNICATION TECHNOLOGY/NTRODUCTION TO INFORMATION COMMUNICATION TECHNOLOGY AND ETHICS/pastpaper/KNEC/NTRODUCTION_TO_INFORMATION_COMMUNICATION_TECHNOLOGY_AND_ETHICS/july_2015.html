<div class="question-content">
<p>With the aid of a diagram in each case, explain the difference between COM and VGA computer ports.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><strong>COM Port (Serial Port):</strong></p>
<p>A COM port, or serial port, is an older type of port used for serial communication. Diagrammatically, a COM port is represented by a D-sub connector, typically with 9 pins (DB9) or 25 pins (DB25). In a diagram, it would show a trapezoidal shape with pins arranged in two or more rows. It transmits data one bit at a time, sequentially, making it slower than parallel ports but suitable for long-distance communication and simpler devices.</p>
<p><strong>VGA Port (Video Graphics Array):</strong></p>
<p>A VGA port is a standard port for video output from a computer to a monitor or projector. Diagrammatically, a VGA port is also represented by a D-sub connector, specifically a 15-pin connector arranged in three rows (DB15). In a diagram, it would show a similar trapezoidal shape but with 15 pins in a denser arrangement. It transmits analog video signals, using separate pins for red, green, blue color components, as well as synchronization signals.</p>
<p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>
<p>The primary difference lies in their function and communication method. COM ports are for serial data communication, typically for peripherals like modems or older mice, transmitting data bit by bit. VGA ports are specifically for video output, transmitting analog video signals to display devices. Visually, they can be distinguished by the number of pins and their internal wiring, although both use D-sub connectors. Modern computers are phasing out COM ports in favor of USB and other faster interfaces, while VGA is being replaced by digital video interfaces like HDMI and DisplayPort.</p>

<h3>1. (c) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Distinguish between device driver and storage drive as used in computer software.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><strong>Device Driver:</strong></p>
<p>A device driver is a software program that enables the operating system to interact with a hardware device. It acts as a translator between the operating system and the hardware. Without a device driver, the operating system would not be able to recognize and properly utilize the hardware, such as a printer, graphics card, or network adapter. Device drivers are specific to the operating system and the hardware they support.</p>
<p><strong>Storage Drive:</strong></p>
<p>A storage drive is a hardware component used for storing digital data. Examples include Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), Solid State Drives (SSDs), and USB flash drives. Storage drives physically store files, applications, and the operating system itself. They are accessed and managed by the operating system through file systems. Storage drives are characterized by their capacity, speed, and type of storage technology.</p>
<p><strong>Distinction:</strong></p>
<p>The key distinction is that a device driver is software that facilitates communication between the operating system and hardware, whereas a storage drive is the physical hardware itself responsible for data storage. Device drivers are essential for the operating system to utilize storage drives (and other hardware) effectively.</p>

</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><strong>Power Management:</strong> Computer users can enable power-saving settings on their devices. This includes setting monitors to automatically turn off after a period of inactivity, utilizing sleep or hibernate modes for computers during breaks, and unplugging devices and chargers when not in use to reduce standby power consumption. These practices collectively minimize energy wastage and lower carbon footprint associated with electricity usage.</p>
<p data-number="2"><strong>Responsible Disposal and Recycling of E-waste:</strong> Users should properly dispose of old or obsolete computer equipment and peripherals through certified e-waste recycling programs. E-waste contains hazardous materials that can harm the environment if improperly discarded in landfills. Recycling recovers valuable materials, reduces the need for new resource extraction, and prevents environmental contamination. Users should avoid throwing electronics in regular trash and seek out designated collection points or recycling facilities.</p>
<p data-number="3"><strong>Promoting Paperless Practices:</strong> Computer users can reduce paper consumption by adopting digital workflows. This involves reading documents on-screen instead of printing, using digital note-taking and collaboration tools, and storing documents electronically rather than in hard copy. Reducing paper usage conserves forests, decreases the energy and resources needed for paper production, and minimizes waste generation. Encouraging digital communication and document management helps in moving towards a more sustainable, paper-light environment.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>Distinguish between open and limited tender methods of computer hardware acquisition.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><strong>Open Tender:</strong></p>
<p>Open tender, also known as public tender, is a procurement method where the invitation to bid for the supply of goods or services is advertised publicly and is open to all eligible suppliers. This method aims to maximize competition, ensure transparency, and achieve the best possible value for money. Any vendor meeting the specified criteria can submit a bid. It is commonly used for government and public sector procurements to ensure fairness and accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Tender:</strong></p>
<p>Limited tender, also known as restricted tender or selective tender, is a procurement method where the invitation to bid is sent only to a select list of pre-qualified or known suppliers. This method is used when there are a limited number of suppliers capable of providing the required goods or services, or when time is of the essence, or for reasons of confidentiality or security. It is less transparent than open tendering but can be more efficient in specific situations.</p>
<p><strong>Distinction:</strong></p>
<p>The key distinction is that open tender is public and open to all eligible bidders, promoting wide competition, whereas limited tender is restricted to a select group of suppliers, often used for specialized needs or when efficiency and speed are prioritized over broad competition.</p>

<p>Distinguish between broadcast and point-to-point as used in computer networks.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><strong>Broadcast Communication:</strong></p>
<p>In broadcast communication, data is transmitted from a single sender to all devices on the network simultaneously. When a device sends a broadcast message, every other device on the network receives and processes it. This is commonly used in local area networks (LANs), such as Ethernet networks, for tasks like address resolution (ARP) where a device needs to find the MAC address associated with an IP address and sends a broadcast request to all devices on the network.</p>
<p><strong>Point-to-Point Communication:</strong></p>
<p>In point-to-point communication, data is transmitted directly between two specific devices on a network. There is a dedicated communication channel established between the sender and receiver. This type of communication is used for one-to-one data transfer, such as when a client requests a webpage from a web server or when transferring a file between two computers. Examples include direct cable connections or virtual private network (VPN) tunnels.</p>
<p><strong>Distinction:</strong></p>
<p>The key distinction is in the communication scope. Broadcast is one-to-all, where a single transmission reaches every device on the network, while point-to-point is one-to-one, involving a direct and dedicated link between two specific devices for data exchange.</p>
