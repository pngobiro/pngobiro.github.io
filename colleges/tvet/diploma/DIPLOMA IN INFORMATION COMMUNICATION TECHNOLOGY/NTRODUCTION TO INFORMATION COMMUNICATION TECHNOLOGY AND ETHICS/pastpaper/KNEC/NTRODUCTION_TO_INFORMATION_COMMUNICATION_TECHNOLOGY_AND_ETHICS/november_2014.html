<div class="question-content">
<p>Outline three advantages of using materials stored on a CD ROM over the Internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><strong>Offline Accessibility:</strong> CD-ROM materials are accessible offline, meaning users do not require an active internet connection to access the stored content. This is advantageous in areas with limited or no internet access, or when consistent access is needed without relying on network availability.</p>
<p data-number="2"><strong>Data Security and Control:</strong> Materials on a CD-ROM are less vulnerable to online security threats such as hacking or data breaches compared to content accessed over the internet. The data is physically stored and controlled by the user, providing a higher degree of security and privacy for sensitive information.</p>
<p data-number="3"><strong>Permanent and Stable Access:</strong> Once data is written on a CD-ROM, it is generally permanent and stable, assuming the disc is properly stored and handled. Unlike internet content which can be altered, removed, or become unavailable due to website changes or server issues, CD-ROM content remains consistent and accessible over a long period.</p>

<p>Joseph aspires to motivate students through public speech. Describe three communication skills he should possess in order to achieve his objective.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><strong>Verbal Communication and Clarity:</strong> Joseph must possess strong verbal communication skills, which include clear articulation, appropriate pacing, and varied vocal tone to maintain audience engagement. Clarity in language is essential to ensure his message is easily understood by the students. He should avoid jargon or complex terms and use precise language to convey his points effectively.

Joseph needs to utilize positive body language, including maintaining eye contact with the audience, using purposeful gestures, and having confident posture. These non-verbal elements enhance his message, project confidence, and establish a connection with the students. His body language should reinforce his verbal message and contribute to a compelling and motivational presentation.</p>
<p data-number="3"><strong>Audience Engagement and Adaptability:</strong> To motivate students, Joseph must be able to engage his audience actively. This involves understanding the students' interests and tailoring his speech to resonate with them. He should incorporate techniques to maintain their attention, such as storytelling, humor, and rhetorical questions. Adaptability is also crucial; Joseph should be able to adjust his delivery and content based on the audience's reactions and the overall atmosphere, ensuring his motivational message is effectively received and impactful.</p>

</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Based on Figure 2, the network topology depicted is a <strong>Bus Topology</strong>.</p>
<p data-number="1"><strong>Single Point of Failure:</strong> A major disadvantage of a bus topology is that the backbone cable acts as a single point of failure. If the backbone cable fails or is damaged at any point, the entire network will go down, and communication between all devices will be disrupted. This lack of redundancy makes the network vulnerable and less reliable.</p>
<p data-number="2"><strong>Difficult Troubleshooting and Limited Scalability:</strong> Troubleshooting network problems in a bus topology can be challenging. Identifying the source of a fault can be difficult as all devices share the same cable. Adding new devices to the network can also be problematic as it can degrade network performance due to increased traffic and potential signal collisions. Bus topologies are not easily scalable and are less suitable for larger networks.</p>

<p>Distinguish between magnetic and optical media devices giving an example in each case.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><strong>Magnetic Media Devices:</strong></p>
<p>Magnetic media devices store data by magnetically encoding it on a magnetic surface. Data is written and read by magnetic heads that alter or detect the magnetic orientation of particles on the storage medium. Magnetic media devices are generally known for their relatively high storage capacity and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Hard Disk Drive (HDD):</strong> A hard disk drive is a magnetic storage device that uses rotating platters coated with magnetic material to store data. It is a common internal storage device in computers, offering large storage capacities at a relatively low cost per gigabyte. HDDs are used for storing operating systems, applications, and user data.</p>
<p><strong>Optical Media Devices:</strong></p>
<p>Optical media devices use lasers to read and write data on optical discs. Data is stored as patterns of pits and lands on the disc surface, which are read by a laser beam. Optical media devices are known for their portability and durability, and they are less susceptible to magnetic interference.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Blu-ray Disc (BD):</strong> A Blu-ray disc is an optical storage medium used for storing high-definition video and large amounts of data. It uses a blue laser to read and write data, allowing for higher storage densities compared to CDs and DVDs. Blu-ray discs are used for distributing movies in high definition, video game storage, and data backup.</p>
<p><strong>Distinction:</strong></p>
<p>The key distinction lies in the technology used for data storage. Magnetic media uses magnetic encoding, while optical media uses lasers and optical patterns. Magnetic media like HDDs typically offer larger capacities and faster speeds for internal storage, whereas optical media like Blu-ray discs are more portable and suitable for data distribution and archival purposes.</p>

<p>Explain the reason for storing firmware in ROM rather than in the hard disk.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Firmware is stored in ROM (Read-Only Memory) rather than the hard disk because ROM is non-volatile memory, meaning it retains data even when the power is turned off. Firmware needs to be readily available and unchangeable to initiate the boot process and control basic hardware functions when the computer is powered on, before the operating system and hard disk are accessible.</p>

<p>Susan encountered the options Upgrade, Uninstall and Repair when she was installing software in her computer. Explain the circumstance under which each option is applicable.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><strong>Upgrade:</strong> The <strong>Upgrade</strong> option is applicable when Susan wants to install a newer version of software that she already has installed on her computer. Upgrading allows her to move from an older version to a more recent one, typically to gain access to new features, performance improvements, security updates, or bug fixes. The upgrade process generally aims to preserve existing user settings and data from the previous version while installing the newer software components.</p>
<p data-number="2"><strong>Uninstall:</strong> The <strong>Uninstall</strong> option is applicable when Susan wants to completely remove software from her computer. This option is used when she no longer needs the software, wants to free up disk space, or needs to resolve software conflicts or issues by removing the existing installation. Uninstalling typically removes program files, related data, and registry entries associated with the software, effectively removing it from the system.</p>
<p data-number="3"><strong>Repair:</strong> The <strong>Repair</strong> option is applicable when Susan's existing software installation is malfunctioning or corrupted. Repairing attempts to fix issues with the software installation without removing it entirely. It typically involves reinstalling or replacing damaged or missing program files, restoring default settings, or reconfiguring software components to restore the software to a working state. Repair is used to troubleshoot and fix problems with a current installation, rather than removing or upgrading the software.</p>
