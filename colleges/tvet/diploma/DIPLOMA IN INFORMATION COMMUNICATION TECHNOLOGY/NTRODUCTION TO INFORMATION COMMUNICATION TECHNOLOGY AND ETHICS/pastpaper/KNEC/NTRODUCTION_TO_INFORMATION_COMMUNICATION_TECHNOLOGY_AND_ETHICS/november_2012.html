<div class="question-content">
<p>Outline four challenges that an organization could encounter while undertaking social responsibility in ICT.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Organizations undertaking social responsibility in ICT may face several challenges:</p>
<p data-number="1"><b>Cost of Implementation:</b> Implementing socially responsible ICT initiatives can be expensive. This involves financial investments in new technologies, infrastructure upgrades, employee training, and ongoing maintenance to ensure ethical and sustainable practices are embedded within ICT operations.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Measuring Impact and ROI:</b> Quantifying the social and environmental impact of ICT initiatives is complex. It is difficult to establish clear metrics and collect data to demonstrate the return on investment (ROI) for social responsibility efforts, making it challenging to justify these investments to stakeholders.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Stakeholder Engagement and Conflicting Interests:</b> Engaging with diverse stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities, and regulatory bodies, is crucial for effective social responsibility. However, balancing potentially conflicting interests and expectations among these groups can be a significant challenge.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Keeping Pace with Evolving Ethical Standards and Regulations:</b> The field of ICT ethics and social responsibility is constantly evolving due to rapid technological advancements and changing societal norms. Organizations must continuously monitor and adapt to new ethical standards, legal requirements, and best practices to maintain responsible ICT operations.</p>

<h3>1. (b) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Differentiate between serial port and parallel port as used in computers.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Serial Port:</b></p>
<p>A serial port transmits data one bit at a time, sequentially, over a single wire pair. It is commonly used for devices that do not require high-speed data transfer, such as modems, mice, and older printers. Serial ports are characterized by their simplicity and ability to transmit data over longer distances reliably.</p>
<p><b>Parallel Port:</b></p>
<p>A parallel port transmits multiple bits of data simultaneously over multiple wires (typically 8 bits or a byte at a time). Historically used for printers and scanners, parallel ports offer faster data transfer rates than serial ports for short distances. However, they are more complex and prone to data corruption over longer distances due to synchronization issues between the parallel data streams.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>The primary difference lies in the method of data transmission: serial ports transmit data bit by bit sequentially, while parallel ports transmit data in multiple bits simultaneously. Serial ports are simpler, slower, and better for long distances, whereas parallel ports are faster for short distances but more complex and less reliable over long distances. Parallel ports are largely obsolete in modern computers, replaced by faster serial technologies like USB.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>Janet owns an ICT consulting firm in a busy town with a number of employees. The space she has for the office is not enough to accommodate all employees.</p>
<p>(i) Describe two approaches in modern telecommunication application she could adopt to ensure that she maximizes employees output.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Remote Desktop Services/Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI):</b> Janet could implement a remote desktop solution. This allows employees to access their work desktops and applications remotely from any location with an internet connection. Using technologies like Citrix or VMware, employees can log in from home or other locations and work as if they were in the office. This approach maximizes output by enabling employees to work regardless of physical office space limitations.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Cloud-Based Collaboration and Communication Tools:</b> Janet can leverage cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, or Slack. These platforms offer tools for communication (email, instant messaging, video conferencing), collaboration (shared documents, project management tools), and file storage in the cloud. Employees can work collaboratively on projects, communicate effectively, and access necessary resources from anywhere, boosting productivity without needing to be physically present in a crowded office.</p>

<h3>1. (c) (2 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>(ii) Outline two benefits other than office space that her firm would derive from the approaches described in (i).</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Increased Employee Flexibility and Satisfaction:</b> Remote work options enhance employee work-life balance by eliminating commutes and offering flexibility in work schedules. This can lead to increased employee satisfaction, reduced stress, and improved morale, ultimately boosting productivity and reducing employee turnover.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Wider Talent Pool and Reduced Overhead Costs:</b> By adopting remote work solutions, Janet's firm can access a wider talent pool, as geographical location becomes less of a constraint in hiring. Furthermore, reduced reliance on physical office space can lead to lower overhead costs, such as rent, utilities, and office maintenance, resulting in significant financial savings for the firm.</p>

</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Poor Communication:</b> Ineffective or lack of clear communication channels within the NGO can lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations of tasks, and unmet expectations. This can result in conflicts arising from unclear roles, responsibilities, and project objectives among team members.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Resource Scarcity:</b> Limited resources such as budget constraints, inadequate equipment, or insufficient staffing can create competition and tension among employees. When individuals or departments feel they are not adequately resourced to perform their duties, it can breed conflict and resentment.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Differing Personalities and Work Styles:</b> Conflicts can stem from clashes in personalities, values, or work styles among team members. Disagreements on approaches to tasks, communication preferences, or interpersonal friction can escalate into conflicts if not managed effectively.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Lack of Clear Procedures and Policies:</b> Absence of well-defined organizational procedures and policies, particularly in areas like decision-making, task allocation, and conflict resolution, can lead to ambiguity and disputes. When employees are unsure of processes or feel that procedures are unfair, it can trigger conflicts.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>(ii) Explain two conflict resolution techniques that Juma could propose to the NGO's management.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Mediation:</b> Juma could propose mediation, where a neutral third party, such as a trained mediator or an HR representative, facilitates communication between conflicting parties. The mediator helps disputants clarify issues, understand each other's perspectives, and explore mutually acceptable solutions. Mediation is a voluntary process aimed at reaching a resolution agreed upon by the parties themselves, fostering collaboration and preserving relationships.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Collaborative Problem Solving:</b> Juma could recommend a collaborative problem-solving approach. This technique involves bringing conflicting parties together to jointly identify the root causes of the conflict and generate solutions together. It emphasizes open dialogue, active listening, and a focus on shared goals. By working collaboratively, employees can develop mutually beneficial outcomes that address the underlying issues causing the conflict and improve team dynamics.</p>

<h3>4. (d) (i) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>(d) (i) Distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous data transmission.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Synchronous Data Transmission:</b></p>
<p>Synchronous data transmission is a method where data is transmitted in continuous blocks or frames, with the sender and receiver clocks synchronized. Data bits are transmitted at a constant rate, and timing signals are used to ensure that the receiver knows when to expect each bit. Start and stop bits are not required for each character, as synchronization is maintained throughout the transmission. This method is efficient for transmitting large volumes of data at high speeds.</p>
<p><b>Asynchronous Data Transmission:</b></p>
<p>Asynchronous data transmission is a method where data is transmitted character by character, with each character framed by start and stop bits. There is no continuous clock synchronization between the sender and receiver. The start bit signals the beginning of a character, and the stop bit indicates the end. This method is simpler to implement and suitable for transmitting data at irregular intervals, such as keyboard input or low-speed communications.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>The primary distinction lies in synchronization and data framing. Synchronous transmission relies on continuous clock synchronization and transmits data in blocks without start/stop bits per character, offering higher speed and efficiency for large data volumes. Asynchronous transmission uses start and stop bits for each character, does not require continuous synchronization, is simpler, and is better suited for intermittent data transmission at lower speeds.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>7.. (a) (i) Citing an example in each case, distinguish between volatile and non volatile memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Volatile Memory:</b></p>
<p>Volatile memory is a type of computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information. When power is turned off, the data stored in volatile memory is lost. Random Access Memory (RAM) is a primary example of volatile memory. RAM is used as the main memory in computers to store data and instructions that the CPU is actively using. For instance, when you are working on a document in a word processor, the text you are typing is stored in RAM. If there is a power outage or the computer is turned off without saving, this unsaved data in RAM will be lost.</p>
<p><b>Non-Volatile Memory:</b></p>
<p>Non-volatile memory is a type of computer memory that retains stored information even when power is removed. Data in non-volatile memory is preserved across power cycles. Examples of non-volatile memory include Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), Solid State Drives (SSDs), and Read-Only Memory (ROM). For example, the operating system, applications, and files stored on an SSD remain intact even when the computer is powered off. ROM, another non-volatile memory, stores firmware or boot instructions that are essential for starting up the computer and are retained permanently.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>The fundamental difference is data retention with and without power. Volatile memory loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM), while non-volatile memory retains data even without power (e.g., SSD, ROM). Volatile memory is typically faster and used for active data processing, whereas non-volatile memory is used for long-term data storage. Volatility is the key distinguishing characteristic between these memory types.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>(ii) Outline four functions of a control unit in a computer system.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Instruction Fetching:</b> The control unit fetches instructions from the main memory (RAM). It retrieves the next instruction to be executed based on the program counter, which holds the address of the next instruction in sequence. Fetching instructions is the first step in the instruction execution cycle.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Instruction Decoding:</b> Once an instruction is fetched, the control unit decodes it to understand the operation to be performed and the operands involved. Decoding involves interpreting the instruction's opcode and operand fields to determine what actions the computer needs to take and which data to use.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Instruction Execution Control:</b> The control unit generates control signals to direct other components of the CPU, such as the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), registers, and memory, to perform the operations specified by the decoded instruction. It manages the sequence of operations needed to execute each instruction, ensuring proper coordination between CPU components.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Data Transfer Management:</b> The control unit manages the flow of data between different components of the computer system, including memory, registers, and input/output devices. It generates control signals to initiate data transfers, specify data sources and destinations, and synchronize data movement within the system. This function ensures that data is available to the CPU when needed and stored correctly after processing.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>(b) A college with a computer laboratory consisting of twenty computers would like to employ hardware techniques to reduce computer virus infection. Outline four such techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>BIOS-Level Write Protection:</b> Implement BIOS-level write protection on the computer hard drives. Some BIOS settings allow administrators to enable write protection, making the hard drive read-only during normal operation. This prevents viruses from writing to the disk and making persistent changes, reducing the risk of infection. However, this method needs careful management as it can also restrict legitimate software installations and updates.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Hardware Firewalls:</b> Deploy a hardware firewall at the network perimeter of the computer laboratory. A hardware firewall acts as a security gateway, inspecting network traffic and blocking unauthorized access and malicious traffic before it reaches individual computers. Configuring the firewall to filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules and protocols can significantly reduce the risk of network-borne virus infections.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Trusted Platform Module (TPM):</b> Utilize Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) in the computers. TPM is a hardware security module that provides hardware-based security functions, such as secure boot and cryptographic key storage. Secure boot ensures that only authorized software and operating systems are loaded during startup, preventing boot-level malware infections. TPM can also store encryption keys securely, enhancing data protection and integrity.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Network Segmentation and VLANs:</b> Segment the computer laboratory network using Virtual LANs (VLANs). VLANs divide a physical network into multiple logical networks, isolating different groups of computers. By placing the lab computers in a separate VLAN from the college's main network, you can contain virus outbreaks within the lab network, limiting the spread of infections to other parts of the college's IT infrastructure. Network segmentation enhances security and reduces the impact of potential breaches.</p>
