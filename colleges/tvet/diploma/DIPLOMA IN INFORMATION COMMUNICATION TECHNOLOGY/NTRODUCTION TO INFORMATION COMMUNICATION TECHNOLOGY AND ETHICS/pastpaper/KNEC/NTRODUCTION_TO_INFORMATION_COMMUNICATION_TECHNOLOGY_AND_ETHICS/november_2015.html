<p>Sawa Company Ltd. are experiencing internal hacking of their computer system. Outline four possible root causes of the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Internal hacking at Sawa Company Ltd. suggests vulnerabilities within their system. Possible root causes include:</p>
<p data-number="1"><b>Weak Password Policies:</b> Inadequate password policies, such as allowing employees to use weak or easily guessable passwords, can be a significant root cause. Weak passwords make it easier for internal individuals to gain unauthorized access to accounts and systems through password cracking or guessing.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Insider Threats (Malicious or Negligent Employees):</b> Disgruntled or negligent employees with internal access can intentionally or unintentionally cause hacking incidents. Malicious insiders may seek to steal data or disrupt systems, while negligent employees may inadvertently compromise security through poor practices or lack of awareness.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Insufficient Access Controls:</b> Lack of proper access controls, such as inadequate user permissions or failure to implement role-based access control, can allow employees excessive access to sensitive data and systems beyond their job requirements. Overly broad access permissions increase the risk of unauthorized data access and internal hacking.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Vulnerabilities in Internal Network Security:</b> Weaknesses in the company's internal network security, such as unpatched systems, misconfigured firewalls, or lack of intrusion detection systems, can create opportunities for internal hacking. Internal network vulnerabilities can be exploited by individuals within the network to gain unauthorized access to systems and data.</p>

<p>With the aid of diagrams in each case, explain two categories of computer networks based on how information is shared.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(c) (i) With the aid of diagrams in each case, explain two categories of computer networks based on how information is shared.</b></p>
<p><b>1. Client-Server Network:</b></p>
<p><b>Diagram:</b> (A diagram showing a central Server connected to multiple Clients. Arrows depict requests from Clients to the Server and responses from the Server back to Clients.)</p>
<p><b>Explanation:</b> In a client-server network, information sharing is centralized. A dedicated server stores and manages resources, data, and applications. Client computers request services or data from the server, and the server responds to these requests. Information is primarily shared from the server to clients, with clients relying on the server for resources. This model is efficient for managing shared resources and ensuring data consistency and security.</p>
<p><b>2. Peer-to-Peer Network:</b></p>
<p><b>Diagram:</b> (A diagram showing multiple computers (Peers) directly connected to each other without a central server. Arrows indicate data sharing directly between peers.)</p>
<p><b>Explanation:</b> In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, information sharing is decentralized. Each computer (peer) can act as both a client and a server, sharing resources directly with other peers. Information is shared directly between connected computers without relying on a central server. P2P networks are suitable for small groups or direct file sharing, but lack centralized management and security.</p>

<p>(ii) Explain two circumstances that could necessitate the use of hybrid topology in a computer network.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(ii) Explain two circumstances that could necessitate the use of hybrid topology in a computer network.</b></p>
<p data-number="1"><b>Integrating Different Network Needs:</b> When an organization has diverse networking needs across different departments or locations, a hybrid topology may be necessary. For instance, a star topology might be used for the main office for centralized management, while a bus or ring topology could be implemented in a smaller branch office due to cost or simplicity. Combining topologies allows for tailored solutions to meet varied requirements within the same organization.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Gradual Network Expansion and Integration:</b> During network expansion or when integrating existing networks from mergers or acquisitions, a hybrid topology might be adopted. Organizations may initially have different network topologies in various parts of their infrastructure. To integrate these disparate networks effectively and gradually, a hybrid approach allows for combining existing topologies while transitioning towards a more unified and scalable network architecture over time.</p>
