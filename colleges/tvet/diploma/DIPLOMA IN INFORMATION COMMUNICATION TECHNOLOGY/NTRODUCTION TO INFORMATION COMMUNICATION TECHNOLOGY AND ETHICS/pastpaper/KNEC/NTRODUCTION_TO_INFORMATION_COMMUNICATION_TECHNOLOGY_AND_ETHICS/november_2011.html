<p><b>Mesh Network Topology:</b></p>
<p>A mesh network topology is a network setup where devices (nodes) are interconnected directly and dynamically, with each node acting as a relay for the network. In a full mesh topology, every node is connected to every other node in the network, providing multiple paths for data transmission. In a partial mesh, some nodes are connected to multiple but not all other nodes. Mesh networks are characterized by redundancy, self-healing capabilities, and robust communication paths.</p>
<p><b>Diagram:</b> (Unfortunately, I cannot generate visual diagrams in this text-based format. Imagine a diagram with multiple nodes, each represented as a circle, and lines connecting each node to several or all other nodes in the network. The lines should crisscross, showing interconnections between many devices, creating a 'mesh' like structure.)</p>
<p><b>Description based on Diagram:</b> In a mesh network, each device is directly connected to several other devices, creating a web-like structure. Data can travel from a source to a destination node through multiple paths. If one path fails, data can be rerouted through alternative paths, ensuring network resilience. Mesh topologies are highly fault-tolerant and reliable due to this redundancy and distributed nature.</p>

<p>(c) (i) Explain the reason for storing firmware in ROM rather than in the hard disk.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Firmware is stored in ROM (Read-Only Memory) rather than a hard disk because ROM is non-volatile and retains its contents even when power is turned off. Firmware, such as BIOS or UEFI, contains essential boot instructions needed to start a computer. Storing it in ROM ensures that these critical instructions are always available and cannot be accidentally erased or modified, guaranteeing the system can reliably boot up every time it is powered on. Hard disks are volatile and require an operating system to be loaded first, making them unsuitable for storing initial boot firmware.</p>
