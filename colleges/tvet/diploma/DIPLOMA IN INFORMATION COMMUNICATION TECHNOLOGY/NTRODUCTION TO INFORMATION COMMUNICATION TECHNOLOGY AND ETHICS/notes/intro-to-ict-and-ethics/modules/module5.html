                    <p><b>DATA AND DATA PROCESSING</b></p>
                    <p>Data are raw, unprocessed and unorganized (unstructured) facts and figures relating to business activity. Data by itself has no meaning until when related data are brought together. Example is the no of items sold, names of customers etc.</p>
                    <p>Information is obtained by assembling data items into meaningful form for example the payroll, an invoice, financial statement, or a report.</p>
                    <p><b>Data processing</b> is the process of collecting and manipulating data items to produce meaningful information.</p>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h3>DATA PROCESSING CYCLE</h3>
                        <div class="content-block">
                            <p>The data processing cycle is the order in which data is processed. There are four stages:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Data collection</b></li>
                                <li><b>Data input</b></li>
                                <li><b>Data processing and storage</b></li>
                                <li><b>Data output</b></li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>1. DATA COLLECTION</h4>
                            <p>There are several data-collection techniques that allow us to systematically collect data and include the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Using available information</b>
                                <p>Usually there is a large amount of data that has already been collected by others, although it may not necessarily have been analyzed or published. Locating these sources and retrieving the information is a good starting point in any data collection effort.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Observing</b>
                                <p>This is being part of the system where the person collecting data systematically selects, watches and records specific situation or type of situations.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Interviewing (face-to-face)</b>
                                <p>An interview is a data-collection technique that involves oral questioning of respondents, either individually or as a group.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Administering written questionnaires</b>
                                <p>A written questionnaire (also referred to as self-administered questionnaire) is a data collection tool in which written questions are presented that are to be answered by the respondents in written form.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Focus group discussions</b>
                                <p>A focus group discussion allows a group of 8 - 12 informants to freely discuss a certain subject with the guidance of a facilitator or reporter.</p></li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>2. DATA INPUT</h4>
                            <p>It is the process through which collected data is <b>transformed into a form</b> that the computer can understand. It is a very important step because correct output result totally depends on the input data. In this stage, the following activities are to be performed.</p>
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li><b>Verification</b>
                                <p>The collected data is verified to determine whether it is correct as required. If errors occur in collected data, data is corrected or it is collected again.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Coding</b>
                                <p>The verified data is coded or <b>converted</b> into machine readable form so that it can be processed through computer.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Storing</b>
                                <p>The data is stored on the secondary storage into a file. The stored data on the storage media will be given to the program as input for processing.</p></li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>3. DATA PROCESSING AND STORAGE</h4>
                            <p>The main purpose of data processing is to get the required result. In this stage, the following activities can be performed in a systematic manner. Some of the important activities are:</p>
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li><b>Classification</b>
                                <p>The data is classified into different groups and subgroups, so that each group or sub-group of data can be handled separately.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Calculations</b>
                                <p>The arithmetic operations are performed on the numeric data to get the required results. For example, total marks of each student are calculated.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Summarising</b>
                                <p>The data is processed to represent it in a summarized form. Summary of data is often prepared for top management. For example, the summary of the data of students is prepared to show the percentage of pass and fail student examination etc.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Storing</b>
                                <p>The data is arranged into an order so that it can be accessed very quickly as and when required.</p></li>
                            </ol>

                            <h4>4. DATA OUTPUT</h4>
                            <p>Mostly, the output is stored on the storage media for later user. In output step, the following activities can be performed.</p>
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li><b>Retrieval</b>
                                <p>Output stored on the storage media can be retrieved at any time and for different purposes.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Conversion</b>
                                <p>The generated output can be converted into different forms. For example, it can be represented into graphical form.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Communication</b>
                                <p>The generated output is sent to different places. For example, weather forecast is prepared and sent to different agencies and newspapers etc. where it is required.</p></li>
                            </ol>

                        <div class="content-block">
                            <p>There are a large number of ways records can be organised on disk or tape. The main methods of file organisation used for files are:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Serial</b></li>
                                <li><b>Sequential</b></li>
                                <li><b>Indexed Sequential</b></li>
                                <li><b>Random (or Direct)</b></li>
                            </ol>

                            <ol type="a">
                                <li><b>Serial Organization/Access Method</b>
                                <p>Serial files are stored in <b>chronological order</b>, which is as each record is received it is stored in the next available storage position. In general it is only used on a serial medium such as Magnetic tape. This type of file organization means that the records are in no particular order and therefore to retrieve a single record the whole file needs to be read from the beginning to end. Serial organization is usually the method used for creating Transaction files (unsorted), Work and Dump files.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Sequential Organization</b>
                                <p>Sequential files are serial files whose records are <b>sorted</b> and stored in an ascending or descending order on a particular key field. The physical order of the records on the disk is not necessarily sequential. They are no longer physically contiguous with the preceding and following logical records, but they can be retrieved in sequence.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Indexed Sequential Organization(ISAM)</b>
                                <p>Indexed Sequential file organization is logically the same as sequential organization, but an <b>index is built</b> indicating the block containing the record with a given value for the Key field.</p>

                                <li><b>Random (or Direct)</b>
                                <p>A randomly organized file contains records arranged physically without regard to the sequence of the primary key. Records are loaded to disk by establishing a direct relationship between the Key of the record and its address on the file, normally by use of a formula (or algorithm) that converts the primary Key to a physical disk address. This relationship is also used for retrieval. Disks are random access media, whereas tapes are sequential access media.</p>
