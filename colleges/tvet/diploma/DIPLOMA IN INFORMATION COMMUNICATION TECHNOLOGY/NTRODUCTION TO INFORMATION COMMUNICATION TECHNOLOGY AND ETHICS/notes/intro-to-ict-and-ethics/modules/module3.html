                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Digital data transmission can occur in two basic modes: serial or parallel. Data within a computer system is transmitted via parallel mode on buses with the width of the parallel bus matched to the word size of the computer system. Data between computer systems is usually transmitted in bit serial mode . Consequently, it is necessary to make a parallel-to-serial conversion at a computer interface when sending data from a computer system into a network and a serial-to-parallel conversion at a computer interface when receiving information from a network. The type of transmission mode used may also depend upon distance and required data rate.</p>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h3>PARALLEL TRANSMISSION</h3>
                        <div class="content-block">
                            <p>In parallel transmission, multiple bits (usually 8 bits or a byte/character) are sent simultaneously on different channels (wires, frequency channels) within the same cable, or radio path, and synchronized to a clock. Parallel devices have a wider data bus than serial devices and can therefore transfer data in words of one or more bytes at a time. As a result, there is a speedup in parallel transmission bit rate over serial transmission bit rate. However, this speedup is a tradeoff versus cost since multiple wires cost more than a single wire, and as a parallel cable gets longer, the synchronization timing between multiple channels becomes more sensitive to distance. The timing for parallel transmission is provided by a constant clocking signal sent over a separate wire within the parallel cable; thus parallel transmission is considered <b>synchronous</b>.</p>

                        <div class="content-block">
                            <p>In serial transmission, bits are sent <b>sequentially</b> on the same channel (wire) which reduces costs for wire but also slows the speed of transmission. Also, for serial transmission, some overhead time is needed since bits must be assembled and sent as a unit and then disassembled at the receiver.</p>

                            <p>Systems software consists of programs that co-ordinate the activities of hardware and other programs. System software is designed for a specific CPU and hardware class. The combination of a particular hardware configuration and operating system is called a <b>computer platform</b>. These programs manage the "behind the scenes" operation of the computer.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Operating systems (OS)</b> ‚Äì This is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs.
                                    <p>Examples of operating systems include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>DOS ‚Äì Disk operating system</li>
                                        <li>Windows 3.1, 95, 98, NT, 2000, ME, XPLinux,Windows Server 2003</li>
                                        <li>Unix</li>
                                        <li>MAC OS X</li>
                                        <li>System 7/Mac OS 7</li>
                                        <li>Solaris</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Utility Programs</b> ‚Äì This is system software designed to help the OS to analyze, configure and maintain a computer. Utility programs often come installed on computer systems or packaged with operating systems. Utilities can also be purchased individually. Examples of utility programs include:
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Language processors ‚Äì Compilers and interpreters.</li>
                                        <li>Disk cloning software ‚Äì This is software that copys the contents of one computer hard disk to another disk or to an "image" file. Unlike standard copying functions, disk cloning involves copying hidden and in-use files, and thus presents special challenges, as those types of files are typically not available for copying. Examples include Disk Copy by Apple and DriveClone by Farstone Technology.</li>
                                        <li>Disk Compression ‚Äì A type of data compression that works by storing compressed versions of files on the hard disk. A disk compression utility sits between the operating system and the disk drive. Whenever the operating system attempts to save a file to disk, the utility intercepts it and compresses it. Likewise, when the operating system attempts to open a file, the disk compression utility intercepts the file, decompresses it, and then passes it to the operating system.</li>
                                        <li>Antivirus software</li>
                                        <li>Backup software</li>
                                        <li>Disk checkers for scanning operating hard drive.</li>

                                        <li>Registry cleaners clean and optimize the Windows registry by removing old registry keys that are no longer in use.</li>
