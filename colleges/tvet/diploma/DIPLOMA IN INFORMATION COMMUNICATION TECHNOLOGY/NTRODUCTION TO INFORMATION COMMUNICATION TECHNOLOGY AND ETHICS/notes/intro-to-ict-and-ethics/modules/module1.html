                <h2>üìö Definition of Terms</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><b>i) Computer</b></p>
                    <p>A computer is an electronic device that accepts and processes data into information and under the control of instructions stored in its own memory and output or store the results for future use.</p>
                    <p>NB: An electronic device is a device that depends on the principles of electronics and uses the manipulation of electron flow for its operation.</p>

                    <p><b>ii) Data</b></p>
                    <p>Data are raw, unprocessed and unorganized (unstructured) facts and figures that are relatively meaningless to the user. E.g. number of hours worked by an employee.</p>

                    <p><b>iii) Information</b></p>
                    <p>Information is derived from data. This is data that is processed, organized/structured and presented in a given context so as to make it useful. e.g., multiplying the hours worked by the hourly rate to get each employee‚Äôs gross earning. Information is an important component in decision making.</p>
                    <p>For example from a students test scores, the following information can be derived:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Class' average score</li>
                        <li>Most improved student</li>
                        <li>Median Score etc.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><b>USES OF INFORMATION</b></p>
                    <p><b>(a) Decision-making</b></p>
                    <p>When managers are ready to make choices (decisions) they need good, accurate and up-to-date information. If they act without relevant information it could lead to disaster, and failure.</p>

                    <p><b>(b) Monitoring and control</b></p>
                    <p>Businesses will compare actual performance against its predicted (budgeted) performance. Then they will act upon it.</p>

                    <p><b>iv) Information Communication Technology/Technologies (ICT)</b></p>
                    <p>ICT is an umbrella term that covers any software or hardware product that can store, retrieve, manipulate, transmit or receive information electronically in a digital form. Examples include personal computers, digital television, email, robots, radio, cellular phones and networking hardware.</p>
                    <p>For our study, we are concerned with computer (hardware and software) and telecommunications technology (data, image, and voice networks).</p>

                    <p><b>v) Information System (IS)</b></p>
                    <p>An Information System (IS) is a combination of hardware, software, personnel, data and procedures that interact to support and improve day-to-day operations in an organization. These elements of an Information System are also known as the components of an Information System.</p>

                    <p><b>Characteristics of High Quality Data</b></p>
                    <p>The Audit Commission has identified six key characteristics of good quality data.</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><b>Accuracy</b>
                        <p>Data should be sufficiently accurate for the intended use and should be captured only once, although it may have multiple uses. Data should be captured at the point of activity.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Validity</b>
                        <p>Data should be recorded and used in compliance with relevant requirements, including the correct application of any rules or definitions. This will ensure consistency between periods and with similar organizations, measuring what is intended to be measured.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Timeliness</b>
                        <p>Data should be captured as quickly as possible after the event or activity and must be available for the intended use within a reasonable time period. Data must be available quickly and frequently enough to support information needs and to influence service or management decisions.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Relevance</b>
                        <p>Data captured should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used. This will require a periodic review of requirements to reflect changing needs.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Completeness</b>
                        <p>Data requirements should be clearly specified based on the information needs of the organization and data collection processes matched to these requirements.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Uniqueness</b>
                        <p>In order to add value to an organization, information must be unique and distinctive.</p></li>

                <h2>üìö A Brief Computer History</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The abacus, which emerged about 5,000 years ago in Asia Minor and is still in use today, may be considered the first computer. This device allows users to make computations using a system of sliding beads arranged on a rack; it was simply a counting device.</p>
                    <figure class="content-image">

                        <figcaption>The Abacus</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>It took long for the next significant advance in computing devices to emerge. In 1642, Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), the 18-year-old son of a French tax collector, invented what he called a <b>numerical wheel calculator</b> to help his father with his duties but which used eight movable dials to add sums up. It was not until the 1940s that the electronic computers emerged.</p>
                    <p>In the 1820s, Charles Babbage designed the ‚Äò<b>Difference Engine</b>‚Äô, a machine which could perform mathematical calculations. A six-wheeled model was initially constructed and demonstrated to a number of audiences. He also worked on another invention, the more complex <b>Analytical Engine</b>, a revolutionary device which was intended to be able to perform any arithmetical calculation using punched cards that would deliver the instructions, as well as a memory unit to store numbers and many other fundamental components of today's computers. Lady Ada produced programs to be used by the analytical machine. She is claimed to be possibly the first programmer.</p>
                    <p><b>Five Generations of Modern Computers</b></p>
                    <p>Modern computers can be classified into five generations.</p>
                    <p><b>First generation: 1946-1959.</b></p>
                    <p>First generation of computers started with using vacuum tubes as the <b>basic components</b> for <b>memory and circuitry</b> for CPU (Central Processing Unit). These tubes like electric bulbs produced a lot of heat and were prone to frequent fusing of the installations, therefore, were very expensive and could be afforded only by very large organizations. The <b>Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC)</b> was announced in 1946. It cost almost $500,000 (approximately $6,000,000 today). The computer contained 17,468 vacuum tubes and consumed 150 kW of electricity.</p>
                    <p>Another example of computers in this generation was the <b>UNIVersal Automatic Computer I (UNIVAC)</b> which used 5200 vacuum tubes and weighed 13 metric tons. It consumed 125 kW, and could perform about 1,905 operations per second.</p>
                    <figure class="content-image">
                        <img src="/api/placeholder/600/300"
                             alt="Image of Vacuum Tubes Placeholder"
                             width="600" height="300">
                        <figcaption>Vacuum Tubes</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In this generation mainly <b>batch processing</b> of data was done. In this generation <b>Punched cards, Paper tape, Magnetic tape Input & Output device</b> were used. It is said that this computer weighed 30 tons, and had 18,000 vacuum tubes which were used for processing. When this computer was turned on for the first time lights dimmed in sections of Philadelphia. Computers of this generation could only perform a <b>single task at a time</b>, and they had <b>no operating system</b>.</p>
                    <p>NB: Batch processing- Executing a series of non-interactive jobs all at one time.</p>

                    <p><b>Second generation: 1959-1965.</b></p>
                    <p>Computers in this generation using the <b>transistor</b> were <b>cheaper, consumed less power, more compact in size, more reliable and faster</b> than the first generation machines made of vacuum tubes. In this generation, <b>magnetic cores</b> were used as primary memory and magnetic tape and magnetic disks as secondary storage devices.</p>
                    <figure class="content-image">
                        <img src="/api/placeholder/600/300"
                             alt="Image of A Transistor Placeholder"
                             width="600" height="300">
                        <figcaption>A Transistor</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In this generation assembly languages and high level programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL were used. Examples of computers in this generation include IBM 300 series and the ATLAS.</p>
                    <p>NB: A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and electrical power.</p>
                    <p>The difference between a transistor and a vacuum tube is that a transistor uses a sandwich of silicon instead of tube filled with gas to do the switching. Silicon falls into a family of elements that are neither conductor nor insulator; they‚Äôre called semiconductors. This type of element will be either a conductor or an insulator depending on some condition. In the case of transistors, an electrical current will cause the silicon to be a conductor.</p>

                    <p><b>Third Generation: 1965-1971.</b></p>
                    <p>The third generation of computers is marked by the use of <b>Integrated Circuits (IC's)</b> in place of transistors. A single I.C has many transistors, resistors and capacitors along with the associated circuitry. The I.C was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers <b>smaller in size, reliable and efficient</b>.</p>
                    <p>In this generation <b>Remote processing, Time-sharing, Real-time, Multi-programming Operating System</b> were used. High level language (FORTRAN-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, BASIC, ALGOL-68 etc.) were used during this generation</p>
                    <p>NB:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.</li>
                        <li>A capacitor (originally known as a condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store energy electrostatically in an electric field.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b>Fourth Generation: 1971-1980.</b></p>
                    <p>The fourth generation of computers is marked by the use of <b>Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits</b>. VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and other circuit elements and their associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have <b>microcomputers</b> of fourth generation. Fourth Generation computers became <b>more powerful, compact, reliable, and affordable</b>. As a result, it gave rise to <b>personal computer (PC) revolution</b>.</p>
                    <p>In this generation <b>Time sharing, Real time, Networks, Distributed Operating System</b> were used. All the High level languages like C and C++, DBASE etc. were used in this generation</p>

                    <p><b>Fifth Generation: 1980-todate.</b></p>
                    <p>In the fifth generation, the VLSI technology became <b>ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration)</b> technology, resulting in the production of <b>microprocessor chips</b> having ten million electronic components or more.</p>
                    <p>This generation is based on <b>parallel processing hardware</b> and <b>AI (Artificial Intelligence)</b> software.</p>
                    <p>AI is an emerging branch in computer science, which interprets means and method of making computers think like human beings. All the Higher level languages like C and C++, Java, .Net etc. are used in this generation</p>

                    <p><b>THE TREND IN THE COMPUTER‚ÄôS TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION</b></p>
                    <ul>

                    </ol>

                    <p><b>Classification by way of processing data (Type of data handled)</b></p>
                    <p>This is by how the computer represents and processes the data.</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li><b>Digital computers</b>
                        <p>Digital computers process data represented in binary format using the numbers 0 and 1. They are used for both business data processing and scientific purposes since digital computation results in greater accuracy than analog computers. They also can perform complex computations. They are the most commonly used type of computers.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Analog computers</b>
                        <p>These are used for scientific, engineering, and process-controlled purposes. Outputs are represented in the form of graphs. Analogue computers process data represented by physical variables and output physical magnitudes in the form of smooth graphs. These physical changes include changes in electronic voltages, pressure changes, temperature changes etc. Analog values, unlike digital values, are typically many values in a range. Examples of analogue devices include car speedometer and the slide rule.</p></li>
                        <li><b>Hybrid computers</b> are computers that have the combined features of digital and analog computers; hybrid computing offers both speed and precision. They offer an efficient and economical method of working out special problems in science and various areas of engineering.</li>
                    </ol>

                <h2>üìö ROLE OF ICT IN A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>The use of ICT and technology has affected every aspect of business, transforming not only the way that business is conducted but also creating new business sectors and jobs. Examples are companies like Google, Amazon, Safaricom M-Pesa and e-Bay.</p>
                    <p>Some examples of the nature of this change include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Marketing and e-Commerce</b>: The use of websites has allowed companies to develop new and cheaper ways of reaching new markets, offering customers the opportunity of buying goods and services whenever they want and often at reduced cost, while also enhancing the level of customer service.</li>
                        <li><b>Finance</b>: Practically all companies now use software programmes e.g. Sage, QuickBooks and Excel to manage their accounts. This has allowed them to look at financial information when required, monitor and respond to their customers purchasing patterns. The result of this has been for many companies a reduction in their accountancy fees.</li>
                        <li><b>Out of office working</b>: For many businesses the need for staff to be away from the office attending meetings or to be based in another geographical location has grown alongside employee demands for more flexible working patterns. However effective communication and ability to access information remains critical to the productivity of these staff members. Therefore through the use of technology many companies now use a range of technologies to enable this. These include mobile phones, e-mail, broadband, laptops, etc, thus ensuring that companies are able to be flexible and adaptive depending on their business needs.</li>
                        <li><b>Networks</b>: Virtually all businesses now have or have access to a computer. The existence of two or more computers in an office almost always leads to the creation of a network. The main advantage of doing so is that resources can be shared e.g. printers, internet access, files/information can be managed and shared amongst workstations and the security of information can be better managed through a network. Increasingly, networks are not just confined to the office but are being adopted so that they allow home/remote working that supports changing business needs.</li>
                        <li><b>Inventory management</b> Inventory management systems track the quantity of each item a company maintains, triggering an order of additional stock when the quantities fall below a predetermined amount</li>
                        <li><b>Customer Relationship Management</b> Customer Relationship Management systems store every interaction a company has with a customer for future reference. The customer has a better, more focused experience and the company benefits from improved productivity.</li>
                        <li><b>Payroll Systems</b> A payroll system is used to maintain pay accounts of employees, easily and quickly.</li>
                        <li><b>Human Resource Management</b> HRIS help in recruitment, Human Resource Planning, wage and salary planning, personnel record</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>keeping and training and development.</p>

                        <p>E-waste is not always disposed of properly, causing deadly chemicals to leach into the ground. Plants that manufacture the electronics are emitting toxic fumes into the air.</p></li>

                        <p>People don‚Äôt turn their devices off; they keep computers on or plugged in, mobile devices charging and televisions plugged in. Also manufacturing all of these high tech toys causes an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.</p></li>

                        <p>Much in the same way that people over share on social media sites, there is an increasing tendency to cross social boundaries. Cyber stalking someone or sending unsolicited nude photos are examples of crossing social boundaries.</p></li>
