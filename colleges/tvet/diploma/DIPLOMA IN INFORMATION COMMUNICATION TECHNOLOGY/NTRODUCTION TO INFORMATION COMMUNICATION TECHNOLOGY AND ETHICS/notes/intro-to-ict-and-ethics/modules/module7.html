                    <p><b>ERGONOMICS</b></p>
                    <p><b>Ergonomics</b> is the science of matching workplace conditions and job demands to the capabilities of the working population. An effective and successful match ensures high productivity, avoidance of illness and injury, and increased satisfaction among the workforce.</p>
                    <p>Ergonomics, further, refers to assessing those work-related factors that may pose a risk of musculoskeletal disorders and recommendations to alleviate them. Common examples of ergonomic risk factors are found in jobs requiring <b>repetitive, forceful, or prolonged exertions</b> of the hands, prolonged awkward postures etc.</p>
                    <p>Ergonomic stress areas in computing environments include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Eyes</li>
                        <li>Neck</li>
                        <li>Shoulders</li>
                        <li>Elbow</li>
                        <li>Wrist</li>
                        <li>Hand</li>
                        <li>Back/Spine</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Resulting injuries are called <b>Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTD)</b> or <b>Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI)</b> or <b>Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSD)</b>.</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li><b>CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME</b>
                                <p>Irritation of the median nerve, which runs through a bony channel in the wrist called the carpal tunnel. Compression of the nerve produces numbness, tingling and, eventually, hand weakness. It usually results from excessive flexing or twisting of the wrist from the use of wrong desks.</p></li>
                                <li><b>TRIGGER FINGER SYNDROME</b>
                                <p>Trigger finger is a painful condition that causes the fingers or thumb to catch or lock when bent. Tendons in the fingers become inflamed, causing pain, swelling, and a loss of dexterity. This is caused by the excessive use of the mouse or typing.</p></li>
                                <li><b>HAND/ARM VIBRATION SYNDROME</b>
                                <p>Stinging, tingling, numbness, paleness, loss of dexterity in the hand/arm. It is related to a condition caused by repeated and prolonged use of the mouse and keyboard.</p></li>
                                <li><b>TENDONITIS</b>
                                <p>An inflammation of the tendons. Typically occurs in the shoulders, wrists, hands, or elbows. It is caused by overuse of the tendons by repetitive actions.</p></li>

                                <li>Minimize reflected glare on the screen by keeping the screen away from windows and other sources of external light.</li>
                                <li>Purchase an antiglare screen/shield for your screen</li>
                                <li>The screen should be brighter than the room light.</li>
                                <li>Bigger monitors cause less eyestrain than small ones.</li>
                                <li>Clean the screen regularly.</li>
                                <li>Position the monitor directly in front of the user to avoid excessive twisting of the neck.</li>
                                <li>Position the monitor approx. 20-26 inches (arm's length) from user.</li>
                                <li>Tilt the top of the monitor back 10 to 20 degrees</li>
                                <li>The top of the viewing screen should be at eye level when the user is sitting in an upright position.</li>

                        <div class="content-block">
                            <p>Sitting for extended periods of time can cause increased pressure on the inter-vertebral discs. Sitting is also hard on the feet and legs since gravity tends to pool blood in the legs and feet and create a sluggish return to the heart.</p>

                            <h4>PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The monitor should be able to tilt and swivel</li>
                                <li>The keyboard should be detachable such that you can sometimes place it on your lap.</li>
                                <li>Don't sit in one static position for extended periods of time i.e. "Dynamic sitting".</li>
                                <li>Adjust the height of backrest to support the natural inward curvature of the lower back.</li>
                                <li>Adjust height of chair such that the feet rest flat on the floor.</li>
                                <li>Sit upright in the chair with the lower back against the backrest. It is recommended that ergonomic chairs be provided for the employees:</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A chair that is well-designed and appropriately adjusted is an essential element of a safe and productive computer workstation. A good chair provides necessary support to the back, legs, buttocks, and arms, while reducing exposures to awkward postures, contact stress, and forceful exertions. This is particularly important if the chair has multiple users.</p>
                            <p>The following parts of the chair are important elements to consider in creating a safe and productive workstation: <b>Backrest, Seat, Armrest and the base</b>.</p>

                            <p>Like any other equipment, computers require care and maintenance to run smoothly. A number of factors can cause damage to your computer‚Äôs hardware (the physical parts inside the computer) or media (storage devices like CD-ROMs and hard drives).</p>

                            <h4>The Right Computer Environment</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Place computers in temperature-controlled rooms to avoid extreme temperatures.</li>
                                <li>Keep computers away from air conditioning or heating vents.</li>
                                <li>Keep computers in a dust-free room.</li>
                                <li>Keep computer storage media a safe distance from electrical or magnetic fields.</li>
                                <li>Make sure cables are not kinked or twisted. Route cables so they will not be stepped on or rolled over by chairs.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Power Spikes/Surges</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Do not connect the computer directly to power source. Connect the computer to a surge suppressor to help avoid damage from power spikes.</li>
                                <li>Use a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) device that will keep computers running in the event of a power outage.</li>
                                <li>Connect all power cables in a way such that they cannot be accidentally disconnected.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Computer Cleanliness</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If a mouse becomes dirty, it will not track smoothly. When a keyboard is contaminated with food particles the keys become ‚Äústicky,‚Äù meaning they do not spring back up immediately after you press them. Dust particles cause printers to jam and smear your printouts.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Maintenance routines</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Regularly clean the keyboard and mouse.</li>
                                <li>Clean the printer of any dirt or dust to prevent jamming.</li>
                                <li>Carefully remove any paper jams.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Monitor Burn-In</h4>
                            <p>If an image is allowed to remain on a monitor for very long periods of time it can become ‚Äúburned‚Äù onto the screen. To prevent this from happening, ensure that you use <b>screensaver software</b>.</p>

                            <h4>Protection against Viruses</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Virus Detection software</li>

                                <li>Don‚Äôt open doubtful email attachments</li>
                                <li>Scan USB drives before opening them</li>
                                <li>Use a firewall program</li>
                                <li>Disable autorun feature</li>
                                <li>Scan email attachments before downloading them</li>
                            </ul>
