                <h2>üìö SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN ICT</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>This refers to the ICT community taking responsibility for the impact of their activities to improve the quality of life of the society. ICT is responsible for many social problems including e-waste</p>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h3>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</h3>
                        <div class="content-block">
                            <p>The main environmental impacts of ICT products are caused by material used in production (chemical substances) and energy consumption through production and usage of electronic products.</p>
                            <p>Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been contributing to environmental problems: computers, electronic devices and ICT infrastructure consume significant amounts of electricity, placing a heavy burden on our electric grids and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. In 2007, the total footprint of the ICT sector ‚Äì including personal computers (PCs) and peripherals, telecoms networks and devices and data centers ‚Äì was 830 Mt CO2 emission, about 2% of the estimated total emissions from human activity released that year (a figure equivalent to aviation).</p>
                            <p>ICT hardware poses severe environmental problems both during its production and its disposal. Each stage of a computer‚Äôs life, from its production, throughout its use, and into its disposal, presents environmental problems. Manufacturing computers and their various electronic and non-electronic components consumes electricity, raw materials, chemicals, and water, and generates hazardous waste.</p>
                            <p>All these directly or indirectly increase carbon dioxide emissions and impact the environment</p>

                            <h4>HANDLING E-WASTE</h4>
                            <p>IT industry (both hardware and software producers) is the key player for the protection of environment and the elimination of power consumption. The usage of recycled components, the adoption of rules and guidelines that contribute to lower power consumption ensure the energy efficiency. These practices should be standard choices at the IT industry, which have to also be indicated by recognizable marks/signs in order for the consumers to be familiar with specs and certifications that ensure the recycling and the energy efficiency of those ICT products.</p>
                            <p><b>3Rs ‚Äì Recycle</b>,</p>
                            <p>Recycling will reduce waste in the production process, recycle the waste and waste heat or transfer them to enterprises or individuals who have the ability to recycle and reutilize the waste, and properly handle the non-recyclable waste.</p>
