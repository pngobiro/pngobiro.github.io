                    <p><b>Definition of a Computer Network</b></p>
                    <p>A computer network refers to a group of two or more computers or other hardware devices connected/linked together for purposes of sharing resources, such as files, programs, printers etc. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.</p>
                    <p>Computers on a network use protocols which define a common set of rules and signals to communicate.</p>
                    <p>NB/ Computers that are not connected to one another are known as stand-alone computers.</p>

                                <li><b>Sharing resources and reducing costs</b>. In a networked environment, each computer on a network can access and use hardware and software on the network. If several computers and a printer are connected to a network, each user can access the printer on the network, as they need it instead of buying as many printers. Other resources include files, applications and disk storage.</li>

                            <p>Categorization can be based on the following criteria:</p>

                            <h4>Networks based Size</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Local Area Networks (LANs)</b>
                                <p>The smallest and simplest networks are called local area networks (LANs), which extend over only a small area, typically within a single office, building or a part thereof. In addition to operating in a limited space, LANs are also typically owned, controlled, and managed by a single person or organization. They also tend to use certain connectivity technologies, primarily Ethernet and Token Ring.</p>
                                <p>A home network is a type of LAN that is contained within a user's residence.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Wide Area Networks (WANs)</b>
                                <p>Wide area networks (WANs) can extend over a large geographic area e.g. across metropolitan, regional, national or continental boundaries and are connected via the telephone network or radio waves. A WAN is a geographically-dispersed collection of LANs. A network device called a router connects LANs to a WAN. In IP networking, the router maintains both a LAN address and a WAN address.</p>
                                <p>A WAN differs from a LAN in several important ways. Most WANs (like the Internet) are not owned by any one organization but rather exist under collective or distributed ownership and management; WANs are usually administered by multiple service providers.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) / Campus Area Network (CAN)</b>
                                <p>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is designed to serve a town or city, and a campus area network is designed to serve a university, military base or an educational institution.</p>
                                <p>A metropolitan area spans a physical area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, such as a city. A MAN is typically owned and operated by a single entity such as a government body or large corporation.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Intranet</b>
                                <p>An intranet is a private network within an organization that uses the same communications protocols as the Internet (internet protocol). It is sometimes contrasted to extranets. An Intranet is used strictly within the confines of a company, university, or organization and is based on the internet standards (HTML, HTTP & TCP/IP protocols). An intranet's Web sites look and acts just like any other Web sites, but the firewall surrounding an intranet fends off unauthorized access.</p></li>
                                <li><b>Extranet</b>
                                <p>This is a computer network that allows controlled access from the outside, for specific business or educational purposes. It uses Internet technology and the public telecommunication system to securely share part of a business's information or operations with suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, or other businesses. An extranet requires security and privacy.</p></li>
                                <li><b>internet/internetwork</b>
                                <p>An internet (spelt with a lower case i) is a network that is composed of a number of smaller computer networks.</p></li>
                                <li><b>The Internet</b>
                                <p>The Internet (spelled with an upper case I) is the world-wide network of interconnected internets that operates using a standardized set of communications protocols called TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet protocol), or the Internet protocol suite. This ultimate internet is vastly larger than any other internet and connects thousands of networks and hundreds of millions of computers throughout the world. The Internet is, therefore, an internet.</p></li>

                                <li><b>PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKS</b>
                                <p>Peer-to-peer networks are also called workgroups and there exists no hierarchy among computers; all computers are equal. No administrator is usually responsible for the network. Peer-to-peer networks are appropriate for small, simple, and inexpensive networks.</p>

                                <p>A computer network in which one centralized, powerful computer (called the server) is a hub to which many less powerful personal computers or workstations (called clients) are connected. The clients run programs and access data that are stored on the server. Network Clients (Workstations) computers request network resources or services while the network Servers provide network resources and services to clients.</p>

                            <p>The devices on a network are referred to as <b>nodes</b>. Nodes can be connected using any of the various types of media, including twisted pair copper wire cable, optical fiber cable, coaxial cable and radio waves.

                            <p>A network topology can be physical or logical. <b>Physical Topology</b> is the actual layout of a network and its connections. <b>Logical Topology</b> is the way in which data accesses the medium and packets are transmitted/ travel.</p>
