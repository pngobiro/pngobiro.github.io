                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Hardware refers to the physical, tangible computer equipment and devices, which provide support for major functions such as input, processing (computation and control), output, secondary storage (for data and programs), and communication.</p>

                    <p><b>System Unit</b></p>
                    <p>The system unit is the core of a computer system. Usually it's a rectangular box placed on or underneath your desk. Inside this box are many electronic components that process data. The most important of these components is the central processing unit (CPU), or microprocessor, which acts as the "brain" of your computer. Another component is random access memory (RAM), which temporarily stores information that the CPU uses while the computer is on. The information stored in RAM is erased when the computer is turned off.</p>
                    <p>Almost every other part of your computer connects to the system unit using cables. The cables plug into specific ports (openings), typically on the back of the system unit. Hardware that is not part of the system unit is sometimes called a peripheral device. Peripheral devices can be external such as a mouse, keyboard, printer, monitor, external Zip drive or scanner or internal, such as a CD-ROM drive, CD-R drive or internal modem. Internal peripheral devices are often referred to as integrated peripherals. There are two types according to shape: tower and desktop.</p>
                    <p>A <b>motherboard</b> (mainboard, system board, planar board or logic board) is the main printed circuit board found in computers and other expandable systems. It holds many of the crucial electronic components of the system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.</p>
                    <p>The <b>Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP)</b> is a high speed connection to the motherboard for video cards. The AGP port is faster than a PCI card and doesn‚Äôt use the system memory.</p>

                    <p><b>The Power Supply</b></p>
                    <p>Power supplies, often referred to as "switching power supplies", use switcher technology to convert the AC input to lower DC voltages, a form that is usable by the Personal computer. The typical voltages supplied are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3.3 volts</li>
                        <li>5 volts</li>
                        <li>12 volts</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The 3.3- and 5-volts are typically used by digital circuits, while the 12-volt is used to run motors in disk drives and fans. The main specification of a power supply is in watts.</p>

                    <p><b>Uninterruptible Power Supply</b></p>
                    <p>An <b>uninterruptible power supply</b>, also <b>uninterruptible power source</b>, <b>UPS</b> or <b>battery/flywheel backup</b> is an electrical apparatus that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source, typically mains power, fails. The device allows the computer to keep running for at least a short time when the primary power source is lost. It also provides protection from power surges. A UPS contains a battery that "kicks in" when the device senses a loss of power from the primary source.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>A computer system is a set of integrated devices that input, output, process, and store data and information. Computer systems are currently built around at least one digital processing device. There are five main hardware components in a computer system: Input, Processing, Storage, Output and Communication devices.</p>

                    <section class="content-section">
                        <h3>1. INPUT DEVICES</h3>
                        <div class="content-block">
                            <p>Most computers cannot accept data in forms customary to human communication such as speech or hand written documents. It is necessary, therefore, to present data to the computer in a way that provides easy conversion into its own electronic pulse-based forms. This is commonly achieved by typing data using the keyboard or using an electronic mouse or any other input device.</p>

                            <h4>a) THE KEYBOARD</h4>
                            <p>Keyboard (similar to a typewriter) is the main input device of a computer (refer to figure 2.2). It contains three types of keys-- alphanumeric keys, special keys and function keys. <b>Alphanumeric keys</b> are used to type all alphabets, numbers and special symbols like $, %, @, A etc. <b>Special keys</b> such as <Shift>, <Ctrl>, <Alt>, <Home>, <Scroll Lock> etc. are used for special functions. <b>Function keys</b> such as <Fl>, <F2>, <F3> etc. are used to give special commands depending upon the software used e.g.F5 reloads a page of an internet browser. The function of each and every key can be well understood only after working on a PC. When any key is pressed, an electronic signal is produced. This signal is detected by a keyboard encoder that sends a binary code corresponding to the key pressed to the CPU. There are many types of keyboards but 101 keys keyboard is the most popular one.</p>

                            <p><b>How the keys are organized</b></p>
                            <p>The keys on your keyboard can be divided into several groups based on function:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Typing (alphanumeric) keys.</b> These keys include the same letter, number, punctuation, and symbol keys found on a traditional typewriter.</li>
                                <li><b>Special (Control) keys.</b> These keys are used alone or in combination with other keys to perform certain actions. The most frequently used control keys are CTRL, ALT, the Windows key , and ESC.</li>
                                <li><b>Function keys.</b> The function keys are used to perform specific tasks. They are labelled as F1, F2, F3, and so on, up to F12. The functionality of these keys differs from program to program.</li>
                                <li><b>Cursor Movement (Navigation) keys.</b> These keys are used for moving around in documents or WebPages and editing text. They include the arrow keys, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, DELETE, and INSERT and ARROW KEYS.</li>
                                <li><b>Numeric keypad.</b> The numeric keypad is handy for entering numbers quickly. The keys are grouped together in a block like a conventional calculator or adding machine.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h4>b) THE MOUSE</h4>
                        <div class="content-block">
                            <p>A mouse is a small device used to point to and select items on your computer screen. Although mice come in many shapes, the typical mouse does look a bit like an actual mouse. It's small, oblong, and connected to the system unit by a long wire that resembles a tail and the connector which can either be PS/2 or USB. Some newer mice are wireless.</p>
                            <p>A mouse usually has two buttons: a primary button (usually the left button) and a secondary button. Many mice also have a wheel between the two buttons, which allows you to scroll smoothly through screens of information.</p>
                            <p>When you move the mouse with your hand, a pointer on your screen moves in the same direction. (The pointer's appearance might change depending on where it's positioned on your screen.) When you want to select an item, you point to the item and then click (press and release) the primary button. Pointing and clicking with your mouse is the main way to interact with your computer. There are several types of mice: Mechanical mouse, optical mouse, optical-mechanical mouse and laser mouse.</p>

                            <p><b>Basic parts</b></p>
                            <p>A mouse typically has two buttons: a primary button (usually the left button) and a secondary button (usually the right button). The primary button is the one you will use most often. Most mice also include a scroll wheel between the buttons to help you scroll through documents and WebPages more easily. On some mice, the scroll wheel can be pressed to act as a third button. Advanced mice might have additional buttons that can perform other functions.</p>

                                <p>Pen input devices are used to select or input items by touching the screen with the pen. Light pens accomplish this by using a white cell at the tip of the pen. When the light pen is placed against the monitor, it closes a photoelectric circuit. The photoelectric circuit identifies the spot for entering or modifying data. It allows the user to point to displayed objects or draw on the screen in a similar way to a touch screen but with greater positional accuracy. Engineers who design microprocessor chips or airplane parts use light pens.</p>

                                <p>Touch sensitive screens, or touch screens, allow the user to execute programs or select menu items by touching a portion of a special screen. Behind the plastic layer of the touch screen are crisscrossed invisible beams of infrared light. Touching the screen with a finger can activate actions or commands. Touch screens are often used in ATMs, information centers, restaurants, and convenience stores. They are popularly used at gas stations for customers to select the grade of gas or request a receipt at the pump (in developed countries), as well as in fast-food restaurants to allow clerks to easily enter orders.</p>
