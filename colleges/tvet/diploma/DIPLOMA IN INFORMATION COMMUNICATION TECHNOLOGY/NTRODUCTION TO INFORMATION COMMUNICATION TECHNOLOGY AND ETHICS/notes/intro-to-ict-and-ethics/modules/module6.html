                    <ol>
                        <li>Data may get lost or damaged during a system crash - especially one affecting the hard disk</li>
                        <li>It can be corrupted as a result of faulty disk drives, or power failures</li>
                        <li>It can be lost by accidental deletion or overwriting of files</li>
                        <li>It can be lost or become corrupted by computer viruses</li>
                        <li>It can be hacked into by unauthorized users and stolen, deleted or altered</li>
                        <li>It can be destroyed by natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or war</li>
                        <li>It can be deleted or altered by employees wishing to make money or take revenge on their employer</li>

                            <p><b>Data security</b> refers to protecting data from destructive forces and unwanted actions of unauthorized users. Data needs to be protected from loss through accidental or malicious deletion, virus attacks hard disk or system failures, unauthorized access etc. Methods of protecting data include:</p>
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li><b>Use of passwords (Access Authentication)</b>: A password is a secret word or string of characters that is used for user authentication/verification before the user can gain access to data.</li>
                                <li><b>Right of Access</b> refers to the authorization you have to access different data files. Right of access helps determines who has the right to do what in relation to certain data or information.</li>
                                <li><b>Logs and Audit trails</b>: An audit trail is a record showing who has accessed a computer system, when and what operations he or she has performed during a given period of time.</li>
                                <li><b>Anti-virus programs</b> are software used to prevent, detect and remove malicious software such as viruses.</li>
                                <li><b>Encryption</b>: This is the process of encoding (convert into a coded form) information stored on a device.</li>
                                <li><b>Firewalls</b>: A firewall is a software or hardware-based network security system that prevents unauthorized access.</li>
                                <li><b>Physical Security</b>: Includes locking offices, alarms, security cameras, etc.</li>
                                <li><b>Data Protection Act</b>: Legal framework to regulate data collection, processing, storage, and use.</li>
                                <li><b>Data Back-up</b> refers to the copying and archiving of computer data in a secure location for restoration.</li>
