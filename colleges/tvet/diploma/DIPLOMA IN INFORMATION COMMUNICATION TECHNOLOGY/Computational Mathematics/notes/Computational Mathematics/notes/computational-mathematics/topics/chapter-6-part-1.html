                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The graph of a function <span class="math-inline">$f$</span> is the set of all points in the plane of the form <span class="math-inline">$(x, f(x))$</span>. We could also define the graph of <span class="math-inline">$f$</span> to be the graph of the equation <span class="math-inline">$y=f(x)$</span>. So, the graph of a function if a special case of the graph of an equation.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Example 1.</h3>
                        <p>Let <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{x}^{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{- 3}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>Recall that when we introduced graphs of equations we noted that if we can solve the equation for y , then it is easy to find points that are on the graph. We simply choose a number for x , then compute the corresponding value of <span class="math-inline">$y$</span>. Graphs of functions are graphs of equations that have been solved for y !</p>
                        <p>The graph of <span class="math-inline">$f(x)$</span> in this example is the graph of <span class="math-inline">$y=x^{2}-3$</span>. It is easy to generate points on the graph. Choose a value for the first coordinate, then evaluate <span class="math-inline">$f$</span> at that number to find the second coordinate. The following table shows several values for x and the function f evaluated at those numbers.</p>
                        <div class="table-container">
                           <table class="content-table">

                        </div>
                        <p>Each column of numbers in the table holds the coordinates of a point on the graph of f .</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Example 2.</h3>
                        <p>Let f be the piecewise-defined function</p>

                        <p>The graph of f is shown below.</p>

                        <div class="equation">$$f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 1-x, & x \leq 4 \\ 2 x-11, & x>4 \end{array}\right.$$</div>
                        <p>We have seen that some equations in x and y do not describe y as a function of x . The algebraic way see if an equation determines <span class="math-inline">$y$</span> as a function of <span class="math-inline">$x$</span> is to solve for <span class="math-inline">$y$</span>. If there is not a unique solution, then y is not a function of x .</p>
                        <p>Suppose that we are given the graph of the equation. There is an easy way to see if this equation describes <span class="math-inline">$y$</span> as a function of <span class="math-inline">$x$</span>.</p>

                        <p>By the vertical line test, this graph is not the graph of a function, because there are many vertical lines that hit it more than once.</p>
                        <p>Think of the vertical line test this way. The points on the graph of a function f have the form ( x , <span class="math-inline">$f(x)$</span> ), so once you know the first coordinate, the second is determined. Therefore, there cannot be two points on the graph of a function with the same first coordinate.</p>
                        <p>All the points on a vertical line have the same first coordinate, so if a vertical line hits a graph twice, then there are two points on the graph with the same first coordinate. If that happens, the graph is not the graph of a function</p>

                        <p>The function f above is increasing everywhere. In general, there are intervals where a function is increasing and intervals where it is decreasing.</p>

                        <p>Using interval notation, we say that the function is decreasing on the interval ( -3, 2 ) increasing on (-infinity, -3 ) and (2, infinity)</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Some of the most characteristics of a function are its Relative Extreme Values. Points on the functions graph corresponding to relative extreme values are turning points, or points where the function changes from decreasing to increasing or vice versa. Let <span class="math-inline">$f$</span> be the function whose graph is drawn below.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/chapter-6-graph-extrema.jpg" alt="Graph illustrating relative minimum and maximum points" class="content-image">
                        <p>f is decreasing on (-infinity, <span class="math-inline">$a$</span> ) and increasing on (<span class="math-inline">$a, b$</span>), so the point (<span class="math-inline">$a, f(a)$</span>) is a turning point of the graph. <span class="math-inline">$f(a)$</span> is called a relative minimum of <span class="math-inline">$f$</span>. Note that <span class="math-inline">$f(a)$</span> is not the smallest function value, <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{f}(\mathrm{c})$</span> is. However, if we consider only the portion of the graph in the circle above a, then <span class="math-inline">$f(a)$</span> is the smallest second coordinate. Look at the circle on the graph above b. While <span class="math-inline">$f(b)$</span> is not the largest function value (this function does not have a largest value), if we look only at the portion of the graph in the circle, then the point (b, f(b)) is above all the other points. So, <span class="math-inline">$f(b)$</span> is a relative maximum of <span class="math-inline">$f$</span>. <span class="math-inline">$f(c)$</span> is another relative minimum of <span class="math-inline">$f$</span>. Indeed, <span class="math-inline">$f(c)$</span> is the absolute minimum of <span class="math-inline">$f$</span>, but it is also one of the relative minima.</p>
                        <p>Here again we are giving definitions that appeal to your geometric intuition. The precise definitions are given in your text.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Approximating Relative Extrema</h3>
                        <p>Suppose a is a number such that <span class="math-inline">$f(a)$</span> is a relative minimum. In applications, it is often more important to know where the function attains its relative minimum than it is to know what the relative minimum is.</p>
                        <p>For example, <span class="math-inline">$f(x)=x^{3}-4 x^{2}+4 x$</span> has a relative minimum of 0 . It attains this relative minimum at <span class="math-inline">$x=2$</span>, so <span class="math-inline">$(2,0)$</span> is a turning point of the graph of <span class="math-inline">$f$</span>. We will call the point <span class="math-inline">$(2,0)$</span> a relative minimum point. In general, a relative extreme point is a point on the graph of <span class="math-inline">$f$</span> whose second coordinate is a relative extreme value of <span class="math-inline">$f$</span>.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Even and Odd Functions</h3>
                        <p>A function f is even if its graph is symmetric with respect to the y -axis. This criterion can be stated algebraically as follows: <span class="math-inline">$f$</span> is even if <span class="math-inline">$f(-x)=f(x)$</span> for all <span class="math-inline">$x$</span> in the domain of <span class="math-inline">$f$</span>. For example, if you evaluate f at 3 and at -3 , then you will get the same value if f is even.</p>
                        <p>A function f is odd if its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. This criterion can be stated algebraically as follows: <span class="math-inline">$f$</span> is odd if <span class="math-inline">$f(-x)=-f(x)$</span> for all <span class="math-inline">$x$</span> in the domain of <span class="math-inline">$f$</span>. For example, if you evaluate <span class="math-inline">$f$</span> at 3 , you get the negative of <span class="math-inline">$f(-3)$</span> when <span class="math-inline">$f$</span> is odd.</p>
