                        <p>A logic model (also known as a logical framework, theory of change, or program matrix) is a tool used by funders, managers, and evaluators of programs to evaluate the effectiveness of a program. They can also be used during planning and implementation. Logic models are usually a graphical depiction of the logical relationships between the resources, activities, outputs and outcomes of a program. While there are many ways in which logic models can be presented, the underlying purpose of constructing a logic model is to assess the "if-then" (causal) relationships between the elements of the program.</p>
                        <p>In its simplest form, a logic model has four components:</p>

                        <p>Following the early development of the logic model in the 1970s by Carol Weiss, Joseph Wholey and others, many refinements and variations have been added to the basic concept. Many versions of logic models set out a series of outcomes/impacts, explaining in more detail the logic of how an intervention contributes to intended or observed results. This will often include distinguishing between short-term, medium-term and long-term results, and between direct and indirect results.</p>
                        <p>Some logic models also include assumptions, which are beliefs the prospective grantees have about the program, the people involved, and the context and the way the prospective grantees think the program will work, and external factors, consisting of the environment in which the program exists, including a variety of external factors that interact with and influence the program action.</p>

                        <p>University Cooperative Extension Programs have developed a more elaborate logic model, called the Program Action Logic Model, which includes six steps:</p>

                        <p>By describing work in this way, managers have an easier way to define the work and measure it. Performance measures can be drawn from any of the steps. One of the key insights of the logic model is the importance of measuring final outcomes or results, because it is quite possible to waste time and money (inputs), "spin the wheels" on work activities, or produce outputs without achieving desired outcomes. It is these outcomes (impacts, long-term results) that are the only justification for doing the work in the first place. For commercial organizations, outcomes relate to profit. For not-for-profit or governmental organizations, outcomes relate to successful achievement of mission or program goals.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Statistical models</h3>
                        <p>A statistical model is a class of mathematical model, which embodies a set of assumptions concerning the generation of some sample data, and similar data from a larger population. A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process.</p>
                        <p>The assumptions embodied by a statistical model describe a set of probability distributions, some of which are assumed to adequately approximate the distribution from which a particular data set is sampled. The probability distributions inherent in statistical models are what distinguishes statistical models from other, non-statistical, mathematical models.</p>
                        <p>A statistical model is usually specified by mathematical equations that relate one or more random variables and possibly other non-random variables. As such, "a model is a formal representation of a theory" (Herman Ad√®r quoting Kenneth Bollen).</p>
                        <p>All statistical hypothesis tests and all statistical estimators are derived from statistical models. More generally, statistical models are part of the foundation of statistical inference.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Formal definition</h4>
                        <p>In mathematical terms, a statistical model is usually thought of as a pair <span class="math-inline">$(\boldsymbol{S}, \boldsymbol{P})$</span>, where <span class="math-inline">$S$</span> is the set of possible observations, i.e. the sample space, and <span class="math-inline">$\boldsymbol{P}$</span> is a set of probability distributions on <span class="math-inline">$\boldsymbol{S}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>The intuition behind this definition is as follows. It is assumed that there is a "true" probability distribution induced by the process that generates the observed data. We choose <span class="math-inline">$\boldsymbol{P}$</span> to represent a set (of distributions) which contains a distribution that adequately approximates the true distribution. Note that we do not require that <span class="math-inline">$\boldsymbol{P}$</span> contains the true distribution, and in practice that is rarely the case. Indeed, as Burnham & Anderson state, "A model is a simplification or approximation of reality and hence will not reflect all of reality"-whence the saying "all models are wrong".</p>
                        <p>Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)</p>
                        <p>The set <span class="math-inline">$\boldsymbol{P}$</span> is almost always parameterized: <span class="math-inline">$\boldsymbol{P}=\left\{\boldsymbol{P}_{\theta}: \Theta \in \Theta\right\}$</span>. The set <span class="math-inline">$\Theta$</span> defines the parameters of the model. A parameterization is generally required to have distinct parameter values give rise to distinct distributions, i.e. <span class="math-inline">$\boldsymbol{P}_{\theta 1}=\boldsymbol{P}_{\theta 2}=>\Theta_{1}=\Theta_{2}$</span>. Must hold (in other words, it must be injective). A parameterization that meets the condition is said to be identifiable.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">An example</h4>
                        <p>Height and age are each probabilistically distributed over humans. They are stochastically related: when we know that a person is of age 10 , this influences the chance of the person being 5 feet tall. We could formalize that relationship in a linear regression model with the following form: height <span class="math-inline">$_{i}=b_{0}+b_{1}$</span> age <span class="math-inline">$_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}$</span>, where <span class="math-inline">$b_{0}$</span> is the intercept, <span class="math-inline">$b_{1}$</span> is a parameter that age is multiplied by to get a prediction of height, <span class="math-inline">$\varepsilon$</span> is the error term, and <span class="math-inline">$i$</span> identifies the person. This implies that height is predicted by age, with some error.</p>
                        <p>An admissible model must be consistent with all the data points. Thus, the straight line (height <span class="math-inline">$_{i}=$</span> <span class="math-inline">$b_{0}+b_{1} \mathrm{age}_{i}$</span> ) is not a model of the data. The line cannot be a model, unless it exactly fits all the data points-i.e. all the data points lie perfectly on a straight line. The error term, <span class="math-inline">$\varepsilon_{i}$</span>, must be included in the model, so that the model is consistent with all the data points.</p>
                        <p>To do statistical inference, we would first need to assume some probability distributions for the <span class="math-inline">$\varepsilon_{i}$</span>. For instance, we might assume that the <span class="math-inline">$\varepsilon_{i}$</span> distributions are i.i.d. Gaussian, with zero mean. In this instance, the model would have 3 parameters: <span class="math-inline">$b_{0}, b_{1}$</span>, and the variance of the Gaussian distribution.</p>
                        <p>We can formally specify the model in the form <span class="math-inline">$(\boldsymbol{S}, \boldsymbol{P})$</span> as follows. The sample space, <span class="math-inline">$S$</span>, of our model comprises the set of all possible pairs (age, height). Each possible value of <span class="math-inline">$\Theta=\left(b_{0}, b_{1}, \sigma^{2}\right)$</span> determines a distribution on <span class="math-inline">$S$</span>; denote that distribution by <span class="math-inline">$\boldsymbol{P}_{\Theta}$</span>. If <span class="math-inline">$\Theta$</span> is the set of all possible values of <span class="math-inline">$\Theta$</span>, then <span class="math-inline">$\boldsymbol{P}=\left\{\boldsymbol{P}_{\theta}: \Theta \in \Theta\right\}$</span>. (The parameterization is identifiable, and this is easy to check.)</p>
                        <p>In this example, the model is determined by (1) specifying <span class="math-inline">$S$</span> and (2) making some assumptions relevant to <span class="math-inline">$\boldsymbol{P}$</span>. There are two assumptions: that height can be approximated by a linear function of age; that errors in the approximation are distributed as i.i.d. Gaussian. The assumptions are sufficient to specify <span class="math-inline">$\boldsymbol{P}$</span>-as they are required to do.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">General remarks</h4>
                        <p>A statistical model is a special class of mathematical model. What distinguishes a statistical model from other mathematical models is that a statistical model is non-deterministic. Thus, in a statistical model specified via mathematical equations, some of the variables do not have specific values, but instead have probability distributions; i.e. some of the variables are stochastic. In the example above, <span class="math-inline">$\varepsilon$</span> is a stochastic variable; without that variable, the model would be deterministic.</p>
                        <p>Statistical models are often used even when the physical process being modeled is deterministic. For instance, coin tossing is, in principle, a deterministic process; yet it is commonly modeled as stochastic (via a Bernoulli process).</p>
                        <p>There are three purposes for a statistical model, according to Konishi & Kitagawa.</p>
