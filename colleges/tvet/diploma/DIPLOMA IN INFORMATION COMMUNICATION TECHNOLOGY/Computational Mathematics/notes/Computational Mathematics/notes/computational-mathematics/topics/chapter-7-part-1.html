                        <p>Data collection is a process of collecting data using different methodologies. It is a very important topic of statistics as well as mathematics. The data collections are known as, any information collected from some person or some other ways to get news. Data collection can be defined as a term which is used to explain the process of preparing and collecting data, such as, a part of a process improvement. The purpose of data collection is to collect important information to keep on record for further use, to make important decisions about different issues, and to pass vital information on to others.</p>

                        <p>They are collected afresh and for the first time, and thus happens to be original in character. They are the most original data and mostly have not undergone any sort of statistical test.</p>

                        <p>They are those that has already been collected by someone else and which has been already been passed through the statistical process. They are not pure and have undergone some treatment at least once.</p>

Editing is a process by which the data collected is examined to discover any error and mistake before it is presented. It has to be understood beforehand itself to what degree the accuracy is needed and to what extent the errors can be tolerated in the inquiry. The editing of secondary data is much simpler than that of primary data.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The process of placing classified data into tabular form is known as tabulation. A table is a symmetric arrangement of statistical data in rows and columns. Rows are horizontal arrangements whereas columns are vertical arrangements. It may be simple, double or complex depending upon the type of classification.</p>
                        <p>one of the most important aspect in any statistical investigation is the manner by which the researcher presents the data</p>
                        <p>various modes of data presentation are:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Textual-data are presented in the form of texts, phrases or paragraphs. Common among newspapers and reports</li>
                            <li>tabular - a more reliable and effective way of showing relationships or comparisons of data</li>
                            <li>graphical-the most effective way of presenting data through the use of statistical graph</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Tables are used to present numerical data in a wide variety of publications from newspapers, journals and textbooks to the sides of grocery packets. They are the format in which most numerical data are initially stored and analysed and are likely to be the means you use to organise data collected during experiments and dissertation research. However, when writing up your work you will have to make a decision about whether a table is the best way of presenting the data, or if it would be easier to understand if you were to use a graph or chart.</p>
                        <p>This section of the guide identifies the appropriate uses of tables, and discusses some design issues for constructing clear tables which are easy to interpret. The points covered in this guide apply equally to primary data that you have collected yourself, and to data that you have found in secondary sources and which you wish to include in your work. The latter may already be presented as a table in the original work but you do not have to reproduce it exactly. It may be that you only require an extract from the table to support your argument, or that the design of the table could be improved, or that you wish to merge information from two different publications. There is no problem in doing any of these as long as you ensure that you reference the original source of the data in your table.</p>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">when you wish to show how a single category of information varies when measured at different points (in time or space). For example, a table would be an appropriate way of showing how the category unemployment rate varies between different countries in the EU (different points in space);</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">When the dataset contains relatively few numbers. This is because it is very hard for a reader to assimilate and interpret many numbers in a table. In particular, avoid the use of complex tables in talks and presentations when the audience will have a relatively short time to take in the information and little or no opportunity to review it at a later stage;</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">When the precise value is crucial to your argument and a graph would not convey the same level of precision. For example, when it is important that the reader knows that the result was 2.48 and not 2.45 ;</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">When you don't wish the presence of one or two very high or low numbers to detract from the message contained in the rest of the dataset. For example if you are presenting information about the annual profits of an organisation and don't want the underlying variability from one year to the next to be swamped by a large loss in a particular year.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Table design</h3>
                        <p>In order to ensure that your table is clear and easy to interpret there are a number of design issues that need to be considered. These are listed below:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Since tables consist of rows and columns of information it is important to consider how the data are arranged between the two. Most people find it easier to identify patterns in numerical data by reading down a column rather than across a row. This means that you should plan your row and column categories to ensure that the patterns you wish to highlight are revealed in the columns. It is also easier to interpret the data if they arranged according to their magnitude so there is numerical progression down the columns, although this may not always be possible.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">If there are several columns or categories of information a table can appear complex and become hard to read. It also becomes more difficult to list the data by magnitude since the order that applies to one column may not be the same for others. In such cases you need to decide which column contains the most important trend and this should be used to structure the table. If the columns are equally important it is often better to include two or more simple tables rather than using a single more complex one.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Numbers in tables should be presented in their most simple format. This may mean rounding up values to avoid the use of decimal places, stating the units (e.g. <span class="math-inline">$¬£ 4.6$</span> million rather than <span class="math-inline">$¬£ 4,600,000$</span> ) or using scientific notation (e.g. <span class="math-inline">$6.315 \times 10-2$</span> rather than 0.06315 ).</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">All tables should be presented with a title that contains enough detail that a reader can understand the content without needing to consult the accompanying text. There should also be information about the source of the data being used; this may be a reference to a book or journal, or could indicate that the data are results from an experiment carried out on a particular date.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Where more than one table is being presented it is standard practice to give each one a unique reference number, and in larger pieces of work, such as dissertations, a list of tables with their page number is usually provided in addition to the contents page.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The formatting of the table should not resemble a spreadsheet where each entry is bounded by a box since this makes it difficult to read across rows or down columns. However, the design of the table should help the reader interpret the data and so the use of lines and/or bold text to separate headings from the body of data, or highlighting/shading specific rows or may be effective. Avoid large gaps between columns since this also makes it difficult to read along a row.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Graphs are a good means of describing, exploring or summarising numerical data because the use of a visual image can simplify complex information and help to highlight patterns and trends in the data. They are a particularly effective way of presenting a large amount of data but can also be used instead of a table to present smaller datasets. There are many different graph types to choose from and a critical issue is to ensure that the graph type selected is the most appropriate for the data. Having done this, it is then essential to ensure that the design and presentation of the graph help the reader or audience interpret the data.</p>
                        <p>A summary of the types of data that can be presented in the most common types of graphs is provided below and this is followed by some general guidelines for designing readily understandable graphs. There is more detailed information on the uses and good design of particular types of graph in the companion study guides covering bar charts, histograms, pie charts, line graphs and scatter plots available from the Student Learning Centre.</p>
