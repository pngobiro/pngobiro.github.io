                        <p>A mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling. Mathematical models are used in the natural sciences (such as physics, biology, earth science, meteorology) and engineering disciplines (such as computer science, artificial intelligence), as well as in the social sciences (such as economics, psychology, sociology, political science).</p>
                        <p>A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behavior.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In common usage, the words hypothesis, model, theory, and law have different interpretations and are at times used without precision, but in science they have very exact meanings.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Hypothesis</h3>
                        <p>It is a limited statement regarding the cause and effect in a specific situation, which can be tested by experimentation and observation or by statistical analysis of the probabilities from the data obtained. The outcome of the test hypothesis should be currently unknown, so that the results can provide useful data regarding the validity of the hypothesis.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes a hypothesis is developed that must wait for new knowledge or technology to be testable. The concept of atoms was proposed by the ancient Greeks, who had no means of testing it. Centuries later, when more knowledge became available, the hypothesis gained support and was eventually accepted by the scientific community, though it has had to be amended many times over the year. Atoms are not indivisible, as the Greeks supposed.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Model</h3>
                        <p>A model is used for situations when it is known that the hypothesis has a limitation on its validity.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Several classes of models</h4>
                        <p>Three classes appear :</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Models which come from laws of physics: this is the case for gravitation laws, Maxwell equations (waves), Navier-Stokes equations (fluid dynamics), and so on;</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Model which come from empirical laws, such as air resistance for a movement: this laws are of empirical nature;</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Models which use statistical laws, for instance that fit a line between several points and assume the response to be linear.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Theory & Law</h3>
                        <p>A scientific theory or law represents a hypothesis (or group of related hypotheses) which has been confirmed through repeated testing, almost always conducted over a span of many years.</p>
                        <p>Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)</p>
                        <p>Generally, a theory is an explanation for a set of related phenomena, like the theory of evolution or the big bang theory.</p>
                        <p>The word "law" is often invoked in reference to a specific mathematical equation that relates the different elements within a theory. Pascal's Law refers an equation that describes differences in pressure based on height. In the overall theory of universal gravitation developed by Sir Isaac Newton, the key equation that describes the gravitational attraction between two objects is called the law of gravity.</p>
                        <p>These days, physicists rarely apply the word "law" to their ideas. In part, this is because so many of the previous "laws of nature" were found to be not so much laws as guidelines, that work well within certain parameters but not within others.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Mathematics can be used to "model", or represent, how the real world works.</p>
                        <p>Example: how much space is inside this cardboard box?</p>
                        <p>We know three measurements:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{I}$</span> (length),</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">w (width), and</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{h}$</span> (height),</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>and the formula for the volume of a cuboid</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/chapter-11-box-simple.jpg" alt="Diagram of a simple cardboard box with dimensions l, w, h" class="content-image">
                        <p>is:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\text { Volume }=1 \times w \times h$$</div>
                        <p>So we have a (very simple) mathematical model of the space in that box.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Accurate?</h3>
                        <p>The model is not the same as the real thing.</p>
                        <p>In our example we did not think about the thickness of the cardboard, or many other "real world" things.</p>
                        <p>But hopefully it is good enough to be useful.</p>
                        <p>If we are charged by the volume of the box we send, we can take a few measurements and know how much to pay.</p>
                        <p>It can also be useful when deciding which box to buy when we need to pack things.</p>
                        <p>So the model is useful!</p>
                        <p>But maybe we need more accuracy, we might need to send hundreds of boxes every day, and the thickness of the cardboard matters. So let's see if we can improve the model:</p>
                        <p>The cardboard is " t " thick, and all measurements are outside the box ... how much space is inside?</p>
                        <p>The inside measurements need to be reduced by the thickness of each side:</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/chapter-11-box-thickness.jpg" alt="Diagram showing how cardboard thickness 't' reduces internal dimensions" class="content-image">
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The inside length is <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{1 - 2 t}$</span></span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The inside width is <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{w - 2 t}$</span>,</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The inside height is <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{h - 2 t}$</span></span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>and now the formula is:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\text { Inside Volume }=(1-2 t) \times(w-2 t) \times(h-2 t)$$</div>
                        <p>Now we have a better model. Still not perfect (did we consider wasted space because we could not pack things neatly, etc ...), but better.</p>
                        <p>So a model is not reality, but should be good enough to be useful.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Playing With The Model</h3>
                        <p>Now we have a model, we can use it in different ways:</p>
                        <p>Example: Your company uses <span class="math-inline">$200 \times 300 \times 400 \mathrm{~mm}$</span> size boxes, and the cardboard is 5 mm thick.</p>
                        <p>Someone suggests using 4 mm cardboard ... how much better is that?</p>
                        <p>Let us compare the two volumes:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Current Volume <span class="math-inline">$=(200-2 \times 5) \times(300-2 \times 5) \times(400-2 \times 5)=190 \times 290 \times 390 = 21,489,000 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$</span></span></li> <!-- Added calculation -->
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">New Volume <span class="math-inline">$=(200-2 \times 4) \times(300-2 \times 4) \times(400-2 \times 4)=192 \times 292 \times 392 = 21,977,088 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$</span></span></li> <!-- Added calculation -->
                        </ul>
                        <p>That is a change of:</p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$(21,977,088-21,489,000) / 21,489,000 \approx 0.0227 \approx 2.3\%$</span> more volume</p> <!-- Corrected calculation -->
                        <p>So the model is useful. It lets us know we will get <span class="math-inline">$\approx 2.3\%$</span> more space inside the box (for the same outside measurements).</p>
                        <p>But there are still "real world" things to think about, such as "will it be strong enough?"</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Thinking Clearly</h3>
                        <p>To set up a mathematical model we also need to think clearly about the facts!</p>
                        <p>Example: on our street there are twice as many dogs as cats. How do we write this as an equation?</p>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Let <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{D}=$</span> number of dogs</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Now ... is that: <span class="math-inline">$2 \mathrm{D}=\mathrm{C}$</span> or should it be: <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{D}=2 \mathrm{C}$</span></p>
                        <p>Think carefully now!</p>
                        <p>The correct answer is <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{D}=2 \mathrm{C}$</span></p>
                        <p>(<span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{2 D}=\mathbf{C}$</span> is a common mistake, as the question is written "twice ... dogs ... cats")</p>
                        <p>Here is another one:</p>
                        <p>Example: You are the supervisor of 8-hour shift workers. They recently had their break times reduced by 10 minutes but total production did not improve.</p>
                        <p>At first glance there is nothing to model, because there was no change in production.</p>
                        <p>But wait a minute ... they are working 10 minutes more, but producing the same amount, so production per hour must have dropped!</p>
                        <p>Let us assume they used to work 7 hours ( 420 minutes):</p>
                        <p>Old work time = 420 min (assuming 1 hour break)</p>
                        <p>New work time = 420 + 10 = 430 min</p>
                        <p>Let P = total production (constant)</p>
                        <p>Old rate = P / 420</p>
                        <p>New rate = P / 430</p>
                        <p>Ratio of New Rate / Old Rate = (P/430) / (P/420) = 420 / 430</p>
                        <p>Change in production per hour = <span class="math-inline">$420 / 430 \approx \mathbf{0 . 9 7 6 7}$</span>...</p> <!-- Corrected calculation -->
                        <p>Which is a reduction of more than <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{2 . 3 \%}$</span></p> <!-- Corrected percentage -->
                        <p>But even worse: the first few hours of the shift are not be affected by the shorter break time, so it could be a 4 or <span class="math-inline">$5 \%$</span> reduction later in the shift.</p>

                        <p>A Bigger Example: Most Economical Size, OK, let us have a go at building and using a mathematical model to solve a real world question.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Your company is going to make its own boxes!</h4>
                        <p>It has been decided the box should hold <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{0 . 0 2 \mathbf { m } ^ { \mathbf { 3 } }}$</span> ( 0.02 cubic meters which is equal to 20 liters) of nuts and bolts.</p>
                        <p>The box should have a square base, and double thickness top and bottom.</p>
                        <p>Cardboard costs <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{\$ 0 . 3 0}$</span> per square meter.</p>
                        <p>It is up to you to decide the most economical size.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Step One: Draw a sketch!</h4>
                        <p>It helps to sketch out what we are trying to solve!</p>
                        <!-- Image missing in MMD (line 5015) -->
                        <p>The base is square, so we will just use " w " for both lengths</p>
                        <p>The box has 4 sides, and double tops and bottoms.</p>
                        <p>The box shape could be cut out like this (but is probably more complicated):</p>
                        <!-- Image missing in MMD (line 5021) -->
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Step Two: Make Formulas.</h4>
                        <p>Ignoring thickness for this model:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\text { Volume }=w \times w \times h=w^{2} h$$</div>
                        <p>And we are told that the volume should be <span class="math-inline">$0.02 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$</span> :</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$w^{2} h=0.02$$</div>
                        <p>Areas:</p>
                        <p>Area of the 4 Sides = <span class="math-inline">$4 \times w \times h=4 w h$</span></p>
                        <p>Area of Double Tops and Bases = <span class="math-inline">$2 \times (w \times w) + 2 \times (w \times w) = 4 w^{2}$</span></p> <!-- Corrected MMD -->
                        <p>Total cardboard needed:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\text { Area of Cardboard }=4 \mathrm{wh}+4 \mathrm{w}^{2}$$</div>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Step Three: Make a Single Formula For Cost</h4>
                        <p>We want a single formula for cost:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\begin{aligned} \text { Cost } & =\$ 0.30 \times \text { Area of Cardboard } \\ & =\$ 0.30 \times\left(4 \mathrm{wh}+4 \mathrm{w}^{2}\right) \end{aligned}$$</div>
                        <p>And that is the cost when we know width and height.</p>
                        <p>That could be hard to work with ... a function with two variables.</p>
                        <p>But we can make it simpler! Because width and height are already related by the volume:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\text { Volume }=w^{2} h=0.02$$</div>
                        <p>... which can be rearranged to ...</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\mathrm{h}=0.02 / \mathrm{w}^{2}$$</div>
                        <p>... and that can be put into the cost formula ...</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\text { Cost }=\$ 0.30 \times\left(4 w \times \mathbf{0 . 0 2} / \mathbf{w}^{2}+4 w^{2}\right)$$</div>
                        <p>And now the cost is related directly to width only.</p>
                        <p>With a little simplification we get:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\text { Cost }=\$ 0.30 \times\left(0.08 / w+4 w^{2}\right)$$</div>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Step Four: Plot it and find minimum cost</h4>
                        <p>What to plot? Well, the formula only makes sense for widths greater than zero, and I also found that for widths above 0.5 the cost just gets bigger and bigger.</p>
                        <p>So here is a plot of that cost formula for widths between <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{0 . 0} \mathbf{~ m}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{0 . 5 5} \mathbf{~ m}$</span> :</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/chapter-11-cost-plot.jpg" alt="Plot of the cost function y = 0.3(0.08/x + 4x^2)" class="content-image">
                        <p>Plot of <span class="math-inline">$y=0.3\left(0.08 / x+4 x^{2}\right)$</span></p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{x}$</span> is width, and <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{y}$</span> is cost</p>
                        <p>Just by eye, I see the cost reaches a minimum at about (0.22, 0.17). In other words:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">when the width is about <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{0 . 2 2} \mathbf{~ m}$</span> (x-value),</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">the minimum cost is about <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{\$ 0 . 1 7}$</span> per box ( y -value).</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In fact, looking at the graph, the width could be anywhere between 0.20 and 0.24 without affecting the minimum cost very much.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Step Five: Recommendations</h4>
                        <p>Using this mathematical model you can now recommend:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Width = <span class="math-inline">$0.22 \mathrm{~m}$</span></span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Or about 16.7 cents per box</p>
                        <p>But any width between 0.20 m and 0.24 m is fine.</p>
                        <p>You might also like to suggest improvements to this model:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                        <p>Mathematical models can also be used to forecast future behavior.</p>
                        <p>Example: An ice cream company keeps track of how many ice creams get sold on different days.</p>
                        <p>By comparing this to the weather on each day they can make a mathematical model of sales versus weather.</p>
                        <p>They can then predict future sales based on the weather forecast, and decide how many ice creams they need to make ... ahead of time!</p>

System designers write pseudo-code to ensure that programmers understand a software project's requirements and align code accordingly. Pseudo-code is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm.</p>
