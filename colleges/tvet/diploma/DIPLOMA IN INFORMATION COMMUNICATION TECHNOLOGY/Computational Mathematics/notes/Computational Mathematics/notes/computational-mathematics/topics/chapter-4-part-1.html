                        <p>Problem 1 - From a bunch of 6 different cards, how many ways we can permute it?</p>
                        <p>Solution - As we are taking 6 cards at a time from a deck of 6 cards, the permutation will be <span class="math-inline">${ }_{6} P_{6}=6!=720$</span></p>
                        <p>Problem 2 - In how many ways can the letters of the word 'READER' be arranged?</p>
                        <p>Solution - There are 6 letters word (2 E, 1 A, 1 D and 2R.) in the word 'READER'.</p>
                        <p>The permutation will be = <span class="math-inline">$6!/[(2!)(1!)(1!)(2!)]=720 / (2 \times 1 \times 1 \times 2) = 720 / 4 = 180$</span>.</p> <!-- Added calculation -->
                        <p>Problem 3 - In how ways can the letters of the word 'ORANGE' be arranged so that the consonants occupy only the even positions?</p>
                        <p>Solution - There are 3 vowels (O,A,E) and 3 consonants (R,N,G) in the word 'ORANGE'. The 6 positions are 1 2 3 4 5 6. The even positions are 2, 4, 6 (3 positions). Number of ways of arranging the 3 consonants in the 3 even positions = <span class="math-inline">$3 P_{3}=3!=6$</span>. The remaining 3 odd positions (1, 3, 5) will be filled up by 3 vowels in <span class="math-inline">$3 P 3=3!=6$</span> ways. Hence, the total number of permutation is <span class="math-inline">$6 \times 6=36$</span></p>
