                        <p>Confusing independent and dependent variables. The Independent variable is what I change." The size of the Dependent variable Depends on the value of the independent variable.</p>
                        <p>Putting wrong variables on axes. For a matter of convenience, it is common practice to put the independent variable on the horizontal <span class="math-inline">$x$</span>-axis (bottom) rather than the vertical <span class="math-inline">$y$</span>-axis (side) when seeking a relationship to define the dependent variable.</p>
                        <p>For instance, if one wants to arrive at a relationship describing F as a function of a, then F (the dependent variable) should be plotted on the y -axis. The slope becomes the proportionality constant, <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>Failure to understand the significance of "linearizing" data. When data are non-linear (not in a straight line when graphed), it is best to "linearize" the data. This does not mean to fit the curved data points with a straight line. Rather, it means to modify one of the variables in some manner such that when the data are graphed using this new data set, the resulting data points will appear to lie in a straight line. For instance, say the data appear to be an inverse function - as <span class="math-inline">$x$</span> is doubled, y is halved. To linearize the data for such a function plot x versus <span class="math-inline">$1 / \mathrm{y}$</span>. If this is indeed an inverse function, then the plot of <span class="math-inline">$x$</span> versus <span class="math-inline">$1 / y$</span> date will be linear.</p>
                        <p>Failure to properly relate <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{m x}+\mathbf{b}$</span> to the linearized data. When plotting, say, distance (on the <span class="math-inline">$y$</span>-axis) versus time (on the x -axis), the correct relationship between distance and time can be found by relating <span class="math-inline">$y$</span> to distance, <span class="math-inline">$x$</span> to time, <span class="math-inline">$m$</span> to the slope, and <span class="math-inline">$b$</span> to the <span class="math-inline">$y$</span>-intercept. For instance, data have been linearized for the function resulting in a straight-line graph when distance is plotted versus time-squared. The slope is <span class="math-inline">$2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} 2$</span> and the y -intercept is 1 m . The correct form of the relationship between all the variables will be distance <span class="math-inline">$=(2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} 2) *$ time $2+1 \mathrm{~m}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>Failure to apply appropriate labeling. Each graph should be appropriately labeled; each axis should be similarly labeled with its variable and units (in parentheses). For instance, time (seconds) or distance (meters).</p>
                        <p>Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)</p>
                        <p>Confusing variables with units. Don't confuse variables (time, resistance, distance) with their units (seconds, ohms, meters).</p>
                        <p>Connecting data points with straight lines. Never connect even linearized data point-to-point with straight lines. Linearized data sometimes appears not to fit the best-fit line precisely. This is frequently due to errors in the data.</p>
                        <p>Scaling errors. In physics it is often best to show the origin <span class="math-inline">$(0,0)$</span> in each graph. While this is not an error, it frequently leads to misinterpretations of relationships. Another problem to avoid is not sticking with a consistent scale on an axis. Values should be equally spaced on graphs. For instance, the distances between <span class="math-inline">$1,2,3$</span>, and 4 should be the same. To be avoided are situations where the spacing between such numbers is irregular or inconsistent.</p>
                        <p>Failing to properly interpret horizontal and vertical slopes. When the slope of a line is zero degrees (horizontal), then there is no relationship between the plotted variables. When the slope of a line is 90 degrees (vertical), there is no relationship between the plotted variables. In both these cases, the so-called "dependent" variable does not actually depend upon the independent variable.</p>
                        <p>Failing to properly interpret a negative slope. A negative slope does NOT imply an inverse relationship. What it does imply is that when x gets larger, y becomes larger but in the negative direction. <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{y}=-\mathrm{mx}$</span> is a negative slope. <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{xy}=\mathrm{m}$</span> or <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{x}=\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{y}$</span> is an inverse relationship. Additionally, a negative acceleration does not necessary imply a slowing down of an object. An object moving in the -x direction will, in fact, be increasing in speed.</p>
                        <p>Failing to properly interpret the <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{y}$</span>-intercept. The value of the y -intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. Sometimes when lines or curve representing relationships clearly should pass through the origin <span class="math-inline">$(0,0)$</span>, they do not. The value of the y-intercept is then small but not zero. This is usually the result of data collection errors. Linearized data can be "forced through the origin" by conducting a proportional fit of the data (<span class="math-inline">$y =m x$</span>) rather than a linear fit (<span class="math-inline">$y=m x+b$</span>).</p>
                        <p>Finding slope using two data points NOT on best-fit line. Finding the slope of the best-fit line from two data points rather than two points on the best-fit line is a common error. This can result in a substantial error in the slope. Use two points on the best-fit line for this process, not data points to find the slope of a line.</p>
                        <p>Improperly finding the slope using elements of a single coordinate point. When finding the slope of a tangent line, students sometimes will mistakenly take the coordinate point nearest where the tangent line is drawn and from those coordinates attempt to determine the slope. For instance, at <span class="math-inline">$(\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y})=(5 \mathrm{~s}, 25 \mathrm{~m})$</span> the data point values are mistakenly used to find a slope of <span class="math-inline">$25 \mathrm{~m} / 5 \mathrm{~s} =5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>Failing to recognize trends. Graphs must be properly interpreted through the use of generalizations (e.g., double the mass, and the period increases by 4)</p>
                        <p>Improperly interpreting the physical meaning of the slope. The units of a slope are a giveaway as far as interpreting the physical meaning of a slope is concerned. The slope is defined as the change in the <span class="math-inline">$y$</span> value divided by a corresponding change in the <span class="math-inline">$x$</span> value. Hence, the units are those of the <span class="math-inline">$y$</span>-axis divided by those of the <span class="math-inline">$x$</span>-axis. If distance (m) is on the <span class="math-inline">$y$</span>-axis, and time(s) on the x -axis, then the slope's units will be <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$</span> which is the unit for speed. Similarly, if velocity ( <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$</span> ) is on the y -axis and time ( s ) is on the x -axis, then <span class="math-inline">$(\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}) / \mathrm{s}=\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s} 2$</span>, the unit of acceleration. Slopes can be either positive or negative.</p>
                        <p>Misinterpreting the area under a best-fit line or curve. To more easily determine what the area under the curve represents, examine the product of the units on the <span class="math-inline">$x$</span>- and <span class="math-inline">$y$</span>-axes. For instance, if velocity or speed ( <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$</span> ) is on the y -axis and time ( s ) is on the x -axis, the product of the units will be meters that is the unit of displacement or distance. Hence, the area under the curve of a v-t graph is displacement. Similarly, the area under the curve of an a-t graph is velocity.</p>
                        <p>Not recognizing errors in data. When one graphs data, large errors in measurement usually stand out. They become noticeable when they deviate from the trend of the data. Such data points should not only be questioned, but the data collection process for this datum repeated to see if there is a readily explainable error. Suspect data should be struck through rather than erased in the written record. Update the data file appropriately.</p>
                        <p>Not understanding the meaning of the best-fit line. A best-fit line is a line which, when drawn, minimizes the sum of the squares of the deviations from the line usually in the <span class="math-inline">$y$</span> direction. It is the line that most closely approximates the trend of the data.</p>
                        <p>Statistics is the study of the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. It deals with all aspects of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.</p>
