                        <p>The key fact about the 'rule' they all obey is that it must be well-defined. In other words, it enables us to say for sure whether or not a given 'thing' belongs to the collection.

                        <p>'... has 5 or more letters'</p>
                        <p>A rule which is not well-defined (and therefore couldn't be used to define a set) might be:</p>

                        <p>The set of all the 'things' currently under discussion is called the universal set (or sometimes, simply the universe). It is denoted by <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{U}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>The universal set doesn't contain everything in the whole universe. On the contrary, it restricts us to just those things that are relevant at a particular time. For example, if in a given situation we're talking about numeric values - quantities, sizes, times, weights, or whatever - the universal set will be a suitable set of numbers (see below). In another context, the universal set may be {alphabetic characters} or {all living people\}, etc.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Singleton Set:</h3>
                        <p>A set which contains only one element is called a singleton set.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><span class="math-inline">$A=\{x: x$</span> is neither prime nor composite<span class="math-inline">$\}$</span></span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is a singleton set containing one element, i.e., 1 .</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><span class="math-inline">$B=\{x: x$</span> is a whole number, <span class="math-inline">$x<1\}$</span></span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This set contains only one element 0 and is a singleton set.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Let <span class="math-inline">$A=\left\{x: x \in N\right.$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\left.x^{2}=4\right\}$</span></span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here A is a singleton set because there is only one element 2 whose square is 4 .</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Let <span class="math-inline">$B=\{x: x$</span> is a even prime number<span class="math-inline">$\}$</span></span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here B is a singleton set because there is only one prime number which is even, i.e., 2 .</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Finite Set:</h3>
                        <p>A set which contains a definite number of elements is called a finite set. Empty set is also called a finite set.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">The set of all colors in the rainbow.</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Infinite Set:</h3>
                        <p>The set whose elements cannot be listed, i.e., set containing never-ending elements is called an infinite set.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Set of all points in a plane</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><span class="math-inline">$A=\{x: x \in N, x>1\}$</span></span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Set of all prime numbers</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><span class="math-inline">$B=\{x: x \in W, x=2 n\}$</span></span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note:</p>
                        <p>All infinite sets cannot be expressed in roster form.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <p>The set of real numbers since the elements of this set do not follow any particular pattern.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cardinal Number of a Set:</h3>
                        <p>The number of distinct elements in a given set A is called the cardinal number of A . It is denoted by <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{n}(\mathrm{A})$</span>.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><span class="math-inline">$A\{x: x \in N, x<5\} A=\{1,2,3,4\}$</span></span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Therefore, <span class="math-inline">$n(A)=4$</span></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{B}=$</span> set of letters in the word ALGEBRA</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$B=\{A, L, G, E, B, R\}$</span></p>
                        <p>Therefore, <span class="math-inline">$n(B)=6$</span></p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Equivalent Sets:</h3>
                        <p>Two sets <span class="math-inline">$A$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$B$</span> are said to be equivalent if their cardinal number is same, i.e., <span class="math-inline">$n(A)=n(B)$</span>. The symbol for denoting an equivalent set is ' <span class="math-inline">$\leftrightarrow$</span> '.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$A=\{1,2,3\}$</span> Here <span class="math-inline">$n(A)=3$</span></p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$B=\{p, q, r\}$</span> Here <span class="math-inline">$n(B)=3$</span></p>
                        <p>Therefore, <span class="math-inline">$A \leftrightarrow B$</span></p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Equal sets:</h3>
                        <p>Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they contain the same elements. Every element of A is an element of <span class="math-inline">$B$</span> and every element of <span class="math-inline">$B$</span> is an element of <span class="math-inline">$A$</span>.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$A=\{p, q, r, s\}$</span></p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$B=\{p, s, r, q\}$</span></p>
                        <p>Therefore, <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{B}$</span></p>

                        <p>Question 1: <span class="math-inline">$A$</span> is a set of alphabets and <span class="math-inline">$B$</span> is a set of numbers. What is the intersection of <span class="math-inline">$A$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$B$</span> ?</p>
                        <p>Solution: <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A} \cap \mathrm{B}=\{ \}$</span></p>
                        <p>Question 2: Write the set A which is a set of goats with 10 legs.</p>
                        <p>Solution: A = \{ \}</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Power Set of the Empty Set</h3>
                        <p>A set is called the power set of any set, if it contains all subsets of that set. We can use the notation <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{S})$</span> for representing any power set of the set. Now, from the definition of an empty set, it is clear that there is no element in it and hence, the power set of an empty set i.e.P <span class="math-inline">$(\phi)$</span> is the set which contain only one empty set, hence <span class="math-inline">$P(\phi)=\{\phi\}$</span></p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cartesian Product Empty Set</h3>
                        <p>The Cartesian product of any two sets say A and B are denoted by A X B. There are some conditions for Cartesian product of empty sets as follows:</p>
                        <p>If we have two sets A and B in such a way that both the sets are empty sets, then A <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{XB}=\phi \times \phi=$</span> <span class="math-inline">$\phi$</span>. It is clear that, the cartesian product of two empty sets is again an empty set.</p>
                        <p>If <span class="math-inline">$A$</span> is an empty set and <span class="math-inline">$B=\{1,2,3\}$</span>, then the cartesian product of <span class="math-inline">$A$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$B$</span> is as follows: <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{AXB}=\{\phi\} .\{1,2,3\}=\{\phi \mathrm{X} 1, \phi \mathrm{X} 2, \phi \times 3\}=\{\phi, \phi, \phi\}=\{\phi\}$</span></p>
                        <p>So, we say that if one of the set is an empty set from the given two sets, then again the Cartesian product of these two sets is an empty set.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Examples of Empty Sets</h3>
                        <p>Given below are some of the examples of empty sets.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Solved Examples</h4>
                        <p>Question 1: Which of the following represents the empty set?</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">A set of cats with 4 legs</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">A set of apples with red color</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text">A set of positive numbers in which all are less than 1</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">4.</span><span class="item-text">A set of rectangles with 4 sides</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <p>Option 1: A set of cats with 4 legs. This set is possible where cats are having 4 legs.</p>
                        <p>Option 2: A set of apples with red color. This set is possible where apple is in red color.</p>
                        <p>Option 3: A set of positive numbers in which all are less than 1.</p>
                        <p>This set is not possible because the positive numbers must be greater than 1 . So, this set is considered as empty set.</p>
                        <p>Answer: 3</p>
                        <p>Question 2: A is a set of numbers from 1 to 10 B is a set of negative numbers. What is the intersection of A and B ?</p>
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <p>Given:</p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A}=$</span> set of number from 1 to <span class="math-inline">$10 .=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$</span></p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{B}=$</span> set of negative numbers</p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$=\{-1,-2,-3,-4, \ldots .\}$</span></p>
                        <p>Intersection of <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{B}=\mathrm{A} \cap \mathrm{B}=\{ \}$</span></p>
                        <p>Answer: The intersection of given sets is an empty set.</p>
