                        <p>The intersection of two sets is the set of all the elements of two sets that are common in both of them. If we have two sets A and B, then the intersection of them is denoted by A <span class="math-inline">$\cap$</span> B and it is read as A intersection B .</p> <!-- Corrected symbol -->
                        <p>Let <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{X}=\{2,3,8,9\}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{Y}=\{5,12,9,16\}$</span> are two sets.</p>
                        <p>Now, we are going to understand the concept of Intersection of set. It is represented by the symbol " <span class="math-inline">$\cap$</span> ".</p> <!-- Corrected symbol -->
                        <p>If we want to find the intersection of <span class="math-inline">$A$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$B$</span>, the common part of the sets <span class="math-inline">$A$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$B$</span> is the intersection of A and B. It is represented as A <span class="math-inline">$\cap$</span> B. That is, if an element is present in both A and B, then that will be there in the intersection of A and B. It will be more clear with the below figure.</p>
                        <p>Let A and B are two sets. Then, the intersection of A and B can be shown as below.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Intersection of Convex Sets</h4>
                        <p>In a Vector space, a set is called convex set if all the elements of the line joining two points of that set also lies on that set. In other words, we can say that the set <span class="math-inline">$S$</span> is convex set if for any points x , <span class="math-inline">$y \in S$</span>, there are no points on the straight line joining points x and y are not in the set S.</p> <!-- Corrected symbols -->
                        <p>The intersection of two convex set is again a convex set. We can prove it with the help of contradiction method. So, lets suppose that A and B are the two convex sets. And, let we have two points <span class="math-inline">$x$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$y$</span> in such a way that <span class="math-inline">$x \in A \cap B$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$y \in A \cap B$</span>, then <span class="math-inline">$x \in A, x \in B, y \in A$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$y \in B$</span> and there exists a point z in such a way that z is not in A or B or both. This is the contradiction of our assumption that A and B are the convex sets. So there is no such point <span class="math-inline">$x, y$</span> and z can exists and A <span class="math-inline">$\cap$</span> B is a convex set.</p> <!-- Corrected symbols -->

                        <p>If we have <span class="math-inline">$A, B$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$C$</span> , then the intersection of these three sets are the set of all elements <span class="math-inline">$A, B$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$C$</span> that are common in these three sets.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsection-heading">Solved Example</h5>
                        <p>Question:</p>
                        <p>If we have <span class="math-inline">$A=\{1,3,5,7,6,8\}, B=\{2,4,6,8,9\}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$C=\{1,3,6,8\}$</span>, then find the <span class="math-inline">$A \cap B \cap C$</span>.</p>
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <p>Given that <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A}=\{1,3,5,7,6,8\}, \mathrm{B}=\{2,4,6,8,9\}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{C}=\{1,3,6,8\}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>Then, it is clear that the elements 6 and 8 are common in all the three given sets.</p>
                        <p>Hence, we get <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A} \cap \mathrm{B} \cap \mathrm{C}=\{6,8\}$</span>.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Intersection of Open Sets</h4>
                        <p>Every intersection of open sets is again an open set. Let us have two open sets <span class="math-inline">$A_{1}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$A_{2}$</span>. If the intersection of both of them is empty and empty set is again an open set. Hence, the intersection is an open set.</p>
                        <p>If <span class="math-inline">$A_{1}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$A_{2}$</span> are open sets, then there exists some <span class="math-inline">$x \in A_{1} \cap A_{2}$</span>. Since the given sets are open, we have some <span class="math-inline">$r_{1}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$r_{2}$</span> in such a way that <span class="math-inline">$B_{r_{1}}(x) \subset A_{1}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$B_{r_{2}}(x)\subset A_{2}$</span>. So, we can choose a number <span class="math-inline">$r = \min(r_1, r_2)$</span> such that <span class="math-inline">$B_{r}(x)\subset A_{1}\cap A_{2}$</span>.</p> <!-- Corrected formula and symbols -->
                        <p>So, we can say that if the intersection is not empty, then by the use of definition of intersection and non emptiness, there exists any <span class="math-inline">$x \in A_{i}$</span> for all <span class="math-inline">$A_{i}$</span> 's, where all <span class="math-inline">$A_{i}$</span> 's are open sets. Then, we have <span class="math-inline">$B_{r_{i}}(x)\subset A_{i}$</span> for some <span class="math-inline">$r_{i}>0$</span>.</p>

Thus, it is the set of everything that does not belong to A.

                        <p>Since we know that every set is the subset of the universal set U , then the complementary set is also the subset of U .

If <span class="math-inline">$A$</span> is the given set, then the complement of <span class="math-inline">$A$</span> is denoted as <span class="math-inline">$A^{c}$</span> or <span class="math-inline">$A^{\prime}$</span>.</p>

                        <p>If we have two sets <span class="math-inline">$A$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$B$</span>, then the symmetric difference of these two sets <span class="math-inline">$A$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$B$</span> is the set of all elements those are either in A or in B not in both sets. So, we can say that the symmetric difference of two sets is the union without the intersection. We can use the symbol <span class="math-inline">$\triangle$</span> for this and denoted as follows:</p> <!-- Corrected symbol -->
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$A \triangle B = \{x \mid (x \in A \land x \notin B) \lor (x \notin A \land x \in B)\}$</span></p> <!-- Corrected formula and symbols -->

                        <p>Symmetric Difference of Sets <span class="math-inline">$A \triangle B$</span></p>
                        <p>The symmetric difference of sets is associative. So, if we have three sets <span class="math-inline">$A, B$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$C$</span>, then <span class="math-inline">$(A \triangle B) \triangle C = A \triangle(B \triangle C)$</span></p> <!-- Corrected symbols -->
                        <p>The symmetric difference of two sets is commutative i.e. for all sets A and B, we have <span class="math-inline">$A \triangle B = B \triangle A$</span></p> <!-- Corrected symbols -->

                        <p>Given below are some of the problems based on difference of sets.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Solved Examples</h4>
                        <p>Question 1: Consider the two sets <span class="math-inline">$A=\{11,12,13,14,15,16\}, B=\{12,14,16,18\}$</span>. Find the difference between the two sets?</p>
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <p>Given <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A}=\{11,12,13,14,15,16\}$</span></p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$B=\{12,14,16,18\}$</span></p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$A-B=\{11,13,15\}$</span></p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{A}=\{18\}$</span></p>
                        <p>The set of all elements are present in A or in B. But, not in both is called the symmetric difference set.</p>
                        <p>Question 2: <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A}=\{2,3,4,1,8,9\}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{B}=\{2,3,4,1,8,, 12\}$</span>. What is <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{B}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{A}$</span> ?</p> <!-- Typo in B -->
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <p>Given <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A}=\{2,3,4,1,8,9\}$</span></p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$B=\{2,3,4,1,8,12\}$</span></p> <!-- Corrected typo -->
                        <p>Here, all elements of A is available in B except 9 .</p>
                        <p>So, the difference <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{B}=\{9\}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>Here, all elements of B are available in A except 12.</p>
                        <p>So, the difference <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{B}-\mathrm{A}=\{12\}$</span>.</p>
                        <p>Question 3: Consider two sets <span class="math-inline">$A=\{a, b, f, g, h\}, B=\{f, g, a, k\}$</span>. Find <span class="math-inline">$A-B$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$B-A$</span> ?</p>
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <p>Given <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{A}=\{\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}, \mathrm{f}, \mathrm{g}, \mathrm{h}\}$</span></p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$B=\{f, g, a, k\}$</span> So, <span class="math-inline">$A-B=\{b, h\}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$B-A=\{k\}$</span></p>
                        <p>Question 4: Consider given sets <span class="math-inline">$P=\{19,38,57,76,95\}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$Q=\{7,19,57,75,94\}$</span>. Find <span class="math-inline">$P - Q$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$Q - P$</span> .</p>
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <p>Given <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{P}=\{19,38,57,76,95\}$</span></p>
                        <p><span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{Q}=\{7,19,57,75,94\}$</span> So, <span class="math-inline">$P-Q=\{38,76,95\}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{Q}-\mathrm{P}=\{7,75,94\}$</span></p>
