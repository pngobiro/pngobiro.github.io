Answer booklet.
This paper consists of EIGHT questions.
Answer any FIVE of the EIGHT questions in the answer booklet provided.
Candidates should answer the questions in English.
}

This paper consist of 4 printed pages.
Candidates should check the questions paper to ascertain that all the pages are printed as indicated and that no questions are missing.
1. (a) Explain each of the following measurement scales as used in the classification of statistical data:
(i) nominal scale;

(6 marks)
(ii) Determine the surface area enclosed by the two lines.
2. (a) Distinguish between interpolation and extrapolation as used in mathematics. (2 marks)
(b) When data is grouped into classes, any measure calculated is merely an estimate no matter how accurate the calculation is. Justify this statement.
(c) The data in Table 1 shows the distribution of heights in cm of 500 male students of a certain secondary school. Use it to answer the questions that follow.
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline Height in cm & $140-150$ & $150-160$ & $160-170$ & $170-180$ & $180-190$ & $190-200200-210$ \\
\hline No. of students & 15 & 50 & 100 & 160 & 120 & 45 & 10 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Table 1
(i) Estimate by calculation the following measures about the height of the students: I. the median;
II. the standard deviation.
(ii) The coach of the school's basketball team wants to recruit players into the team. However he wants to recruit only among the top $36 \%$ in height. Determine the minimum height for a student to qualify to join the basketball team. (2 marks)
(iii) Suppose the basketball coach has set a minimum height of 182 cm for a student to qualify to join the basketball team, determine the proportion of the students who would qualify.
(3 marks)
(iv) Construct an ogive curve to represent the data.
3. (a) Explain three methods that could be used to collect primary statistical data. (6 marks)
(b) Convert each of the following number systems to their respective equivalents showing your working:
(i) 637428 to hexadecimal;
(ii) $\mathrm{D}_{8 \mathrm{~B}_{16}}$ to octal;
(iii) $8345_{10}$ to binary.
(c) Six family couples run a business as partners. A delegation of four people is to be chosen to represent the business in a conference. Determine the number of ways in which the delegation can be selected under each of the following conditions:
(i) if a man and his wife cannot both be selected;
(ii) if each sex must be at least one quarter of the total delegation.
4. (a) Explain the term parity bit as used in computer data representation.
(b) (i) Using the binomial theorem, expand the binomial expression $(3 x+y)^{6}$ in ascending powers of $x$.
(ii) Using the expansion in (i), evaluate the expression (15.1) ${ }^{6}$
(c) A cubic polynomial function is given by $f(x)=x^{3}-5 x^{2}+3 x+8$. Using the Newton-Raphson iterative method, determine the root of the equation rounded off to 4 decimal places. Take the initial root $x_{0}=2.0$.
5. (a) Define each of the following terms as used in numerical analysis:
(i) absolute error;
(ii) relative error.
(b) Explain three properties of the standard deviation as a measure of dispersion. (6 marks)
(c) Given two matrices A and B such that:
$A=\left[\begin{array}{ll}5 & 7 \\ 4 & 6\end{array}\right]$.

(10 marks)
6. (a) Some of the measures of central tendency are viewed as points of equilibrium. Explain the context in which each of the following statistical measures is considered as a point of equilibrium in a distribution:
(i) the arithmetic mean;
(ii) the median.
(b) Differentiate between a diagonal matrix and a non-singular matrix as used in mathematics.
(c) Solve the following set of simultaneous equations using the matrix method.

& 5 x+8 y=96
\end{aligned}$$
(d) A manufacturing company produces ballpoint pens in two colours as follows: blue $75 \%$, and red $25 \%$. The machine is set to produce these colours randomly but maintaining the proportions.
