   QUANTITATIVE TECHNIQUES

   GENERAL OBJECTIVES

At the end of this course unit, the trainee should be able to;-
     broaden his/her knowledge in mathematical application;
     understand and appreciate the role of quantitative methods in
       decision making;
     collect and organize statistical data for management;
     analyze quantitative data for management decision making;
     Apply quantitative methods in solving business problems.

Introduction
Def; quantitative techniques are those techniques which provides the
decision maker with a systematic and powerful means of analysis and help,
based on quantitative data in exploring policies for achieving pre-




                                                         om
determined goals Involves the use of numbers, symbols and other
mathematical expressions.




                                                    i.c
They are essentially helpful in supplementing to judgment and intuition.

                                                ng
These techniques evaluate planning factors of alternatives as and when
they arise rather than prescribe courses of action. They are particularly
                                              si
relevant to problems of complex business enterprises.

Limitation of Q.T s
  1. the inherent limitation concerning mathematical expressions
  2. high costs involved in the use of QTs
  3. They do not take into consideration the intangible factors i.e. non-
      measurable human factors.
  4. Quantitative techniques are just the tools of analysis and not the
      complete decision making process.

Role of QT in business and industry
    1. they provide a tool for scientific analysis
these techniques provides executives with a more precise description of the
cause and effect relationship and risks underlying the business operations in
measurable terms and this eliminates the conventional
intuitive and subjective basis on which management used to formulate their
decisions.
    2. they provide solution for various business problems




                                                       om
Are used in the field of production, procurement, marketing, finance and
other allied fields. Problems like how best can managers and executive4s




                                                   i.c
allocate available resources to various products so that in a given time the

                                               ng
profits are maximized or costs are minimized. Is it possible for an
enterprise to arrange the time and quantity of orders of its stocks such that
                                            si
the overall profit with given resources is maximized?
                                       om

    3. they enable proper development of resources
E.g. programmed evaluation and review techniques (PERT) enables us to
                                 om



determine earliest and the latest time fro each of he events and activities
and thereby helps in the identification of the critical path
All these helps in deployment of resources from one activity to another to
                             as




enable the project completion on time.
                        .m




    4. They help in minimizing waiting and servicing time.
The queuing theory helps management in minimizing the total waiting of
                      w




servicing costs. It also analyses the feasibility of adding facilities and
                   w




thereby helping to take correct and profitable decision.
                w




    5. They enable management to decide when to buy and how much to
        buy.
The main objective of inventory planning is to achieve balance between the
costs of holding stock and benefits of holding stock. Helps in determining
when to buy and how much to buy.
    6. They assist in choosing an optimum strategy.
In a competitive situation game theory helps to determine optimum
strategy which maximizes profits or minimizes loses but adopting optimum
strategy.
    7. they render great help in optimum resource allocation
    8. they facilitate the process of decision making
    9. Through various QTs management can know the reactions of the
        integrated business systems.

   ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS

   Algebra




                                                       om
   Algebra is a branch of mathematics in which, instead of using numbers,
   we use letters to represent numbers.




                                                   i.c
   We all know that 2+3=5.
                                              ng
                                           si
   Suppose, though, that we substitute letters for the first two numbers, so
                                      om

   that:
                                om



   2=a

   3=b
                             as
                        .m




   We can then write:
                     w




       a+b=5
                  w




   All that has happened is that we have replaced the numbers with
               w




   letters. However, a number is a specific quantity – e.g., 5 is more than
   4, but less than 6 – whereas a letter can be used to represent any
   number. Thus in the above expression, ‗a‘ could be 4 and ‗b‘ could be 1.
   We only know that they are 2 and 3 respectively because we defined
   them as such before.

   The main consequence of this is that algebra uses general expression
   and gives general results, whereas arithmetic (using numbers) uses
   definite numbers and gives definite results. Arithmetic is specific
   whereas algebra is general.

Equations
An equation is an expression with an equal sign (=)
Equations are classified into two main groups‘ linear equations and non
linear equations. Examples of linear equations are
       x + 13 = 15
       7x + 6 = 0


Non linear equations in the variable x are equations in which x appears in
the second or higher degrees. They include quadratic and cubic equations
amongst others. For example




                                                        om
       5x2 + 3x + 7 = 0 (quadratic equation)
        2x3 + 4x2 + 3x + 8 = 0 (cubic equation)




                                                    i.c
The solution of equations or the values of the variables for which the
                                                  ng
equations hold is called the roots of the equation or the solution set.
                                               si
Solution of linear equations.
                                         om


Supposing M, N, and P are expressions that may or may not involve
                                     om



variables, then the following constitute some rules which will be useful in
the solution of linear equations
                                as




Rule 1: Additional rule
                           .m




       If M = N then M + P = N + P
                       w




Rule 2: Subtraction rule
                    w




       If M = N, Then M – P = N – P
                  w




Rule 3: multiplication rule
       If M = N and P ≠ O then M x P = N x P
Rule 4: Division rule
       If P x M = N and P ≠ O
       And N/P = Q Q being a raterial number then
       M = N/P

                                    om



Rule 1: Addition rule

Rule 2: Subtraction Rule
         If M < N and M1 ≥N1
Then M – P < N – P and
         M1 – P ≥N1– P
Rule 3: Multiplication rule
         If M ≥N and M1 > N1 and P≠ 0
         Then MP ≥NP; M1P > N1P
         M (-P) ≤ N (-P) and M1 (-P) < N1(-P)
Rule 4: Division
         If M > N and M1< N1 and P≠ 0
    9
          Then M/P > N/P: M1/P < N1/P
          M/ (-P) < N/ (-P): and M1/ (-P) > N1/ (-P)
Rule 5: Inversion Rule
          If M/P ≤ N/Q where P, Q ≠ 0
          M1/P > N1/Q
          Then P/M ≥ Q/N and P/M1 < Q/N1
Note: The rules for solving equations are the same as those for solving
equations with one exception; when both sides of an equation is multiplied
or divided by a negative number, the inequality symbol must be reversed
(see rule 3 & Rule 4 above).

Linear inequalities in two variables: relations
                             w
                         w




An expression of the form
                       w




          Y ≥ 2x – 1
Is technically called a relation. It corresponds to a function, but different
from it in that, corresponding to each value of the independent variable x,
there is more than one value of the dependent variable y
Relations can be successfully presented graphically and are of major
importance in linear programming.


Solutions of linear simultaneous equations.

Two or more equations will form a system of linear simultaneous equations
if such equations be linear in the same two or more variables.


   11
For instance, the following systems of the two equations is simultaneous in
the two variables x and y.
       2x + 6y = 23
        4x + 7y = 10
The solution of a system of linear simultaneous equations is a set of values
of the variables which simultaneously satisfy all the equations of the
system.

Solution techniques
           a) The graphical technique
The graphical technique of solving a system of linear equations consists of
drawing the graphs of the equations of the system on the same rectangular
coordinate system. The coordinates of the point of intersection of the
equations of the system would then be the solution.

The above figure illustrates:
Solution by graphical method of two equations
        2x + y = 8
        x + 2y = 10
The system has a unique solution (2, 4) represented by the point of
intersection of the two equations.

           b) The elimination technique
   12
This method requires that each variable be eliminated in turn by making
the absolute value of its coefficients equal in the equations of the system
and then adding or subtracting the equations. Making the absolute values of
the coefficients equal necessitates the multiplication of each equation by
an appropriate numerical factor.
Consider the system of two equations (i) and (ii) below
         2x – 3y = 8 …….. ........................... (i).
         3x + 4y = -5 …….. .......................... (ii).
Step 1
Multiply (i) by 3
6x – 9y = 24 …… .................................... (iii).




                                                               om
Multiply (ii) By 2




                                                              i.c
6x + 8y = - 10 …… .................................. (iv).
Subtract (iii) from (iv).
                                                       ng
17y = -34 ……........................................ (v).
                                                   si
                                               om

        y = -2
                                       om



Step 2
                                  as




Multiply (i) by 4
                             .m




8x – 12y = 32 ……. ................................. (vi)
                          w




Multiply (ii) by 3
                       w




9x + 12y = -15 ….. ................................. (vii)
                    w




Add (vi) to (vii)
17x = 17 ……......................................... (viii)
        x=1
Thus x = 1, y = -2      i.e. {1,-2}

            c) The substitution technique
To illustrate this technique, consider the system of two equations (i) and
(ii) reproduced below
... 2x – 3y = 8 ……..                   (i).
... 3x + 4y = -5 ……                    (ii).
    13
The solution of this system can be obtained by
   a) Solving one of the equations for one variable in terms of the other
      variable;
   b) Substituting this value into the other equation(s) thereby obtaining
      an equation with one unknown only
   c) Solving this equation for its single variable finally
   d) Substituting this value into any one of the two original equations so
      as to obtain the value of the second variable

Step 1
Solve equation (i) for variable x in terms of y
         2x – 3y = 8
         x= 4 + 3/2 y               (iii)




                                                          om
Step 2
Substitute this value of x into equation (ii). And obtain an equation in y only




                                                      i.c
         3x + 4y = -5
         3 (4 + 3/2 y) + 4y = -5                  ng
                                              si
         8 ½ y = - 17 …….           (iv)
                                            om

Step 3
                                    om



Solve the equation (iv). For y
         8½y = -17
                                   as




         y = -2
                            .m




Step 4
                          w
                        w




Substitute this value of y into equation (i) or (iii) and obtain the value of x
                   w




         2x – 3y = 8
         2x – 3(-2) = 8
         x=1

Example
Solve the following by substitution method
         2x + y = 8
         3x – 2y = -2
Solution
Solve the first equation for y

   14
        y = 8 – 2x
Substitute this value of y into the second equation and solve for x
        3x – 2y = -2
        3x – 2 (8-2x) = -2
        x=2
Substitute this value of x into either the first or the second original
equation and solve for y
        2x + y = 8
        (2) (2) + y = 8
        y=4

situation where there are only 3 items but if the number of items exceeds 3
then determining the no. of permutations by outlining as done above may
be cumbersome. Therefore we use a special formula to determine such
permutations. The formula is given below

then we have a new combination

Example

       16
3 items x, y and z will have 6 different permutations but only one
combination.
The following formula is usually used to determine the no. of combinations
in a given situation.

Example
There is a committee to be selected comprising of 5 people from a group of
5 men and 6 women. If the selection is randomly done. Find the possibility
of having the following possibilities (combinations)
    i.    Three men and two women
    ii.   At least one man and at least one woman must be in the
          committee
    iii.  One particular man and one particular woman must not be in the
          committee (one man four women)

SETS THEORY
Introduction
Sets and set theory
A set is a collection of distinct objects. We may consider all the ocean in
the world to be a set with the objects being whales, sea plants, sharks,
octopus etc, similarly all the fresh water lakes in Africa can form a set.
Supposing A to be a set
          A = {4, 6, 8, 13}


   19
The objects in the set, that is, the integers 4, 6, 8 and 13 are referred to as
the members or elements of the set. The elements of a set can be listed in
any order. For example,
         A = {4, 6, 8, 13} = {8, 4, 13, 6}
Sets are always precisely defined. Each element occurs once and only once
in a set.

The notion  is used to indicate membership of a set. ∉ represents non
membership. However, in order to represent the fact that one set is a
subject of another set, we use the notion  . A set ―S‖ is a subject of
another set ―T‖ if every element in ―S‖ is a member of ―T‖
Example
If A = {4, 6, 8, 13} then

              4  {4, 6, 8, 13} or 4  A; 16 ∉ A




                                                            om
   i)
   ii)        {4, 8}  A; {5, 7}  A; A  A




                                                        i.c
Methods of set representation

                                                    ng
Capital letters are normally used to represent sets. However, there are two
different methods for representing members of a set:
                                                   si
   i.         The descriptive method and
                                             om

   ii.        The enumerative method
                                      om



The descriptive method involves the description of members of the set in
such a way that one can determine the elements of the set without
                                  as




difficulty.
                             .m




The enumerative method requires that one writes out all the members of
the set within the curly brackets.
                          w




For example, the set of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 can be
                       w




represented ass follows
                    w




         P = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} ,       enumerative method
         P = {X/x = 0, 1, 2…7}                descriptive method
         Or
         P = {x/0 ≤ x ≤7} where x is an integer.


         Types of sets
   a) Finite and infinite sets
A set can be classified as a finite or infinite set, depending upon the
number of elements it has. A finite set has a finite number of elements
whereas an infinite set has an infinite number of elements.

   20
For example, set P below has ten elements and is therefore a finite set. Set
S, on the other hand, is an infinite set since it has an infinite number of
elements.




        P = {2, 4, 6…20}
        S = {1, 3, 5…}
   b) Universal set
The term refers to the set that contains all the elements that an analyst
wishes to study.
The notation U or ξ is generally used to denote universal sets
    c) The null set or empty set




                                                            om
This is a set which contains no elements. It is normally designated by a
Greek letter Ø, or { }.




                                                        i.c
The sets Ø and {Ø} are not the same thing since the former has no elements
                                                    ng
in it, while the later has one element in it, namely zero
                                                si
   d) Equal or equivalent sets
                                          om

Two sets C and D are said to be equal if every member of set C belongs to D
and every member of set D also belongs to C
                                    om



   e) Complement of a set
The complement of set A is written as A΄. This set contains all those
                                as




elements of universal set which are not in A
                           .m




   f) Intersection and union
B  C Denotes the intersection of B and C. it is the set containing all those
                         w




elements, which belong to both B and C
                     w




        If B = {5, 8, 11, 20, 25} and C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}
                  w




        Then B  C = {5, 11}
        B  C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 20 25}

Set Operations and Laws
A simple way of representing sets and relations between sets is by means of
the Venn diagram. Venn diagram consists of a rectangle that represents the
universal set. Subjects of the universal set are represented by circles drawn
within the rectangle, or the universe.
Suppose that the universal set is designated by U and the sets A, B and C
are subject of U.The Venn diagram below can be used to illustrate the sets
as follows


   21
         U
                                        B

                     DATA COLLECTION AND PRESENTATION

Specific objectives
At the end of this topic the trainee should be able to:
     Discuss the basic consideration for data collection.
     Classify collected data into various categories.
     Tabulate collected data.
     Diagrammatically and graphically present data.

   Introduction

 a) Statistics
Statistics viewed as a subject is a process of collecting, tabulating and




                                                        om
analyzing numerical data upon which significant conclusions are drawn.
Statistics may also be defined as numerical data, which has been, collected




                                                    i.c
from a given source and for a particular purpose e.g. population statistics

                                                ng
from the ministry of planning, Agricultural statistics from the ministry of
Agriculture
                                             si
Statistics may also refer to the values, which have been obtained from
                                       om

statistical calculations e.g. the mean, mode, range e.t.c.
                                  om



 b) Application of statistics
1. Quality Control
                             as




Usually there is a quality control departments in every industry which is
                          .m




charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the products made do meet
the customers standards e.g. the Kenya bureau of standards (KeBS) is one of
                        w




the national institutions which on behalf of the government inspects the
                     w




various products to ensure that they do meet the customers specification.
                 w




The KeBS together with other control department have developed quality
control charts. They use these charts to check whether the products are up
to standards or not.

2. Statistics may be used in making or ordering economic order quantities
(EOQ).
 It is important for a business manager to realize that it is an economic cost
if one orders a large quantity of items which have to be stored for too long
before they are sold. This is because the large stock holds a lot of capital
which could otherwise be used in buying other items for sale.
It is also important to realize that the longer the items are stored in the
stores the more will be the storage costs
On the other hand if one orders a few items for sale he will incur relatively
low storage expenses but may not be able to satisfy all the clients. These

   29
may lose their customers if the goods are out of stock. Therefore it is
advisable to work out the EOQ which will be sufficient for the clients in a
certain period before delivery.
The EOQ will also ensure that minimal costs are incurred in terms of storage

3. Forecasting
Statistics is very important for business managers when predicting the
future of a business for example if a given business situation involves a
dependent and independent variables one can develop an equation which
can be used to predict the output under certain given conditions.

4. Human resource management
Statistics may be used in efficient use of human resources for example we
may give questionnaires to workers to find out where the management is
weak
By compiling the statistics of those who were signing it may be found useful




                                                        om
to analyze such data to establish the causes of resignation thus whether it
is due to frustration or by choice.

Introduction
                                       om

A statistical investigation involves a number of stages:
     Definition of the problem or issue;
                                  om



     Collection of relevant data;
     Classification and analysis of the collected data;
     Presentation of the results.
                             as




Even before the collection of data starts, then, there are some important
                         .m




points to consider when planning a statistical investigation.
                      w




Preliminary considerations.
                   w




It is important to be aware of these issues as they impact on the data which
                w




is to be collected and analyzed.
      Exact definition of the problem
        This is necessary in order to ensure that nothing important is omitted
        from the enquiry, and effort is not wasted by collecting irrelevant
        data. The problem as originally put to the statistician is often of a
        very general type and it needs to be specified precisely before work
        can begin.

    Definition of the units
     The results must appear in comparable units for any analysis to be
     valid. If the analysis is going to involve comparisons, then the data
     must all be in the same units. It is no use just asking for ‗output‘
     from several factories – some may give their answers in numbers of


   30
     items, some in weigh of items, some in number of inspected batches
     and so on.
    Scope of the enquiry.
     No investigation should be got under way without defining the field
     to be covered. Are we interested in all departments of our business,
     or only some? Are we to concern ourselves with our own business
     only, or with others of the same kind?

    Accuracy of the data
     To what degree of accuracy is data to be recorded? For example, are
     ages of individuals to be given to the nearest year or to the nearest
     month or as the number of completed years? If some of the data is to
     come from measurements, then the accuracy of the measuring
     instrument will determine the accuracy of the results. The degree of
     precision required in an estimate might affect the amount of data we
     need to collect. In general, the more precisely we wish to estimate a




                                                        om
     value, the more readings we need to take.

Data constitute the foundation of statistical analysis and interpretation.
Data can be obtained from three sources namely;
                                             si
    Primary source
                                       om

    Secondary source
    Internal records
                                  om



Primary data
                             as




Primary data are measurement, observed and recorded as part of an
originals study. There are two basic methods of obtaining primary data
                         .m




namely;
     Questionnaires
                      w




     Observation
                   w




     Interviews
                w




     Sampling
Primary data is data which is both original and has been obtained in order
to solve the specific problem in hand. Primary data is, therefore, raw data
and has to be classified and processed using appropriate statistical methods
in order to reach a solution to the problem.

Secondary sources
Secondary data can be obtained from journals, reports, and government
publications, publications of research organization, trade and professional
bodies.
Secondary data must be used with utmost care, before using secondary data
the investigator should examine the following;
   1. Whether the data are suitable for the purpose of investigation.
   2. whether the data are adequate for the purpose of investigation
   31
   3. Whether the data are reliable.
Secondary data is any data other than primary data. Thus, it includes any
data which has been subject to the processes of classification or tabulation
or which has resulted from the application of statistical methods to primary
data, and all published statistics.

Internal data
Internal data refers to the measurement that are the by products of routine
businesses records keeping like accounting , finance, production personnel,
quality control , sales , R&D.
Since internal data originate within the business collecting the desired
information does not usually offer much difficult. The particular procedure
depends largely upon the nature of the facts being collected and the form
in which they exist.

Data collection methods and limitations




                                                          om
The methods usually available are as follows:
    Questionnaires




                                                      i.c

       a. Questionnaire
                                   om



As the name suggest is distinguished by the fact that data are collected by
asking questions from people who are thought to have the desired
information.
                              as




A formal list of such questions is called a questionnaire
                          .m




Questionnaire refers to a device for securing answers to questions by using
a form which the respondent fills in it.
                          w




       b. Observation
                    w




The investigator observes the object or action in which he is interested.
                 w




Sometime individual makes the observation on other occasions mechanical
device observe and record the desired information.
Observation method does not automatically produce accurate data. Physical
difficulties n the observation situation on the part of the observer may
result in errors.

Classification of Data
Classification is grouping of related facts into different classes. Facts in one
class differ from another class with respect to some characteristics called a
basis of classification.
Sorting facts on one basis of classification and then another basis is called
cross-classification

Rules of Classification

   32
   1. the number of classes should preferably be between 5 and 15
   2. as far as possible one should avoid odd values of class intervals
   3. the starting point i.e. the lower limit of the first class should either
      be zero or 5 or multiple of 5
   4. to ensure continuity and to get correct interval we should adopt
      exclusive method of classification
   5. Whenever possible all classes should be of the same size.

Types of classification

    Geographical
    Chronological
    Qualitative
    Quantitative

Geographical classification; in geographical classification data are classified




                                                           om
on the basis of geographical or location difference between the various
items.




                                                       i.c
Chronological classification; when data are observed over a period of time,

                                                  ng
the type of classification is known as chronological classification.
                                               si
Qualitative classification; in qualitative classification data re classified on
                                         om

the basis of some attributes or quality such as sex, color of hair, literacy,
religion.

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS DATA COLLECTION LIMITATION OF STATISTICS.
 Despite the usefulness of statistics in many fields, impression should not be
                               as




carried that statistics are like magical devices which always provide the
                          .m




correct solution of problems . unless the data are properly collected and
critically interpreted there is every likelihood of drawing wrong
                       w




conclusion. Therefore it is necessary to know the limitation and the possible
                    w




misuse of statistics.
                 w




The following are the important limitation of the science of statistics:
    - Statistics does not deal with isolated measurement.
    - Statistics deals only with quantitative characteristic i.e quantitative
       characteristic such as honesty , efficiency , intelligence, blindness
       and deafness cannot be studied directly
    - Statistics result are true only an average.
    - Statistic is only a means not a end.
    - Statistics can be misused.


Classification functions.
Classification of data is a function very similar to text of sorting letters in a
post office. It is well known that the letter collected in a post office are
sorted into different geographical basis i.e in accordance with their

   33
destination as Nairobi , Mombasa , kampala etc .they are then put in
separate bags each containing letters with a common characteristic , or
having the same destination.
Classification of statistical data is comparable to the sorting operation, the
process of classification gives prominence to important information
gathered while dropping unnecessary details facilitates comparison and
enables a statistical treatment of the material collected.

Formation of frequency distribution.
Here we just count the number of times a particular value is repeated
which is called the frequency. In order to facilitate counting prepare a
column of ‗‘tally‘‘ in another column all possible values of variables from
the lowest to the highest. Then put a bar( vertical line ) opposite the
particular value to which it relates.
To facilitate counting blocks of five bars are prepared and some space is
left in between each block.




                                                         om
We finally count the number of blocks and bars corresponding to each value
to each value of the variable and place it in the column and frequency.

Classification according to class interval.
The following technical terms are important when data are classified
according to class intervals:
   (a) Class limit.these are the lowest and the highest values that can be
       included in the class e.g take the class 20-40.the lowest value of this
       class is 20 and the highest is 40.



   34
        The two boundaries of a class is the value below which there can be
        no value in that class, while the upper limit of a class is the value
        above which no value can belong to that class.
        The class 70- 89 .70 is the lower limit and 80 is the upper limit i.e in
        this class there can be no value which is less than 70 or more than
        89.

   (b) Classs interval .it is the span of a class i.e the difference between
       the upper limit and the lower limit is known as class interval , for
       example in the class 20-40 , the class interval is 20 (i.e 40 – 20) the
       size of the class interval is dertemined by the number of classes and
       the total range in the data.
   (c) Class frequency . this is the number of observation corresponding to
       the particular class.it is also known s the frequency of that class or
       the class frequency .if we add together the frequency of all
       individual classes , we obtain the total frequency.




                                                          om
   (d) Class mid – point.it is the value lying half way between the lower and
       the upper class limit of a class interval.




                                                      i.c
       Mid point of a class is ascertained as follows:

                                                  ng
                                               si
       Mid point of a class = upper limit of the class + lower limit of the
                                         om

       class
                                                           2
                                   om



       There are two methods of classifying the data according to class
       interval namely
   - Exclusive method.
                               as




   - Inclusive method.
                          .m




   (a) Exclusive method.
   When the class interval are so fixed that the upper limit of one class is
                       w




   the lower limit of the next class, it is known as the exclusive method of
                    w




   classification .this can be illustrated as follow.
                 w




   Class interval   No of items
   10-20            5
   20-30            3
   30-40            4
   40-50            6
   50-60            2
   60-70            1


It is clear that the exclusive method ensures continuity of data in as much
as the upper limit of one class is the lower limit of the next class.



   35
Whenever this method is used it is always assumed that the upper limit is
exclusive i.e the observation exactly equals to the upper limit is not
included in that class.


    (b) Inclusive method.
Under this method the upper limit of one class is included in that class
itself.this can be illustrated as below:

Class interval   frequency
1-10             2
11-20            5
21-30            4
31-40            10
41-50            15
51-60            30




                                                        om
61-70            12

                                            si
Whenever inclusive method is used for equal class interval is obtained by
                                       om

taking the difference between the two upper limit or lower limit.

DATA TABULATION.
   - a table is a systematic arrangements of statistical data in column and
                             as




      rows.
   - Rows are horizontal arrangements whereas columns are vertical
                         .m




      ones.
                      w




   - The purpose of a table is to simplify the presentation and to
      facilitate comparisons.

   - The simplication result from the clear cut and systematic
                 w




      arrangements which enables the reader to quickly locate desired
      information.

Parts of a table.
   - The various parts of a table may vary from case to case depending
       upon the given data, but a good table must contain atleast te
       following parts:
       (a) Table number
       (b) Title of the table
       (c) Caption
       (d) Stub
       (e) Body of the table
       (f) Headnote
       (g) Footnote
   36
   (a) table number. each table should be numbered.
   (b) Title of the table. every table must have a suitable title.
   (c) Caption.it refers to the column heading .it represent what the
       column represent.
   (d) Stub .are the designation of the rows or row heading .they are at
       the extreme left and perform the same function for the horizontal
       rows or numbers I the table as the Column heading do for the
       horizontal rows or numbers in the table as the column heading do for
       the vertical column or numbers.
   (e) Body of the table. It contains the numerical information .data
       presented in the body arranged according to description are
       classification of the captions and stubs.
   (f) Head note. It is a brief explanatory statement applying to all or a
       major part of the material in the table and is placed below the tittle




                                                       om
       entered and closed in brackets.
   (g) Footnote .they are placed directly below the body of the table.

                                 om



   - Proper proportion between width and height should be maintained.
   - The scale selected should be appropriate
   - If necessary footnotes should be given at the bottom of the diagram.
                             as




   - Diagram should be absolutely neat and clean
                        .m




   - An index illustration different types of lines or different shades ,
       column , should be give so that the reader can easily make out the
                     w




       meaning of the diagram.
                  w




   - Diagram should be as simple as possible.
                w




Types of diagrams.
   - One dimensional diagram e.g bar diagram.
   - Two dimensitional diagram e.g squares .
   - Picto grams and cartograms.

One dimensional diagrams.
   - Bar diagrams are the most common type of diagram used in practice
      , a bar is a thick line whose width is shown merely for attention.
   - They are called one dimensional because it is only the lengh of the
      bar that matters and not the width.



   37
Merits of bar diagrams.
   - They are readily understood even by those unaccustomed to reading
       charts or those who are not chart minded.
   - They posses the outstanding advantage that they are the simplest
       and the easiest to make.
   - When a large number of observation are to be compared they are the
       only form that can be used effectively..


Points to mind when constructing bar diagrams.
   - The width of the bars should be uniform throughout the diagram.
   - The gap between one bar and another should be uniform throughout.
   - Bars may either horizontal or vertical .the vertical bars should be
       preferred because they give a better look an also facilitate
       comparison.




                                                       om
   - While constructing the bar diagram it is desirable to write the
       respective figure at the end of each bar so that the reader can know




                                                   i.c
       the precise value without looking at the scale.

     (a) Simple bar charts.
It is used to represent only one variable i.e show s only totals.
                      w




However an important limitation of such diagrams is that they can prefer
                   w




only one classification or one category of data e.g for example while
                w




presenting the population for the last five decade , one can only depict the
total population in the simple bar diagram and not its sex- wise
distribution.

    (b) Component bar charts.
These diagrams are used to represent various parts of the total, while
constructing such charts, the various components in each bar should be
kept in the same order.
A common and helpful arrangement is that of presenting each bar in the
order of magnitude from the largest component at the base of the bar to
the smallest at the end.
To distinguish between the different component, it is useful to use
different shade or colours.
They usually show component totals and the totals.

   38
    (c) multiple bar charts
in multiple bar chart two or more set of interrelated data are represented
.the technigue of drawing such a diagram is the same as that of simple bar
charts.
The only difference is that since more than one phenomenon is represented
,different shades , colours .,dots or crossing are used to distinguish
between the bars. they normally show the component totals only.

    (d) Percentage component bar charts.
They are particularly useful in statistical work which require the portrayal
of relative changes in data.
When such diagrams are prepared , the length of the bars is kept equal to
100 and segment are cut in these bars to represent the component of an
aggregate.

   TWO DIMENSITIONAL DIAGRAMS.
    As distinguished from one dimensional diagram in which only the length
   of the bars is taken into account in two dimension diagram, the length
   as well as the width of the bars is considered.
   Thus the area of the bar represents the given data. Two dimensional
   diagrams are also known as surface diagrams example of this are-
   - Rectangles
   - Squares
   - Circles

Pie chart or diagram
This type of diagram enables as to show the partitioning of a total into
component parts.
In constructing a pie chart , the steps involved are:
    - Prepare the data so that the various components values are in
       percentage by applying

Tabulation of Data
                       w




One of the simplest and most revealing devices of summarizing data and
                     w




presenting them in meaningful fashion is the statistical tables.
                  w




Types of tabulation
Tabulation may be classified as:
   1. simple tabulation
   2. complex or matrix tabulation

Simple tabulation only one characteristic is shown hence this type of table
is also known as one –path table. This can be illustrated as follows:




   42
Table1: Distribution of workers by workshop

                   Workshop           Number Of Employees
                   A                  600
                   B                  360
                   C                  660
                   D                  840

                   Total              3,000
N/B: simple tabulation does not tell us very much – although it may be
enough for the question of the moment.

Complex tabulation has two or more characteristics are shown i.e. two or
more aspects of a problem are dealt with at the same time. It is some times
called two path tables. Such tables show two characteristics and are




                                                       om
formed when either the stub or the caption is divided into two coordinate
parts.

Charting data

One of the most convincing and appealing ways in which data may be
presented is through charts
A chart can take the shape of either a diagram or a graph.

Types of diagrams
    One dimensional diagram e.g. bar graphs
    Two dimensional diagram e.g. rectangles squares
    Pictograms and cartograms (circles)

One dimensional diagram
Bar diagrams is the most common type of diagram used in practice.

   43
Merits of bar diagrams
    They‘re readily understood
    They are simplest and easiest to make
    They are effective if the large number of observation is to be
       compared.
Example


Two dimensional diagrams
As distinguished from one dimensional diagrams in which only the length of
the bar is taken into account in two dimensional diagram the length as well
as the width of the bars is considered. Thus the area of the bar represents
the given data.

Pictograms

Also known as picture grams are very popularly used in presenting situation
data. They are no abstract presentation such as lines or bars




                                                   i.c
When pictograms are used data are represented through a pictorial symbol
that is carefully selected.

Merits of diagrams
    Pictograms have a greater attraction thus stimulate interest in the
      information being presented
    Facts portrayed in pictorial form are generally remembered longer.
Limitations
    They are difficult to construct

Graphs
A large variety of graphs are used in practice. Graphs can be divided under
the following headings
     Time series.
     Z- Charts.
     Scatter graphs
     Semi- logarithmic graphs
     Graphs of frequency distribution

                                                ng
is extremely helpful in analyzing change at different point of time.
Graphs of time series can be constructed either on a natural scale or on a

The following points should be kept in mind while smoothing a frequency
graph.
Only frequency distribution based on sample should be smoothed
Only continuous series should be smoothed
The total area under the curve should be equal to the area under the
original histogram or polygon.

                    MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY

Specific Objectives
At the end of this topic the trainee should be able to:
     Define the measures of central tendency;
     State the properties of the measure of central tendency;
     Determine the measures of central tendency.


Introduction
Measures of central tendency show the tendency of some central value
around which data tends to cluster. These are statistical values which tend
to occur at the centre of any well ordered set of data. Whenever these
measures occur they do not indicate the centre of that data




                                                        om

      designed to simplify complexity, it is described that an average be
      such that can be readily understood, its use is bound to be very
      limited.

    Should be simple to compute.
                         .m




    Should be based on all observation.
    Should be rigidly defined, i.e. an average should be properly defined

    Should have sampling stability.
    Should not be unduly affected by the presence of extreme values.


N/B. The following statistical terms are commonly used in statistical
calculations. They must therefore be clearly understood.



i) Class limits
These are numerical values which limits the extend of a given class i.e. all
the observations in a given class are expected to fall within the interval
which is bounded by the class limits e.g. 15 & 19 are class limits as in the
table of the example above.

   49
ii) Class boundaries
These are statistical boundaries, which separate one class from the other.
They are usually determined by adding the lower class limit to the next
upper class limit and dividing by 2 e.g. in the above table the class
                                                19 + 20
boundary between 19 and 20 is 19.5 which is =             .
                                                   2

iii) Class mid points
These are very important values which mark the center of a given class.
They are obtained by adding together the two limits of a given class and
dividing the result by 2.

iv) Class interval/width




                                                              om
This is the difference between an upper class boundary and lower class
boundary. The value usually measures the length of a given class.




                                                       i.c
The following are important measures of central tendency

Arithmetic Mean
                              as




The most popular and widely used measure for representing the entire data
                           .m




by one value is an average. Its value is contained by adding together all the
observation and dividing this total by the number of observation
                         w




These is commonly known as average or mean it is obtained by first of all
                    w




summing up the values given and by dividing the total value by the total no.
                 w




of observations.
                         X
        I.e. mean    =
                          n
        Where x = no. of values
              ∑ = summation
              n = no of observations
Example
The mean of 60, 80, 90, 120




   50
                60 + 80 + 90 +120
                          4


                    350
                =
                    4


                = 87.5

The arithmetic mean is very useful because it represents the values of most
observations in the population.
The mean therefore describes the population quite well in terms of the
magnitudes attained by most of the members of the population

Computation of the mean from grouped Data i.e. in classes.

Merits of arithmetic mean
                           .m




    It possess first six our seven characteristics of good average and no
                     w




       other average possess such large number of characteristics
    It is unduly affected by the presence of extreme value.
                  w




    It utilizes all the observations given.
                 w




    It is a very useful statistic in terms of applications. It has several
       applications in business management e.g. hypothesis testing, quality
       control e.t.c.
    It is the best representative of a given set of data if such data was
       obtained from a normal population.
    The a.m. can be determined accurately using mathematical
       formulas.


Limitation
    It is difficult to compute mean without making assumption regarding
      the size of the class- interval of the open end classer.


   52
       If the data is not drawn from a ‗normal‘ population, then the a.m.
        may give a wrong impression about the population.
       In some situations, the a.m. may give unrealistic values especially
        when dealing with discrete variables e.g. when working out the
        average no. of children in a no. of families. It may be found that the
        average is 4.4 which is unrealistic in human beings.

The Median
This is a statistical value which is normally located at the center of a given
set of data which has been organized in the order of magnitude or size e.g.
consider the set 14, 17, 9, 8, 20, 32, 18, 14.5, 13. When the data is ordered
it will be 8, 9, 13, 14, 14.5, 17, 18, 20, and 32. The middle number/median
is 14.5. The importance of the median lies in the fact that it divides the
data into 2 equal halves. The no. of observations below and above the
median is equal. In order to determine the value of the median from




                                                         om

Merits of median
    It is not influenced by the presence extreme values
    The sum of the deviation of observation from median is minimum
    It shows the centre of a given set of data
    Knowledge of the determination of the median may be extended to
       determine the quartiles
    The median can easily be defined
    It can be obtained easily from the cumulative frequency curve
    It can be used in determining the degrees of skewness

Limitation
    Its value is not determined by each and every observation.
    Median is not capable of algebraic treatment.
    Median is less reliable.
    It is affected by sampling fluctuation.




                                                      om
    In some situations where the no. of observations is even, the value of
      the median obtained is usually imaginary.




                                                  i.c
    The computation of the median using the formulas is not well

Q1 =size of N/4th observation = 100/4 =25th observation
Hence q1 lies in the class 40-50
Q1= L+ i/f (m-c)

   = 40 +10/18(25-12)
   = 40 + 7.22 = 47.22
   = 47.22


D4 = L+ i/f (m-c)
   = 50 +10/30 (40-30)
   = 50 + 3.33
   = 53.33

   56
Thus 40 percent of the companies earn an annual profit of kshs.53.33 or
less

P80 = size of 80/100 the observation = 80 the observation
P80 lies in the class 70-80
P80 = L+ i/f (m-c)
       = 70 + 10/10(80-75)
       = 70 +5
       = 75
This means that 80 percent of the companies earn an annual profit of
kshs.75 or less
20 percent of the companies earn an annual profit of more than kshs. 75

Mode
This is one of the measures of central tendency. The mode is defined as a




                                                         om
value within a frequency distribution which has the highest frequency.
Sometimes a single value may not exist as such in which case we may refer




                                                     i.c
to the class with the highest frequency. Such a class is known as a modal
class
                                                ng
The mode is a very important statistical value in business activities quite
                                              si
often business firms tend to stock specific items which are heavily on
                                        om

demand e.g. footwear, clothes, construction materials (beams, wires, iron
sheets e.t.c.
                                  om



The mode can easily be determined form ungrouped data by arranging the
figures given and determining the one with the highest frequency.
When determining the values of the mode from the grouped data we may
                              as

                         .m

Merits of mode
    Mode is not affected by extreme values.
    At can be easily used to decide qualitative phenomenon.
    Mode happens to be meaningful as an average.
    It can be determined from incomplete data provided the
       observations with the highest frequency are already known.
    The mode has several applications in business.
    The mode can be easily defined.
    It can be determined easily from a graph.


Limitation of mode
    Mode cannot always be computed
    If the data is quite large and ungrouped, determination of the mode




                                                                  om
      can be quite cumbersome

                 MEASUREMENT OF VARIATION /DISPERSION

Specific objectives
At the end of this topic, the trainee should be able to:-
     State the characteristics of a good measure of dispersion.
     Differentiate between the absolute and relative measures.
     Calculate and interpret the measures of dispersion.

Introduction
Measures of variation help us in studying the important characteristics of a
distribution. The measures of dispersion are very useful in statistical work
because they indicate whether the rest of the data are scattered around
the mean or away from the mean. If the data is approximately dispersed
around the mean then the measure of dispersion obtained will be small




                                                         om
therefore indicating that the mean is a good representative of the sample
data. But on the other hand, if the figures are not closely located to the




                                                     i.c
mean then the measures of dispersion obtained will be relatively big

                                                 ng
indicating that the mean does not represent the data sufficiently.

Methods of studying variation
The following Aretha important methods of studying variation

              The range
              The Mean deviation
              The interquartile range or quartile deviation
              The standard deviation
   63
               The Lorenz curve

         Absolute and relative measures of variation
  Measures of variation may be either absolute or relative. Absolute measures
  of variation are expressed in the same statistical unit in which the original
  data are given. Such shillings, kilograms, tones, etc
  These values may be used to compare the variation in two or more than two
  distributions provided the variables are expressed in the same units and
  have almost the same average value.
  In case the two sets of data are expressed in different units such as
  manager‘s salary versus workers salary, the absolute measures of variation
  are not comparable. In such cases measures of relative variation should be
  used.
  A measure of relative variation is the ratio of a measure of absolute
  variation to an average. It is sometimes called a coefficient of variation,
  because coefficient means a pure number that is independent of the unit of




                                                         om
  measurement.




                                                     i.c
a) The Range

                                                 ng
  The range is defined as the difference between the highest and the smallest
  values in a frequency distribution. This measure is not very efficient
                                              si
  because it utilizes only 2 values in a given frequency distribution. However
                                          om

  the smaller the value of the range, the less dispersed the observations are
  from the arithmetic mean and vice versa
                                   om



  The range is not commonly used in business management because 2 sets of
  data may yield the same range but end up having different interpretations
                               as




  regarding the degree of dispersion.
  Range is the simplest method of studying variation. It is defined as the
                          .m




  difference between the value of the smallest observation and the value of
                        w




  the largest observation
                     w
                  w




  Range = largest value- smallest value

  R= L-S

  Coefficient of Range = L-S
                           L+S
  Example
  The following are the prices of shares of a company from Monday to
   Saturday
  days                           Prices
  Monday                         200
  Tuesday                        210
  Wednesday                      208
  Thursday                       160
  Friday                         220
     64
Saturday                       250

Calculate the range and coefficient of range.
Solution
Range =L-S
L=250
S= 160
Range =250-160
       = 90
Coefficient of range = L-S =   250-160 = 90 = 0.219
                        L+S           250+ 160         410
 Merits of range
    It is the simplest to understand and easiest to compute
    It takes minimum time to calculate the value of range

Limitation




                                                        om
    Range is not based on each and every observation of the distribution
    It is subject to fluctuation of considerable magnitude from sample to




                                                    i.c
      sample

                                               ng
    Range cannot be computed in case of open –end distribution
    Range cannot tell us anything about the character of the distribution
                                            si
      within two extreme observations
                                       om

Uses of range
   1. Quality control; the objective of quality control is to keep a check on
                                 om



      the quality of the products without 100% inspection control charts
      are prepared.
                             as




   2. fluctuation in the shares price; range is useful in studying the
      variation in the prices in stocks and shares and other commodities
                         .m




   3. Weather forecast; the meteorological department does make use of
                      w




      the range in determining the difference between the minimum
      temperature and maximum temperature.

                w




(b) Mean Deviation
This is a useful measure of dispersion because it makes use of all the values
given. The average deviation is obtained by calculating the absolute
deviation of each observation from median (or mean) and then averaging
this deviation by taking their arithmetic mean. The formula for average
deviation may be written as;
A.D = ∑ /x – med/
             N
Incase deviation are taken from mean the formula shall be written as;
A.D x = ∑ /x - x/
              N
Computation of average deviation
The formula for computing average deviation is
A.D (med) = ∑ /x – med/
   65
                   N
If average deviation is small the distribution is highly compact or uniform
since more than half of the cases are concentrated within a small range
around the mean.
The relative measure corresponding to the average deviation called the
coefficient of average deviation is obtained by dividing average by the
measure of central tendency used, i.e. mean or median.

(b) The interquartile range or quartile deviation
                   w




This is a measure of dispersion which involves the use of quartile. A quartile
is a mark or a value which lies at the boundary of a division when any given
set of data is divided into four equal divisions
Each of such divisions normally carries 25% of all the observations
The semi interquartile range is a good measure of dispersion because it
shows how the rest of the data are generally spread around the mean
The quartiles normally used are three namely;
           i. The lower quartile (first quartile Q1) this usually binds the
                lower 25% of the data
           ii. The median (second quartile Q2)
           iii. The upper quartile (third quartile Q3)

Interquartile range = Q3-Q1


   67
Very often the interquartile range is reduced to the form of the semi-
interquartile range or quartile deviation by dividing it by 2
       Q.D = quartile deviation
       Q.D = Q3-Q1/2
Quartile deviation gives the average amount by which the quartile differs
from the median. Quartile deviation is an absolute measure of variation.
The relative measure corresponding to the measure called the coefficient
of quartile deviation.
       Coefficient of Q.D = Q3-Q1/Q3+Q1

The 10th – 90th percentile range
This is a measure of dispersion which uses percentile. A percentile is a
value which separates one division from the other when a given data is
divided into 100 equal divisions.
This measure of dispersion is very important when calculating the co-
efficient of skewness.

Example

Using the above data for retirees calculate the 10th - 90th percentile. The
tenth percentile 10th percentile lies on position

Merits of quartile deviation
                     w




  i)      In certain respect it is superior to range as a measure of variation
  ii)     It has a special utility in measuring variation in cases of open –
          ended distribution
  iii)    It has also useful in erratic or highly skewed distribution where
          the other measure of variation would be warped by extreme
          values. It is not affected by the presence of extreme values.



Limitation
   i)     Quartile deviation ignores 50% item as the value of quartile
          deviation does not depend upon every observation it cannot be
          regarded as a god method of measuring variation.
   ii)    It is not capable of mathematical manipulation

   71
   iii)   Its value sis very much affected by sampling fluctuation
   iv)    It is in fact not a measure of variation as it really does not show
          the scatter around an average but rather a distance on scale.

(d) Standard deviation
The standard deviation measures the absolute dispersion (or variability of
distribution, the greater amount of dispersion or variability). The greater
the standard deviation the greater will be the magnitude of the deviations
of the value from their mean.
A small standard deviation means a high degree of uniformity of the
observation as well as homogeneity of a series.
A large standard deviation means just the opposite.
Difference between deviation and standard deviation
Both these measure of dispersion are based on each and very item of the
distribution. But they differ in the following respects.
     Algebraic signs are ignores while calculating mean deviation whereas




                                                          om
         in the calculation of standard deviation signs are taken into account.
     Mean deviation can be computed either from median or mean. The




                                                      i.c
         standard deviation on the other hand is always computed from the

         arithmetic mean because the sum of the squares of the deviation of
         items from arithmetic mean is least.
                                              si
This is one of the most accurate measures of dispersion. It has the following
                                        om

advantages;
    i. It utilizes all the values given
                                  om



    ii. It makes use of both negative and positive values if they occur
    iii.     The standard deviation reflects an accurate impression of how
                                as




             much the sample data varies from the mean. This is because its
             suitability can also be tested using other statistical methods

In business statistical work we usually encounter a set of grouped data. In
order to determine the standard deviation from such data, we use any of




                                                        i.c

Relative measures of dispersion
                             as




Def: A relative measure of dispersion is a statistical value which may be
                         .m




used to compare variations in 2 or more samples.
                      w




The measures of dispersion are usually expressed as decimals or
                   w




percentages and usually they do not have any other units
                w




Example
The average distance covered by vehicles in a motor rally may be given as
2000 km with a standard deviation of 5 km.
In another competition set of vehicles covered 3000 km with a standard
deviation of 10 kms
NB: The 2 standard deviations given above are referred to as absolute
measures of dispersion. These are actual deviations of the measurements
from their respective mean
However, these are not very useful when comparing dispersions among
samples.
Therefore the following measures of dispersion are usually employed in
order to assess the degree of dispersion.

Conclusion
Since the coefficient of variation is greater in the 2 nd group, than in the
first group we may conclude that the distances covered in the 1 st group are
much closer to the mean that in the 2nd group.

Example 2
In a given farm located in the UK the average salary of the employees is £
3500 with a standard deviation of £150
The same firm has a local branch in Kenya in which the average salaries are
Kshs 8500 with a standard deviation of Kshs.800
Determine the coefficient of variation in the 2 firms and briefly comment
on the degree of dispersion of the salaries in the 2 firms.

Conclusively, since 4.29% < 9.4% then the salaries offered by the firm in UK

A sample of 40 electric batteries gives a mean life span of 600 hrs with a
standard deviation of 20 hours.
Another sample of 50 electric batteries gives a mean lifespan of 520 hours

If these two samples were combined and used in a given project
simultaneously, determine the combined new mean for the larger sample

SKEWNESS
   - This is a concept which is commonly used in statistical decision
     making. It refers to the degree in which a given frequency curve is
     deviating away from the normal distribution
     - There are 2 types of skew ness namely
        i.     Positive skew ness
        ii.    Negative skew ness


    80
    1. Positive Skewness
       - This is the tendency of a given frequency curve leaning towards
          the left. In a positively skewed distribution, the long tail
          extended to the right.

In this distribution one should note the following
    i.     The mean is usually bigger than the mode and median
    ii.    The median always occurs between the mode and mean
    iii.   There are more observations below the mean than above the
           mean
This frequency distribution as represented in the skewed distribution curve
is characteristic of the age distributions in the developing countries

    This is an asymmetrical curve in which the long tail extends to the left

age distribution in developed countries

       - The mode is usually bigger than the mean and median

       - The median usually occurs in between the mean and mode
                          w




       - The no. of observations above the mean are usually more than
           those below the mean (see the shaded region)

MEASURES OF SKEWNESS
     - These are numerical values which assist in evaluating the degree
       of deviation of a frequency distribution from the normal
       distribution.



           -   Following are the commonly used measures of skew ness.
               1. Coefficient Skewness
                                 mean - median 
                   = 3
                                Standard deviation
     81
          2. Coefficient of skewness
                    mean - mode
              =
                  Standard deviation
NB: These 2 coefficients above are also known as Pearsonian measures of
skewness.

          3. Quartile Coefficient of skewness
                  Q3+ Q1- 2Q2
              =
                    Q3+ Q1
               Where Q1 = 1st quartile
                     Q2 = 2nd quartile
                     Q3 = 3rd quartile
NB: The Pearsonian coefficients of skewness usually range between –ve 3
and +ve 3. These are extreme value i.e. +ve 3 and –ve 3 which therefore




                                                           om
indicate that a given frequency is negatively skewed and the amount of
skewness is quite high.




                                                         i.c
Similarly if the coefficient of skewness is +ve it can be concluded that the
amount of skew ness of deviation from the normal distribution is quite high
                                                    ng
and also the degree of frequency distribution is positively skewed.

The coefficient of skewness obtained suggests that the frequency
distribution of the loans given was positively skewed
This is because the coefficient itself is positive. But the skewness is not
very high implying the degree of deviation of the frequency distribution
from the normal distribution is small

Example 2
Using the above data calculate the quartile coefficient of skewness

KURTOSIS
      - This is a concept, which refers to the degree of peaked ness of a
         given frequency distribution. The degree is normally measured
         with reference to normal distribution.
      - The concept of kurtosis is very useful in decision making
         processes i.e. if is a frequency distribution happens to have either
         a higher peak or a lower peak, then it should not be used to make
         statistical inferences.
      - Generally there are 3 types of kurtosis namely;-
         i.       Leptokurtic
         ii.      Mesokurtic
         iii.     Platykurtic
Leptokurtic
      a)      A frequency distribution which is lepkurtic has generally a
              higher peak than that of the normal distribution. The
              coefficient of kurtosis when determined will be found to be




                                                                            om
              more than 3. thus frequency distributions with a value of more
              than 3 are definitely leptokurtic




                                                                      i.c
      b)      Some frequency distributions when plotted may produce a

                                                                ng
              curve similar to that of the normal distribution. Such
              frequency distributions are referred to as mesokurtic. The
                                                          si
              degree of kurtosis is usually equal to 3
                                                    om

      c)      When the frequency curve contacted produces a peak which is
              lower that that of a normal distribution when such a curve is
                                             om



              said to be platykurtic. The coefficient of such is usually less
              than 3
      - It is necessary to calculate the numerical measure of kurtosis.

         The commonly used measure of kurtosis is the percentile

         using the following equation

Introduction
When the relationship is of a quantitative nature, the appropriate
statistical tool for discovering and measuring the relationship and
expressing it in a brief formula is known as a correlation. This is an
important statistical concept which refers to interrelationship or
association between variables. The purpose of studying correlation is for
one to be able to establish a relationship, plan and control the inputs
(independent variables) and the output (dependent variables).




                                                     om
In business one may be interested to establish whether there exists a
relationship between the

    i.     Amount of fertilizer applied on a given farm and the resulting

    ii.

                                             ng
           Amount of experience one has and the corresponding
                                          si
           performance
                                     om

    iii.   Amount of money spent on advertisement and the expected
           incomes after sale of the goods/service
                                om



There are two methods that measure the degree of correlation between
two variables these are denoted by R and r.
                            as




   (a) Coefficient of correlation denoted by r, this provides a measure of
                        .m




       the strength of association between two variables one the dependent
       variable the other the independent variable r can range between +1

       and – 1 for perfect positive correlation and perfect negative
                  w




       correlation respectively with zero indicating no relation i.e. for
               w




       perfect positive correlation y increase linearly with x increment.
   (b) Rank correlation coefficient denoted by R is used to measure
       association between two sets of ranked or ordered data. R can also
       vary from +1, perfect positive rank correlation and -1 perfect
       negative rank correlation where O or any number near zero
       representing no correlation.




   88
Significance of the study of correlation
    Most of the variation shows some kind of relationship between price
       and supply income and expenditure. With the help of correlation
       analysis the degree of relationship existing between the variable can
       be measured.
    The value of one variable can be estimated once it has been known
       that they closely related. It can be done with the help of regression
       analysis.
    It contributes to the economic behavior, aids in locating the critically
       important variable on which other depend.
    Nature has been found to be multiplying of interrelated force.
    It helps in determining the degree of relationship between two or
       more variable.

increasing the other on an average is also increasing or if one variable is
decreasing the other on an average is also decreasing. Correlation is said to

be positive. On the other hand if they are varying in the opposite directions
i.e. as one variable is increasing the other is decreasing or vice versa,

Simple partial and multiple correlations
The distribution between simple, partial and multiple correlations are
based upon the number of variable studied.
When only two variables are studied it is a problem of simple correlation.
When three or more variables are studied it is a problem of either

Multiple or partial correlation.
In multiple correlations three or more variables are studied simultaneously.


   89
Linear and non linear correlation
The distinction between linear and non linear correlation is based upon the
constancy of the ratio of change between the variables. If the amount of
change in one variable tends to bear constant ratio to the amount of
change in the other variable then the correlation is said to be linear. If such
variable are plotted on a graph paper, all the plotted points would fall on a
straight line. Correlation would be non linear or curvilinear, If the amount
of change in one variable does not bear constant ratio to the amount of
change in the other variable.

Scatter diagram
The simplest device for studying correlation in two variables is a special
type of dot chart called dotogram or scatter diagram.
A scatter graph is a graph which comprises of points which have been
plotted but are not joined by line segments
The pattern of the points will definitely reveal the types of relationship

may easily be represented by a single line graph e.g. when measuring
relationship between volumes of sales and profits in a company, the more
the company sales the higher the profits.

h) Spurious Correlations
    in some rare situations when plotting the data for x and y we may have
    a group showing either positive correlation or –ve correlation but when
    you analyze the data for x and y in normal life there may be no
    convincing evidence that there is such a relationship. This implies
    therefore that the relationship only exists in theory and hence it is
    referred to as spurious or non sense e.g. when high pass rates of student
    show high relation with increased accidents.

Correlation coefficient
   These are numerical measures of the correlations existing between the
   dependent and the independent variables. These are better measures of
   correlation than scatter graphs (diagrams).The range for correlation
   coefficients lies between +ve 1 and –ve 1. A correlation coefficient of +1
   implies that there is perfect positive correlation. A value of –ve shows




                                                        om
   that there is perfect negative correlation. A value of 0 implies no
   correlation at all.

There are usually two types of correlation coefficients normally used
namely;-


Merits of scatter diagram
    It is simple and non mathematical method of studying correlation
       between the variables.


   93
     It is not influenced by the size of extreme values whereas most of
      the mathematical methods of findings correlation are influenced by
      extreme values.
Limitation
    Exact degree of correlation can not be established between the
      variable


Product Moment Coefficient (r)
It gives an indication of the strength of the linear relationship between two
variables.

The correlation coefficient thus indicates a strong negative linear
association between the two variables.

Interpretation of r – Problems in interpreting r values


NOTE:
 A high value of r (+0.9 or – 0.9) only shows a strong association between
  the two variables but doesn‘t imply that there is a causal relationship




                                                            om
  i.e. change in one variable causes change in the other it is possible to
  find two variables which produce a high calculated r yet they don‘t have




                                                           i.c
  a causal relationship. This is known as spurious or nonsense correlation
  e.g. high pass rates in QT in Kenya and increased inflation in Asian
  countries.                                          ng
                                                      si
 Also note that a low correlation coefficient doesn‘t imply lack of
  relation between variables but lack of linear relationship between the
                                             om

  variables i.e. there could exist a curvilinear relation.
 A further problem in interpretation arises from the fact that the r value
                                     om



  here measures the relationship between a single independent variable
  and dependent variable, where as a particular variable may be
                                   as




  dependent on several independent variables (e.g. crop yield may be
                           .m




  dependent on fertilizer used, soil exhaustion, soil acidity level, season
  of the year, type of seed etc.) in which case multiple correlation should
                       w




  be used instead.

The Rank Correlation Coefficient (R)
Also known as the spearman rank correlation coefficient, its purpose is to
establish whether there is any form of association between two variables
where the variables arranged in a ranked form.

Comment: The value obtained 0.89 suggests that the correlation between
annual income and annual expenditure is high and positive. This implies
that the more one earns the more one spends.

REGRESSION

BASIC CONCEPTS
This is a concept, which refers to the changes which occur in the dependent
variable as a result of changes occurring on the independent variable.
Knowledge of regression is particularly very useful in business statistics
where it is necessary to consider the corresponding changes on dependant
variables whenever independent variables change. It should be noted that
most business activities involve a dependent variable and either one or
more independent variable. Therefore knowledge of regression will enable
a business statistician to predict or estimate the expenditure value of a
dependant variable when given an independent variable e.g. consider the




                                                        om
above example for annual incomes and annual expenditures. Using the
regression techniques one can be able to determine the estimated




                                                    i.c
expenditure of a given family if the annual income is known and vice versa.

The general equation used in simple regression analysis is as follows

             y = a + bx
                w




Where y = Dependant variable
      a= Interception y axis (constant)
      b = Slope on the y axis
      x = Independent variable
      i.     The determination of the regression equation such as given
             above is normally done by using a technique known as ―the
             method of least squares‘.

The following sets of equations normally known as normal equation are
used to determine the equation of the above regression line when given a

NB: The above regression line is normally used in one way only i.e. it is

used to estimate the y values when the x values are given.

    - The fact that regression lines can only be used in one way leads to
                      w




       what is known as a regression paradox
                      w




    - This means that the regression lines are not ordinary mathematical
       line graphs which may be used to estimate the x and y
       simultaneously
    - Therefore one has to be careful when using regression lines as it
       becomes necessary to develop an equation for x and y before doing
       the estimation.
The following example will illustrate how regression lines are used

By substituting of the appropriate values in the above equations we have

      25607 = 44a + 254.96b …….. (ii)

by substituting for b in …….. (i)
                w




      4400 = 9a + 44(102.78)
      4400 – 4522.32 = 9a
       –122.32 = 9a
      -13.59 = a
Therefore the equation of the regression line of y on x is
      Y = 13.59 + 102.78x
When the acreage (hectares) is 4.5 then the cost
      (y) = -13.59 + (102.78 x 4.5)

We now insert these values in the linear model giving

or
Delivery time (mins) = 5.91 + 2.66 (delivery distance in miles)

The slope of the regression line is the estimated number of minutes per
mile needed for a delivery. The intercept is the estimated time to prepare
for the journey and to deliver the goods which is the time needed for each
journey other than the actual traveling time.

PREDICTION WITHIN THE RANGE OF SAMPLE DATA
We can use the linear regression model to predict the mean of dependant
variable for any given value of independent variable
For example if the sample model is given by
       Time (min) = 5.91 + 2.66 (distance in miles)
Then if the distance is 4.0 miles then our estimated mean time is
        Ý = 5.91 + 2.66 x 4.0 = 16.6 minutes

Multiple Linear Regression Models
There are situations in which there is more than one factor which influence
the dependent variable

factors;
     i.       Total numbers of hours worked    ng

     iv.      Number of hours spent on repair and maintenance
                                 om

multiple correlation coefficient r close to ±1 and the value of α which is

This show a strong correlation between power cost and output. The

multiple correlations when both output and time are considered at the
same time are 0.976.
                                     om



We observe that there has been very little increase in r which means that
inclusion of time variable does not improve the correlation significantly
                                 as




The value for time variable is only 0.60 which is insignificant as compared
with a t value of 2.64 for the output variable
                              .m




In fact, if we work out correlation between output and time, there will be a
                             w




high correlation. Hence there is no necessity of taking both the variables.
Inclusion of time does improve the correlation coefficient but by a very
                        w




small amount.

relationship between output and time i.e.

       Output = 9.6 + 3.11 × 7
             = 9.6 + 21.77
             = 31.37 units
Using the equation, Power costs = 2.29 + 0.34 × output
             = 2.29 + 0.34 × 31.37

Non Linear Relationships
If the scatter diagram and the correlation coefficient do not indicate linear
relationship, then the relationship may be non – linear

                  and
Both of these can be reduced to linear model. Simple or multiple linear
regression methods are then used to determine the values of the

   log y = log a + log bx

   log y = log a + xlog b
Let log y = Y and log a = A and log b = B
                              as




Thus we get Y = A + Bx. This is a linear regression model

                        ELEMENTS OF PROBABLITY

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
At the end of the topic the trainee should be able to:
     Discuss the basic concepts of probability;
     Apply the techniques of counting and set theory;
     Apply the laws of probability;
     Apply probability distribution concepts to decision problems.

Introduction
Probability is the ratio of the number of favorable cases to the total
number of equal likely cases. Probability is a very popular concept in
business management. This is because it covers the risks which may be
involved in certain business situations. It is a fact that when a business
investment is being arranged, the outcome is usually uncertain. Therefore




                                                                om
the concept of probability may be used to describe the degree of
uncertainty of a particular business outcome. Probability may therefore




                                                               i.c
be defied as the chances of a given event occurring. Numerically,

                                                       ng
probability values range between 0 and 1. a probability of 0 implies that
the event cannot occur at all. A probability of 1 implies that the event will
                                                    si
certainly occur.
                                             om

Therefore other events have their probabilities with values lying between 0
and 1
                                     om



   The formula used to determine probability is as follow
                             as




                                 r       Favourable outcomes
             Probability (x) =       
                                 n         Total outcomes
                         .m




Uses of Probability in Business
                      w




1. Business games of chance e.g. Raffles Lotteries e.t.c.
                   w




2. Insurance firms: this is usually done when a new client or property is
                w




   being insured. The company has to be certain about the chances of the
   insured risks occurring.
3. Business decision making regarding viability of projects thus the projects
   with a greater probability has greater chances.

There are mainly four schools of thought on probability
   i)    the classical to priors approach
   ii)   the relative frequency of empirical approach
   iii)  the axiomatic approach
   iv)   the personalistic approach


The classical approach
This school of thought assumes that all the possible outcomes of an
experiment are mutually exclusive and equally likely.
P (E) = number of outcomes favorable to the occurrence of event E       =     a
       Total number of outcome                                              a+
b

constructing a theory probability large tree from the inadequacies of both

the classical and empirical approaches.

Personality approach                              ng
                                                  si
According to the personality or subjective concept the probability of an
                                        om

event is the degree of confidence placed in the occurrence of an event by a
particular individual based on the evidence available to him.
                                   om



Relative frequency approach
The relative frequency theoreticians agree that the only valid procedure for
                              as




determining event probabilities is through repetitive experiments

      or more mutually exclusive events. In such circumstances the
      probability of the separate events must be added.

        Example
        What is the probability of throwing a 3 or a 6 with a throw of a die?


        Solution
        P (throwing a 3 or a 6) = 1  1  1
                                   6    6     3

(b)     Multiplicative rule
        This is used when there is a string of independent events for which
        individual probability is known and it is required to know the overall
        probability.
  112
        Example
        What is the probability of a 3 and a 6 with two throws of a die?

        Solution
        P (throwing a 3) and P (6)
              = P (3) and P (6) = 1  1  1

              2)     P(x) and P(y) ≠ P(x and y) note that these two are
                     different. The first implies P(x) happening and P(y),

It‘s used frequently in decision making where information is given the in
form of conditional probabilities and the reverse of these probabilities must
be found.

classified their holiday as good at Malindi. The probability of hot weather
in the resort is 0.6. If the probability of regarding holiday as good given hot

weather is 0.9, what is the probability that there was hot weather if a
holiday maker considers his holiday good?

Solution

P(A|B) =
                     
           PA   P B A
               P(B)

        Let H = hot weather
               G = Good
               P(G) = 0.75 P(H) = 0.6 and P(G|H) = 0.9 (Probability of regard
               holiday as good given hot weather)

Now the question requires us to get
      P(H|G) = Probability of (there was) hot weather given that the
      holiday has been rated as good).

POISSON PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
This is a set of probabilities which is obtained for discrete events which are
described as being rare. Occasions similar to binominal distribution but
have very low probabilities and large sample size.

Examples of such events in business are as follows:
   i.       Telephone congestion at midnight
   ii.      Traffic jams at certain roads at 9 o‘clock at night
   iii.     Sales boom
   iv.      Attaining an age of 100 years (Centureon)
Poisson probabilities are frequently applied in business situations in order
to determine the numerical probabilities of such events occurring.
The formula used to determine such probabilities is as follows

NORMAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
In a continuous distribution, the variable can take any value within a
specified range, e.g. 2.21 or 1.64 compared to the specific values taken by
a discrete variable e.g. 1 or 3. The probability is represented by the area
under the probability density curve between the given values.
The uniform distribution, the normal probability distribution and the
exponential distribution are examples of a continuous distribution
The normal distribution is a probability distribution which is used to
determine probabilities of continuous variables
Examples of continuous variables are
          o Distances
          o Times
          o Weights
          o Heights
          o Capacity e.t.c
Usually continuous variables are those, which can be measured by using the




                                                      om
appropriate units of measurement.
Following are the properties of the normal distribution:

               the maximum value of probability

           2. The line of symmetry divides the curve into two equal halves
           3. The two ends of the normal distribution curve continuously
              approach the horizontal axis but they never cross it
           4. The values of the mean, mode and median are all equal
NB: The above distribution curve is referred to as normal probability
distribution curve because if a frequency distribution curve is plotted from
measurements of a given sample drawn from a normal population then a
graph similar to the normal curve must be obtained.

deviation, ±1σ

                                 SAMPLING

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE
At the end of the topic the trainee should be able to:
     Discuss the reasons for sampling;
     Differentiate between sampling and census;
     Discuss the various types of sampling.

Introduction
Census method and sampling method can be used in sampling.
Sampling is the only tool which helps to know the characteristics of the
universe or population by examining only a small part of it.

Advantages of sampling method




                                                         om
   i)    It is cheaper to collect data as only a small part of the whole
         population is studied.




                                                   i.c
   ii)   The data are collected and analyzed more quickly. Thuds

   iii)
         sampling saves a lot of time.
                                               ng
         A good quality of labor with better supervision can be provided
                                            si
         since only a part of the whole population is to be studied.
                                       om

   iv)   An investigation of small part of the population gives us more
         detailed information.
                                 om



Disadvantages of sampling
          Non accurate
                             as




          Reliability is low.
                        .m




Size of the sample
                      w




An important decision that has to be taken while adopting a sampling
                   w




technique is about the size of the sample. However the following two
                w




considerations may be kept in mind in determining the appropriate size of
the sample;
          a) The size of the sample should increase as the variation in the
              individual item increases.
          b) The greater the degree of accuracy desired the larger should
              be the sample size.

Sampling and non- sampling errors
A sample being only a part of a population cannot represent the population
no matter how carefully the sample is selected. This gives rise to the
difference between the value of sample statistics and the true value of the
corresponding population parameters. Such difference is called sampling
error for that sample. These errors can be avoided through proper selection


  127
of questionnaires, following up the non-response, proper training of the
investigator, and correct manipulation of the collected information.

Sampling errors are of two types.
   I. Biased errors
  II. Unbiased errors

Biased errors
These errors arise from any bias in selecting estimation.

Unbiased errors
These errors arise due to chance difference between the member of
population included in the sample and those not included. Thus the total
sampling errors is made up of errors due to bias and the random sampling.

Causes of bias




                                                          om
   I. Faulty process of selection
  II. Faulty work during the collection of information




                                                      i.c
Faulty methods of analysis.
                                                 ng
Sampling bias means a systematic component of error which deprives
                                              si
statistical results of its representatives. Bias is introduced by the following
                                        om

methods of selection.
                                   om



   i)      Deliberate selection
Bias originates from deliberate selection which is biased on personal
judgment of what is representative.
                              as
                          .m




   ii)    substitution
   Sometime sit becomes difficult to make contact with certain member or
                        w




   information is not obtained from certain units then we substitute
                    w




   members or units that are conveniently available such substitution
                 w




   introduce bias.

   iii)    incomplete coverage
Bias also enters when we fail to cover the whole of he selected sample.

   iv)    haphazard selection
Haphazard human selection can also introduce bias as every human being
has a tendency away from randomness in his choice.

       v) Inadequate interviewing
Bias also enters when the interviewing is hasty, incomplete and misleading.

Sampling distribution


  128
A sampling distribution is defined as a probability distribution of the values
of a statistics such as mean, standard deviation, proportion computed from
all possible samples of the same size. Sampling distribution constitutes the
theoretical basis of statistical inference and are considerable important in
business decision making.




Methods of Sampling
a). Random or probability sampling methods
    They include:
    i.    Simple random sampling
    ii.   Stratified sampling
    iii.  Systematic sampling
    iv.   Multi stage sampling




                                                         om
b). Non random probability sampling methods




                                                     i.c
   These consist of:
   i.
   ii.
          Judgment sampling
          Quota sampling
                                                ng
                                             si
   iii.   Cluster sampling
                                        om
                                  om



Simple Random Sampling
This refers to the sampling technique in which each and every item of the
population is given an equal chance of being included in the sample. Since
                              as




selection of items in the sample depends entirely on chance, this method is
                          .m




also called chance selection or representative sampling.
It is assumed that if the sample is chosen at random and if the size of the
                       w




sample is sufficiently large, it will represent all groups in the population
                      w




Random sampling is of 2 types; sampling with replacement and sampling
                w




without replacement
Sampling is said to be with replacement when from a finite population a
sampling unit is drawn observed and then returned to the population before
another unit is drawn. The population in this case remains the same and a
sampling unit might be selected more than once
If on the other hand a sampling unit is chosen and not retuned to the
population after it has been observed the sampling is said to be without
replacement.
Random samples may be selected by the help of lottery method or table of
random numbers (such as tippet‘s table of random numbers, Fischer and
Yates numbers or Kendall and Babington Smith numbers.)

Stratified sampling


  129
In this case the population is divided into groups in such a way that units
within each group are as similar as possible in a process called
stratification. The groups are called strata. Simple random samples from
each of the strata are collected and combined into a simple. This technique
of collecting a sample from a population is called stratified sampling.
Stratification may be by age, occupation income group e.t.c.

Systematic Sampling
This sampling is a part of simple random sampling in ascending or
descending orders. In systematic sampling a sample is drawn according to
some predetermined object. Suppose a population consists of 1000
Units, then every tenth, 20th or 50th item are selected. This method is very
easy and economical. It also saves a lot of time

Multistage sampling
This is similar to stratified sampling except division is done on




                                                        om
geographical/location basis, e.g. a country can be divided into provinces
and then survey is done in 4 towns in each province. This helps to cut




                                                    i.c
traveling costs for a surveyor.

Cluster Sampling                               ng
                                             si
This is where a few geographical regions e.g. a location, town or village are
                                       om

selected at random and say every single household or shop in that area is
interviewed. This again cuts on costs.
                                 om



Judgment Sampling
Here the interviewer selects whom to interview believing that their view is
                             as




more fundamental since they might be directly affected e.g. to find out
                         .m




effects of public transport one may chose to interview only people who
don‘t own cars and travel frequently to work.

                   w




Merits of random or probability sampling
                w




    i)     Since the sample is objective and unbiased, it is defensive before
           the supervisor.
    ii)    The size of the sample does not depend upon the expediency or
           mere tradition but on demonstrable statistical method.
    iii)   Te degree of deviation from the parameter i.e. the statistical
           measure based on population can be estimated.
    iv)    It provides a more accurate method of drawing conclusion.
The sample may be combined and evaluated even though accomplished by
different individual.

Def: It is the procedure of using statistic to estimate a population

parameter. It is divided into point estimation (where an estimate of a
                w




population parameter is given by a single number) and interval estimation
(where an estimate of a population is given by a range in which the
parameter may be considered to lie) e.g. a bus meant to take a class of 100
students (population N) for trip has a limit to the maximum weight of 600kg
of which it can carry, the teacher realizes he has to find out the weight of
the class but without enough time to weigh everyone he picks 25 students
selected at random (sample n = 25). These students are weighed and their
average weight recorded as 64kg ( X - mean of a sample) with a standard
deviation (s), now using this the teacher intends to estimate the average
weight of the whole class (µ – population mean) by using the statistical
parameters standard deviation (s), and mean of the sample ( x ).

Characteristic of a good estimator
      (i)    Unbiased: where the expected value of the statistic is equal to
             the population parameter e.g. if the expected mean of a
             sample is equal to the population mean
      (ii)   Consistency: where an estimator yields values more closely
             approaching the population parameter as the sample increases
      (iii) Efficiency: where the estimator has smaller variance on
             repeated sampling.
      (iv) Sufficiency: where an estimator uses all the information
             available in the data concerning a parameter

Confidence Interval
The interval estimate or a ‗confidence interval‘ consists of a range (upper
confidences limit and lower confidence limit) within which we are




                                                      om
confident that a population parameter lays and we assign a probability that
this interval contains the true population value




                                                   i.c
The confidence limits are the outer limits to a confidence interval.

                                              ng
Confidence interval is the interval between the confidence limits. The
higher the confidence level the greater the confidence interval. For

(a)      Estimation of population mean
Here we assume that if we take a large sample from a population then the
mean of the population is very close to the mean of the sample
Steps to follow to estimate the population mean includes
    i.      Take a random sample of n items where (n>30)
    ii.     Compute sample mean ( X ) and standard deviation (S)
    iii.    Compute the standard error of the mean by using the following
            formula
                          s
                   Sx =
                           n
            Where S x = Standard error of mean
                  S = standard deviation of the sample
                  n = sample size
   iv.   Choose a confidence level e.g. 95% or 99%
  133
   v.      Estimate the population mean as under
           Population mean µ = χ ± (appropriate number) ×S x
           ‗Appropriate number‘ means confidence level e.g. at 95%
           confidence level is 1.96 this number is usually denoted by Z and is
           obtained from the normal tables.


Example
The quality department of a wire manufacturing company periodically
selects a sample of wire specimens in order to test for breaking strength.
Past experience has shown that the breaking strengths of a certain type of
wire are normally distributed with standard deviation of 200 kg. A random
sample of 64 specimens gave a mean of 6200 kgs. Find out the population
mean at 95% level of confidence

Population mean     = 6200 ± 1.96(25)

                    = 6151 to 6249

Finite Population Correction Factor (FPCF)
If a given population is relatively of small size and sample size is more than
                 w




5% of the population then the standard error should be adjusted by
multiplying it by the finite population correction factor
                                N n
        FPCF is given by    =

Where N = population size
     n = sample size

A manager wants an estimate of sales of salesmen in his company. A
random sample 100 out of 500 salesmen is selected and average sales are
found to be Shs. 75,000. If a sample standard deviation is Shs. 15000 then
find out the population mean at 99% level of confidence

(b) Estimation of difference between two means
We know that the standard error of a sample is given by the value of the
                                                as




standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the number of items in
                                         .m




the sample ( n ).
But, when given two samples, the standard errors is given by
                                   w




                                S A2 S B2
                                w




        S X
               AX B   =           
                        w




                                n A nB
Also note that we do estimate the interval not from the mean but from the
difference between the two sample means i.e. X A  X B  .
The appropriate number of confidence level does not change
Thus the confidence interval is given by;
       X A  X B  ± Confidence level SX  X           A   B
                  = X  X  ± Z S 
                                     A B
                            A      B            X   X

Example
Given two samples A and B of 100 and 400 items respectively, they have the
means X 1 = 7 ad X 2 = 10 and standard deviations of 2 and 3 respectively.
Construct confidence interval at 70% confidence level?



  135
Solution
Sample        A              B
       X1 = 7         X 2 = 10
       n1 = 100       n2 = 400
       S1 = 2         S2 = 3
The standard error of the samples A and B is given by
                                    4    9
              S X  X      =        

                                                        om
At 70% confidence level, then appropriate number is equal to 1.04 (as read
from the normal tables)



                                                    i.c
       X 1  X 2 = 7 – 10 = - 3 = 3
                                               ng
We take the absolute value of the difference between the means e.g. the
                                             si
value of X = absolute value of X i.e. a positive value of X.
                                          om

Confidence interval is therefore given by
       = 3± 1.04 (0.25 )      From the normal tables a z value of 1.04 gives a
                                   om



value of 0.7.

                         w




        Thus 2.974 ≤ X ≤ 3.26
                    w
                    w




Example 2
A comparison of the wearing out quality of two types of tyres was obtained
by road testing. Samples of 100 tyres were collected. The miles traveled
until wear out were recorded and the results given were as follows
Tyres        T1                   T2
Mean          X1 = 26400 miles X 2 = 25000 miles
Variance     S21= 1440000 miles S22= 1960000 miles
Find a confidence interval at the confidence level of 70%


Solution
X1 = 26400
X 2 = 25000

  136
Difference between the two means

                    =      184.4
Confidence level at 70% is read from the normal tables as 1.04 (Z = 1.04).
Thus the confidence interval is calculated as follows
      = 1400 ± (1.04) (184.4)
                                                     ng

        = 1400 ± 191.77
                                      om



        or (1400 – 191.77) to (1400 + 191.77)
                                 as




        1,208.23 ≤ X ≤ 1591.77

c) Estimation of population proportions
                             w




This type of estimation applies at the times when information cannot be
                         w




given as a mean or as a measure but only as a fraction or percentage
                         w




The sampling theory stipulates that if repeated large random samples are
taken from a population, the sample proportion ―p‘ will be normally
distributed with mean equal to the population proportion and standard
error equal to
                          Pq
                    Sp =      = Standard error for sampling of population
                           n
              proportions
Where n is the sample size and q = 1 – p.
The procedure for estimating a proportion is similar to that for estimating a
mean, we only have a different formula for calculating standard.

proportion at 95% confidence level.

        Sp = 0.016


Population proportion
      = P ± 1.96 Sp where 1.96 = Z.

Population proportion

d) Estimation of difference between population proportions
Let the two proportions be given by P1 and P2, respectively
Then the difference (absolute) between the two proportions is given by (P1
– P2)
The standard error is given by

           1 2      n1 n2               n1  n2


Then given the confidence level, the confidence interval between the two
population proportions is given by

2.      SMALL SAMPLES
(a)     Estimation of population mean
                              as




If the sample size is small (n<30) the arithmetic mean of small samples are
not normally distributed. In such circumstances, students‘
                          .m




t-distribution must be used to estimate the population mean.
                          w




In this case
                     w




Population mean µ = X ± tsx

X = Sample mean

                                          n 1
n = sample size
v = n – 1 degrees of freedom.

The value of t is obtained from students t-distribution tables for the
required confidence level

Example

  139
A random sample of 12 items is taken and is found to have a mean weight
of 50 grams and a standard deviation of 9 grams
What is the mean weight of population?
    a) with 95% confidence
    b) with 99% confidence

Solution
                                                       s    9
X  50; S = 9; v = n – 1 = 12 – 1 = 11;         Sx       
                                                        n   12
µ = x‘ ± tsx

At 95% confidence level
                      9 
      µ = 50 ± 2.262     
                      12 




                                                         om
        = 50 ± 5.72 grams




                                                       i.c
                                                ng
Therefore we can state with 95% confidence that the population mean is
                                             si
between 44.28 and 55.72 grams
                                          om

At 99% confidence level
                     9 
                                   om



      µ = 50 ± 3.25     
                     12 
                              as




        = 50 ± 8.07 grams
                            .m




Therefore we can state with 99% confidence that the population mean is
                      w




between 41.93 and 58.07 grams
                   w
                 w




Note: To use the t distribution tables it is important to find the degrees of
freedom (v = n – 1). In the example above v = 12 – 1 = 11
From the tables we find that at 95% confidence level against 11 and under
0.05, the value of t = 2.201

HYPOTHESIS TESTING

Definition
- A hypothesis is a claim or an opinion about an item or issue. Therefore it
has to be tested statistically in order to establish whether it is correct or
not correct
- Whenever testing a hypothesis, one must fully understand the 2 basic
hypotheses to be tested namely
    i.     The null hypothesis (H0)

  140
   ii.    The alternative hypothesis(H1)

The null hypothesis
This is the hypothesis being tested, the belief of a certain characteristic
e.g. Kenya Bureau of Standards (KBS) may walk to a sugar making company
with an intention of confirming that the 2kgs bags of sugar produced are
actually 2kgs and not less, they conduct hypothesis testing with the null
hypothesis being: H0 = each bag weighs 2kgs. The testing will set out to
confirm this or to refute it.

The alternative hypothesis
While formulating a null hypothesis we also consider the fact that the belief
might be found to be untrue hence we will reject it. We therefore
formulate an alternative hypothesis which is a contradiction to the null
hypothesis, thus when we reject the null hypothesis we accept the
alternative hypothesis.




                                                         om
In our example the alternative hypothesis would be
       H1 = each bag does not weigh 2kg




                                                     i.c
Acceptance and rejection regions
                                                 ng
All possible values which a test statistic may either assume consistency with
                                              si
the null hypothesis (acceptance region) or lead to the rejection of the null
                                        om

hypothesis (rejection region or critical region)
                                  om



The values which separate the rejection region from the acceptance region
are called critical values
                              as
                         .m




Type I and type II errors
While testing hypothesis (H0) and deciding to either accept or reject a null
                      w




hypothesis, there are four possible occurrences.
                   w




a) Acceptance of a true hypothesis (correct decision) – accepting the null
                w




   hypothesis and it happens to be the correct decision. Note that
   statistics does not give absolute information, thus its conclusion could
   be wrong only that the probability of it being right are high.
b) Rejection of a false hypothesis (correct decision).
c) Rejection of a true hypothesis – (incorrect decision) – this is called type I
   error, with probability = α.
d) Acceptance of a false hypothesis – (incorrect decision) – this is called
   type II error, with probability = β.

Levels of significance
A level of significance is a probability value which is used when conducting
tests of hypothesis. A level of significance is basically the probability of one
making an incorrect decision after the statistical testing has been done.
Usually such probability used are very small e.g. 1% or 5%

        Crititical value = -1.65

                          w
                     w




NB: If the standardized value of the mean is less than –1.65 we reject the
null hypothesis (H0) and accept the alternative Hypothesis (H1) but if the
standardized value of the mean is more than –1.65 we accept the null
hypothesis and reject the alternative hypothesis

The above sketch graph and level of significance are applicable when the
sample mean is < (i.e. less than the population mean)

TWO TAILED TESTS
A two tailed test is normally used in statistical work(tests of significance)
e.g. if a complaint lodged by the client is about a product not meeting
certain specifications i.e. the item will generate a complaint if its
measurements are below the lower tolerance limit or above the upper
tolerance limit

                                                       Region of acceptance

                                       om


NB: Alternative hypothesis is usually rejected if the standardized value of
                                  om



the sample mean lies beyond the tolerance limits (15cm and 17 ½ cm).
                              as




ONE TAILED TEST
This is a test where the alternative hypothesis (H1:) is only concerned with
                         .m




one of the tails of the distribution e.g. to test a business complaint if the
                      w




complaint is above the measurements of item being shorter than is
                   w




required.
E.g. a manufacturer of a given brand of bread may state that the average
                  w




weight of the bread is 500 gms but if a consumer takes a sample and weighs
each of the pieces of bread and happens to have a mean of 450 gms he will
definitely complain about the bread which is underweight. The statistical
analysis to be done will concentrate on the left tail of the normal
distribution in which one will have to establish whether 450 gms being less
than 500g is statistically significant. Such a test therefore is referred to as
one tailed test.

normal distribution when this happens the major complaint is likely to do
with oversize items bought. Therefore the test is known as one tailed as the
focus is on one end of the normal distribution.

HYPOTHESIS TESTING PROCEDURE
                         w




Whenever a business complaint comes up there is a recommended
procedure for conducting a statistical test. The purpose of such a test is to
                   w




establish whether the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis is to be
accepted.
The following are steps normally adopted
   1. Statement of the null and alternative hypothesis
   2. Statement of the level of significance to be used.
   3. Statement about the test statistic i.e. what is to be tested e.g. the
       sample mean, sample proportion, difference between sample means
       or sample proportions
   4. Type of test whether two tailed or one tailed.
   5. Statement on critical values using the appropriate level of
       significance
   6. Standardizing the test statistic
   7. Conclusion showing whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis

  145
STANDARD HYPOTHESIS TESTS
In principal, we can test the significance of any statistic related to any
probability distribution. However we will be interested in a few standard
cases. The sample statistics mean, proportion and variance, are related to
the normal, t, F, and chi squared distributions
Thus


   1. Normal test
   Test a sample mean ( X ) against a population mean (µ) (where samples
   size n > 30 and population variance σ2 is known) and sample proportion,
   P(where sample size np >5 and nq >5 since in this case the normal
   distribution can be used to approximate the binomial distribution




                                                       om
   2. t test




                                                   i.c
   Tests a sample mean ( X ) against a population mean and especially
                                               ng
   where the population variance is unknown and n < 30.
                                            si
   3. Variance ratio test or f test
                                       om

A certain NGO carried out a survey in a certain community in order to
                w




establish the average at which the girls are married. The results of the
survey indicated that the marriage age for the girls is 19 years
In order to establish the validity of the mean marital age, a sample of 50
women was interviewed and the average age indicated that they got
married at the age of 16 years. However the different ages at which they
were married differed with the standard deviation of 2.1years
The sample data indicates that the marital age is less 19 years. Is this
conclusion true or not?

Required
Conduct a statistical test to either support the above conclusion drawn
from the sample statistics i.e. the marriage age is less than 19 years, use a
level of significance of 5%

  146
Solution
   1. Null hypothesis
       H0: μ (mean marital age) = 19 years
       Alternative hypothesis      H1: μ (mean marital age) < 19 years
   2. The level of significance is 5%
   3. The test statistics is the sample mean age, X = 16 years
   4. The critical value of the one tailed test (one tailed because the
       alternative hypothesis is an inequality) at 5% level of significance is –
       1.65

                     n = sample size
                     z = standard value (as per computation)
        The standard value Z must fall within the acceptance region for us to
        accept the null hypothesis. Thus it must be > - 1.65 otherwise we
        accept the alternative hypothesis.
                     16  19
        Z     =         2.1

                         50


   6. Since –10.1 < -1.65, we reject the null hypothesis but accept the
      alternative hypothesis at 5% level of significance i.e. the marriage
      age in this community is significantly lower than 19 years

Example 2
A foreign company which manufactures electric bulbs has assured its
customers that the lifespan of the bulbs is 28 month with a standard
deviation of 4months
Recently the company embarked on a quality improvement research for
their product. After the research using new technology, a sample of 70
bulbs was tested and they gave a mean lifespan of 30.2 months
Does this justify the research undertaken? Use 1% level of significance to
conduct a statistical test in order to establish the truth about the above
question.
Testing procedure
   1. Null hypothesis H0: µ = 28
       Alternative hypothesis H1: µ > 28

                Sx                   70


   6. Since 4.6 > 2.33, we reject the null hypothesis but accept the
      alternative hypothesis at 1% level of significance i.e. the new sample
      mean life span is statistically significant higher than the population
      mean
      Therefore the research undertaken was worth while or justified

of items at one time and another batch at a later time at the end he may
have concluded that the two samples are different in certain specifications
e.g. mean weight mean lifespan, mean length e.t.c. further it may become
necessary to establish whether the observed differences are statistically
significant or not. If the differences are statistically significant then it
means that such differences must be explained i.e. there are known causes
but if they are not statistically significant then it means that the difference
observed have no known causes and are mainly due to chance
If the differences are established to be statistically significant then it
implies that the complaints, which necessitated that kind of test, are
justified

A member of parliament (MP) claims that in his constituency only 50% of the
total youth population lacks university education. A local media company
                                                 ng

of 400 youths, of these 54% lacked university education.

HYPOTHESIS TESTING OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROPORTIONS

Example
Ken industrial manufacturers have produced a perfume known as
―fianchetto.‖ In order to test its popularity in the market, the
manufacturer carried a random survey in Back rank city where 10,000
consumers were interviewed after which 7,200 showed preference. The
manufacturer also moved to area Rook town where he interviewed 12,000
consumers out of which 1,0000 showed preference for the product.

Example
In a random sample of 100 persons taken from village A, 60 are found to be
consuming tea. In another sample of 200 persons taken from a village B,
100 persons are found to be consuming tea. Do the data reveal significant
difference between the two villages so far as the habit of taking tea is
concerned?

Solution
Let us take the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between
the two villages as far as the habit of taking tea is concerned i.e. π1 = π2
We are given
       P1 = 0.6;     n1 = 100
       P2 = 0.5;     n2 = 200

Appropriate statistic to be used here is given by

Since the computed value of Z is less than the critical value of Z = 1.96 at
5% level of significance therefore we accept the hypothesis and conclude
that there is no significant difference in the habit of taking tea in the two
villages A and B

t distribution (student’s t distribution) tests of hypothesis (test for small
samples n < 30)
For small samples n < 30, the method used in hypothesis testing is exactly
similar to the one for large samples except that t values are used from t
distribution at a given degree of freedom v, instead of z score, the standard
error Se statistic used is also different.
Note that v = n – 1 for a single sample and n1 + n2 – 2 where two sample are
involved.
  157
   a) Test of hypothesis about the population mean
When the population standard deviation (S) is known then the t statistic is
defined as
                           X                  S
        t     =                      where S X 
                            SX                   n
Follows the students t distribution with (n-1) d.f. where
        X = Sample mean
       μ = Hypothesis population mean
       n = sample size
and S is the standard deviation of the sample calculated by the formula

              X  X 
                            2

        S=                  for n < 30
                 n 1
If the calculated value of t exceeds the table value of t at a specified level




                                                        om
of significance, the null hypothesis is rejected.

Example

                                                   ng
Ten oil tins are taken at random from an automatic filling machine. The
mean weight of the tins is 15.8 kg and the standard deviation is 0.5kg. Does
                                               si
the sample mean differ significantly from the intended weight of 16kgs?

Use 5% level of significance.
                                     om



Solution
Given that n = 10; x = 15.8; S = 0.50; μ = 16; v = 9
                                  as

              =
                 0.16
              = -1.25
The table value for t for 9 d.f. at 5% level of significance is 2.26. the
computed value of t is smaller than the table value of t. therefore,
difference is insignificant and the null hypothesis is accepted.


   b) Test of hypothesis about the difference between two means
The t test can be used under two assumptions when testing hypothesis
concerning the difference between the two means; that the two are
normally distributed (or near normally distributed) populations and that the
  158
standard deviation of the two is the same or at any rate not significantly
different.

Appropriate test statistic to be used is
                     X1  X 2
      t      =                     at (n1 + n2 – 2) d.f.
                     S X X 2
                        1 

The standard deviation is obtained by pooling the two sample standard
deviation as shown below.


                  Sp =
                             n1  1 S12   n2  1 S22

Thus we accept the null hypothesis.

Hence there is no significant difference in the efficacy of the two drugs in
the matter of increasing weight

Two salesmen A and B are working in a certain district. From a survey
conducted by the head office, the following results were obtained. State
whether there is any significant difference in the average sales between
the two salesmen at 5% level of significance.

The table value of t at 5% level of significance for 36 d.f. when d.f. >30,
that t distribution is the same as normal distribution is 1.9. Since the value
computed value of t is more than the table value, we reject the null
hypothesis. Thus, we conclude that there is significant difference in the
average sales between the two salesmen



Testing the hypothesis equality of two variances
The test for equality of two population variances is based on the variances
in two independently selected random samples drawn from two normal
populations

Under the null hypothesis σ12  σ 22
               s12
               σ 12
        F=                   Now under the H0 : σ12  σ 22 it follows that

               σ 22
              S12
        F=        which is the test statistic.
              S22
Which follows F – distribution with V1 and V2 degrees of freedom. The larger
sample variance is placed in the numerator and the smaller one in the
denominator
If the computed value of F exceeds the table value of F, we reject the null
hypothesis i.e. the alternate hypothesis is accepted

the calculated value of F is less than the table value, we accept the
hypothesis. The samples may have been drawn from the two populations

Mr. Nguku carried out a survey of 320 families in Ateka district, each family
had 5 children and they revealed the following distribution
No. of boys       5       4        3      2        1        0
No. of girls      0       1        2      3        4        5
No. of families   14      56       110    88       40       12

Is the result consistent with the hypothesis that male and female births are
equally probable at 5% level of significance?

Solution
If the distribution of gender is equally probable then the distribution
conforms to a binomial distribution with probability P(X) = ½.
Therefore


  163
       H0 = the observed number of boys conforms to a binomial distribution
with P = ½
       H1 = the observations do not conform to a binomial distribution.
On the assumption that male and female births are equally probable the
probability of a male birth is P = ½. The expected number of families can
be calculated by the use of binomial distribution. The probability of male
births in a family of 5 is given by
P(x) = 5cX Px q5-x (for x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,)

      = 5cX (½)5    (Since P = q = ½)
To get the expected frequencies, multiply P(x) by the total number N =
320. The calculations are shown below in the tables

The table of χ2 for V = 6 – 1 = 5 at 5% level of significance is 11.07. The
computed value of χ2 = 7.16 is less than the table value. Therefore the
hypothesis is accepted. Thus it can be concluded that male and female
births are equally probable.

ii)    Test of independence of attributes
This test disclosed whether there is any association or relationship between
two or more attributes or not. The following steps are required to perform
the test of hypothesis.
           1. The null and alternative hypothesis are set as follows
              H0: No association exists between the attributes
              H1: an association exists between the attributes
           2. Under H0 an expected frequency E corresponding to each cell
              in the contingency table is found by using the formula
                   RC
              E=




                                                         om
                    n
              Where R = a row total, C = a column total and n = sample size
           3. Based upon the observed values and corresponding expected

              frequencies the χ2 statistic is obtained using the formula

              χ = 

                                 2

                                          om

           4. The characteristic of this distribution are defined by the
              number of degrees of freedom (d.f.) which is given by
                      d.f. = (r-1) (c-1),
                                      om



              Where r is the number of rows and c is number of columns
              corresponding to a chosen level of significance, the critical
                                     as




              value is found from the chi squared table
                          .m




           5. The calculated value of χ2 is compared with the tabulated
              value χ2 for (r-1) (c-1) degrees of freedom at a certain level of
                       w




              significance. If the computed value of χ2 is greater than the
                    w




              tabulated value, the null hypothesis of independence is
                   w




              rejected. Otherwise we accept it.


Example
In a sample of 200 people where a particular devise was selected, 100 were
given a drug and the others were not given any drug. The results are as
follows
                   Drug                No drug              Total
Cured              65                  55                   120

Total              100                 100                  200
Test whether the drug will be effective or not, at 5% level of significance.

Solution

  165
Let us take the null hypothesis that the drug is not effective in curing the
disease.
Applying the χ2 test
The expected cell frequencies are computed as follows

Arranging the observed frequencies with their corresponding frequencies in

The calculated value of χ2 is less than the table value. The hypothesis is
accepted. Hence the drug is not effective in curing the disease.

Test of homogeneity
It is concerned with the proposition that several populations are
homogenous with respect to some characteristic of interest e.g. one may be
interested in knowing if raw material available from several retailers are
homogenous. A random sample is drawn from each of the population and
the number in each of sample falling into each category is determined. The
sample data is displayed in a contingency table
The analytical procedure is the same as that discussed for the test of
independence

hypothesis and conclude that the populations are not homogenous with
respect to the type of TV programs preferred, thus the different age groups
vary in choice of TV programs.

Specific Objectives
At the end of the this topic the trainee should be able to:
     Describe the components of time series;
     Describe the time series models;
     Evaluate trend and seasonal variation in the series;
     Explain the concept of deseasonalization;
     Apply time series analysis to business problems

INTRODUCTION

Businesses and governments use statistical analysis of information collected
at regular intervals over extensive periods of time to plan future policies.




                                                          om
For example, sales values or unemployment levels recorded at yearly,
quarterly or monthly intervals are examined in an attempt to predict their




                                                     i.c
future behavior. Such sets of values observed at regular intervals over a

                                                 ng
period of time are called time series. The analysis of this data is a complex
problem as many variable factors may influence the
                                              si
changes. The first step is to plot the observations on a scattergraph, which
                                        om

differs from those scattergraphs we have considered previously as the
points are evenly spaced on the time axis in the order in which they are
                                  om



observed, and the time variable is always the independent Variable. This
scattergraph gives us a good visual guide to the actual changes, but is of
very little help in showing the component factors causing these changes or
                              as




in predicting future movements of the dependent variable.
                         .m




Statisticians have constructed a number of mathematical models to
describe the behavior of time series, and several of these will be discussed
                      w




in this study unit.

 COMPONENTS OF A TIME SERIES
These mathematical models assume that the changes are caused by the
variation of four main factors; they differ in the relationship between these
factors. It will be easier to understand the theory in detail if we relate it to
a simple time series so that we can see the calculations necessary at each
stage. Consider a factory employing a number of people in producing a
particular commodity, say thermometers. Naturally, at such a factory
during the course of a year some employees will be absent for various
reasons. The following table shows the number of days lost through sickness
over a five-year period. Each year has been broken down into four quarters
of three months. We have assumed that the number of employees at the
factory remained constant over the five years.

We will begin by plotting a time-series graph for the data, as shown in
Figure 9.1.
                             as
                         .m




Note the following characteristics of a time-series graph:
    It is usual to join the points by straight lines. The only function of
                      w




      these lines is to help your eyes to see the pattern formed by the
                   w




      points.
                w




    Intermediate values of the variables cannot be read from the graph.
    Every time-series graph will look similar to this, but a careful study
      of the change of
    Pattern over time will suggest which model should be used for
      analysis.

There are four factors that influence the changes in a time series – trend,
seasonal variations, cyclical fluctuations, and irregular or random
fluctuations. Now we will consider each in turn.

Trend
This is the change in general level over the whole time period and is often
referred to as the secular trend. You can see in Figure 9.1 that the trend is
definitely upwards, in spite of the obvious fluctuations from one quarter to

  174
the next. A trend can thus be defined as a clear tendency for the time
series data to travel in a particular direction in spite of other large and
small fluctuations.


Seasonal Variations
These are variations which are repeated over relatively short periods of
time. Those most frequently observed are associated with the seasons of
the year, e.g. ice cream sales tend to rise during the summer months and
fall during the winter months. You can see in our example of employees'
sickness that more people are sick during the winter than in the summer. If
you can establish the variation throughout the year then this seasonal
variation is likely to be similar from one year to the next, so that it would
be possible to allow for it when estimating values of the variable in other
parts of the time series. The usefulness of being able to calculate seasonal
variation is obvious as, for example, it allows ice cream manufacturers to




                                                          om
alter their production schedules to meet these seasonal changes.

As this type of fluctuation is difficult to determine, it is often considered

with the final (fourth) element, and the two together are called the
residual variation.

Summary
To sum up, a time series (Y) can be considered as a combination of the
following four factors:
     Trend (T)
     Seasonal variation (S)
     Cyclical fluctuation (C)
     Irregular fluctuations (I).


Time series models:


  175
Additive Model
Time series value = T +S +C +R
           Where S, C and R are expressed in absolute value.
This model is best suited where the component factors are independent
e.g. where the seasonal variation is unaffected by trend.

Multiplicative Model:
Time series value = T × S× C × R
            Where S, C and are expressed as percentage or proportions.

This model is best applied where characteristics interact e.g. where high
trends increase seasonal variations. Multiplicative model is more commonly
used in practice.
Of the four elements of time series the most important are trend and
seasonal variation. The following illustration shows how the trend (T) and
seasonal variation (S) are separated out from a time series and how the




                                                       om
calculated T and S values are used to prepare forecast. The process of
separating out the trend and seasonal variation is known as deseasonalising




                                                   i.c
the data.

                                              ng
There are two approaches to this process: one is based on regression
through the actual data points and the other calculates the regression line
                                           si
through moving average trend points. The method using the actual data is

SPECIIFIC OBJECTIVES
At the end of this topic the trainee should be able to:
     Define index numbers;
     Differentiate between the types of index numbers
     Explain the uses of index numbers
     List the limitations of index numbers.

INTRODUCTION
An index number is a device which shows by its variation the changes in a
magnitude which is not capable of accurate measurement in itself or of
direct valuation in practice. An index number may be described as a
specialized average designed to measure the level of a phenomenon with




                                                         om
respect to time geographic location or other characteristics such as income.
Uses of index numbers




                                                     i.c
     They help in framing suitable policies
     They reveal trends and tendencies
     Index numbers are very useful in deflatingng

Index numbers may be classified in terms of what they measure. In
economics and business the classification is;
                                  om



     Price
     Quantity
                              as




     Value
     Special purpose

Problems in the constructing of index numbers
                      w




Before constructing index numbers a careful thought must be given to the
following problems.
                   w




    i)     The purpose of the index; as the very outset the purpose of
                w




           constructing the must be very clearly decided.
    ii)    Availability and comparability of data; it is needles to say that it
           is impossible to make appropriate comparison unless the
           necessary statistical data can be obtained
    iii)   Selection of base period; whenever index number are constructs,
           a reference is made to some base period ,safe period should be
           normal , it should not be too distant.
    iv)    Selection of number of items; every item cannot be included
           while constructing an index number and hence one has to select a
           sample.
    v)     Price quotation; after the commodities have been selected the
           next problem is to obtain price quotation for these commodities
           pricing vary from place to place and even from shop to shop.

  177
   vi)     Choice of an average; since index numbers are specific average a
           decision has to be made as to which particular average (i.e.
           arithmetic mean, median , mode , geometric mean)
   vii)    Selection of appropriate weight; the problem of selecting suitable
           weights are quite important and at the same time quite difficult
           to decide.
   viii)   Selection of appropriate formula; a large number of formula have
           been devised for often constructing the index numbers. The
           problem very often is that in selecting the most appropriate
           formula.

An index number is an attempt to summarize a whole mass of data into one
figure. The single figure shows how one year differs from another year. It is
a statistical devise used to measure the change in the level of prices, wages
output and other variables at given times, relative to their level at an
earlier time which is taken as the base for comparison purposes

which the price index to be calculated)

Methods of constructing index numbers
   a) unweighed indices
   b) weighed indices

In the unweighted indices weight are not expressively assigned whereas in
the weighed indices weights are assigned to the various items. Each of
these types may further be divided under two heads.
    i)    simple aggregate
    ii)   simple average of price relations

Unweighted index numbers
   i)      simple aggregate method
This is the simplest method of constructing index numbers. When this
method is used to construct a price index number, the total of current year

  178
prices for the various commodities is divided by total of base year and
quotient is multiplied by 100.
        P01 = ∑p1 x 100
               ∑p0
Where ∑p1 = total current price for various commodities
        ∑p0 = total of base year price for various commodities
Limitation of the method
             The units in which prices of commodities are given affect the
               price index.
             No consideration is given to the relative importance of the
               commodities.
    ii)     simple average of relative method
When this method is used to construct a price index, price relative are
obtained for the various items include intercontinental he index and then
an average of these relative
        P01 = ∑p1 x 100 /N




                                                       om

     Extreme items do not influence the index
                                               ng
     The index is not influenced by the units in which prices are quoted.

   ii)    Paasche Method
   iii)   Fishers Ideal Method
   iv)    Marshall – Edgeworth

Laspeyres method
In this method the base year‘s quantities are taken as weights. The formula
for constructing index is
P01 =       ∑ p1q0 x 100
                ∑ p0q0

Paasche method
  179
In this method the current year quantities are taken as the formula for
constructing index is
 P01 = ∑ p1q1 x 100
         ∑ p0q1




Fischer‘s ideal method
Prof Fischer has given a number of formulas for constructing index numbers

P01 =    √    ∑ p1q0      x   ∑ p1q1 x 100
              ∑ p0q0            ∑ p0q1               or

INDEX NUMBERS APPLICATION

The index of industrial production
It is a quantity index compiled by the government. It measures changes in
the volume of production in major industries. The index is a good indication
of the state of national economy.
It covers the following major industries in the UK
    i.     Mining and quarrying
    ii.    Manufacturing such as food, drinks and tobacco, chemicals, metal
           manufacture, engineering e.t.c
    iii.   Textile
    iv.    Construction
    v.     Gas electricity, water e.t.c


  180
It excludes agriculture, fishing, trade, transport, finance and other such
industries.
Each industries order is given a weighting. The weighting is based on
average monthly production in each industry in a fixed base year. It gives
each item its relative importance amongst all other items and thus gives a
better estimate of the index for comparison purposes.

The Geometric Index (Industrial Share index)
This index is an index of 30 selected top industrial companies. It is
calculated by taking an unweighted geometric mean of the price relatives
of the selected shares.

Example
The share prices of ordinary shares of four companies on 1 st January 1990
and 1st January 1991 were as follows.




                                                                      om

           Company B
           Company C

Tests for an Ideal Index Number
  181
1. Factor Reversal Test
This test indicates that when the price index is multiplied with a quantity
index i.e. factors are reversed), it should result in the value index.

2. The time reversal test
If we reverse the time subscripts of a price or quantity index, the result
should be reciprocal of the original index.

INTRODUCTION
A matrix is a rectangular array of items or numbers. These items or
numbers are arranged in rows and columns to represent some information.
The position of an element in one matrix is very important as well be seen
later; therefore an element is located by the number of the row and




                                                                    om
column which it occupies. The size of a matrix is defined by the number of
its rows (m) and column (n).

Types of matrices
Equal Matrices
Two matrices A and B are said to be equal, that is

         A=B            or  a ij  =  bij 

If and only if they are identical if they both have the same number of rows
and columns and the elements in the corresponding locations in the two
matrices should be the same, that is, aij = bij for all i. And j.

OPERATION ON MATRICES
  188
Matrix addition and subtraction
We can add any number of matrices (or subtract one matrix from another)
if they have the same sizes. Addition is carried out by adding together
corresponding elements in the matrices. Similarly subtraction is carried out
by subtracting the corresponding elements of two matrices as shown in the
following example

                                                            om
commodity P, Q, R respectively and let column vector B represent the
number of units of commodities P, Q, R sold respectively. Then the vector

Rules of multiplication
   i.      The row vector must have the same number of elements as the
           column vector
   ii.     The first vector is a row vector and the second is a column vector
   iii.    The corresponding elements in each vector are multiplied
           together and the results obtained are added. This addition is
           always a single number
           Going back to the example given before
                           100 

 b) Multiplication of two matrices
Rules
   i.    Multiplication is only possible if the first matrix has the same
         number of columns as the second matrix has rows. That is if A is
         the order a×b, then B has to be of the order b×c. If the A×B = D,
         then D must be of the order a×c.
  ii.    The general method of multiplication is that the elements in row
         m of the first matrix are multiplied by the corresponding
         elements in columns n of the second matrix and the products
         obtained are then added giving a single number.
We can express this rule as follows

                  a11 a12                   b       b12    b13 

The determinant of a square matrix
The determinant of a square matrix det (A) or A is a number associated to
that matrix. If the determinant of a matrix is equal to zero, the matrix is
called singular matrix otherwise it is called non-singular matrix. The
determinant of a non square matrix is not defined.

Simplify 3 x 3 determinants as in ii and then evaluate the 4 x 4
determinants.

Inverse of a matrix
If for an n ( n square matrix A, there is another n ( n square matrix B such
that there product is the identity of the order n X n, In, that is A X B = B X A
= I, then B is said to be inverse of A. Inverse if generally written as A-1
        Hence AA-1 = I

Note: Only non singular matrices have an inverse and therefore the inverse
of a singular matrix is non defined.

General method for finding inverse of a matrix


  193
In order to introduce the rule to calculate the determinant as well as the
inverse of a matrix, we should introduce the concept of minor and cofactor.

The minor of an element
Given a matrix A = (aij), the minor of an element aij in row i and column j
(call it mij), is the value of the determinant formed by deleting row i and
column j in matrix A.

Example

The cofactor of an element
The cofactor of any element aij (known as cij) is the signed minor associated
with that element.
The sign is not changed if (i+j) is even and it is changed if (i+j)is odd. Thus
the sign alternated whether vertically or horizontally, beginning with a plus
in the upper left hand corner.

either of the following 2 methods

      d) Multiply the original by the inverse on both sides of the matrix

SIMPLE INPUT – OUTPUT ANALYSIS
The input output analysis is a topic which requires application of matrices
The technique analyses the flow of inputs from one sector of the economy
to the other sectors thus the technique is quite useful in studying the
interdependence of sectors within a single economy.
The input – output analysis was first developed by Prof Leontief hence the
Leontief matrix has been developed. See the following example

NB: In the above table, one should be able to interpret the table e.g. of the
total demand of 2060 metric tones from the agricultural sector; 300 is
produced for the agricultural sector, 360 for industrial sector, 320 for the

Technical Coefficients
These show the units required from each sector to make up one complete
product in a given sector e.g. in the above matrix of coefficients it may be
said that one complete product from the agricultural sector requires 0.14
units from the agricultural sector itself, 0.22 from the industrial sector and
0.30 from the service sector
NB: The primary inputs are sometimes known as ―value added‖

Three clients of Disrupt, Ltd P, Q and Rare direct competitors in the retail
business. In the first week of the year P had 300 customers Q had 250
customers and R had 200 customers. During the second week, 60 of the
original customers of P transferred to Q and 30 of the original customers of
P transferred to R. similarly in the second week 50 of the original customers
of Q transferred to P with no transfers to R and 20 of the original customers
of R transferred to P with no transfers to Q.

At this point you will notice that condition h (ii) and condition (iii) produce
                                      as




2x + x = 3x when substituted into condition (i), we therefore need extra
condition x + y + z = 1 to solve the problem.

Where for example second element in the first row, that is 0.2850 is the
result of multiplying the corresponding elements of the first row of S by the
second column of S and summing the product.

          Of the original customers who buy BM2, 48.7% will remain loyal to
          the brand in month three 34.25% will have switched to BM1 and
          17% will have switched to BM3
          Of the original customers who buy BM3, 66% will remain loyal to
          the brand in month three 11.25% will have switched to BM1 and
          22.75% will have switched to BM2
          Alternatively
          In month three 54.5% of the customers buying BM1 are original
          customers. 34.5% came from BM2 originally and remaining 11.25%
          have switched from BM3 and so on.

                                                       om
The Markov processes are defined as a set of trials which follow a certain
sequence which depend on a given set of probabilities known as transition




                                                   i.c
probabilities. These probabilities indicate how a particular activity or
product moves from one state to another.

Applications of Markov Chains in Business
                                      om

The Markov processes or chains are frequently applied as follows:-
1. Brand Switching
                                  om



By using the transitional probabilities we can be able to express the manner
                             as




in which consumers switch their tastes from one product to another.

persons and also decide the level of premiums to be paid in future.

3. Movement of urban population
By formulating a transition matrix for the current population in the urban
areas, one can be able to determine what the population will be in say 5
years.

4. Movement of customers from one bank to another.
It is a fact that customers tend to look for efficient banks. Therefore at a
certain time when a given bank installs such machinery as computers it will
tend to attract a number of customers who will move from certain banks to
efficient ones.

PROPERTIES OF MARKOV CHAINS

ABSORBING STATES
                            .m




A state Si (I = 1, 2, 3 …) of a markov chain is called absorbing if the system
remains in the state, Si once it enters there. Thus a state, Si is absorbing if
                        w




and only if the ith row of the transition matrix p has a 1 on the main
                    w




diagonal and zeroes every where else. See the following example.
                   w




The following matrix, P is a transition matrix of the markov chain.

The States S2 and S5 are absorbing states since the 2 nd and 4th rows have 1
on the main diagonal.

Probability Transition Matrices (Brand switching)
These are matrices in which the individual elements are in the form of
probabilities. The probabilities represent the probability of one event
following another event i.e. the probability of transition from one event to
the next. The probabilities of the various changes applied to the initial
state by matrix multiplication, give a forecast of the succeeding state.
Normally a transition matrix is defined with its columns adding up to one
and state vectors as column vectors.
In this case the succeeding state is found by pre-multiplying the transition
matrix by the proceeding state (column) vector. If the transition matrices
are given with their rows adding up to one, then the succeeding state is
found by post multiplying the transition matrix by the preceding state (row)
vector.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
At the end of this topic the trainee should be able to:
     Differentiate algebraic functions;
     Integrate algebraic functions

INTRODUCTION

Calculus is a branch of mathematics which explains how one variable changes
in relationship to another variable. It enables us to find the rate of change of
one variable with respect to another variable.

Example
   i.   The rate at which business revenue is increasing at a particular stage




                                                                   om
        when volume of sales is increasing.
   ii.  The rate at which costs are changing at a particular stage when




                                                               i.c
        volume of sales is given
   iii. The evaluation of ‗rate of change‘ can help us to identify when the

   iv.
                                                          ng
        change in one variable reaches a maximum or minimum.
        Calculus may be used in production management when the
                                                          si
        production manager wants to know
                                                   om

        a) How much is to be manufactured in order to maximize the profits,
           revenues e.t.c
                                              om



        b) How much is to be produced in order to minimize the production
           costs
                                      as




Calculus is divided into two sections namely:
                                  .m

                   w




activities or simply the process of finding the derivative of a function.
Integration deals with the summation or totality of items produced over a given
period of time or simply the reverse of differentiation

The derivative and differentiation
The process of obtaining the derivative of a function or slope or gradient is
referred to as derivation or differentiation.
                                         dy
The derivative is denoted by                  or f΄(x) and is given by dividing the change in
                                         dx
y variable by the change in x variable.
The derivative or slope or gradient of a line AB connecting points (x,y) and
(x+dx, y + dy) is given by
       y
            
                Change in y
                              
                                   y  dy   y  dy
       x       Change in x       x  dx  x dx
                                                    222
Where dy is a small change in y and dx is a small change in x variables.

If given y = Axr, then            dy = rAxr-1
                     dx

                 4. The sum rule
The derivative of the sum of two or more functions equals the sum of the
derivatives of the functions.
For instance
If H(x) = h(x) + g(x)
Then dy or H´(x) = h´(x) + g´(x)
     dx

                 5. The difference rule
                                                224
The derivative of the difference of two or more functions equals the difference
of the derivatives of the functions
If H (£) = h(x) – g(x)
Then H´ (£) = h´(x) – g´(x)

Examples.
Find the derivatives of
     i.        y = 3x2 + 5x + 7
     ii.       y = 4x2 – 2xb

Solution

Determine the rate of change of w with respect to m (i.e. the rate at which the
number of eggs per month increase or decrease depending on the rate at which

                  8. Chain Rule
This rule is generally applied in the determination of the derivatives of
composite functions, which can be defined as a function in which another
function can be considered to have taken the place of the independent
variable. The composite function is also referred to as a function of a function.
It is normally of the form y = (2x2 + 3)3. If we let u = (2x2 + 3), then y = u3.
In order to differentiate such an equation we use the formula
       dy        dy       du
                     
       dx        du       dx

                                                                          i.c
             y = (2x2 + 3)3
Let u = 2x2 + 3

∴      du = 2x

Example
Consider the function
             y = (x2 + 16x + 5)2
which can be decomposed into
y = u2 and u = x2 + 16x + 5. in this case y is a function of (x2 + 16x + 5)
Hence y = f(u) and u = g(x)
       dy =       dy . du
       dx         du dx
       = (2u) (2x +16)

       The derivative of a function raised to power r; the composite function
       rule.
The derivative of a function raised to power r equals to the power r times the
function which is raised by power (r-1), all of which is multiplied by the
derivative of the function

         Then dy = r[g(x)]r-1 . g´(x)

An Implicit function is one of the y = x2 y + 3x2 + 50. it is a function in which
the dependent variable (y) appears also on the right hand side.

To differentiate the above equation we use the differentiation method for a
product, quotient or function of a function.

Partial derivatives
These derivatives are used when we want to investigate the effect of one
independent variable on the dependent variable.
For example, the revenues of a farmer may depend on two variables namely;
the amount of fertilizer applied and also the type of the natural soil.
Let ㄫ = 30x2y + y2 + 50x + 60y

Example
Determine the critical value for the following functions and find out the critical
value that constitutes a maximum
       y = x3 – 12x2 + 36x + 8

Solution
       y = x3 – 12x2 + 36x + 8
       then dy        = 3x2 – 24x + 36 +0
                                            231
              dx
   iii.    The critical values for the function are obtained by equating the first
           derivative of the function to zero, that is:
              dy     = 0 or 3x2 – 24x + 36 = 0
              dx
              Hence (x-2) (x-6) = 0
              And x = 2 or 6
The critical values for x are x = 2 or 6 and critical values for the function are y
= 40 or 8
ii. To ascertain whether these critical values of x will give rise to a maximum,
we apply the second text, that is
              d2y    <0
              d2x
              dy     = 3x2 – 24x + 36 and

                                                     i.c
           b) When x = 6                        ng
                                                si
              Then d2y = +2 > 0
                                        om

                    d2x
Hence a maximum occurs when x = 2, since this value of x satisfies the second

condition. X = 6 does not give rise to a local maximum
                              as




b) Tests for relative minimum
There are two tests for a relative minimum point
                         .m




       i.     The first derivative, that is
                      w




                     dy = f´(x) = 0
                   w




                     dx
                w




       ii.    The second derivative, that is
                     d2y = f´(x) > 0
                     dx2

Example:
For the function
       h(x) = 1/3 x3 + x2 – 35x + 10
Determine the critical values and find out whether these critical values are
maxima or minima. Determine the extreme values of the function

Solution
   i.      Critical values
      h(x) = 1/3 x3 + x2 – 35x + 10 and
      h´(x) = x2 + 2x – 35
   by first text,
               then h´(x) = x2 + 2x – 35 = 0
                                          232
             or (x-5) (x+7) = 0
             Hence x = 5 or x = -7

    ii.      The determinant of the maximum and the minimum points requires
             that we test the value x = 5 and –7 by the second text
             H´´(x) = 2x + 2
             a) When x = -7 h´´(x) = -12 <0
             b) When x = 5 h´´(x) = 12>0
       There x = -7 gives a maximum point and x = 5 gives a minimum point.
    iii.     Extreme values of the function
             h(x) = 1/3 x3 + x2 – 35x + 10
             when x = -7, h(x) = 189 2/3
             when x = 5, h(x) = -98 1/3
             The extreme values of the function are h(x) = 189 2/3 which is a
         relative maximum and h(x) = -98 1/3 , a relative minimum

Find the points of inflexion on the curve of the function
                            as




       y = x3
                        .m




Solution
                     w




The only possible inflexion points will occur where
                  w




        d2y
              0

              3 x 2 and       6x
        dx               dx 2
Equating the second derivative to zero, we have
        6x = 0 or x = 0
We test whether the point at which x = 0 is an inflexion point as follows
                                    d2y
When x is slightly less than 0,            0 which means a downward concavity
                                    dx 2
                                   d2y
When x is slightly larger than 0,         0 which means an upward concavity
                                   dx 2
Therefore we have a point of inflexion at point x = 0 because the concavity of
the curve changes as we pass from the left to the right of x = 0

   i.     To find maximum or minimum value we use differential calculus as

          follows

   Therefore at x = 18, the value of R is a maximum. Similarly at x = -18, the

Note: Exams focus: Note the difference between marginal function and total
function. You differentiate total function to attain marginal function, this is
common in exams,
total profit = total revenue – total cost.

Example 3.

marginal (or variable) cost, which is the gradient of the total cost curve, is (92
– 2x) Shs. thousands, where x is the number of units of output per annum. The
fixed costs are Shs. 800,000 per annum. It has also been shown that the
marginal revenue which is the gradient of the total revenue is (112 – 2x) Shs.

         b) Maximize the total costs, together with the maximum total

Solution
                                      om

   i.    First find the indefinite integral limit points of the marginal cost as
         the first step to obtaining the total cost curve
                                 om



         Thus ʃ(92 – 2x) dx = 92x – x2 + c
         Where c is constant
                            as
                        .m




Since the total costs are the sum of variable costs and fixed costs, the constant
term in the integral represents the fixed costs, thus if Tc are the total costs
                      w




then,
                  w




             Tc = 92x – x2 + 800
          or Tc = 800 + 92x - x2
               w




   ii.    As in the above case, the first step in determining the total revenue
          is to form the indefinite integral of the marginal revenue
          Thus ʃ(112 - 2x) dx = 112x – x2 + c
          Where c is a constant

The total revenue is zero if no items are sold, thus the constant is zero and if
Tr represents the total revenue, then
                    Tr = 112x – x2
   iii.   At break even the total revenue is equal to the total costs
          Thus 112x – x2 = 800 + 92x - x2
          20x = 800
          x = 40 units per annum

           x = 56 units per annum
                     d 2 Tr 

Specific objectives
At the end of this topic the trainee should be able to:
     Describe networks and need for the analysis;
     Construct project networks;
     Determine the critical path;
     Apply network analysis to decision problems.

INTRODUCTION
This is a system of interrelationship between jobs and tasks for planning and
control of resources of a project by identifying critical path of the project.

Terminology
Activity. Task or job of work, which takes time and resources e.g building a




                                                          om
       bridge. It is represented by an arrow which indicates where the task
       begins and ends




                                                     i.c
Event (node). This is a point in time and it indicates the start or finish of an
                                                ng
      activity e.g in building a bridge, rails installed. It is represented by a
      circle.
                                              si
                                       om


Dummy activity. An activity that doesn‘t consume time or resources, it is
                                  om



    merely to show logical dependencies between activities so as abide by
    rules of drawing a network, it is represented by a dotted arrow
                             as
                         .m




Network. This is a combination of activities and events (including dummy
                      w




     activities)
                   w
                w




Rules for Drawing a Network
   a) A network should only have one start point and one finish point (start
       event and finish event )
   b) All activities must have at least one preceding event (tail event) and at
       least one succeeding event (head event), but an activity may not share
       the same tail event and head event.
   c) An activity can only start after its tail event has been reached
   d) An event is only complete after all activities leading to it are complete.
   e) Activities are identified by alphabetical or numeric codes i.e. A,B,C;
       1,2,3 or identification by head or tail events 1-2, 2-4, 3-4,1-4…


                                        245
        f) Loops (a series of activities leading back to the same event) and danglers
           (activities which do not link to the overall project) are not allowed




                                                                       Dangling activity
                              Loop


     Dummy Events
     This is an event that does not consume time or resources, it is represented by
     dotted arrow. Dummies are applied when two or more events occur
     concurrently and they share the same head and tail events e.g. when a car
     goes to a garage tires are changed and break pads as well, instead of
     representing this as;

                         A- Tires Changed




                                                                  om

    Network Analysis-Time Analysis
    Assessing the time
       a) After drawing the outline of the network time durations of the activities
           are then inserted.
           a) Time estimates. The analysis of the projects time can be achieved by
               using :
               i. Single time estimates for each activity. These estimates would
                    be based on the judgment of the individual responsible or by




                                                             om
                    technical calculations using data from similar projects
              ii. Multiple time estimates for each activity. the most usual




                                                       i.c
                    multiple time estimates are three estimates for each activity ,
                    i.e. optimistic (O), Most Likely (ML), and Pessimistic (P). These
                                                     ng
                    three estimates are combined to give an expected time and the
                    accepted time formula is:
                                               si
                                          om

                                            O  P  4ML
                          Expected time =
                                                 6
                                    om



                      For example assume that the three estimates for an activity
                      are
                                as




                                  Optimistic         11 days
                            .m




                                  Most likely        15 days
                                  Pessimistic        18 days
                          w




                                                      11  18  4 15 
                                    Expected time =
                      w




                                                             6
                      w




                                                    = 14.8 days
              b) Use of time estimates. as three time estimates are converted to a
                 single time estimate. There is no fundamental difference between
                 the two methods as regards the basic time analysis of a network.
                 However, on completion of the basic time analysis, projects with
                 multiple time estimates can be further analyzed to give an
                 estimate of the probability of completing the project by a
                 scheduled date.
              c) Time units. Time estimates may be given in any unit, i.e. minutes
                 , hours, days depending on the project. All times estimates within
                 a project must be in the same units otherwise confusion is bound
                 to occur.

    Basic time analysis – critical path
       b) The critical path of a network gives the shortest time in which the
           whole project can be completed. It is the chain of activities with the
                                        247
      longest duration times. There may be more than one critical path which
      may run through a dummy.

   Earliest start times (EST) – Forward pass, Once the activities have been
         timed we can assess the total project time by calculating the ESTs for
         each activity. The EST is the earliest possible time at which a
         succeeding activity can start.
         Assume the following network has been drawn and the activity times
         estimated in days.

      The method used to insert the ESTs is also known as the forward pass,
                   w




      this is obtained by;
                 EST = The greater of [EST (tail event) + Activity duration]

   a) Start from the start event giving it 0 values,
   b) For the rest of the events EST is obtained by summing the EST of the tail
      event and the activity duration
   c) Where two or more routes converge into an activity, calculate individual
      EST per route and then select the longest route (time)
   d) The EST of the finish event is the shortest time the whole project can be
      completed.

Latest Start Times (LST) – Backward pass. this is the latest possible time
      with which a preceding activity can finish without increasing the project
      duration. After this operation the critical path will be clearly defined.

From our example this is done as follows;
                                           248
                                          2                            LST

             LST = Lowest of [LST (head event) – activity duration]

   a) Starting at the finish event, insert the LST (i.e. 9 for our example) ,and
      work backwards through the network.
   b) deduct each activity duration from the previously calculated LST (i.e.
      head LST).
   c) Where the tails of activities join an event, the lowest number is taken as




                                                       om

Critical Path. . This is the chain of activities in a network with the longest
                                       om

          duration Assessment of the resultant network shows that one path
          through the network (A, B, D, F) has EST's and LST's which are
                                om



          identical this is the critical path.

         The critical path can be indicated on the network either by a
                           as




         different colour or by two small transverse lines across the arrows
                       .m




         along the path, thus in our example we have;
                    w
                 w




                                          2
                w




                                        3 3
                               B                  D

         Activities along the critical path are vital activities which must be
         completed by their EST's/LST's otherwise the project will be delayed.

         Non critical activities (in the example above, C and E) have spare
         time or float available. C and/ or E could take up to an additional 2
         days in total without delaying the project duration. If it is required to
         reduce the overall project duration then the time of one or more of
         the activities on the critical path must be reduced perhaps by using
         more labour, or better equipment to reducing job times.

Float
Float or spare time can only be associated with activities which are non-
critical. By definition, activities on the critical path cannot have float. There
are three types of float, Total Float, Free Float and Independent Float. To
illustrate these types of float we use the following example.
                                                  6
           A         5           B             40 50     C
                   10 20         10




                            Section of the network

   a) Total float. Amount of time by which a path of activities could be
      delayed without affecting the overall project duration. The path in this




                                                        om
      example consists of one activity only i.e. B




                                                       i.c
Total Float = Latest Finish time (LFT) - Earliest Start time(EST) time –
Activity Duration
             Total Float = 50 - 10 - 10
                           = 30 days
                                                  ng
                                              si
                                        om

   b) Free float Amount of time an activity can be delayed without affecting
      the commencement of a subsequent activity at its earliest start time,
                                  om



      but may affect float of a previous activity.
         Free Float = Earliest Finish Time(EFT) - EST - Activity Duration
                             as




                   Free Float = 40-10-10
                           .m




                                 = 20 days
   c) Independent float. Amount of time an activity can be delayed when all
                      w




      preceding activities are completed as late as possible and all succeeding
                   w




      activities commenced as early a possible. Independent float therefore
                w




      does not affect the float of either preceding or subsequent activities.

      Independent float = EFT- Latest Start time (EST) - Activity Duration

               Independent float = 40 - 20 - 10
                                  = 10 days
Note:
 for examination purposes, float always refers to total float
 The total float can be calculated separately for each activity but it is often
   useful to find the total float over chains of non-critical activities between
   critical events

Slack
This is the difference between the EST and LST for each event. Strictly it does
not apply to activities but on occasions the terms are confused in examination
questions and unless the context makes it abundantly clear that event slack is
required, it is likely that some form of activity float is required. Events on the
critical path have zero slack.


APPLICATIONS

Cost Scheduling
This is done by calculating the cost of various project durations, cost analysis




                                                         om
seeks to find the cheapest way of reducing the overall cost duration of a
project by increasing labour hours, equipment e.t.c.

Terminologies
                                               ng
Normal cost. The costs associated with a normal time estimate for an activity.
                                             si
         Often the normal time estimate is set at the point where resources
         (labour, equipment, etc.) are used in the most efficient manner.
                                      om


Crash cost. The costs associated with the minimum possible time for an
                                 om



         activity. Crash costs, because of extra wages, overtime premiums,
         extra facility costs are always higher than normal costs.
                              as




Crash time. The minimum possible time that an activity is planned to take. .
                        .m




         The minimum time is invariably brought about by the application of
                     w




         extra resources, e.g. more labour or machinery.
                  w




Cost slope. This is the average cost of shortening an activity by one time unit
               w




          (day, week, month as appropriate). The cost slope is generally
          assumed to be linear and is calculated as follows:

          Cost slope = Crash cost – Normal cost
                     Normal time – Crash time

Example
A project has the following activities and costs. You are required to prepare
the least cost schedules for all possible durations from normal time – normal
cost to crash time – crash cost.

Project duration and costs

              Critical path = A,C,E

              Project cost (cost of all activities in normal time) = Shs. 1,250.
                                                  om


(b)           Reduce by 1 day the activity on the critical path with the lowest cost

              slope. Thus we reduce C at extra cost of Shs. 50.
                                         as




              Now
                                 .m




              Project duration = 13 days
              Project cost = Shs. 1,300

              Note: that all activities are now critical.
                         w




(c)           Further reducing the critical path by 1 day will require that more than
              one activity is affected because there exist several critical paths.

               Reduce by 1 day            Extra cost           Activities
                                                                critical
               A and B                   60 + 70 = 130            All
               D and E                   40 + 80 = 120            All
               B, C and D                70 + 50 + 40 =           All
                                              160
               A and E                   60 + 80 = 140         A, D, B, E

              From this we realize that reducing D and E is the cheapest.




                                                   254
      However closer examination of the fourth alternative reveals that C is
      now non-critical and has 1 day float. Since we earlier reduced C for Shs.
      50, if we reduce A and E and increase C by a day which will save Shs. 50.

      Then the net cost for 12 day duration = 1,300 + (140 – 50) = 1,390.

                     LESSON 8 REINFORCING QUESTIONS

QUESTION ONE
Regal Investments has just received instructions from a client to invest in two
shares; one an airline share, the other an insurance share. The total maximum
appreciation in share value over the next year is to be maximized subject to
the following restrictions:
-      the total investment shall not exceed Sh.100,000
-      at most Sh.40,000 is to be invested in the insurance shares
-      quarterly dividends must total at least Sh.2,600

The airline share is currently selling for Sh.40 per share and its quarterly
dividend is Sh.1per share. The insurance share is currently selling for Sh.50 per
share and the quarterly dividend is Sh.1.50 per share. Regal‘s analysts predict
that over the next year, the value of the airline share will increase by Sh.2 per
share and the value of the insurance share will increase by Sh.3 per share.

QUESTION FIVE
a)   Explain the value of sensitivity analysis in linear programming problems and
     show how dual values are useful in identifying the price worth paying to
     relax constraints.

b) J.A Computers is a small manufacturer of personal computers. It
   concentrates on production of three models- a Desktop 386, a Desktop 286,
   and a Laptop 486, each containing one CPU Chip. Due to its limited
   assembly facilities JA Computers are unable to produce more than 500
   desktop models or more than 250 Laptop models per month. It has one
   hundred and twenty 80386 chips (these are used in Desktop-386) and four
   hundred 80286 chips (used in desktop 286 and Laptop 486) for the month.
   The Desktop 386 model requires five hours of production time, the Desktop
   286 model requires four hours of production time, and the Laptop 486
   requires three hours of production time. J.A Computers have 2000 hours of
   production time available for the coming month. The company estimates
   that the profit on Desktop 386 is Sh. 5,000. for a desktop 286 the profit is




                                                         om

INTRODUCTION
The activities of a business during a financial year combine investment projects
in progress with new projects commencing and others terminate within the year.
It would appear reasonable to presume, therefore, that business financial

facilitate comparison of actual with planned cash flows.

Profit is measured conventionally by setting against the sales revenue for a
period the costs expired in earning that revenue. That is, sales are matched
against their relevant costs. Profit is therefore more evenly reported than it
would be if all cash receipts and payments, capital and revenue, were fully
reflected in the accounts of the period in which they are received and paid.

The management accountant also adopts the matching principle when preparing
control information in both actual and budgeted form, and also ascertains full
product cost as a starting point for setting selling prices.

This outlines the systems and methods used to control the flow of resources
through production and service cost centres, for their eventual inclusion in
product and period costs.

MATERIAL CONTROL
It is said that "any fool can sell"—it is buying at the right price that is more
critical to the achievement of a satisfactory return on capital employed. Buying
price is important of course, but buying the right materials, is equally important
if production targets are to be achieved and investment in inventories to be
minimized.


WHAT TO ORDER
This is governed by product specifications, but an efficient buyer will always
have his ear to the ground to discover new and substitute materials and
components of advantageous quality and price. Other economies can be realized
by reducing the variety of materials purchased by standardization, e.g. reducing
the variety of colors of paint stocked, or by introducing value analysis into the
decision process.

characteristics. These are the attributes that a customer looks for in a product
                                               ng
and include its use value (functional qualities), appeal value (color, style etc.)
                                             si
and second-hand value (e.g. trade-in-price). The object of value analysis is to
                                      om

build into the product the optimum of desired value at minimum cost, by
introducing the most up-to-date designs, materials and methods of manufacture.
No more value need be built into the product than is desired by the customer.

How much to order
Supposing the estimated annual usage of a component by Harambee Agricultural
Machinery Ltd is 20,000 units. Usage is even throughout the year and only one
order per annum is placed with the supplier. Because only one delivery is made,
average stock will be high, i.e. 20,000  2 = 10,000 and consequently
stockholding costs will be very high. On the other hand, the costs of ordering
will be negligible. If two orders are placed there will be less in stock (i.e.
average 5,000), which will reduce holding costs, but ordering costs will increase.
Thus, the higher the number of orders placed, the lower are stockholding costs,
but the higher are ordering costs.

Stockholding costs include interest on the capital invested in stocks, storage,
insurance, rates, security, building maintenance, heating, etc. Ordering costs
include buying-department staff costs, receiving and handling.

Assuming that the cost of each Harambee component is £10, that holding cost is
10% of stock value and the cost of placing an order is £1, the total annual cost of




                                                        om

As costs of ordering and holding stock are equal at the EOQ point, we can build a

Where Q      =       EOQ
      H      =       holding cost per unit
      A      =       annual demand
      P      =       cost of placing an order

                     2 AP
       finally Q =
                       H
Using the data in the previous example:
                 2 x 20,000 x 1
       EOQ =

   = 200

                                       270
Although the model assumes that holding and ordering costs are fixed, this
simplification is acceptable given a relatively unchanging level of production
activity. In addition, because the total cost curve in the Figure 1 is relatively
flat either side of the EOQ, minor errors and approximation in the variables used
in the calculation may not affect the end result significantly.

Practical constraints on the use of the model include restrictions on the available
storage space, the availability of quantity discounts (though the model can be
modified in this respect), the seasonal nature of supplies, the shelf-life of
products and delivery schedules imposed by suppliers.


WHEN TO ORDER
If deliveries from suppliers normally take two weeks to arrive, then
replenishment orders should be placed with them when the level of stocks
represents two weeks' supply. For example, if usage is 200 units a week, an




                                                        om
order (the EOQ) will be placed when the stock level falls to 400 units. Figure
6(a) illustrates that, with certain knowledge of usage and lead time, delivery




                                                    i.c
takes place just as stock is exhausted.

and this has to be balanced against the cost of running out of stock. `Stock outs'

The buyer, ideally after making enquiries of several suppliers, sends a purchase
order, and eventually the material is received, checked by the good-inwards
department as to quality and quantity, and is detailed on a goods-received note
(GRN). One copy of the GRN goes to the buyer to write off the outstanding order
record; one to the accounts department for checking against the order and
invoice—the latter authorizing payment to the supplier; and one to the stores
department with the materials.

Figure 3:    Procedure of material acquisition, recording and issue

A stores record is maintained into which the quantity and value of materials
received is entered. Issues of materials to production are made by authorized
materials requisitions which are also entered into the stores ledger to keep that
record up to date continuously, and also into the appropriate job or process
const record.

As already indicated, all the above procedures may be integrated into a
computerised stock record which can provide information at the press of a
button to the storekeeper, buyer, production planner, financial manager or any

                                       273
other person authorized to key into it. For example, information on slow-moving
stock items can be obtained automatically and without delay.


MATERIAL STORAGE
Sophisticated mathematical models to control economic buying, and systems
control the flow of material may all be for nought if the obvious—efficient
storekeeping—ignored. Good practice in this respect implies:


•     The employment of a well-trained stores staff
•     Use of the most efficient equipment—for storage and handling
•     Easy access to items—stored in logical order
•     Siting of stores convenient to users
•     Security against theft and fire
•     Protection against deterioration
•     A system of continuously checking physical with recorded stocks.

INVENTORY PLANNING AND CONTROL



                                                    i.c
The major goal of "inventory control" is to discover and maintain the optimum
                                               ng
level of investment in all types of inventories, from raw materials and supplies
to finished goods that helps to maximize long-run profits.

Two limits must be imposed in controlling inventory levels, because there are
two danger points that management usually wants to avoid. They are:
                                 om




i.    That inadequate inventories, disrupts production and may lose sales.
                             as




ii.   That excessive inventories, introduces unnecessary carrying costs and
                        .m

MOTIVES FOR HOLDING INVENTORIES
               w




If production and delivery of goods were instantaneous, there would be no need
for inventories. However in reality, the manufacturing and purchasing processes
do not function quickly enough to avoid the need for having inventories. Hence
inventories must be maintained so that he or she does not turn to another source
of supply. In turn, production operations cannot flow smoothly without having
inventories of direct materials, work-in-progress, supplies, etc. In other words
inventories must be viewed as cushions:

i.    To absorb planning errors and unforeseen fluctuations in supply and
      demand. (i.e. precautionary motive).

ii.   To facilitate smooth production and marketing operations.
      Note: The fundamental questions to which answers are required are:

      a.     How much should the company order (when stocks are re-ordered)?
      b.     When should the company reorder?
                                       274
      c.      How much should the company produce, and when (if internal
production is involved).


     Accordingly regardless of their complexity, all inventory planning models
     focus on the twin problem of size and timing.

1.       CHOOSING ORDER QUANTITY (SIZE—PROBLEM)
         The objective of inventory decisions is usually to minimize total inventory
         costs to the company. Costs are ascribed to all elements which are of
         interest in reaching its inventory decisions (e.g. purchasing costs, stock
         out costs etc.), and solutions, are derived based on these costs.

         Several inventory planning models exist. These models can be classified
         into two basic classified into two basic classifications:




                                                          om
         i.    Deterministic Models:—whereby all parameters are known with
               certainty, e.g. lead-time, annual demand, etc.

         ii.   Stochastic Models:—in which parameters (particularly demand and

               lead time) are not known with certainty, but follow known
               probability distributions (i.e. risks)

               This is the most simple of all the models discussed. In addition to
               the general assumptions which relate to all deterministic models
                          .m




               (i.e. certainty of all parameters) it is further assumed that:
                        w




               a.     Demand is continuous and constant over time.
                     w

                      immediately on the day the order is made.
              c.      That stock-outs are not allowed.
              d.      There are no bulk quantity discounts.
              e.      Holding costs per unit, ordering costs per order and costs per
unit are constant.

               Relevant costs of basic EOQ model
                      The relevant costs that should be considered when
                      determining optimum inventory levels can be classified into
                      two categories:
               i.     Ordering costs.
               ii.    Holding (Carrying) Costs.
                      I.e. TC = Ordering Costs + Holding Costs

               i.     Ordering Costs

                             the company‘s inventory or stores, and usually consist
                             of clerical costs of:

                      1.     Making the purchase requisition.
                      2.     Issuing of a purchase order
                      3.     Follow-up action

                      6.     Placing goods in stores
                      7.     Paying vendors (Suppliers)

The basic EOQ model assumes that these costs are fixed constant for each order
made.

1.     EOQ Model with quantity discounts

       discounts for large purchase orders. Buying in bulk has some advantages
       and disadvantages.
                                                278
        Advantages


        i.    (A saving in purchase rule) Decreases in unit cost, which consists of
              the total amount of discount for the period.

        ii.   A reduction in the total ordering costs because fewer orders are
              placed to take advantages of the discounts.
        Disadvantages
Increased holding cost arising from higher stock levels when large quantities are
purchased.

Such as:
i.      Stock out cost
ii.     Insurance.
iii.    Deterioration

                                                      i.c
Broadly there are two types of discount structures:
i.                                               ng
      Fixed discount on "all units" when the order placed is for a minimum
quantity.
                                                si
ii.   Variable discounts for given ranges.

        When evaluating inventory decisions when a fixed discount rate exists,
                              as




        the appropriate procedure is to compare the total costs of the EOQ with
        the total costs when discounts are taken. The option giving lower costs is

The Unit (variable) cost (i.e. Purchase Price) behaves in the following manner.

              C      =       Co            if    0  Q  Qb
                             Co (1 - P)    if    Q  Qb

                  Where              Co    =     basic unit cost without a discount
                             P      =      Discount rate allowed.
                             Qb     =      Break-point (Quantity)—where discounts
become operational.

In order to determine the optimal ordering quantity, it is necessary to include
the costs of the inventory with the carrying ordering costs.

              Total costs of Inventory     =     Total Purchase cost + Total order
cost + Total carrying cost

                                          279
              TC     =       DCo + Q* H +         Do          If 0  Q  Qb (i)
                                   2              Q2

              TC     =       DC. (1 - P) + Q H    +     Do    If Q  Qb     (ii)
                                           2            Q

Note:
Equation (ii) i.e. with discounts will give a lower TC than equation (i) for the
same. The decision whether to go for the discount lies on a trade-off between
extra carrying costs vs. a reduction in acquisition costs.

THE CASE OF VARIABLE QUANTITY DISCOUNTS
In practice, suppliers may offer different discounts for different quantities
purchased. For example:


        SEGMENT       QUANTITY PURCHASED                UNIT PRICE
        1               0 — 500                               Shs 100

        4             over — 1,500                      Shs 70

The best approach to the solution in this case is to apply the price-breaks
theorem. This works as follows:

1.      For each segment an EOQ is calculated. There are two possible requests:




                                                         om
        i.      The EOQ is within the quantity segment (i.e. valid)
                In this case, the EOQ is used as the minimum cost quantity for that
segment.

                The EOQ is outside the quantity segment (i.e. invalid)
                In this case the minimum cost quantity will be the quantity within

NON-ZERO LEAD TIME (DETERMINING REORDER POINT)

This basic EOQ model assumes that the suppliers lead time is zero (i.e. goods are

delivered immediately on the day the order was made). In reality, however,
                w




supplies are rarely ordered and received on the same day. Accordingly, orders
must be placed some time before stocks reach zero. In world of certainty (when
demand is continuous and constant) the reorder point will be the number of
days/weeks lead time multiplied by the daily/weekly usage during the period.

i.e. Reorder point   =       Average daily usage x Lead time in days.

INVENTORY PLANNING & CONTROL UNDER UNCERTAINTY
The basic EOQ model assumes that all the parameters (elements) in the model
                                                 ng
are certain (i.e. can be predicted accurately in advance). These parameters
                                               si
are:
                                         om

i.     Demand or usage of stocks
ii.    Lead times.
                                  om



iii.   Holding costs per unit, ordering costs per order and costs per unit.
                              as




In reality however, stock demand, supplies lead times and cost date are not
                          .m




known with certainty. Accordingly to make the models applicable to real
situations we must consider uncertainty when planning for inventory levels.
                     w
                     w




To protect itself from conditions of uncertainty, a firm will maintain a level of
               w




safety stocks for raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods stocks. Thus
safety stocks are the amount of stocks that are carried in excess of the expected
use during the lead time to provide a cushion against running out of stocks. Thus
the reorder point is computed as safety stock plus the average usage during the
lead time
i.e. reorder point =       Average usage during lead time + safety (buffer)
stock.




DETERMINING THE SAFETY STOCKS LEVEL
1.   Uncertainty of demand

       Demand is the most troublesome variable to predict accurately. Actually,
       demand may fluctuate from day to day, from week to week or from
                                         286
        month to month. Thus, the firm takes the risk of running out of stocks if
        there are sudden increases in demand. Hence safety stock is the extra
        inventory held as a buffer of protection against the possibility of stock
        due to higher demand.

        However, a larger inventory of safety stock will involve a higher inventory
        carrying costs, and on the other hand, the higher safety stock will
        decrease stock-out costs. Therefore one has to make a balance between
        these two costs in order to find out an optimal safety costs.

Note:
The optimum safety-stock level exists where the costs of carrying an extra unit
are exactly counter balanced by the expected stock-out costs. This would be
the level that minimizes the annual total stock-out and carrying costs.

Stock-out costs




                                                         om
These are the opportunity costs of running out of stock. They include:
i.     The costs of lost customer sales, and therefore lost contribution to fixed




                                                     i.c
costs.
ii.
iii.                                              ng
       Potential loss of goodwill with customers whose demand cannot be net.
       Acquiring emergency supplies at higher prices to meet demand.
                                             si
iv.    Cost production of finished goods, where raw material stock-outs occur.
                                        om


The computation of safety stocks lingers on demand forecasts. The manager will
                                  om



have some notion (usually based on past experience) of the range of daily
demand. That is the probability that exists for usage of various quantities.
                                as




Hence total inventory costs will be as follows:
                         .m
                        w




Total inventory costs               =     Purchase price cost + carrying costs +
stock-out cost + order costs.
                   w
                  w




                           =      Purchase price costs + "normal~ carrying costs
(Q2 H) + Buffer Stock holding costs (B x H) + Stock-out costs + order costs.

Total inventory costs       =      DC + Q2H + (B x H) + stock-out costs + DQ 
Co

        Where:       D      =      Total annual demand
             H       =      Holding costs per unit
             B       =      Buffer stock
             Q       =      EOQ

Note:

1.      The normal EOQ formula is used to compute order quantity Q. Hence
        purchase costs, carrying costs, and ordering costs remain unchanged.
                                         287
      Only buffer stock holding costs and stock-out costs change. Accordingly,
      the minimization of these two costs will also mean that total/overall costs
      will be minimized.

2.     Stock-out costs    =      Number of units short x Probability of being
short.

                    =      {(Number of units short x Stock-out costs per unit
      Probability of being short)—Stock-out costs for every usage duration} x
      Number of orders per year.

3.    Buffer Stock-holding costs =      Bx H

       Using this model, we can still develop a table similar to the table worked
out in this problem.

      Graph of total cost against re-order level can be drawn using the table.
The minimum cost and the re-order level can then read from the graph. Once
re-order level is known, safety stock can be worked out.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF EOQ MODEL
Sensitivity Analysis is concerned with the way in which those results of solutions
change in response to change in model parameters.

                    2 DO
        EOQ =
                      H

Note:
It is important to appreciate that in formulating our inventory models, we have
really been performing a planning exercise. Thus we have made certain
assumptions and estimates (e.g. annual demand D, holding costs H, & ordering
costs O) and out solutions have obviously been affected by these. When for
example calculating a deterministic EOQ value with maximization of total
inventory costs as the objective, expected annual demand (D) is taken into
account. If we subsequently find that annual demand has differed from that
expected then we will find that the EOQ we selected was not the optimum and,
as a result, the total inventory cost was not actually minimum.

Therefore, X Ltd total inventory costs are actually Shs 50 (3,050 - 3,000) higher
than they would have been if the EOQ had been set in accordance with perfect
information.

Observation:
Hence the change in demand by 44%               (99,000 - 62,500) has result in a 20%
      (600 - 500)

Increase in EOQ but only 91.64% (3,050 - 3,000) increase in total costs.
                               3,000

Hence we can conclude that total cost is relatively insensitive to changes in
demand.

SELECTIVE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
The inventory of an industrial firm generally comprises thousands of items with
diverse prices, usage and lead time, as well as procurement and/or technical
problems. It is neither desirable nor possible to exercise the same degree of
control over all those items. The organisation should pay more attention and
care to those items whose usage value is high and less attention to those whose
usage and consumption value is low. The organisation has, therefore, to be
selective in its approach to control its investment in various types of stocks and
inventories. Such a system is known as `selective inventory control' system.

ABC ANALYSIS (PARETO ANALYSIS)

In ordinary parlance, ABC analysis can be best compared with our class society
where the population is categorised into Top, Middle and Lower classes. In the




                                                       om
case of inventories also, it has been noticed that out of a large number of items
(in a million-tonne capacity steel plant there would be usually about 50,000




                                                   i.c
items of inventory of various types) that are generally held in stock, some of the
items are quite significant whereas the others are not that important. Through
                                               ng
ABC plan which is in fact an analytical approach based on common statistical
techniques, the relative importance of the various items is established for the
                                             si
purpose of individual scrutiny and subsequent control. Through this technique
                                      om

`VIP' or the `privileged few' and the `trivial many' are distinguished and treated
as such.
                                 om




ABC analysis contemplates to classify all the inventory items in a number of
                            as




categories, generally in three categories based on their values. Items of high
value but small in number are classified as `A' items which would be under a
                        .m




strict control. `C' items represent relatively small value items and would be
                     w




under simple control. Items of moderate value and size are classified as `B'
                  w




items and would attract reasonable attention of the management. Since this
               w




plan concentrates attention on the basis of the relative importance of the
various items of inventory, it is also known as `control by importance and
exception'. As items are classified in order of their relative importance in terms
of value, it is also known as the `proportional value analysis'.


It has been found that normal inventory items in most organisations show the
following distribution pattern:

      A—     5 to 10% of total number of items account for about 70% of the
             total consumption value. These items may be called "A" items.

      B—     10 to 20% account for 20% of total consumption value.

      C—     the remaining large number of items account for the balance of
             15% of the consumption value.
                                       297
Remark       When a detailed scrutiny was conducted in respect of inventories
held by the Ford Motor Company, the following results were obtained.

         1.    9% of the total items (in number) were accounting for 57% of the
               total value of the inventory. These were classed as `A' items.

         2.    10% of the items (in number) were found to be accounting for 18%
               of the total value. These were categorized as `B' items.

         3.    81% of the items (in number) were found to be accounting for only
               25% of the total value. These were classified as `C' items.

         Similarly, when ABC ANALYSIS was done in the case of G.E.C., the results
         obtained were as under:

         `A' Category—Items accounting for 8% of the total number but 75% of total




                                                          om
value.




                                                      i.c
       `B' Category—Items accounting for 25% of the total number and 20% of
total value.
                                                 ng
       `C' Category—Items accounting for 67% of the total number and only 5% of
                                              si
the total value.
                                        om


It would thus be observed that substantial and effective controls are made
                                   om



possible if greater attention is focused on `A' category items since these would
be covering quite a substantial part of the inventory in terms of shilling value.
                              as




Some Remarks:
                          .m




1.        There is no hard and fast rule that all the inventory items should be
                       w




          classified only in these three categories. There can be a large number
                     w




          of classifications based on the requirements of the company and the
                 w




          nature of the items. For example `A' items may be further sub-
          classified as A1, A2, A3, etc. The same principle may be extended to `B'
          items also or alternatively all the inventory items may be classified into
          A, B, C, D, E, F, etc.

2.       All items that the company consumes must be considered together while
         classifying into ABC classes. Separate classification of raw materials,
         spares and consumable is not really meaningful.

While classifying as ABC items, what counts is the consumption shillings and not
the unit price of an item or its consumptions in terms of units. Thus of the three
items given below, the last one is most important since its annual consumption
in terms of value is more than the other two.

              Item       Price/U    Annual            Annual
                         nit        Consumption       Consumption
                                        298
                       Shs       in units           in Shs
           X           20,000    2                  40,000
           Y           0.02      100,000,000        200,000
           Z           1,000     500                500,000

4.    Even though, so far we have referred to annual consumption, it is not at
      all necessary that the consumption figures should be taken only for one
      year. It can be for 6 months or even 3 months. But the period should be
      so selected that the consumption figures would be representative.
      However, annual figures are far more convenient and are universally
      followed.

5.    If a firm follows ABC analysis, it will devote much time and effort on the
      control of `A' items. For example, extra care will be taken in the
      determination of minimum, maximum, reorder level, etc. of the `A'
      items, whereas so much control may not be exercised on `C' items. `A'
      items may be purchased only once in a year. For `A' items perpetual




                                                        om
      inventory system may be applied whereas in the case of `C' items, only a
      bin card may be maintained. In the same way an appropriate accounting




                                                   i.c
      method for `B' items may be devised. However, in the classification of
      items into ABC categories if there are some critical items which are of
                                               ng
      small value whose non-availability may hamper the production, may in
                                              si
      the normal situation, be classified as `C' items but, due to the critical
                                      om

      nature of these items extra care may be taken so that these may not go
      out of stock.
                                om



6.    The objective of classifying inventory items into `A', `B' and `C' categories
      is to develop policy guidelines for selective control. Such a policy can be
                            as




      designed in a variety of ways. In general `A' items merit a tightly
                       .m




      controlled inventory system with periodic attention, and `C' items to
      subject to loose control with casual attention.

LIMITATIONS OF ABC ANALYSIS
Although ABC analysis is a fundamental tool for exercising selective control over
numerous inventory items, it does not, in its present form, permit precise
consideration of all relevant problems of inventory management. For instance, a
never-ending problem in inventory management is that of adequately handling
thousands of low-value `C' items. Low-value purchases frequently require more
items and thereby reduce the time allowance available to purchasing personnel
for value analysis, vendor investigation, and other `B' items.

Besides, if ABC analysis is not periodically reviewed and updated, the very
approach of control may be defeated. For example, `C' items like diesel oil in a
firm, will become most high-value items during power crisis should, therefore,
                                        300
deserve more attention, but this point may be overlooked if classification of
items is not reviewed and updated.

The following steps are involved in implementing the ABC analysis:

1.      Classify the items of inventories, determining the expected use in units
        and price per unit for each item.
2.      Determine the total value of each item by multiplying the expected units
by its unit price.
3.      Rank the item in accordance with the total value, giving first rank to the
        item with highest total value and so on.
4.      Compute the ratios (percentage) of number of units of each item to total
        units of all items and the ratio of total value of each item total value of
        all items.

Combine items on the basis of their relative value to form three categories—A, B
and C.

The tabular and graphic representation indicates that "Item A" forms a minimum
proportion, 15 per cent of total units of all items, but represents the higher
value, 70 per cent. On the other hand, "Item C" represents 55 per cent of the
total units and only 10 per cent of the total value. "Item B" occupies the middle
place. Items A and B jointly represent 45 per cent of the total units and 90 per
cent of the investment. More than half of the total units are item C,
representing merely 10 per cent of the investment. Thus, a tighter control
should be exercised on "Item A" in order to maximize profitability on its
investment. In case of "Item C" simple controls will be sufficient.

JIT PRODUCTION
Is a production system, which is driven by demand for the finished products
whereby each component on the production line is produced only when needed
for the next stage.


JIT PURCHASING
 On the other hand is a purchasing system in which material purchased are
contracted so as that the receipt and usage of materials to the maximum
extent possible, coincide.



                                       302
JIT concept can be traced back to the Japanese company whose success in the
international market generates interest among many western companies as t6o
how this success was achieved.
The implementation of JIT production methods was considered to be pursuit of
excellence in all phase of manufacturing systems design and operations.
The JIT are to produce the required items at the required quality and in the
required quantities, at the precise time that they are required.

JIT seeks to achieve the following goals-
(1). Elimination of non-value adding activities.
(2). Zero inventory
(3). Zero defects
(4). Batch size of one.
(5). Zero break-downs
(6). 100% on time delivery services.

The above goals represent perfection and are most unlikely to be archived in




                                                      om
practice. They do however offer targets and create a climate for continuous
improvement and excellence.

(1). Elimination of non-value added activity
                                      om

 JIT manufacturing can be described as a philosophy of management, dedicate
to the elimination of waste. Waste is defined as anything that does not add
                                 om



value to a product.
The cycle time involved in manufacturing and selling a product consist of –
                             as
                         .m




      Process time-add values
      Inspection time
                     w




      More time
                  w




      Queue time
               w




      Storage time

Of these 5 steps only process time actually adds value to the products. All the
other activities add cost and No value to the production and therefore are
deemed as non-value within the JIT philosophy.
Usually in many companies, process time is less than 10% of total
manufacturing, lead and cycle time. Therefore 90% of the manufacturing lead
time disassociated with the product, adds cost but no-value to the product by
adapting a JIT philosophy and forecasting, on reducing lead time, it is claimed
that total cost can be significantly reduced.
The ultimate products with lead-time = processing time, and eliminating all
non-value adding activities.




                                       303
(2). Factory Layout
The first stage of implementing the JIT manufacturing techniques is to
rearrange the factory floor away from the batch production functional layout
towards a production layout using low lines with a functional plant layout
production through a No. of special departments that normally contain a group
of similar machines.
Products are processed in stage batches so as to minimize the set times when
machine settings are changed between processing batches of different
products. Batches move via different and complex routes through the various
departments, traveling over much of the factory floor before they are
complete.
Each process normally involves a considerable amount of waiting time and
which much time is taken transporting items from one process to another.

A further problem is that it is not easy at any point in time to determine what
progress has been made on individual batches and therefore detailed cost
accumulation records are necessary to track work in progress. This results in




                                                      om
long manufacturing cycles and high work in progress levels.




                                                  i.c
The JIT solution is to reorganize the production process by dividing the many
different products that an organization makes into families of similar products
                                              ng
or component. All the products is a in a particular group will have similar
                                            si
production requirement and routing. Production is necessary used* so that each
                                     om

production family is manufactured in a well-defined production cell based on
flow line principles. In a production how lines specialist department containing
                                om



similar markets no longer exist. Instead groups of dissimilar markets are
organised into products or component family flow lines that function like an
assembly line.
                            as
                          .m




For each production lines the market are placed close together in the order in
which they are required by the group of products to be processed. Items in
                      w




each product family can now move one at time from process to process more
                  w




easily, thereby reducing wip, and lead time.
               w




The aim is to produce products or component from start to finish without
returning to the stock room or stores

(3). Batch size of one.
Set up time is the amount of time required to adjust equipment and to retool
for a different product. Long set ups a change over time make the production
of batches with a small no. of units uneconomical.
However, the creation of large batches lead to substantial lead time delays and
the creation of high inventory levels. The JIT philosophy is to reduce and
eventually eliminate set-up times.E.g. by investing in advanced manufacturing
technology some machines setting can be adjusted automatically instead of
manually.
Alternatively some set up times can be eliminated entirely by reducing
products, so that markets do not have to be reset each time a different
product has to be made.

                                      304
If the set up times are approaching zero, then there‘s no advantage production
in batches and therefore the optimal batch size can be one. With a batch size
of one, the work can flow smoothly to the next stage without the need for and
to schedule the next machine to accept this item.


JIT PURCHASING ARRANGEMENTS
JIT philosophy also extends to adapting JIT purchasing techniques whereby
delivery of material immediately precedes their use. By arranging with
suppliers for more frequent deliveries stocks can be out to a minimum
Considerable savings in material handling expenses can be obtained by
requiring suppliers to inspect materials before their delivery and guarantee
their quality.
This improved service is obtained by giving more business to fewer suppliers
and placing long tern purchasing orders, therefore the suppliers has an
assurance of long term sales and can plan to meet this demand.
Companies that have implemented JIT purchasing techniques have claimed to




                                                     om
substantially reduce their investment in raw materials and work in progress
stocks.

JIT and Management Accounting.
                       .m




Management accountants in many organisations have been criticised because of
their failure to change their managing accounting system to reflect the mode
                    w




from a traditional manufacturing to a JIT manufacturing system.
                 w




Conventional management accounting systems can encourage behaviour that is
              w




inconsistent with JIT phylosopy, management, accounting must support JIT
manufacturing by monitoring, identifying, and communicating to decision
makers any delays errors and waste in the system.

Modern management accounting systems are now placing greater emphasis on
providing information on suppliers relialibility set up times cycle times,
percentage of deliveries that are on time and defect rates
All these measures are critical in supporting JIT manufacturing philosophy.



FINANCIAL MANAGER'S ROLE IN INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
The techniques of inventory management, discussed above are very useful in
determining the optimum level of inventory and finding answers to the problems
of the economic order quantity, the re-order point and the safety stock. The
techniques are very essential to economize the use of resources by minimizing
                                     305
the total inventory cost. Although out treatment of inventory management has
been simple, it indicates the broad framework of managing inventories. Many
sophisticated techniques have been evolved to handle inventory management
problems more efficiently and effectively and the improvements are still
continuing.     For the majority of the companies, inventory represents a
substantial investment. Thus, the goal of the wealth maximization is related to
the efficiency with which inventory is managed. Consequently, the financial
manager has an important role to play in the management of inventory, although
it is not his operating responsibility to control inventory. The financial manager
should see that only an optimum amount is invested in inventory. He should be
familiar with the inventory control techniques and ensure that inventory is
managed well. He should introduce the policies which reduce the lead time,
regulate usage and thus, minimize safety stock. The net effect would be to
reduce inventory investment and increase the firm's prospects of making more
profits.

INTRODUCTION
These are mathematical technique that deals with optimism of linear function
variables known as objective functions. It is a method of determine an
optimum program of independent activities in view of available resources.
Linear programming is a technique of decision making used by managers to




                                                       om
allocate limited resources e.g. machinery, raw materials and labor in order to
minimize costs or maximize production. Decision variable are the amounts of




                                                   i.c
each product to be made in a given time period. Linear programming assumes
that the variable has a linear relationship.

Limitation
                  w




   1. it assumes that the activity is infinitely divisible

   2. it treats all relationships as linear
   3. it takes into account single object only.
   4. It can be adopted only under the condition of certainty i.e. when the
      quantity of resources is known.

Assumption of linear programming
   1. linearity
   2. Divisibility- assumes that quantities, costs and revenues are infinitely
      divisible.
   3. certainty- the technique assumes that there is certainty in all
   4. positive solutions- non negative constraints are introduced to ensure the
      values are considered
   5. Interdependent between demands for products is ignored.
   6. Time factor is ignored. It assumes that production is instantaneous.

Application of linear programming
Production department to decide the quantity of pots to be produced subject
to limited resources (constraints) e.g. labor, power, machine hours, raw
materials etc.
Marketing department: Allocation of salesmen to different sales regions subject
to their expected performance.
Human Resource: Scheduling personnel‘s work hours and job description to
either maximize production or minimize cost.

Steps in solving linear programming problems (problem formulation)
1. Identify variables (e.g. product x and product y)
2. Identify the objective (To maximize contribution or to minimize cost), and
   write down its mathematical presentation in terms of variables.
3. Identify the constraints (i.e. the limited resources shared among the
   variables), and write down its mathematical representation in terms of
   variables.
4. Write down the objectives and the constraints in terms of the variables.

   maximize its daily contribution assuming that all the lager produced is sold.




                                      309
Solution:
1.     Formulating a linear programming model

Step 1: Identifying variables:
The variables here are the number of units of Benko and Benoni lager produced
by Long castling breweries per day; we can represent them as:
                                       X1= a unit of Benko lager.
                                       X2= a unit of Benoni lager.

Step 2: Identify the objective:

Definition: An objective is the desired result i.e. optimization of a function
dependent on decision variable and subject to some constraints.

The objective of Long Castling Breweries is to maximize daily contribution.
Objective function is the formula that will give us the total contribution in a
day for both Benko lager and Benoni lager.

Limitations must be quantified mathematically and they must be linear.

For Long castling breweries we have limited machine hours (12hrs/day), which
must be shared among production of Benko and Benoni lagers.
Therefore production must be such that the numbers of machine hours required
is less than or equal to 12 hours per day.
        0.5X1+0.33X2 ≤ 12hrs

Similarly for labor hours we have:
       0.5X1+0.5X2 ≤ 14hrs

Non-Negativity: It is logical assumption to assume that the company cannot
manufacture negative amounts of a product, thus it can only manufacture
either zero product or more. Therefore we have:    X1≥0
                    X2≥0         or    X1, X2≥0

                                       310
Thus the complete linear programming model is;
      Maximize 4X1 + 3X2

Subject to the constraints;
      0.5X1 + 0.33X2 ≤ 12
      0.5X1 + 0.5X2 ≤ 14
      X1 X2 ≥ 0

Solving linear programming problems
The question requires us to optimize (in our case, maximize) the objective (the
contribution function), or in simple terms we are required to solve the linear
programming model.
Solving linear programming model entails finding the values of variables that
satisfy all inequalities simultaneously and optimize the objective.

Graphical solution
This method is used to solve LP models in case where only two variables are




                                                     om
involved. For more than two variables (multivariable) then the simplex
technique (algebraic method may be used).




                                                 i.c
Now in solving the problem above we first draw the axis, taking X1 to be the y
axis and X2 to be the X axis.
                                               ng
                                            si
                                      om

X1
                                om
                              as
                        .m

                  w

0
                                                    X2

Next we plot the scales on each axis to approximate the scales to use them, we
consider each constraint equation. We get the value of one of variables putting
the other variable to be zero and by substituting the inequality ≤or ≥ with
equality sign (=).

For:          0.5X1 + 0.33X2 ≤ 12
When          X1 = 0
       0.5(0) + 0.33X2 = 12
       0.33X2 = 12
       X2 = 12/0.33 = 36
Therefore point to plot is        (   36, 0)             … Implying that when
X2 = 36 then X1 = 0
                                      311
When X2 = 0
      0.5X1 + 0.33(0) = 12
      0.5X1 = 12
      X1 = 12/0.5 = 24
Therefore the point is (0, 24)

For   0.5X1 + 0.5X2 ≤ 14
When X1 = 0
      0.5(0) + 0.5X2 = 14
      0.5X2 = 14
      X2 = 14/0.5 = 28
Therefore the point is (28, 0)

When X2 = 0
      0.5X1 + 0.5(0) = 14
      0.5X1 = 14




                                                        om
      X1 = 14/0.5 = 28
Therefore the point is (0, 28)




                                                    i.c
Comparing these values we see that X2 ranges between 0 – 28, therefore we
can have the graph plotted as:
                                               ng
                                             si
                                       om
                                 om
                             as
                        .m
                     w
                  w
               w




Next draw each limitation (constraint) as separate line on the graph.
For 0.5X1 + 0.33X2 ≤ 12
The two points that represent this line are (36, 0) and (0, 24). This is plotted as
a straight line from 36 on X2 axis to 24 on X1 axis.




                                       312
Now including the Non-Negativity constraints since no negative product can be




                                                      om
produced;
X1 ≥ 0; x2 ≥ 0




                                                  i.c
                                              ng
                                            si
                                      om
                                om
                            as
                        .m
                     w
                  w
               w




We must now consider how to choose the production which will maximize
contribution. This we do by plotting a line representing the objective function
(4x1 + 3x2).
                                      313
First choose a convenient point inside the feasible region

                                   E.g. X2(10) +3X1 (20) = 40 +60
                                                    = Sh 100

All of the other product mixes that give a contribution of Sh.100 lies on the
line:

100 = 4X1 + 3X2 ........................................... (i)
<<This line is called a contribution line>>

Picking another point, say X2 =10 ad X1 = 20
Its contribution value is SH 110, thus give a contribution line of

110 = 4X1 + 3X2 ............................................. (ii)

Plotting these two contribution lines to our graph we get two parallel lines.




                                                                om
                                                           i.c
                                                      ng
                                                   si
                                            om
                                      om
                                 as
                            .m
                        w
                     w
                  w




Until we reach the last feasible solution(s) before the line moves entirely out of
the feasible region.




                                             314
                                                      om
                                                     i.c
                                              ng

Point X is the last feasible solution. Coordinates of this point give a
combination of the two lager‘s production volumes that fetches the highest
                                om



contribution.
Coordinates of point X can be read from the graph, but for precision they are
                            as




calculated by solving simultaneously the equations of the two lines that
intersect at point X.
                        .m




The two constraints are called binding or limiting constraints. They are the
resources being fully used thus preventing daily contribution from increasing
                     w




further.
                  w




Therefore to get point x we solve:
               w




                0.5X1 + 0.33X2 = 12…. (i)
                0.5X1 + 0.5X2 = 14 …. (ii)
Since X is the intersection of these two constraints, solving by deducting (i)
from (ii) we get
                0.17X2=2
                X2 =11.76

And substituting X2 = 11.76 to equation (i) we get
               X1 = 16.24

Therefore 11.76 units of Benko lager and 16.24 units of Benoni lager need to be
produced for maximum contribution.

               Contribution = 4(16.24) + 3(11.76) = 100.24

Requirements in linear programming
   Assumptions that are made to solve these types of problems are that:.
    Proportionality: all activities in linear programming problems are
      proportional to the level of decision variables.
    Divisibility: the solution to a linear programming problem does not have
      to be an integer but for strictly whole number solutions, use integer
      programming.
    Non-negativity: no decision variable can be negative.
    Additivity: the total of all activities in linear programming problems are
      assumed to equal to the sum of individual activities.

Special cases in linear programming
    Infeasibility: This is when all constraints don‘t satisfy a particular point
      thus there is no feasible solution.
    Redundancy: A constraint is considered redundant if it does not affect
      the feasible region. This happens in cases of excess resources since it
      does not limit attainment of the objective.




                                                       om
    Multiple optimal solutions: This occurs when the objective function has
      the same slope as a binding constraint.

Example
                                      om

A manufacturing company has acquired new machine for producing product P
at a rate of 25 units per hour with a 98% rate of efficiency. The company
                                om



requires producing at least 1800 units of P per day. The 10 old machines that
the company has produce 15 units of P with 95% efficiency.
The cost of operating the new machine is Sh. 4 per hour and Sh. 3 per hour for
                            as




the old ones. The cost incurred due to inefficiency is Sh. 2 per unit; It is
                        .m




government policy that at least 2 of the new machines must be indulged into
production.
                     w




The company wishes to optimally allocate the machines in order to minimize
                  w




the total manufacturing cost if the total available hours for production in a day
               w




are 8 hours.

Solution
In minimizing problems we use ≥ (greater or equal to) type inequality.

Step 1: Identifying variables.
Since the problem requires us to appropriately allocate the machines in order
to minimize the costs thus our variables are the new machines and the old
machines, we can let;
                X1 =new machines
                X2=old machines



Step 2: Identify objectives:
The objective is to minimize manufacturing costs.
                                      316
Total manufacturing cost per machine=Operating cost + (inefficiency rate ×
number of units × cost of loss)
Therefore cost for new machines
Cost = 4+ (0.02 × 25 × 2) = Sh. 5 per hour
                 =5 × 8= Sh. 40 per day]
Similarly for old machines
Cost = 3+ (0.05×15×2) = Sh. 4.5 per hour
                 =4.5×8=Sh. 36 per day
Therefore the objective function is to minimize 40X1 + 36X2
Step 3: Identifying constraint functions.
                 X1 ≤ 8
                 X2 ≤ 10
(25 × 8) X1 +(8 × 15) X2 ≥1800 (This can be simplified further as)
200 X1 +120 X2 ≥1800        (dividing through by 40)
5X1 +3 X2 ≥45
X1 ≥2
X1, X2 ≥0




                                                  om
Thus the LP model is:




                                                i.c
Minimize        40X1 + 36X2

                                    om

                X1, X2 ≥0
Plotting this on a graph we get:
                                   om

                                                         X1

                                    317
The line X1 ≥2 does not affect the feasible region (doesn‘t cause reduction of
the feasible region), this constraint doesn‘t limit attainment of the objective,
thus its known as a redundant constraint.
Now picking a convenient point inside the feasible region, say (6, 10)

We get a total cost of               600 = (6(40)+10(36))
Thus the objective function line of 40X1 + 36X2 = 600

Moving this line parallel toward the origin to locate the last apex before the
line completely fall off the feasible region, we get:




                                                      om
                                                  i.c

                            as
                        .m
                      w




Point X is the point of optimal solution
                  w




The binding constraints here are:
               w




                 X1 ≤ 8
And              5X1 +3 X2 ≥45
Solving this to get coordinates of point X
                 5X1 +3 X2 = 45 (when X1 = 8)
                 40 + 3 X2 = 45
                 X2 = 5/3
Thus the solution is         X1 = 8
                      X2 = 5/3

Shadow or dual prices
Definition: A shadow price or a dual price is the amount increase (or decrease)
of the objective function when one more (or one less) of the binding
constraints is made available.
Consider example 1.

Maximize 4X1 + 3 X2
                                       318
Subject to:     0.5X1 + 0.33X2 ≤ 12 (Machine hours)
                0.5X1 + 0.5X2 ≤ 14 (labor hours)
Starting with machine hours; let‘s assume that one more machine hour is
available (with labor hours remaining constant)
We get:
                0.5X1 + 0.33X2 = 13
                0.5X1 + 0.5X2 = 14
Solving this simultaneously we get the values of X1 and X2 as
                0.17 X2 = 1
                X2 = 5.88
                X1 = 22.12
Thus the contribution is
                4(22.12) + 3(5.88) = Sh.106.12
Comparing this with its original contribution of Sh.100.24 (see example 1) we
see increasing machine hours by one unit has increased contribution by
Sh.5.88, which is the shadow price per machine hour.
Note: This figure is also arrived at if we assume that machine hours are




                                                     om
reduced by 1 unit i.e. 12-1.
Similarly assuming that one more labor hour is made available, and then




                                                 i.c
contribution change is:
                0.5X1 + 0.33X2 = 12
                0.5X1 + 0.5X2 = 15
Solving this simultaneously gives:
                                             ng
                                           si
                0.17 X2 =3
                                     om

                X2 = 17.65
                X1 = 12.35
                               om



Which give a contribution of.
                4(12.35) + 3(17.65) = Sh.102.35
                           as




The contribution change is Sh.2.11 which is the shadow price per labor hour.
                       .m




Note:
                       w




The shadow prices apply in so far as the constraint is binding for example if
                  w




more and more labor hours are available it will reach a point where labor hours
               w




are no longer scarce thus labor hours cease to be a binding constraint and its
shadow price becomes a zero.(All non-binding constraints have zero shadow
price). Logically its senseless to pay more to increase a resource, which is
already abundant.

Interpretation of shadow prices
A shadow price of a binding constraint indicates to management how much
extra contribution will be gained by increasing a unit of the scarce resource.
In the example above Sh.2.11 is the shadow price for labor hours. This implies
that management is ready to pay up to Sh.2.11 extra per hour for the extra
hours i.e. say an employee is paid sh.5 per hour and one day he works for two
hours extra (overtime), the management is prepared to pay up to sh.7.11 per
hour for the two hours overtime worked.

Sensitivity Analysis


                                     319
Definition: Sensitivity analysis is the test of how certain changes in resources
affect the optimal solution.

In sensitivity analysis we consider the effect of additional limiting or non-
limiting constraints.
We already know that adding more non-limiting constraints does not change
the optimal solution.
We also know that adding more binding constraints affects the objective
function.
It is very important for the management to know how much of a limit resource
can be made available until it has no effect on the objective function (ie
ceases to be a binding resource)


SIMPLEX METHOD
When analyzing linear programming problems with three or more variables the
graphical method becomes enadequate, in such cases we employ simplex




                                                             om
method . Simplex method is an algebraic procedure for solving systems of
equations requiring optimization of the objective function..




                                                            i.c
This method can be applied to any number of variables, the more they are the
more complex it becomes to workout a solution on paper. Computer programs
                                                       ng
e.g. Tora are used to solve the most intricate problems.
The first step in simplex method is conversion of inequalities to linear

Consider the linear problem.

                   w




Solution.
                w




   1. To convert this problem to a system of linear equation, we introduce
       slack variables to each constraint.
                Z  45 x1  80 x2
       Subject to 5 x1  20 x2  x3  400
                10 x1  15 x2  x4  450
                     x1 , x2 , x3 , x4  0

Where the structural variables x3 and x4 are slack variables

    2. we then place this information in a tabular form known as a tableau
Initial tableau
Solutio         Products           Slack       Solutio
    n                           Variables         n

                                                 320

  x3        5        20        1       0       400
  x4       10        15        0       1       450
  Z        45        80        0       0        0

The tableau shows that
x3  400
x4  450
 Z 0         (Total contribution)
It also show that unused capacity is at maximum i.e. the value for the slack
 x3 and x4 is 0.
After several operations and when an optimal solution has been attained, these
values will change to give an optimal feasible solution.

    3. Select the column with the highest value of Z (i.e. 80), then devide the




                                                     om
        positive numbers in that column (i.e. the x 2 column) into the quantity
        column.
i.e. 400  20  20



                                                 i.c
      450 15  30
                                             ng
Chose the row giving the lowest result (in our case the row with x 3 gives 20)
                                           si
and mark the element falling on the intersection of the selected row and
                                     om

selected column (i.e. 20: selected element)
                               om



   4. Divide all the elements in the selected row by the value of the selected
       and change the solution variable to the heading of the identified column
                           as




       (from x3 to x2)
                         .m




   Thus the tableau will appear as follows.

                w




   e                                              y
   x2        1

                        1       1
                               20

  x4       10        15        0       1       450
  Z        45        80        0       0        0

   5. Next we conduct row operations that aim to reduce elements falling in
      the same column as the previously marked element to zero. These row
      operations may sometime necessitate multiplying or dividing the
      selected row with an arbitrary number.

   Therefore:
            Row 2 – 15×Row 1




                                     321
              x4 10 15 0 1  450
          
   15        x2 154 15 15
                        20 0  300
   new   x4 6 14 0* 43 1  150
   Note that the aim was to attain the zero.

              Z 45 80 0 0     0
          
   80        x2 20 80 4 0  1600
   new        Z    25 0*    4 0  1600

   On replacing the new rows to the tableau we get
   2nd tableau.

                                                         ng
   Since in the Z row under products column we still have values greater than
                                                        si
   zero, we conduct another operation.
                                                    om


   Taking the column with a Z value of 25, we repeat the process in the same
                                              om



   manner.
        20  14  80
                                             as




          150  6 14  24
                                 .m




   Thus we pick the x4 row and mark the element 6 14 , the row solution
                            w




   variable is changed to x1 and we divide the row by 6 14 to convert the
                       w
                       w




   marked element to 1.

                                                 25   = 24

   This is the final tableau since the Z row has no values greater than zero thus
   we have the optimal solution.

       to maximize Z we need to produce 24 units x2 and 24 units of x1, we
         obtain these values from the solutions quantity column
                          Thus, Z = 24(45) + 24(80) = 3000

        We have zero slack (unused quantities of constraints).

Solution.
Table 1:
                            as




Objective value, is the solution to objective function (e.g. the solution to this
                        .m




example is 71,436)
The four columns of table 1 are to be interpreted as follows;
                     w




    Variable: these are the variables of the model. In our example we have
                  w




       x1 = Xtragrow, x2 = Young row and x3 = Zupergrow
               w




    Value: this is value that the variables assume at optimal solution (to
       optimize the objective function one needs to produce this amounts of
       the variables). In our example we are required to produce 1,666.67 of x1
       and 1,750 of x2 and none of x3
    Objective coefficient: these are the coefficients of the objective
       function
    Objective value contribution: this is the value contributed by each
       variable to the objective function (for x1=25×1,666.67), the total of this
       is equal to our objective value (i.e. 41,666.67+35,000=76,666.67).

The 3 columns of the second part of table1 can be interpreted as follows;
   Constraints: this is constraints of the model representing the limited
      resources.
   RHS: the Right hand side value is the limiting value of the constraint.
       E.g. for the first constraint the maximum amount of material A is 500
      tons.
                                      324
      Slack/surplus: at optimal production not all the materials for some of
       the constraints will be fully utilized, slack is the amount of material that
       is left over after production. For constraint 1 and 4 no material
       remained, this also implies that these are the binding constraints i.e.
       their adjustment directly affects the objective solution



Sensitivity Analysis
This is the analysis of the effect of adjusting variables or constraint, whether
the objective solution will be affected. How much of the objective coefficient
(or the maximum available amount of a constraint) can be reduced or
increased without affecting the objective solution.
The columns of this table can be interpreted as follows;
    Variable: as explained above
    Current objective coefficient: this is the value of coefficients of the
        objective function




                                                        om
    Minimum objective coefficient: this is how low the coefficient can be
        reduced without affecting the optimal basis. The coefficient for x1 can




                                                    i.c
        be reduced from 25 to 13.50 (the prize for Xtragrow fall to as low as
                                               ng
        $13.50 from $25) but the optimal solution will remain the same
                                             si
   Maximum objective coefficient: this is how high the coefficient can be
                                       om

      increased without affecting the optimal basis
                                 om



   Reduced cost: this is amount by which the coefficient of the variable has to
      be adjusted with for it to become a basic variable (included to the
                             as




      objective optimal solution). X1 and x2 have 0 reduced costs implying
      that they already make part of the optimal solution, x3 will require to
                        .m




      be increased by 7.67 for it to make part of the basic variable.
                     w
                  w
               w




The second part of the table is interpreted as follows;
    Constraints: as described above
    Current Right Hand Side: the limiting value of the constraint. E.g. for
      the first constraint the maximum amount of material A is 500 tons.
    Minimum RHS: the lowest the available amount of the constraint can be
      reduced without affecting the optimal basis
    Maximum RHS: the highest the available amount of the constraint can
      be increased without affecting the optimal solution
    Dual price: this is amount increase to the objective contribution due to a
      unit increase of the available constraint. Since there is only 500 tons of
      material A, if management decides to increase it by a unit to 501tons
      then the objective optimal solution will be 76,666.67+83.33.

QUESTION ONE
Regal Investments has just received instructions from a client to invest in two
shares; one an airline share, the other an insurance share. The total maximum
appreciation in share value over the next year is to be maximized subject to
the following restrictions:
-      the total investment shall not exceed Sh.100,000
-      at most Sh.40,000 is to be invested in the insurance shares
-      quarterly dividends must total at least Sh.2,600

The airline share is currently selling for Sh.40 per share and its quarterly
dividend is Sh.1per share. The insurance share is currently selling for Sh.50 per
share and the quarterly dividend is Sh.1.50 per share. Regal‘s analysts predict
that over the next year, the value of the airline share will increase by Sh.2 per
share and the value of the insurance share will increase by Sh.3 per share.
