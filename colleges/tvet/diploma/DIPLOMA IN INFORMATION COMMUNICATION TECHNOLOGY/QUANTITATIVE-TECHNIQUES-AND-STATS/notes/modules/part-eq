Let X1 and X2 be any two samples whose sizes are n1 and n2 and mean X 1
and X 2. Standard deviation S1 and S2 respectively. In order to test the
difference between the two sample means, we apply the following formulas

        Z      =                                      

Example 1
An agronomist was interested in the particular fertilizer yield output. He
planted maize on 50 equal pieces of land and the mean harvest obtained
later was 60 bags per plot with a standard deviation of 1.5 bags. The crops
grew under natural circumstances and conditions without the soil being
treated with any fertilizer. The same agronomist carried out an alternative
experiment where he picked 60 plots in the same area and planted the
same plant of maize but a fertilizer was applied on these plots. After the
harvest it was established that the mean harvest was 63 bags per plot with
