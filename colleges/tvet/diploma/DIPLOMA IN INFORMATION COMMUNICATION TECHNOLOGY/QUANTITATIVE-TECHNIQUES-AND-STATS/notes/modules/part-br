Q1 =size of N/4th observation = 100/4 =25th observation
Hence q1 lies in the class 40-50
Q1= L+ i/f (m-c)

   = 40 +10/18(25-12)
   = 40 + 7.22 = 47.22
   = 47.22


D4 = L+ i/f (m-c)
   = 50 +10/30 (40-30)
   = 50 + 3.33
   = 53.33

   56
Thus 40 percent of the companies earn an annual profit of kshs.53.33 or
less

P80 = size of 80/100 the observation = 80 the observation
P80 lies in the class 70-80
P80 = L+ i/f (m-c)
       = 70 + 10/10(80-75)
       = 70 +5
       = 75
This means that 80 percent of the companies earn an annual profit of
kshs.75 or less
20 percent of the companies earn an annual profit of more than kshs. 75

Mode
This is one of the measures of central tendency. The mode is defined as a




                                                         om
value within a frequency distribution which has the highest frequency.
Sometimes a single value may not exist as such in which case we may refer




                                                     i.c
to the class with the highest frequency. Such a class is known as a modal
class
                                                ng
The mode is a very important statistical value in business activities quite
                                              si
often business firms tend to stock specific items which are heavily on
                                        om

demand e.g. footwear, clothes, construction materials (beams, wires, iron
sheets e.t.c.
                                  om



The mode can easily be determined form ungrouped data by arranging the
figures given and determining the one with the highest frequency.
When determining the values of the mode from the grouped data we may
                              as




use the following methods;-
                         .m




i. The graphical method which involves use of the histogram
ii. The computation method which involves use of formula

In a social survey in which the main purpose was to establish the
intelligence quotient (IQ) of resident in a given area, the following results
were obtained as tabulated below:
