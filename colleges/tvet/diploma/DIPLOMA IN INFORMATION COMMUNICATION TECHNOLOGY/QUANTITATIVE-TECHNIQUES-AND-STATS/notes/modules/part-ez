        t0.05(36) = 1.9 (Since d.f > 30 we use the normal tables)

The table value of t at 5% level of significance for 36 d.f. when d.f. >30,
that t distribution is the same as normal distribution is 1.9. Since the value
computed value of t is more than the table value, we reject the null
hypothesis. Thus, we conclude that there is significant difference in the
average sales between the two salesmen



Testing the hypothesis equality of two variances
The test for equality of two population variances is based on the variances
in two independently selected random samples drawn from two normal
populations

Under the null hypothesis σ12  σ 22
               s12
               σ 12
        F=                   Now under the H0 : σ12  σ 22 it follows that
               s 22
               σ 22
              S12
        F=        which is the test statistic.
              S22
Which follows F – distribution with V1 and V2 degrees of freedom. The larger
sample variance is placed in the numerator and the smaller one in the
denominator
If the computed value of F exceeds the table value of F, we reject the null
hypothesis i.e. the alternate hypothesis is accepted

                                                   om

Given that n1 = 10, n2 = 12, Σ(x1 – X 1 )2 = 120
       Σ(x2 – X 2 )2 = 314
                                                  om
