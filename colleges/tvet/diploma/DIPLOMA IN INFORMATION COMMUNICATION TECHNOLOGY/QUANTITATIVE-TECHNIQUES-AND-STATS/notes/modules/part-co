              more than 3. thus frequency distributions with a value of more
              than 3 are definitely leptokurtic

              curve similar to that of the normal distribution. Such
              frequency distributions are referred to as mesokurtic. The

      c)      When the frequency curve contacted produces a peak which is
              lower that that of a normal distribution when such a curve is

              said to be platykurtic. The coefficient of such is usually less
              than 3

         The commonly used measure of kurtosis is the percentile

         coefficient of kurtosis. This coefficient is normally determined
         using the following equation
