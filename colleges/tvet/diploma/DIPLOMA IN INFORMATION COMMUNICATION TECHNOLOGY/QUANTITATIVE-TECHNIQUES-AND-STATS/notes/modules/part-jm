Solution:
1.     Formulating a linear programming model

Step 1: Identifying variables:
The variables here are the number of units of Benko and Benoni lager produced
by Long castling breweries per day; we can represent them as:
                                       X1= a unit of Benko lager.
                                       X2= a unit of Benoni lager.

Step 2: Identify the objective:

Definition: An objective is the desired result i.e. optimization of a function
dependent on decision variable and subject to some constraints.

The objective of Long Castling Breweries is to maximize daily contribution.
Objective function is the formula that will give us the total contribution in a
day for both Benko lager and Benoni lager.

Limitations must be quantified mathematically and they must be linear.
