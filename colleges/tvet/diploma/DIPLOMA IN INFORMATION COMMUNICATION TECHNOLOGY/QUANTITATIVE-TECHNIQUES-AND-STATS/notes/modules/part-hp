QUESTION SEVEN
a) The following table shows the Fixed Cost (F) and the variable cost (V) of
   producing 1 unit of X and 1 unit of Y:




                                                         om
                                   Product




                                                     i.c
                         X           Y
    Cost F               5           8     (Shs ‗000‘)
    Cost V               4          12          ng
                                                si
                                        om

When x units of X and y units of Y are produced, the total fixed cost is
                                  om



Shs.640,000 and total variable cost is Shs.820,000. Express this information as
a matrix equation and hence find the quantities of x and y produced using
matrix algebra.                         (10 marks)

The marginal productivity of an industrial operation (the production of electric
furnaces) is given by:
                      w




                     f  x   60  10
                   w




                               x2
               w




Where x is capitalization in millions of shillings. Given that, when the
capitalization is Shs. Million they can produce 62 of the furnaces per week.

Required:
a) How many furnaces they will be able to produce if their capitalization
   increased to Shs 10 million.
b) What does the term marginal of productivity mean?

Specific objectives
At the end of this topic the trainee should be able to:
     Describe networks and need for the analysis;
     Construct project networks;
     Determine the critical path;
     Apply network analysis to decision problems.

INTRODUCTION
This is a system of interrelationship between jobs and tasks for planning and
control of resources of a project by identifying critical path of the project.

Terminology
Activity. Task or job of work, which takes time and resources e.g building a
