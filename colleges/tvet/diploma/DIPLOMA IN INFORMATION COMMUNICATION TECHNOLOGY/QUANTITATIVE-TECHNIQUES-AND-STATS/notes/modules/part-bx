Calculate the range and coefficient of range.
Solution
Range =L-S
L=250
S= 160
Range =250-160
       = 90
Coefficient of range = L-S =   250-160 = 90 = 0.219
                        L+S           250+ 160         410
 Merits of range
    It is the simplest to understand and easiest to compute
    It takes minimum time to calculate the value of range

                                                        om
    Range is not based on each and every observation of the distribution
    It is subject to fluctuation of considerable magnitude from sample to

    Range cannot be computed in case of open –end distribution
    Range cannot tell us anything about the character of the distribution

Uses of range
   1. Quality control; the objective of quality control is to keep a check on
                                 om



      the quality of the products without 100% inspection control charts
      are prepared.
                             as




   2. fluctuation in the shares price; range is useful in studying the
      variation in the prices in stocks and shares and other commodities
                         .m




   3. Weather forecast; the meteorological department does make use of
                      w




      the range in determining the difference between the minimum
      temperature and maximum temperature.

(b) Mean Deviation
This is a useful measure of dispersion because it makes use of all the values
given. The average deviation is obtained by calculating the absolute
deviation of each observation from median (or mean) and then averaging
this deviation by taking their arithmetic mean. The formula for average
deviation may be written as;
A.D = ∑ /x – med/
             N
Incase deviation are taken from mean the formula shall be written as;
A.D x = ∑ /x - x/
              N
Computation of average deviation
The formula for computing average deviation is
A.D (med) = ∑ /x – med/
   65
                   N
If average deviation is small the distribution is highly compact or uniform
since more than half of the cases are concentrated within a small range
around the mean.
The relative measure corresponding to the average deviation called the
coefficient of average deviation is obtained by dividing average by the
measure of central tendency used, i.e. mean or median.
