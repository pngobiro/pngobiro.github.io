SKEWNESS
   - This is a concept which is commonly used in statistical decision
     making. It refers to the degree in which a given frequency curve is
     deviating away from the normal distribution
     - There are 2 types of skew ness namely
        i.     Positive skew ness
        ii.    Negative skew ness

    1. Positive Skewness
       - This is the tendency of a given frequency curve leaning towards
          the left. In a positively skewed distribution, the long tail
          extended to the right.

In this distribution one should note the following
    i.     The mean is usually bigger than the mode and median
    ii.    The median always occurs between the mode and mean
    iii.   There are more observations below the mean than above the
           mean
This frequency distribution as represented in the skewed distribution curve
is characteristic of the age distributions in the developing countries
