Statistics viewed as a subject is a process of collecting, tabulating and




                                                        om
analyzing numerical data upon which significant conclusions are drawn.
Statistics may also be defined as numerical data, which has been, collected




                                                    i.c
from a given source and for a particular purpose e.g. population statistics

                                                ng
from the ministry of planning, Agricultural statistics from the ministry of
Agriculture
                                             si
Statistics may also refer to the values, which have been obtained from
                                       om

statistical calculations e.g. the mean, mode, range e.t.c.
                                  om



 b) Application of statistics
1. Quality Control
