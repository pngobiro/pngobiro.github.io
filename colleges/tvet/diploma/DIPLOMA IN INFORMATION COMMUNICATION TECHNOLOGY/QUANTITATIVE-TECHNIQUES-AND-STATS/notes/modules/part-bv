                 MEASUREMENT OF VARIATION /DISPERSION

Specific objectives
At the end of this topic, the trainee should be able to:-
     State the characteristics of a good measure of dispersion.
     Differentiate between the absolute and relative measures.
     Calculate and interpret the measures of dispersion.

Introduction
Measures of variation help us in studying the important characteristics of a
distribution. The measures of dispersion are very useful in statistical work
because they indicate whether the rest of the data are scattered around
the mean or away from the mean. If the data is approximately dispersed
around the mean then the measure of dispersion obtained will be small




                                                         om
therefore indicating that the mean is a good representative of the sample
data. But on the other hand, if the figures are not closely located to the




                                                     i.c
mean then the measures of dispersion obtained will be relatively big

                                                 ng
indicating that the mean does not represent the data sufficiently.

Significance of measuring variation or dispersion

   i)     to determine the reliability of an average
   ii)    to serve as a basis for the control of the variability
                                   om



   iii)   to compare two or more series with regard to their variability
   iv)    to facilitate the use of other statistical measures

Property of a good measure of variation/dispersion.
A good measure of variation should possess as far as possible
