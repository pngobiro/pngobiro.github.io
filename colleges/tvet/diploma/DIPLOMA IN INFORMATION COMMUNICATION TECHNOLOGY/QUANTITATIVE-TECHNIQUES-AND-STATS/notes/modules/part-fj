period of time are called time series. The analysis of this data is a complex
problem as many variable factors may influence the

changes. The first step is to plot the observations on a scattergraph, which

differs from those scattergraphs we have considered previously as the
points are evenly spaced on the time axis in the order in which they are

observed, and the time variable is always the independent Variable. This
scattergraph gives us a good visual guide to the actual changes, but is of
very little help in showing the component factors causing these changes or
                              as




in predicting future movements of the dependent variable.

Statisticians have constructed a number of mathematical models to
describe the behavior of time series, and several of these will be discussed

 COMPONENTS OF A TIME SERIES
These mathematical models assume that the changes are caused by the
variation of four main factors; they differ in the relationship between these
factors. It will be easier to understand the theory in detail if we relate it to
a simple time series so that we can see the calculations necessary at each
stage. Consider a factory employing a number of people in producing a
particular commodity, say thermometers. Naturally, at such a factory
during the course of a year some employees will be absent for various
reasons. The following table shows the number of days lost through sickness
over a five-year period. Each year has been broken down into four quarters
of three months. We have assumed that the number of employees at the
factory remained constant over the five years.
