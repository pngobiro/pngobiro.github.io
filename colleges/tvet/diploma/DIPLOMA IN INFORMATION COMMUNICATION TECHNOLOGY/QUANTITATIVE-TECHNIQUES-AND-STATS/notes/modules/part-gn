2x + x = 3x when substituted into condition (i), we therefore need extra
condition x + y + z = 1 to solve the problem.
                             .m




       Thus          x+x+x=1
                          w




           Or            3x = 1
                         w
                     w




           That is       x= 1
                                3

           Leading to    x=1 ,            y=1 ,         z= 1

e). In proportion terms this solution means that P, Q, and R will in the long
    term each have one third of the total customers

Example 4
There are three types of breakfast meal available in supermarkets known as
brand BM1, brand BM2 and Brand BM3. In order to assess the market, a
survey was carried out by one of the manufacturers. After the first month,
the survey revealed that 20% of the customers purchasing brand BM1
switched to BM2 and 10% of the customers purchasing brand BM1 switched
to BM3. similarly, after the first month of the customers purchasing brand
     210
BM2, 25% switched to BM1 and 10% switched to BM3 and of the customers
purchasing brand BM3 0.05% switched to BM1 and 15% switched to BM2

Required
i.           Display in a matrix S, the patterns of retention and transfers of
             customers from the first to the second month, expressing percentage
             in decimal form.            (2marks)
ii.          Multiply matrix S by itself (that is form S2)                    (5
             Marks)
iii.         Interpret the results you obtain in part ii with regard to customer
             brand loyalty (3 marks)

Solution
The objective of the first part of the question was to test the candidate‘s
ability to formulate and manipulate a matrix, then interpret the result of

 (The second element in the first row shows the 20% movement from BM1 to
BM2 and so on)
