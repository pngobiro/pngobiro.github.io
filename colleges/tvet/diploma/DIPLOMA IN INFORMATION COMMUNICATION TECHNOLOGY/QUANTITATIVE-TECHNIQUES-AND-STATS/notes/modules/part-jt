   1. To convert this problem to a system of linear equation, we introduce
       slack variables to each constraint.
                Z  45 x1  80 x2
       Subject to 5 x1  20 x2  x3  400
                10 x1  15 x2  x4  450
                     x1 , x2 , x3 , x4  0

Where the structural variables x3 and x4 are slack variables

    2. we then place this information in a tabular form known as a tableau
Initial tableau
Solutio         Products           Slack       Solutio
    n                           Variables         n
Variabl       x1        x2      x3       x4   Quantit

                                                 320
  e                                             y
  x3        5        20        1       0       400
  x4       10        15        0       1       450
  Z        45        80        0       0        0

The tableau shows that
x3  400
x4  450
 Z 0         (Total contribution)
It also show that unused capacity is at maximum i.e. the value for the slack
 x3 and x4 is 0.
After several operations and when an optimal solution has been attained, these
values will change to give an optimal feasible solution.

    3. Select the column with the highest value of Z (i.e. 80), then devide the




                                                     om
        positive numbers in that column (i.e. the x 2 column) into the quantity
        column.
i.e. 400  20  20



                                                 i.c
      450 15  30
                                             ng
Chose the row giving the lowest result (in our case the row with x 3 gives 20)
                                           si
and mark the element falling on the intersection of the selected row and
                                     om

selected column (i.e. 20: selected element)
                               om



   4. Divide all the elements in the selected row by the value of the selected
       and change the solution variable to the heading of the identified column
                           as




       (from x3 to x2)
                         .m
