Computation
                                           as




The formula used is
                                  .m




           Media= L +i⁄f{m-c}
Where L = Lower class boundary of the class containing the median
                             w
                          w




           m = (n/2)th or (n+1/2)th
                      w




           c= Cumulative frequency of the class before that containing the
median.
           f = Frequency of the class containing the median


                 Media= L +i⁄f{m-c}
                          73.5 - 56
                 = 60 +               × 20
                             48
                 = 60 + 7.29
                 = 67.29

Merits of median
    It is not influenced by the presence extreme values
    The sum of the deviation of observation from median is minimum
    It shows the centre of a given set of data
    Knowledge of the determination of the median may be extended to
       determine the quartiles
    The median can easily be defined
    It can be obtained easily from the cumulative frequency curve
    It can be used in determining the degrees of skewness

Limitation
    Its value is not determined by each and every observation.
    Median is not capable of algebraic treatment.
    Median is less reliable.
    It is affected by sampling fluctuation.




                                                      om
    In some situations where the no. of observations is even, the value of
      the median obtained is usually imaginary.




                                                  i.c
    The computation of the median using the formulas is not well
      understood by most businessmen.
                                              ng
    In business environment the median has got very few applications.

 Quartiles, Deciles, Percentiles
The procedure for computing quartiles deciles etc is the same as for median
For grouped data the following formula are used for quartiles, deciles and
                                  om



percentiles:
