Arranging the observed frequencies with their corresponding frequencies in
the following table we get

The calculated value of χ2 is less than the table value. The hypothesis is
accepted. Hence the drug is not effective in curing the disease.

Test of homogeneity
It is concerned with the proposition that several populations are
homogenous with respect to some characteristic of interest e.g. one may be
interested in knowing if raw material available from several retailers are
homogenous. A random sample is drawn from each of the population and
the number in each of sample falling into each category is determined. The
sample data is displayed in a contingency table
The analytical procedure is the same as that discussed for the test of
independence

groups and each person was asked to specify which types of TV programs be
