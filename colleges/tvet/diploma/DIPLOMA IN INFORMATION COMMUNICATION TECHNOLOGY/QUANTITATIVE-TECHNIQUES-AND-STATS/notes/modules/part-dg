We assume that errors or residuals are negligible.
                   w




In order to choose between the models we examine the values of the
                w




multiple correlation coefficient r and the standard deviation of the
residuals α.
A model which describes well the relationship between y and x‘s has
multiple correlation coefficient r close to ±1 and the value of α which is
small.




Example
Odino chemicals limited are aware that its power costs are semi variable
cost and over the last six months these costs have shown the following
relationship with a standard measure of output.

         measured by the number of the month) the following least
         squares regression equation is obtained
