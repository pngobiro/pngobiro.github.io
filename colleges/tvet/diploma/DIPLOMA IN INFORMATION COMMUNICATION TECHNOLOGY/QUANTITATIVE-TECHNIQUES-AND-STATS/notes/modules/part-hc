Differentiation of an implicit function
                                              om

An Implicit function is one of the y = x2 y + 3x2 + 50. it is a function in which
the dependent variable (y) appears also on the right hand side.
                                             om



To differentiate the above equation we use the differentiation method for a
product, quotient or function of a function.

Partial derivatives
These derivatives are used when we want to investigate the effect of one
independent variable on the dependent variable.
For example, the revenues of a farmer may depend on two variables namely;
the amount of fertilizer applied and also the type of the natural soil.
Let ㄫ = 30x2y + y2 + 50x + 60y




                                                          om
