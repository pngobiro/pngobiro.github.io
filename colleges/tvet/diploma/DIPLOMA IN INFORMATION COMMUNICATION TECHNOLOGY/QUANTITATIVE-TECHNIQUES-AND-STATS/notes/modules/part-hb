                  8. Chain Rule
This rule is generally applied in the determination of the derivatives of
composite functions, which can be defined as a function in which another
function can be considered to have taken the place of the independent
variable. The composite function is also referred to as a function of a function.
It is normally of the form y = (2x2 + 3)3. If we let u = (2x2 + 3), then y = u3.
In order to differentiate such an equation we use the formula
       dy        dy       du
                     
       dx        du       dx




                                                                           om
Solution




                                                                          i.c
             y = (2x2 + 3)3
Let u = 2x2 + 3
                                                                     ng
                                                                     si
∴      du = 2x
                                                               om

       dx
                                                     om



Let y = u3
                                               as




       dy
∴            = 3u2
       du
                                     .m
                                 w




       dy =       dy . du = 3u2 x 4x = 12xu2
                           w




       dx         du dx
                      w




                  = 12x(2x2 + 3)2

Example
Consider the function
             y = (x2 + 16x + 5)2
which can be decomposed into
y = u2 and u = x2 + 16x + 5. in this case y is a function of (x2 + 16x + 5)
Hence y = f(u) and u = g(x)
       dy =       dy . du
       dx         du dx
       = (2u) (2x +16)

                                                               228
         = 2 (x2 + 16x + 5) (2x + 16)

       The derivative of a function raised to power r; the composite function
       rule.
The derivative of a function raised to power r equals to the power r times the
function which is raised by power (r-1), all of which is multiplied by the
derivative of the function

         If y = [g(x)]r

         Then dy = r[g(x)]r-1 . g´(x)
              dx

For example
             given y   3 x 2  4 x 
          dy                           5
