Weighed aggregate method
                   w




An index is called a weighed aggregate index when it is constructed fro an
                w




aggregate of items (price) that have been weighed.
Some important formulae of construction a weighed aggregate index are
   i)     Laspeyres Method
   ii)    Paasche Method
   iii)   Fishers Ideal Method
   iv)    Marshall – Edgeworth

Laspeyres method
In this method the base year‘s quantities are taken as weights. The formula
for constructing index is
P01 =       ∑ p1q0 x 100
                ∑ p0q0

Paasche method
  179
In this method the current year quantities are taken as the formula for
constructing index is
 P01 = ∑ p1q1 x 100
         ∑ p0q1




Fischer‘s ideal method
Prof Fischer has given a number of formulas for constructing index numbers

P01 =    √    ∑ p1q0      x   ∑ p1q1 x 100
              ∑ p0q0            ∑ p0q1               or




                                                       om
                                                   i.c
 po1 = √ (L*P)                                 ng
                                            si
                                       om
                                 om



Marshall Edge Worth Method
In this method also the current year as well as base year and quantities are
considered
                              as




        P01= ∑ (q0 + q1) p1 x 100
                        .m




              ∑ (q0 + q1) p0
                       w
                   w
                 w




INDEX NUMBERS APPLICATION

The index of industrial production
It is a quantity index compiled by the government. It measures changes in
the volume of production in major industries. The index is a good indication
of the state of national economy.
It covers the following major industries in the UK
    i.     Mining and quarrying
    ii.    Manufacturing such as food, drinks and tobacco, chemicals, metal
           manufacture, engineering e.t.c
    iii.   Textile
    iv.    Construction
    v.     Gas electricity, water e.t.c


  180
It excludes agriculture, fishing, trade, transport, finance and other such
industries.
