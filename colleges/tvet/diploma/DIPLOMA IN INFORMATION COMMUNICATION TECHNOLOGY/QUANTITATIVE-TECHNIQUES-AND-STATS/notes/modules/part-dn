Example:
In a competitive examination, 30 candidates are to be selected. In all 600
candidates appear in a written test, and 100 will be called for the
interview.
(i)    What is the probability that a person will be called for the interview?
(ii)   Determine the probability of a person getting selected if he has been
       called for the interview?
(iii) Probability that person is called for the interview and is selected?

Solution:
Let event A be that the person is called for the interview and event B that
he is selected.

Example:
From past experience a machine is known to be set up correctly on 90% of
occasions. If the machine is set up correctly then 95% of good parts are
expected but if the machine is not set up correctly then the probability of a
good part is only 30%.
On a particular day the machine is set up and the first component produced
and found to be good. What is the probability that the machine is set up
