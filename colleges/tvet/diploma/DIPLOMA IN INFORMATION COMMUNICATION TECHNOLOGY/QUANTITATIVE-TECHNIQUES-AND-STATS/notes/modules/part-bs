               f1  f 0     
Mode = L +                   ×c
            2f1  f 0  f 2 
Where L = Lower class boundary of the class containing the mode
       f0 = Frequency of the class below the modal class
       f1 = Frequency of the class containing the mode
       f2 = frequency of the class above the modal class
       c = Class interval
                           48 - 32  
Therefore Mode = 60.50 +                      × 20
                          2  48  - 32 - 27 

                      = 69.14

Merits of mode
    Mode is not affected by extreme values.
    At can be easily used to decide qualitative phenomenon.
    Mode happens to be meaningful as an average.
    It can be determined from incomplete data provided the
       observations with the highest frequency are already known.
    The mode has several applications in business.
    The mode can be easily defined.
    It can be determined easily from a graph.


Limitation of mode
    Mode cannot always be computed
    If the data is quite large and ungrouped, determination of the mode




                                                                  om
      can be quite cumbersome
    Use of the formula to calculate the mode is unfamiliar to most

    The mode may sometimes be non existent or there may be two
