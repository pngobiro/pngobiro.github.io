POISSON PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
This is a set of probabilities which is obtained for discrete events which are
described as being rare. Occasions similar to binominal distribution but
have very low probabilities and large sample size.

Examples of such events in business are as follows:
   i.       Telephone congestion at midnight
   ii.      Traffic jams at certain roads at 9 o‘clock at night
   iii.     Sales boom
   iv.      Attaining an age of 100 years (Centureon)
Poisson probabilities are frequently applied in business situations in order
to determine the numerical probabilities of such events occurring.
The formula used to determine such probabilities is as follows




                                                          om

Example 1
A manufacturer assures his customers that the probability of having
                                    om



defective item is 0.005. A sample of 1000 items was inspected. Find the
probabilities of having the following possible outcomes
                                as




   i.      Only one is defective
                            .m




   ii.     At most 2 defective
   iii.    More than 3 defective
