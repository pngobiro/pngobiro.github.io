QUESTION THREE
A tea blender uses two types of tea, T1, and T2, to produce two blends, B1 and
B2 for sale. B1 uses 40% of available T1 and 60% of the available T2 whilst B2
uses 50% of the available T1 and 25% of the available T2.

Required:
a) Given that t1 kilos of T1 and t2 of T2 are made available to produce b1 kilos
   of B1 and b2 kilos of B2. Express the blending operation in the matrix
   format.

b) If 400 kilos of T1 and 700 kilos of T2 were made available for blending, what
   quantities of B1 and B2 would be produced?

c) If 600 kilos of B1 and 450 kilos of B2 were produced, use a matrix method to
   determine what quantities of T1 and T2 would be used to produce the
   blends.
