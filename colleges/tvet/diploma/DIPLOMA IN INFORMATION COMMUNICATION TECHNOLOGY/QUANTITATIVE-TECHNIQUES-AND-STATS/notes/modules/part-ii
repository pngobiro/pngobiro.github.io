£200, therefore the economic order quantity is 200 units.
The same information is graphed in Figure 1 above, showing that the economic
order quantity (EOQ) is the point where ordering and holding costs are equal,
                                 om



and total £200.
                             as




As costs of ordering and holding stock are equal at the EOQ point, we can build a
                         .m




simple mathematical model to solve the problem, as follows:
                     w




Q X H        =       A X P
                     w




2                    Q
                 w




Where Q      =       EOQ
      H      =       holding cost per unit
      A      =       annual demand
      P      =       cost of placing an order

                     2 AP
       finally Q =
                       H
Using the data in the previous example:
                 2 x 20,000 x 1
       EOQ =
                        1

  = 40,000
   = 200

                                       270
Although the model assumes that holding and ordering costs are fixed, this
simplification is acceptable given a relatively unchanging level of production
activity. In addition, because the total cost curve in the Figure 1 is relatively
flat either side of the EOQ, minor errors and approximation in the variables used
in the calculation may not affect the end result significantly.

Practical constraints on the use of the model include restrictions on the available
storage space, the availability of quantity discounts (though the model can be
modified in this respect), the seasonal nature of supplies, the shelf-life of
products and delivery schedules imposed by suppliers.


WHEN TO ORDER
If deliveries from suppliers normally take two weeks to arrive, then
replenishment orders should be placed with them when the level of stocks
represents two weeks' supply. For example, if usage is 200 units a week, an




                                                        om
order (the EOQ) will be placed when the stock level falls to 400 units. Figure
6(a) illustrates that, with certain knowledge of usage and lead time, delivery




                                                    i.c
takes place just as stock is exhausted.
