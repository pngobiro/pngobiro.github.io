        3             1001 — 1,500                      Shs 80
        4             over — 1,500                      Shs 70

The best approach to the solution in this case is to apply the price-breaks
theorem. This works as follows:

1.      For each segment an EOQ is calculated. There are two possible requests:




                                                         om
        i.      The EOQ is within the quantity segment (i.e. valid)
                In this case, the EOQ is used as the minimum cost quantity for that
segment.



                                                     i.c
        ii.
                                                 ng
                The EOQ is outside the quantity segment (i.e. invalid)
                In this case the minimum cost quantity will be the quantity within
                                               si
                the segment closest to the EOQ as calculated.
                                        om


2.    Select the quantity that leads to the lowest total inventory costs (i.e.
                                   om



Purchase, Ordering & Carrying).
                               as




Illustration:
                          .m




1.      Assume a manufacturer uses 3,300 drums of a certain chemical per year.
2.      Assume delivery costs incurred per order are Shs 40 and inventory carrying
                       w




        costs are estimated to be 30% of stock value.
                    w




3.      Assume the normal cost per drum is Shs 22 but the supplier offers discount
                 w




        of 1.5% on orders for 500 drums or more, and 3% on orders for 1,000
        drums or more.

Required:
Determine the order quantity the manufacturer should adopt to minimize total
costs.

Solution:
Note:
There are 3 discount levels (0, 1.5% & 3%) and hence 3 segments.


STEPS
1.    Calculating the EOQ for each segment.

                                         282
a.   For Segment 1               (0 - 499 drums)
      C = Shs 22

     EOQ       =        200 drums
                         7
                   2 x 3,300 x 40
     EOQ =
                      0.3 (22)




                   264,000
         =                 =     40,000
                     6.6

                       = 200
