Modern management accounting systems are now placing greater emphasis on
providing information on suppliers relialibility set up times cycle times,
percentage of deliveries that are on time and defect rates
All these measures are critical in supporting JIT manufacturing philosophy.



FINANCIAL MANAGER'S ROLE IN INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
The techniques of inventory management, discussed above are very useful in
determining the optimum level of inventory and finding answers to the problems
of the economic order quantity, the re-order point and the safety stock. The
techniques are very essential to economize the use of resources by minimizing
                                     305
the total inventory cost. Although out treatment of inventory management has
been simple, it indicates the broad framework of managing inventories. Many
sophisticated techniques have been evolved to handle inventory management
problems more efficiently and effectively and the improvements are still
continuing.     For the majority of the companies, inventory represents a
substantial investment. Thus, the goal of the wealth maximization is related to
the efficiency with which inventory is managed. Consequently, the financial
manager has an important role to play in the management of inventory, although
it is not his operating responsibility to control inventory. The financial manager
should see that only an optimum amount is invested in inventory. He should be
familiar with the inventory control techniques and ensure that inventory is
managed well. He should introduce the policies which reduce the lead time,
regulate usage and thus, minimize safety stock. The net effect would be to
reduce inventory investment and increase the firm's prospects of making more
profits.
