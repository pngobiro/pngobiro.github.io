Example
Find the points of inflexion on the curve of the function
                            as




       y = x3
                        .m




Solution
                     w




The only possible inflexion points will occur where
                  w




        d2y
              0
               w




         dx 2
From the function given
        dy               d2y
              3 x 2 and       6x
        dx               dx 2
Equating the second derivative to zero, we have
        6x = 0 or x = 0
We test whether the point at which x = 0 is an inflexion point as follows
                                    d2y
When x is slightly less than 0,            0 which means a downward concavity
                                    dx 2
                                   d2y
When x is slightly larger than 0,         0 which means an upward concavity
                                   dx 2
Therefore we have a point of inflexion at point x = 0 because the concavity of
the curve changes as we pass from the left to the right of x = 0
