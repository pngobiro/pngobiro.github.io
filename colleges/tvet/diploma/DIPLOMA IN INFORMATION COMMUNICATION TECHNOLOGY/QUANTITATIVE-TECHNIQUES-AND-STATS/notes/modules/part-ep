TESTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO SAMPLE MEANS (LARGE

A large sample is defined as one which contains 30 or more items (n≥30)
                          w




Where n is the sample size
In a business those involved are constantly observant about the standards or
                    w




specifications of the item which they sell e.g. a trader may receive a batch
                 w




of items at one time and another batch at a later time at the end he may
have concluded that the two samples are different in certain specifications
e.g. mean weight mean lifespan, mean length e.t.c. further it may become
necessary to establish whether the observed differences are statistically
significant or not. If the differences are statistically significant then it
means that such differences must be explained i.e. there are known causes
but if they are not statistically significant then it means that the difference
observed have no known causes and are mainly due to chance
If the differences are established to be statistically significant then it
