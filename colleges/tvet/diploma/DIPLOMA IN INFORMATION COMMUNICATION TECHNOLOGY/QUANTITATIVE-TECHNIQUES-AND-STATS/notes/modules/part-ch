The Lorenz curve derived by Max O. Lorenz, famous economic statistician,
                  w




is a graphic method of studying dispersion. This curve was used by him for
the first time to measure the distribution off wealth and income. Now the
curve is also used to study the distribution of profits, wages, turnover, etc.

Illustration
In the following table is given the number of companies belonging to two
areas A and B according to the amount of profits earned by them. Draw in
the same diagram their Lorenz curve and interpret them.

Relative measures of dispersion
                             as




Def: A relative measure of dispersion is a statistical value which may be
                         .m




used to compare variations in 2 or more samples.
                      w




The measures of dispersion are usually expressed as decimals or
                   w




percentages and usually they do not have any other units
                w




Example
The average distance covered by vehicles in a motor rally may be given as
2000 km with a standard deviation of 5 km.
In another competition set of vehicles covered 3000 km with a standard
deviation of 10 kms
NB: The 2 standard deviations given above are referred to as absolute
measures of dispersion. These are actual deviations of the measurements
from their respective mean
However, these are not very useful when comparing dispersions among
samples.
Therefore the following measures of dispersion are usually employed in
order to assess the degree of dispersion.
   i.     Coefficient of mean deviation
      77
                       Mean deviation
                   =
                            mean
   ii.        Coefficient of quartile deviation
