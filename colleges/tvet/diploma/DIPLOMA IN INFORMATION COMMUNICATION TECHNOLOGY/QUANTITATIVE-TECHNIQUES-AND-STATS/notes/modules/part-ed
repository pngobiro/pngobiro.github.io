            Where S x = Standard error of mean
                  S = standard deviation of the sample

   v.      Estimate the population mean as under
           Population mean µ = χ ± (appropriate number) ×S x
           ‗Appropriate number‘ means confidence level e.g. at 95%
           confidence level is 1.96 this number is usually denoted by Z and is
           obtained from the normal tables.


Example
The quality department of a wire manufacturing company periodically
selects a sample of wire specimens in order to test for breaking strength.
Past experience has shown that the breaking strengths of a certain type of
wire are normally distributed with standard deviation of 200 kg. A random
sample of 64 specimens gave a mean of 6200 kgs. Find out the population
mean at 95% level of confidence




                                                        om
Solution
Population mean = χ ± 1.96 S x




                                                    i.c
Note that sample size is already n > 30 whereas s and x are given thus step
i), ii) and iv) are provided.
Here: X = 6200 kgs                              ng
                                              si
                     s      200
              Sx =      =         =      25
                                       om

                      n      64
                                  om



Population mean     = 6200 ± 1.96(25)
                    = 6200 ± 49
                                as




                    = 6151 to 6249
At 95% level of confidence, population mean will be in between 6151 and
                           .m

Finite Population Correction Factor (FPCF)
If a given population is relatively of small size and sample size is more than
                 w




5% of the population then the standard error should be adjusted by
multiplying it by the finite population correction factor
                                N n
        FPCF is given by    =
                                n 1
Where N = population size
     n = sample size

Example
A manager wants an estimate of sales of salesmen in his company. A
random sample 100 out of 500 salesmen is selected and average sales are
found to be Shs. 75,000. If a sample standard deviation is Shs. 15000 then
find out the population mean at 99% level of confidence


  134
Solution
Here N = 500, n = 100, X = 75000 and S = 15000
Now
Standard error of mean
