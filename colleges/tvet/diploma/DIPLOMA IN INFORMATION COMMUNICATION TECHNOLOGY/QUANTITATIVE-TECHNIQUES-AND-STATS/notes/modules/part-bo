       applications in business management e.g. hypothesis testing, quality
       control e.t.c.
    It is the best representative of a given set of data if such data was
       obtained from a normal population.
    The a.m. can be determined accurately using mathematical
       formulas.


Limitation
    It is difficult to compute mean without making assumption regarding
      the size of the class- interval of the open end classer.

       If the data is not drawn from a ‗normal‘ population, then the a.m.
        may give a wrong impression about the population.
       In some situations, the a.m. may give unrealistic values especially
        when dealing with discrete variables e.g. when working out the
        average no. of children in a no. of families. It may be found that the
        average is 4.4 which is unrealistic in human beings.

The Median
This is a statistical value which is normally located at the center of a given
set of data which has been organized in the order of magnitude or size e.g.
consider the set 14, 17, 9, 8, 20, 32, 18, 14.5, 13. When the data is ordered
it will be 8, 9, 13, 14, 14.5, 17, 18, 20, and 32. The middle number/median
is 14.5. The importance of the median lies in the fact that it divides the
data into 2 equal halves. The no. of observations below and above the
median is equal. In order to determine the value of the median from

the following methods
