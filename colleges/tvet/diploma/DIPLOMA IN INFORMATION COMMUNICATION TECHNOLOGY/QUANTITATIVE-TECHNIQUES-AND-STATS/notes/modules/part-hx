Normal cost. The costs associated with a normal time estimate for an activity.
                                             si
         Often the normal time estimate is set at the point where resources
         (labour, equipment, etc.) are used in the most efficient manner.

Crash cost. The costs associated with the minimum possible time for an
                                 om



         activity. Crash costs, because of extra wages, overtime premiums,
         extra facility costs are always higher than normal costs.

Crash time. The minimum possible time that an activity is planned to take. .
                        .m




         The minimum time is invariably brought about by the application of
                     w




         extra resources, e.g. more labour or machinery.
                  w




Cost slope. This is the average cost of shortening an activity by one time unit
               w




          (day, week, month as appropriate). The cost slope is generally
          assumed to be linear and is calculated as follows:

          Cost slope = Crash cost – Normal cost
                     Normal time – Crash time

Example
A project has the following activities and costs. You are required to prepare
the least cost schedules for all possible durations from normal time – normal
cost to crash time – crash cost.
