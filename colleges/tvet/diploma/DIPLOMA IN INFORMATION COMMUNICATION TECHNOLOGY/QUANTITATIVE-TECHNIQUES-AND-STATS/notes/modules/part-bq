           L= Lower class limit of the lower quartile group.
                    w




           i = class interval of the lower quartile group.

           f = frequency of the lower quartile group.
          m = n/4
          c = cumulative frequency of the group preceding the lower
quartile group.

Decile:
       D2 = L +i/f (m-c)

Where, D2 = second decile
        m = 2n/10

Percentile:

        P40 = L + i/f (m-c)

   55
Where, P40 = fortieth percentile.
        m = 40n/100
