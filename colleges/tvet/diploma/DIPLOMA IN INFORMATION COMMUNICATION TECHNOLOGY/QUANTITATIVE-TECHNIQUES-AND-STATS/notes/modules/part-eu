HYPOTHESIS TESTING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO

PROPORTIONS
Is used to test the difference between the proportions of a given attribute
                                  as




found in two random samples.
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the population

proportions. It means two samples are from the same population.

Hence

H0 : π1 = π2
The best estimate of the standard error of the difference of P1 and P2 is
                  w




given by pooling the samples and finding the pooled sample proportions (P)
thus
                  p n  p2 n2
              P= 1 1

Example
In a random sample of 100 persons taken from village A, 60 are found to be
consuming tea. In another sample of 200 persons taken from a village B,
100 persons are found to be consuming tea. Do the data reveal significant
difference between the two villages so far as the habit of taking tea is
concerned?

Solution
Let us take the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between
the two villages as far as the habit of taking tea is concerned i.e. π1 = π2
We are given
       P1 = 0.6;     n1 = 100
       P2 = 0.5;     n2 = 200

Appropriate statistic to be used here is given by
             p n  p2 n2
