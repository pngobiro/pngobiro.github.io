                   Q3 = third quartile


   iii.       Coefficient of standard deviation
              Standard deviation
          =

                                                          i.c
                  standard deviation
              =
                         mean
                                       ×100

   Example (see information above)
   First group of cars: mean = 2000 kms
                                               om



                            Standard deviation = 5 kms
                                        as




              ∴ C.O.V = 5
                                   .m




                                       x 100
                                       2000
                                 w
                            w




              = 0.25%
                       w




   Second group of cars: mean = 3000 kms
                            Standard deviation = 10kms

              ∴ C.O.V = 10             x 100
                                        3000

                            = 0.33%

Conclusion
Since the coefficient of variation is greater in the 2 nd group, than in the
first group we may conclude that the distances covered in the 1 st group are
much closer to the mean that in the 2nd group.

Example 2
In a given farm located in the UK the average salary of the employees is £
3500 with a standard deviation of £150
The same firm has a local branch in Kenya in which the average salaries are
Kshs 8500 with a standard deviation of Kshs.800
Determine the coefficient of variation in the 2 firms and briefly comment
on the degree of dispersion of the salaries in the 2 firms.
First firm in the UK
        C.O.V         = 150  x 100
                 3500

                = 4.29%

Second firm in Kenya
        C.O.V            = 800 x 100
