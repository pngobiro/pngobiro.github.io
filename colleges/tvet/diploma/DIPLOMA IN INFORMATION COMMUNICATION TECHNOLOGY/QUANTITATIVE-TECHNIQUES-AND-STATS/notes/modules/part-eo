                     µ = Population mean
                     S = sample standard deviation
                     n = sample size
                     z = standard value (as per computation)
        The standard value Z must fall within the acceptance region for us to
        accept the null hypothesis. Thus it must be > - 1.65 otherwise we
        accept the alternative hypothesis.
                     16  19
        Z     =         2.1
                             = - 10.1
                         50


   6. Since –10.1 < -1.65, we reject the null hypothesis but accept the
      alternative hypothesis at 5% level of significance i.e. the marriage
      age in this community is significantly lower than 19 years

Example 2
A foreign company which manufactures electric bulbs has assured its
customers that the lifespan of the bulbs is 28 month with a standard
deviation of 4months
Recently the company embarked on a quality improvement research for
their product. After the research using new technology, a sample of 70
bulbs was tested and they gave a mean lifespan of 30.2 months
Does this justify the research undertaken? Use 1% level of significance to
conduct a statistical test in order to establish the truth about the above
question.
Testing procedure
   1. Null hypothesis H0: µ = 28
       Alternative hypothesis H1: µ > 28
   2. The level of significance is 1% (one tailed test)




                                                        om
   3. The test statistics is the sample mean age, x‘ = 30.2
   4. The critical value of the one tailed test at 5% level of significance is




                                                    i.c

                             as




                                                               1% = 0.01

                w




   5. The standardized value of the sample mean is
               X               30.2  28
      Z     =            =           4
                                            = 4.6
                Sx                   70


   6. Since 4.6 > 2.33, we reject the null hypothesis but accept the
      alternative hypothesis at 1% level of significance i.e. the new sample
      mean life span is statistically significant higher than the population
      mean
      Therefore the research undertaken was worth while or justified

Example 3

  148
A construction firm has placed an order that they require a consignment of
wires which have a mean length of 10.5 meters with a standard deviation of
1.7 m
The company which produces the wires delivered 90 wires, which had a
mean length of 9.2 m., The construction company rejected the consignment
on the grounds that they were different from the order placed.

Required
Conduct a statistical test to indicate whether you support or not support
the action taken by the construction company at 5% level of significance.

Solution
Null hypothesis µ = 10.5 m
