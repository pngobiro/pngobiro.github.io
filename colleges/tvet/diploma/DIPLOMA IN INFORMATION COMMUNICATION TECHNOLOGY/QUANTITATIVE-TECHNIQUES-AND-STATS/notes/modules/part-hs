              b) Use of time estimates. as three time estimates are converted to a
                 single time estimate. There is no fundamental difference between
                 the two methods as regards the basic time analysis of a network.
                 However, on completion of the basic time analysis, projects with
                 multiple time estimates can be further analyzed to give an
                 estimate of the probability of completing the project by a
                 scheduled date.
              c) Time units. Time estimates may be given in any unit, i.e. minutes
                 , hours, days depending on the project. All times estimates within
                 a project must be in the same units otherwise confusion is bound
                 to occur.

    Basic time analysis – critical path
       b) The critical path of a network gives the shortest time in which the
           whole project can be completed. It is the chain of activities with the
                                        247
      longest duration times. There may be more than one critical path which
      may run through a dummy.

   Earliest start times (EST) – Forward pass, Once the activities have been
         timed we can assess the total project time by calculating the ESTs for
         each activity. The EST is the earliest possible time at which a
         succeeding activity can start.
         Assume the following network has been drawn and the activity times
         estimated in days.

      The method used to insert the ESTs is also known as the forward pass,
                   w




      this is obtained by;
                 EST = The greater of [EST (tail event) + Activity duration]

   a) Start from the start event giving it 0 values,
   b) For the rest of the events EST is obtained by summing the EST of the tail
      event and the activity duration
   c) Where two or more routes converge into an activity, calculate individual
