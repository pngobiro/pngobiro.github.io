which is called the frequency. In order to facilitate counting prepare a
column of ‗‘tally‘‘ in another column all possible values of variables from
the lowest to the highest. Then put a bar( vertical line ) opposite the
particular value to which it relates.
To facilitate counting blocks of five bars are prepared and some space is
left in between each block.




                                                         om
We finally count the number of blocks and bars corresponding to each value
to each value of the variable and place it in the column and frequency.

Classification according to class interval.
The following technical terms are important when data are classified
according to class intervals:
   (a) Class limit.these are the lowest and the highest values that can be
       included in the class e.g take the class 20-40.the lowest value of this
       class is 20 and the highest is 40.



   34
        The two boundaries of a class is the value below which there can be
        no value in that class, while the upper limit of a class is the value
        above which no value can belong to that class.
        The class 70- 89 .70 is the lower limit and 80 is the upper limit i.e in
        this class there can be no value which is less than 70 or more than
        89.

   (b) Classs interval .it is the span of a class i.e the difference between
       the upper limit and the lower limit is known as class interval , for
       example in the class 20-40 , the class interval is 20 (i.e 40 – 20) the
       size of the class interval is dertemined by the number of classes and
       the total range in the data.
   (c) Class frequency . this is the number of observation corresponding to
       the particular class.it is also known s the frequency of that class or
       the class frequency .if we add together the frequency of all
       individual classes , we obtain the total frequency.




                                                          om
   (d) Class mid – point.it is the value lying half way between the lower and
       the upper class limit of a class interval.




                                                      i.c
       Mid point of a class is ascertained as follows:

                                                  ng
                                               si
       Mid point of a class = upper limit of the class + lower limit of the
                                         om
