Solution
                      w




   i.     To find maximum or minimum value we use differential calculus as
                  w




          follows
               w




                       x3
       R  14  18 x 
                       12

       dR        1
           81  .3 x 2
       dx       12

       d 2R       1          x
          2
             0  .3.2 x  
       dx        12          2




                                          235
           dR                 1
    put       0     i.e. 81  x 2  0
           dx                 4

           which gives x  18 or x  18
            d 2R    x
               2
                 
            dx      2
                                 d 2R
           thus when x  18;           9 which is negative  indicating a maximum value
                                 dx 2

   Therefore at x = 18, the value of R is a maximum. Similarly at x = -18, the
   value of R is a minimum. Therefore, the number of units that maximize the
   revenue = 18 units
   ii. The maximum revenue is given by




                                                            om
                  R = 14 + 81 + 18 – (18)3
                                             12




                                                        i.c
                  = Shs. 986
   ii.                                             ng
            The price per unit to maximize the revenue is
                                                   si
            986 = 54.78 or Shs.54.78
                                             om

            18
                                         om



INTEGRATION
It is the reversal of differentiation. An integral can either be indefinite (when it
