Note:
The optimum safety-stock level exists where the costs of carrying an extra unit
are exactly counter balanced by the expected stock-out costs. This would be
the level that minimizes the annual total stock-out and carrying costs.

Stock-out costs




                                                         om
These are the opportunity costs of running out of stock. They include:
i.     The costs of lost customer sales, and therefore lost contribution to fixed

iii.                                              ng
       Potential loss of goodwill with customers whose demand cannot be net.
       Acquiring emergency supplies at higher prices to meet demand.

iv.    Cost production of finished goods, where raw material stock-outs occur.

The computation of safety stocks lingers on demand forecasts. The manager will

have some notion (usually based on past experience) of the range of daily
demand. That is the probability that exists for usage of various quantities.

Hence total inventory costs will be as follows:

                        w




Total inventory costs               =     Purchase price cost + carrying costs +
stock-out cost + order costs.

(Q2 H) + Buffer Stock holding costs (B x H) + Stock-out costs + order costs.

Total inventory costs       =      DC + Q2H + (B x H) + stock-out costs + DQ 
Co

        Where:       D      =      Total annual demand
             H       =      Holding costs per unit
             B       =      Buffer stock
             Q       =      EOQ

Note:

1.      The normal EOQ formula is used to compute order quantity Q. Hence
        purchase costs, carrying costs, and ordering costs remain unchanged.

      Only buffer stock holding costs and stock-out costs change. Accordingly,
      the minimization of these two costs will also mean that total/overall costs
      will be minimized.

2.     Stock-out costs    =      Number of units short x Probability of being
short.

                    =      {(Number of units short x Stock-out costs per unit
      Probability of being short)—Stock-out costs for every usage duration} x
      Number of orders per year.

3.    Buffer Stock-holding costs =      Bx H
