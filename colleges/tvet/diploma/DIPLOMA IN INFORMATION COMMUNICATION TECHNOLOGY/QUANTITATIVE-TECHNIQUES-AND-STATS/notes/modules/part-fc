hypothesis is accepted. Thus it can be concluded that male and female
births are equally probable.

ii)    Test of independence of attributes
This test disclosed whether there is any association or relationship between
two or more attributes or not. The following steps are required to perform
the test of hypothesis.
           1. The null and alternative hypothesis are set as follows
              H0: No association exists between the attributes
              H1: an association exists between the attributes
           2. Under H0 an expected frequency E corresponding to each cell
              in the contingency table is found by using the formula
                   RC
              E=




                                                         om
                    n
              Where R = a row total, C = a column total and n = sample size
           3. Based upon the observed values and corresponding expected




                                                     i.c
              frequencies the χ2 statistic is obtained using the formula

              χ = 
               2      O  E 
                                 2
                                                ng
                                             si
                           E
                                          om

           4. The characteristic of this distribution are defined by the
              number of degrees of freedom (d.f.) which is given by
                      d.f. = (r-1) (c-1),
                                      om



              Where r is the number of rows and c is number of columns
              corresponding to a chosen level of significance, the critical
                                     as




              value is found from the chi squared table
                          .m




           5. The calculated value of χ2 is compared with the tabulated
              value χ2 for (r-1) (c-1) degrees of freedom at a certain level of
                       w




              significance. If the computed value of χ2 is greater than the
                    w




              tabulated value, the null hypothesis of independence is
                   w




              rejected. Otherwise we accept it.


Example
In a sample of 200 people where a particular devise was selected, 100 were
given a drug and the others were not given any drug. The results are as
follows
                   Drug                No drug              Total
Cured              65                  55                   120
Not cured          35                  45                   80
Total              100                 100                  200
Test whether the drug will be effective or not, at 5% level of significance.

Solution

  165
Let us take the null hypothesis that the drug is not effective in curing the
disease.
Applying the χ2 test
The expected cell frequencies are computed as follows
      RC     120  100
E11 = 1 1 =               =      60
       n        200
