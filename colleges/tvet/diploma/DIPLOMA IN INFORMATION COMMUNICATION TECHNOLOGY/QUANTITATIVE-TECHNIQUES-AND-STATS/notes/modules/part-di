If we use the linear regression analysis and attempt to find the linear
relationship between output and time i.e.



                    Month                 Output
                    1                          12
                    2                          18

                    4                          20
                    5                          24
                    6                          30
The value of b and a will turn out to be 3.11 and 9.6 i.e. relationship will
be of the form
    107
       Output = 9.6 + 3.11 × month
For this equation forecast for 7th month will be
       Output = 9.6 + 3.11 × 7
             = 9.6 + 21.77
             = 31.37 units
Using the equation, Power costs = 2.29 + 0.34 × output
             = 2.29 + 0.34 × 31.37
             = 2.29 + 10.67
             = 12.96 i.e. £ 12,960


Non Linear Relationships
If the scatter diagram and the correlation coefficient do not indicate linear
relationship, then the relationship may be non – linear
Two such relationships are of peculiar interest

                                                         om
                  and
Both of these can be reduced to linear model. Simple or multiple linear
regression methods are then used to determine the values of the




                                                    i.c
coefficients

                                            si
         y  ab x
                                        om

   Take log of both sides
   log y = log a + log bx
                                  om



   log y = log a + xlog b
Let log y = Y and log a = A and log b = B
                              as




Thus we get Y = A + Bx. This is a linear regression model

   Using the same technique as above
   Log y = log a + blog x
   Y = A + bX
Where Y = log y
       A = log a
       X = log x
Using linear regression technique (the method of least squares), it is
