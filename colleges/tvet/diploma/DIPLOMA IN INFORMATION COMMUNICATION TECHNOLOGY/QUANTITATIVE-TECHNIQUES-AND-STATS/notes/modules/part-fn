Methods of constructing index numbers
   a) unweighed indices
   b) weighed indices

In the unweighted indices weight are not expressively assigned whereas in
the weighed indices weights are assigned to the various items. Each of
these types may further be divided under two heads.
    i)    simple aggregate
    ii)   simple average of price relations

Unweighted index numbers
   i)      simple aggregate method
This is the simplest method of constructing index numbers. When this
method is used to construct a price index number, the total of current year

prices for the various commodities is divided by total of base year and
quotient is multiplied by 100.
        P01 = ∑p1 x 100
               ∑p0
Where ∑p1 = total current price for various commodities
        ∑p0 = total of base year price for various commodities
Limitation of the method
             The units in which prices of commodities are given affect the
               price index.
             No consideration is given to the relative importance of the
               commodities.
    ii)     simple average of relative method
When this method is used to construct a price index, price relative are
obtained for the various items include intercontinental he index and then
an average of these relative
        P01 = ∑p1 x 100 /N

Merits
     Extreme items do not influence the index
                                               ng
     The index is not influenced by the units in which prices are quoted.

Limitations

     Difficulty is faced with regard to the selection of an appropriate
        average.
