Since the computed value of Z is less than the critical value of Z = 1.96 at
5% level of significance therefore we accept the hypothesis and conclude
that there is no significant difference in the habit of taking tea in the two
villages A and B

t distribution (student’s t distribution) tests of hypothesis (test for small
samples n < 30)
For small samples n < 30, the method used in hypothesis testing is exactly
similar to the one for large samples except that t values are used from t
distribution at a given degree of freedom v, instead of z score, the standard
error Se statistic used is also different.
Note that v = n – 1 for a single sample and n1 + n2 – 2 where two sample are
involved.

   a) Test of hypothesis about the population mean
When the population standard deviation (S) is known then the t statistic is
defined as
                           X                  S
        t     =                      where S X 
                            SX                   n
Follows the students t distribution with (n-1) d.f. where
        X = Sample mean
       μ = Hypothesis population mean
       n = sample size
and S is the standard deviation of the sample calculated by the formula

Example

                                                   ng
Ten oil tins are taken at random from an automatic filling machine. The
mean weight of the tins is 15.8 kg and the standard deviation is 0.5kg. Does
                                               si
the sample mean differ significantly from the intended weight of 16kgs?

Use 5% level of significance.

Solution
Given that n = 10; x = 15.8; S = 0.50; μ = 16; v = 9
