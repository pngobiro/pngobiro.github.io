This is a measure of central tendency normally used to measure industrial
                                     as




growth rates. It is defined as the nth root of the product of ‗n‘ observations
or values

Example

In 1995 five firms registered the following economic growth rates; 26%. 32%
41% 18% and 36%.

Calculate the GM for the above values

    GM  5 26  32  41  18  36


          15  Log 26  Log 32  Log 41  Log18  Log 26

                   No. Log
                     26                     1.4150
                     32                     1.5052

                   41               1.6128
                   18               1.2533
                   36               1.5563
                                    7.3446
   Therefore Log of GM      = 1/5 x 7.3446 = 1.46892
   So GM = Antilog of 1.46892
         = 29.43
Merits
   i.       It makes use of all the values given (except when x = 0 or
            negative)
   ii.      It is the best measure for industrial growth rates

Demerits




                                                   i.c
   i.       The determination of the GM by using logarithms is not familiar

   ii.                                         ng
            process to all those expected to use it e.g. managers
            If the data contains zeros or –ve values, the GM ceases to exist

Harmonic mean
                                  om



This is a measure of central tendency which is used to determine the
                              as




average growth rates for natural economies. It is defined as the reciprocal
of the average of the reciprocals of all the values given by HM.
