    Network Analysis-Time Analysis
    Assessing the time
       a) After drawing the outline of the network time durations of the activities
           are then inserted.
           a) Time estimates. The analysis of the projects time can be achieved by
               using :
               i. Single time estimates for each activity. These estimates would
                    be based on the judgment of the individual responsible or by




                                                             om
                    technical calculations using data from similar projects
              ii. Multiple time estimates for each activity. the most usual




                                                       i.c
                    multiple time estimates are three estimates for each activity ,
                    i.e. optimistic (O), Most Likely (ML), and Pessimistic (P). These
                                                     ng
                    three estimates are combined to give an expected time and the
                    accepted time formula is:
                                               si
                                          om

                                            O  P  4ML
                          Expected time =
                                                 6
                                    om



                      For example assume that the three estimates for an activity
                      are
                                as
