                                          Thus:
Before Advertising                        P1  5 6 and P2  1 6

If there are 60,000 buyers


Before Advertising                         2  60, 000  40, 000 Customers

this implies that,                         contribution  40, 000  2.5
                                                          = Sh.100, 000

After Advertising
P1  5 6

this implies that,

5  60, 000  50, 000 customers will buy

                       our brand
contribution  (50, 000  2.5)  20, 000
               = Sh.105, 000

the difference between advertising and not advertising is

105,000 – 100,000 = Sh.5, 000 in favour of advertising,
Thus the advertising campaign is worthwhile.
