NON-ZERO LEAD TIME (DETERMINING REORDER POINT)
                     w




This basic EOQ model assumes that the suppliers lead time is zero (i.e. goods are
                     w




delivered immediately on the day the order was made). In reality, however,
                w




supplies are rarely ordered and received on the same day. Accordingly, orders
must be placed some time before stocks reach zero. In world of certainty (when
demand is continuous and constant) the reorder point will be the number of
days/weeks lead time multiplied by the daily/weekly usage during the period.

i.e. Reorder point   =       Average daily usage x Lead time in days.

Note:
The reorder point has no cost implications, since it does not affect the EOQ.
