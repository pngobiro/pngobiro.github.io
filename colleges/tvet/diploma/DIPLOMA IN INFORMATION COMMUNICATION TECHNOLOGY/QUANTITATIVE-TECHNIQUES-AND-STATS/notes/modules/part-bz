NB if the absolute mean deviation is relatively small it implies that the data
                                     as




is more compact and therefore the arithmetic mean is a fair sample
representative.

(b) The interquartile range or quartile deviation
                   w




This is a measure of dispersion which involves the use of quartile. A quartile
is a mark or a value which lies at the boundary of a division when any given
set of data is divided into four equal divisions
Each of such divisions normally carries 25% of all the observations
The semi interquartile range is a good measure of dispersion because it
shows how the rest of the data are generally spread around the mean
The quartiles normally used are three namely;
           i. The lower quartile (first quartile Q1) this usually binds the
                lower 25% of the data
           ii. The median (second quartile Q2)
           iii. The upper quartile (third quartile Q3)

Interquartile range = Q3-Q1

Very often the interquartile range is reduced to the form of the semi-
interquartile range or quartile deviation by dividing it by 2
       Q.D = quartile deviation
       Q.D = Q3-Q1/2
Quartile deviation gives the average amount by which the quartile differs
from the median. Quartile deviation is an absolute measure of variation.
The relative measure corresponding to the measure called the coefficient
of quartile deviation.
       Coefficient of Q.D = Q3-Q1/Q3+Q1
