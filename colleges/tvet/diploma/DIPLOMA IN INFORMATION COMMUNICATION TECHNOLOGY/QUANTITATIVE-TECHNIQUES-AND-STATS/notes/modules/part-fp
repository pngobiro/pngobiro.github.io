Each industries order is given a weighting. The weighting is based on
average monthly production in each industry in a fixed base year. It gives
each item its relative importance amongst all other items and thus gives a
better estimate of the index for comparison purposes.

The Geometric Index (Industrial Share index)
This index is an index of 30 selected top industrial companies. It is
calculated by taking an unweighted geometric mean of the price relatives
of the selected shares.

Example
The share prices of ordinary shares of four companies on 1 st January 1990
and 1st January 1991 were as follows.




                                                                      om

Inflation
The inflation rate for a given period can be calculated using the following
formula;
                           Current retail price index
        Inflation =                                          × 100
                       Retail price index in the base year
