activities or simply the process of finding the derivative of a function.
Integration deals with the summation or totality of items produced over a given
period of time or simply the reverse of differentiation

The derivative and differentiation
The process of obtaining the derivative of a function or slope or gradient is
referred to as derivation or differentiation.
                                         dy
The derivative is denoted by                  or f΄(x) and is given by dividing the change in
                                         dx
y variable by the change in x variable.
The derivative or slope or gradient of a line AB connecting points (x,y) and
(x+dx, y + dy) is given by
       y
            
                Change in y
                              
                                   y  dy   y  dy
       x       Change in x       x  dx  x dx
                                                    222
Where dy is a small change in y and dx is a small change in x variables.

Rules of Differentiation
             1. The constant function rule




                                                          i.c
                                                                               dy
If given a function y = k where k is a constant then                                = 0
                                                       ng                      dx
