Specific Objectives
At the end of the topic the trainee should be able to:
     Draw the scatter diagram;
     Differentiate between the various forms of correlation;
     Determine the correlation coefficient and interpret;
     Determine the coefficient of determination and interpret;
     Apply the linear regression models.

Introduction
When the relationship is of a quantitative nature, the appropriate
statistical tool for discovering and measuring the relationship and
expressing it in a brief formula is known as a correlation. This is an
important statistical concept which refers to interrelationship or
association between variables. The purpose of studying correlation is for
one to be able to establish a relationship, plan and control the inputs
(independent variables) and the output (dependent variables).
