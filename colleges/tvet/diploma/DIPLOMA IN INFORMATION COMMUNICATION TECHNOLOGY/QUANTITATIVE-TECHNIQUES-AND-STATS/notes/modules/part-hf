                     d2y = f´(x) > 0
                     dx2

Example:
For the function
       h(x) = 1/3 x3 + x2 – 35x + 10
Determine the critical values and find out whether these critical values are
maxima or minima. Determine the extreme values of the function

Solution
   i.      Critical values
      h(x) = 1/3 x3 + x2 – 35x + 10 and
      h´(x) = x2 + 2x – 35
   by first text,
               then h´(x) = x2 + 2x – 35 = 0
                                          232
             or (x-5) (x+7) = 0
             Hence x = 5 or x = -7

    ii.      The determinant of the maximum and the minimum points requires
             that we test the value x = 5 and –7 by the second text
             H´´(x) = 2x + 2
             a) When x = -7 h´´(x) = -12 <0
             b) When x = 5 h´´(x) = 12>0
       There x = -7 gives a maximum point and x = 5 gives a minimum point.
    iii.     Extreme values of the function
             h(x) = 1/3 x3 + x2 – 35x + 10
             when x = -7, h(x) = 189 2/3
             when x = 5, h(x) = -98 1/3
             The extreme values of the function are h(x) = 189 2/3 which is a
         relative maximum and h(x) = -98 1/3 , a relative minimum
