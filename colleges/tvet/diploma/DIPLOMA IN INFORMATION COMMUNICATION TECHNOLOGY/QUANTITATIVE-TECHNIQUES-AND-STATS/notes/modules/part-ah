Linear inequalities in two variables: relations
                             w
                         w




An expression of the form
                       w




          Y ≥ 2x – 1
Is technically called a relation. It corresponds to a function, but different
from it in that, corresponding to each value of the independent variable x,
there is more than one value of the dependent variable y
Relations can be successfully presented graphically and are of major
importance in linear programming.


Solutions of linear simultaneous equations.

Two or more equations will form a system of linear simultaneous equations
if such equations be linear in the same two or more variables.


   11
For instance, the following systems of the two equations is simultaneous in
the two variables x and y.
       2x + 6y = 23
        4x + 7y = 10
The solution of a system of linear simultaneous equations is a set of values
of the variables which simultaneously satisfy all the equations of the
system.

Solution techniques
           a) The graphical technique
The graphical technique of solving a system of linear equations consists of
drawing the graphs of the equations of the system on the same rectangular
coordinate system. The coordinates of the point of intersection of the
