   Thus the tableau will appear as follows.

             4
                        1       1
                               20
                                        0        20

  Z        45        80        0       0        0

   5. Next we conduct row operations that aim to reduce elements falling in
      the same column as the previously marked element to zero. These row
      operations may sometime necessitate multiplying or dividing the
      selected row with an arbitrary number.

   Therefore:
            Row 2 – 15×Row 1




                                     321
              x4 10 15 0 1  450
          
   15        x2 154 15 15
                        20 0  300
   new   x4 6 14 0* 43 1  150
   Note that the aim was to attain the zero.

              Z 45 80 0 0     0
          
   80        x2 20 80 4 0  1600
   new        Z    25 0*    4 0  1600

   On replacing the new rows to the tableau we get
   2nd tableau.

                                                                   om

                              20
                                       0        20
   x4       6 14         0     3       1       150




                                                             i.c
                               4

  Z               25             0            -4    0    -1600
                                                         ng
   Since in the Z row under products column we still have values greater than
                                                        si
   zero, we conduct another operation.
                                                    om


   Taking the column with a Z value of 25, we repeat the process in the same
                                              om



   manner.
