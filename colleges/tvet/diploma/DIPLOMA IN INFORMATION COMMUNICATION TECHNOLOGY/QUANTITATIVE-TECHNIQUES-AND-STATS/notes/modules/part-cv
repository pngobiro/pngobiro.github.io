   implies that there is perfect positive correlation. A value of –ve shows




                                                        om
   that there is perfect negative correlation. A value of 0 implies no
   correlation at all.

There are usually two types of correlation coefficients normally used
namely;-


Merits of scatter diagram
    It is simple and non mathematical method of studying correlation
       between the variables.


   93
     It is not influenced by the size of extreme values whereas most of
      the mathematical methods of findings correlation are influenced by
      extreme values.
Limitation
    Exact degree of correlation can not be established between the
      variable


Product Moment Coefficient (r)
It gives an indication of the strength of the linear relationship between two
variables.
                     n xy   x y
       r=
             n x 2    x   n y 2    y 
                             2                   2




Note that this formula can be rearranged to have different outlooks but the




                                                             om
resultant is always the same.
