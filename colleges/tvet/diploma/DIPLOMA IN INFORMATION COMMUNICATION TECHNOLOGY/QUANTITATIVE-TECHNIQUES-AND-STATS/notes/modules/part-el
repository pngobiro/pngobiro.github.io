+2.58 accept the null hypothesis but otherwise reject it and therefore
accept the alternative hypothesis

TWO TAILED TESTS
A two tailed test is normally used in statistical work(tests of significance)
e.g. if a complaint lodged by the client is about a product not meeting
certain specifications i.e. the item will generate a complaint if its
measurements are below the lower tolerance limit or above the upper
tolerance limit

                                                       Region of acceptance
                                                for
                                                       H0

                                       om


NB: Alternative hypothesis is usually rejected if the standardized value of
                                  om



the sample mean lies beyond the tolerance limits (15cm and 17 ½ cm).

ONE TAILED TEST
This is a test where the alternative hypothesis (H1:) is only concerned with
                         .m




one of the tails of the distribution e.g. to test a business complaint if the
                      w




complaint is above the measurements of item being shorter than is
                   w




required.
E.g. a manufacturer of a given brand of bread may state that the average
                  w




weight of the bread is 500 gms but if a consumer takes a sample and weighs
each of the pieces of bread and happens to have a mean of 450 gms he will
definitely complain about the bread which is underweight. The statistical
analysis to be done will concentrate on the left tail of the normal
distribution in which one will have to establish whether 450 gms being less
than 500g is statistically significant. Such a test therefore is referred to as
one tailed test.
