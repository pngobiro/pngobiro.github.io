Therefore, X Ltd total inventory costs are actually Shs 50 (3,050 - 3,000) higher
than they would have been if the EOQ had been set in accordance with perfect
information.

Observation:
Hence the change in demand by 44%               (99,000 - 62,500) has result in a 20%
      (600 - 500)
                                                62,000                          500

Increase in EOQ but only 91.64% (3,050 - 3,000) increase in total costs.
                               3,000

Hence we can conclude that total cost is relatively insensitive to changes in
demand.

SELECTIVE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
The inventory of an industrial firm generally comprises thousands of items with
diverse prices, usage and lead time, as well as procurement and/or technical
problems. It is neither desirable nor possible to exercise the same degree of
control over all those items. The organisation should pay more attention and
care to those items whose usage value is high and less attention to those whose
usage and consumption value is low. The organisation has, therefore, to be
selective in its approach to control its investment in various types of stocks and
inventories. Such a system is known as `selective inventory control' system.

ABC ANALYSIS (PARETO ANALYSIS)

In ordinary parlance, ABC analysis can be best compared with our class society
where the population is categorised into Top, Middle and Lower classes. In the

case of inventories also, it has been noticed that out of a large number of items
(in a million-tonne capacity steel plant there would be usually about 50,000

items are quite significant whereas the others are not that important. Through

techniques, the relative importance of the various items is established for the

`VIP' or the `privileged few' and the `trivial many' are distinguished and treated
as such.
