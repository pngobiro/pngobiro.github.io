   e) Complement of a set
The complement of set A is written as A΄. This set contains all those
                                as




elements of universal set which are not in A
                           .m




   f) Intersection and union
B  C Denotes the intersection of B and C. it is the set containing all those
                         w




elements, which belong to both B and C
                     w




        If B = {5, 8, 11, 20, 25} and C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}
                  w




        Then B  C = {5, 11}
        B  C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 20 25}

Set Operations and Laws
A simple way of representing sets and relations between sets is by means of
the Venn diagram. Venn diagram consists of a rectangle that represents the
universal set. Subjects of the universal set are represented by circles drawn
within the rectangle, or the universe.
Suppose that the universal set is designated by U and the sets A, B and C
are subject of U.The Venn diagram below can be used to illustrate the sets
as follows


   21
         U
                                        B
               A
                                            C

You are given the universal set
                                  as




        T = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
And the following subjects of the universal set:
                              .m




        A = {3, 4, 5, 6,}
                          w
