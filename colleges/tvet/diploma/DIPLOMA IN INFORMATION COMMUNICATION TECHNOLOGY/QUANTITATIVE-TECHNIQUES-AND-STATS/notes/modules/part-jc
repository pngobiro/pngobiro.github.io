ABC analysis contemplates to classify all the inventory items in a number of
                            as




categories, generally in three categories based on their values. Items of high
value but small in number are classified as `A' items which would be under a
                        .m




strict control. `C' items represent relatively small value items and would be
                     w




under simple control. Items of moderate value and size are classified as `B'
                  w




items and would attract reasonable attention of the management. Since this
               w




plan concentrates attention on the basis of the relative importance of the
various items of inventory, it is also known as `control by importance and
exception'. As items are classified in order of their relative importance in terms
of value, it is also known as the `proportional value analysis'.


It has been found that normal inventory items in most organisations show the
following distribution pattern:

      A—     5 to 10% of total number of items account for about 70% of the
             total consumption value. These items may be called "A" items.

      B—     10 to 20% account for 20% of total consumption value.

      C—     the remaining large number of items account for the balance of
             15% of the consumption value.

Remark       When a detailed scrutiny was conducted in respect of inventories
held by the Ford Motor Company, the following results were obtained.

         1.    9% of the total items (in number) were accounting for 57% of the
               total value of the inventory. These were classed as `A' items.

         2.    10% of the items (in number) were found to be accounting for 18%
               of the total value. These were categorized as `B' items.

         3.    81% of the items (in number) were found to be accounting for only
               25% of the total value. These were classified as `C' items.

         Similarly, when ABC ANALYSIS was done in the case of G.E.C., the results
         obtained were as under:

         `A' Category—Items accounting for 8% of the total number but 75% of total




                                                          om
value.




                                                      i.c
       `B' Category—Items accounting for 25% of the total number and 20% of
total value.
                                                 ng
       `C' Category—Items accounting for 67% of the total number and only 5% of
                                              si
the total value.
                                        om


It would thus be observed that substantial and effective controls are made
                                   om



possible if greater attention is focused on `A' category items since these would
be covering quite a substantial part of the inventory in terms of shilling value.
