Example 2
                        w




250 members of a certain society have voted to elect a new chairman. Each
                     w




member may vote for either one or two candidates. The candidate elected
                  w




is the one who polls most votes
Three candidates x, y z stood for election and when the votes were
counted, it was found that
    - 59 voted for y only, 37 voted for z only
    - 12 voted for x and y, 14 voted for x and z
    - 147 voted for either x or y or both x and y but not for z
    - 102 voted for y or z or both but not for x

Required
   i)    How may voters did not vote
   ii)   How many voters voted for x only
   iii)  Who won the elections
