Merits of quartile deviation
                     w




  i)      In certain respect it is superior to range as a measure of variation
  ii)     It has a special utility in measuring variation in cases of open –
          ended distribution
  iii)    It has also useful in erratic or highly skewed distribution where
          the other measure of variation would be warped by extreme
          values. It is not affected by the presence of extreme values.



Limitation
   i)     Quartile deviation ignores 50% item as the value of quartile
          deviation does not depend upon every observation it cannot be
          regarded as a god method of measuring variation.
   ii)    It is not capable of mathematical manipulation

   71
   iii)   Its value sis very much affected by sampling fluctuation
   iv)    It is in fact not a measure of variation as it really does not show
          the scatter around an average but rather a distance on scale.

(d) Standard deviation
The standard deviation measures the absolute dispersion (or variability of
distribution, the greater amount of dispersion or variability). The greater
the standard deviation the greater will be the magnitude of the deviations
of the value from their mean.
A small standard deviation means a high degree of uniformity of the
observation as well as homogeneity of a series.
A large standard deviation means just the opposite.
Difference between deviation and standard deviation
Both these measure of dispersion are based on each and very item of the
distribution. But they differ in the following respects.
     Algebraic signs are ignores while calculating mean deviation whereas

     Mean deviation can be computed either from median or mean. The
