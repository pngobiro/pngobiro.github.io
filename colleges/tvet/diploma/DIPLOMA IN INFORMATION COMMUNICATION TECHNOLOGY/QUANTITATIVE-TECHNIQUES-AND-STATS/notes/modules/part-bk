                    MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY

Specific Objectives
At the end of this topic the trainee should be able to:
     Define the measures of central tendency;
     State the properties of the measure of central tendency;
     Determine the measures of central tendency.


Introduction
Measures of central tendency show the tendency of some central value
around which data tends to cluster. These are statistical values which tend
to occur at the centre of any well ordered set of data. Whenever these
measures occur they do not indicate the centre of that data
