Rules for solving linear inequalities
                                            om

Suppose M, M1, N, N1 and P are expressions that may or may not involve
variables, then the corresponding rules for solving inequalities will be:
                                    om



Rule 1: Addition rule
         If M > N and M1> N1
                                as




Then M + P > N + P and
                              .m
                         w




         M1 + P >N1+ P
                         w
                    w




Rule 2: Subtraction Rule
         If M < N and M1 ≥N1
Then M – P < N – P and
         M1 – P ≥N1– P
Rule 3: Multiplication rule
         If M ≥N and M1 > N1 and P≠ 0
         Then MP ≥NP; M1P > N1P
         M (-P) ≤ N (-P) and M1 (-P) < N1(-P)
Rule 4: Division
         If M > N and M1< N1 and P≠ 0
    9
          Then M/P > N/P: M1/P < N1/P
          M/ (-P) < N/ (-P): and M1/ (-P) > N1/ (-P)
Rule 5: Inversion Rule
          If M/P ≤ N/Q where P, Q ≠ 0
          M1/P > N1/Q
          Then P/M ≥ Q/N and P/M1 < Q/N1
Note: The rules for solving equations are the same as those for solving
equations with one exception; when both sides of an equation is multiplied
or divided by a negative number, the inequality symbol must be reversed
(see rule 3 & Rule 4 above).
