Solution
The frequency polygon of the above data are shown bellow
                       w




Draw graph
                    w




 Smoothed frequency curve
                 w




The following points should be kept in mind while smoothing a frequency
graph.
Only frequency distribution based on sample should be smoothed
Only continuous series should be smoothed
The total area under the curve should be equal to the area under the
original histogram or polygon.

Draw a histogram frequency polygon and frequency curve representing the
following information

Cumulative frequency curve / ogives
Sometimes one needs to know the answers to questions like how May
workers of a factory earn more the Rs 1500 per month
There are two methods of constructing a cumulative frequency curve
namely;
The less than method
The more than method




                                                     om
Less than method; in the less than method we start with the upper limit of
the classes and go on adding the frequencies. When these frequencies are




                                                  i.c
plotted we get a rising curve.

                                             ng
More than method; in the more than method, we start with the upper limits
of the classes and from the total frequencies we subtract the frequency of
                                          si
each class. When the frequencies are plotted we get a declining curve.
