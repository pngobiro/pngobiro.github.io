h) Spurious Correlations
    in some rare situations when plotting the data for x and y we may have
    a group showing either positive correlation or –ve correlation but when
    you analyze the data for x and y in normal life there may be no
    convincing evidence that there is such a relationship. This implies
    therefore that the relationship only exists in theory and hence it is
    referred to as spurious or non sense e.g. when high pass rates of student
    show high relation with increased accidents.

Correlation coefficient
   These are numerical measures of the correlations existing between the
   dependent and the independent variables. These are better measures of
   correlation than scatter graphs (diagrams).The range for correlation
   coefficients lies between +ve 1 and –ve 1. A correlation coefficient of +1
