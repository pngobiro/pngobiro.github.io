The table value of F at 5% level of significance for V 1 = 9 and V2 = 11. Since
the calculated value of F is less than the table value, we accept the
hypothesis. The samples may have been drawn from the two populations
having the same variances.

Chi square hypothesis tests (Non-parametric test)(X2)
They include amongst others
   i.     Test for goodness of fit
   ii.    Test for independence of attributes
   iii.   Test of homogeneity
   iv.    Test for population variance

The Chi square test (χ2) is used when comparing an actual (observed)

These tests are used when we want to determine whether an actual sample
distribution matches a known theoretical distribution
                                as




The null hypothesis usually states that the sample is drawn from the
                               .m




theoretical population distribution and the alternate hypothesis usually
states that it is not.

Mr. Nguku carried out a survey of 320 families in Ateka district, each family
had 5 children and they revealed the following distribution
No. of boys       5       4        3      2        1        0
No. of girls      0       1        2      3        4        5
No. of families   14      56       110    88       40       12

Is the result consistent with the hypothesis that male and female births are
equally probable at 5% level of significance?

Solution
If the distribution of gender is equally probable then the distribution
conforms to a binomial distribution with probability P(X) = ½.
Therefore
