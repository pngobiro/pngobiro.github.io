INTRODUCTION
A matrix is a rectangular array of items or numbers. These items or
numbers are arranged in rows and columns to represent some information.
The position of an element in one matrix is very important as well be seen
later; therefore an element is located by the number of the row and




                                                                    om
column which it occupies. The size of a matrix is defined by the number of
its rows (m) and column (n).

are (2 x 2) and (3 x 3) matrices since A has 2 rows and 2 columns and B has
3 rows and 3 columns.

A matrix A with three rows and four columns is given by one of:

Types of matrices
Equal Matrices
Two matrices A and B are said to be equal, that is

         A=B            or  a ij  =  bij 

If and only if they are identical if they both have the same number of rows
and columns and the elements in the corresponding locations in the two
matrices should be the same, that is, aij = bij for all i. And j.

Example
                                   3 4 0  3 4 0
The following matrices are equal  2 2 3  =  2 2 3 
