deserve more attention, but this point may be overlooked if classification of
items is not reviewed and updated.

The following steps are involved in implementing the ABC analysis:

1.      Classify the items of inventories, determining the expected use in units
        and price per unit for each item.
2.      Determine the total value of each item by multiplying the expected units
by its unit price.
3.      Rank the item in accordance with the total value, giving first rank to the
        item with highest total value and so on.
4.      Compute the ratios (percentage) of number of units of each item to total
        units of all items and the ratio of total value of each item total value of
        all items.

Combine items on the basis of their relative value to form three categoriesâ€”A, B
and C.

The tabular and graphic representation indicates that "Item A" forms a minimum
proportion, 15 per cent of total units of all items, but represents the higher
value, 70 per cent. On the other hand, "Item C" represents 55 per cent of the
total units and only 10 per cent of the total value. "Item B" occupies the middle
place. Items A and B jointly represent 45 per cent of the total units and 90 per
cent of the investment. More than half of the total units are item C,
representing merely 10 per cent of the investment. Thus, a tighter control
should be exercised on "Item A" in order to maximize profitability on its
investment. In case of "Item C" simple controls will be sufficient.
