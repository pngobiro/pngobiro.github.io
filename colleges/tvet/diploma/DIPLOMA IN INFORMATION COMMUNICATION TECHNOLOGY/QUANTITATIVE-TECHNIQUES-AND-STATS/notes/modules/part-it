INVENTORY PLANNING & CONTROL UNDER UNCERTAINTY
The basic EOQ model assumes that all the parameters (elements) in the model
                                                 ng
are certain (i.e. can be predicted accurately in advance). These parameters
                                               si
are:
                                         om

i.     Demand or usage of stocks
ii.    Lead times.
                                  om



iii.   Holding costs per unit, ordering costs per order and costs per unit.

In reality however, stock demand, supplies lead times and cost date are not

situations we must consider uncertainty when planning for inventory levels.

                     w




To protect itself from conditions of uncertainty, a firm will maintain a level of
               w




safety stocks for raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods stocks. Thus
safety stocks are the amount of stocks that are carried in excess of the expected
use during the lead time to provide a cushion against running out of stocks. Thus
the reorder point is computed as safety stock plus the average usage during the
lead time
i.e. reorder point =       Average usage during lead time + safety (buffer)
stock.




DETERMINING THE SAFETY STOCKS LEVEL
1.   Uncertainty of demand

       Demand is the most troublesome variable to predict accurately. Actually,
       demand may fluctuate from day to day, from week to week or from
                                         286
        month to month. Thus, the firm takes the risk of running out of stocks if
        there are sudden increases in demand. Hence safety stock is the extra
        inventory held as a buffer of protection against the possibility of stock
        due to higher demand.

        However, a larger inventory of safety stock will involve a higher inventory
        carrying costs, and on the other hand, the higher safety stock will
        decrease stock-out costs. Therefore one has to make a balance between
        these two costs in order to find out an optimal safety costs.
