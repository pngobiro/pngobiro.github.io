   Since 3.45 > 2.33 reject the null hypothesis but accept the alternative
   hypothesis at 1% level of significance i.e. there is a significant
   difference between the reading speed of Males and females, thus
   females are actually faster readers.

TEST OF HYPOTHESIS ON PROPORTIONS
This follows a similar method to the one for means except that the standard
error used in this case:
                      Pq
              Sp =
                      n
                                     P
       Z score is calculated as, Z =          Where P = Proportion found
                                      Sp
in the sample.
                                              Π – the hypothetical
proportion.

Example




                                                      i.c
A member of parliament (MP) claims that in his constituency only 50% of the
total youth population lacks university education. A local media company
                                                 ng
wanted to acertain that claim thus they conducted a survey taking a sample
                                              si
of 400 youths, of these 54% lacked university education.
                                        om

Required:
At 5% level of significance confirm if the MP‘s claim is wrong.
                                   om




Solution.
                              as




Note: This is a two tailed tests since we wish to test the hypothesis that
                          .m




       the hypothesis is different (≠) and not against a specific alternative
       hypothesis e.g. < less than or > more than.
                       w
                    w




      H0 : π = 50% of all youth in the constituency lack university
                 w




education.
      H1 : π ≠ 50% of all youth in the constituency lack university
education.
              pq      0.5 x0.5
      Sp =       =             = 0.025
               n        400
           0.54  0.50
      Z=               = 1.6
              0.025

at 5% level of significance for a two-tailored test the critical value is 1.96
since calculated Z value < tabulated value (1.96).
       i.e. 1.6 < 1.96 we accept the null hypothesis.
Thus the MP‘s claim is accurate.

HYPOTHESIS TESTING OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROPORTIONS

Example
Ken industrial manufacturers have produced a perfume known as
―fianchetto.‖ In order to test its popularity in the market, the
manufacturer carried a random survey in Back rank city where 10,000
consumers were interviewed after which 7,200 showed preference. The
manufacturer also moved to area Rook town where he interviewed 12,000
consumers out of which 1,0000 showed preference for the product.
