set of data.
       Σy = an + bΣx

Where Σy = Sum of y values
                                       om

       Σxy = sum of the product of x and y
       Σx = sum of x values
       Σx2= sum of the squares of the x values
                                 om



       a = The intercept on the y axis
       b = Slope gradient line of y on x
                              as




NB: The above regression line is normally used in one way only i.e. it is
                          .m




used to estimate the y values when the x values are given.
Regression line of x on y i.e. x = a + by
                          w




    - The fact that regression lines can only be used in one way leads to
                      w




       what is known as a regression paradox
                      w




    - This means that the regression lines are not ordinary mathematical
       line graphs which may be used to estimate the x and y
       simultaneously
    - Therefore one has to be careful when using regression lines as it
       becomes necessary to develop an equation for x and y before doing
       the estimation.
The following example will illustrate how regression lines are used

Determine the regression equations of
      i. y on x and hence estimate the cost of a piece of land with 4.5
hectares

      ii. Estimate the expected average if the piece of land costs £ 900,000
               Σy = an + bΣxy
