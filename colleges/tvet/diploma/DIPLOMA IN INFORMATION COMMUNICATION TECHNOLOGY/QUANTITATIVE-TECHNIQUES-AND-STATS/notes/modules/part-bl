N/B. The following statistical terms are commonly used in statistical
calculations. They must therefore be clearly understood.



i) Class limits
These are numerical values which limits the extend of a given class i.e. all
the observations in a given class are expected to fall within the interval
which is bounded by the class limits e.g. 15 & 19 are class limits as in the
table of the example above.

   49
ii) Class boundaries
These are statistical boundaries, which separate one class from the other.
They are usually determined by adding the lower class limit to the next
upper class limit and dividing by 2 e.g. in the above table the class
                                                19 + 20
boundary between 19 and 20 is 19.5 which is =             .
                                                   2

iii) Class mid points
These are very important values which mark the center of a given class.
They are obtained by adding together the two limits of a given class and
dividing the result by 2.

iv) Class interval/width




                                                              om
This is the difference between an upper class boundary and lower class
boundary. The value usually measures the length of a given class.

    Mode
