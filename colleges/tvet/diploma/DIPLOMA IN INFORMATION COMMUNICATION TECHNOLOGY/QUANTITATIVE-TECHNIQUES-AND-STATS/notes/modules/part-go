Where for example second element in the first row, that is 0.2850 is the
result of multiplying the corresponding elements of the first row of S by the
second column of S and summing the product.

             0.2850=          0.70 × 0.20 + 0.20 × 0.65 + 0.10 × 0.15
                              =      0.14 + 0.13 + 0.015 e.t.c.

       ii.       The resulting matrix may be interpreted in the following way
                 Of the original customers who buy BM1, 54.5% will remain loyal to
                 the brand in month three, 28.5% will have switched to BM2 and
                 17% will have switched to BM3.
      211
          Of the original customers who buy BM2, 48.7% will remain loyal to
          the brand in month three 34.25% will have switched to BM1 and
          17% will have switched to BM3
          Of the original customers who buy BM3, 66% will remain loyal to
          the brand in month three 11.25% will have switched to BM1 and
          22.75% will have switched to BM2
          Alternatively
          In month three 54.5% of the customers buying BM1 are original
          customers. 34.5% came from BM2 originally and remaining 11.25%
          have switched from BM3 and so on.

MARKOV CHAINS/PROCESSES




                                                       om
The Markov processes are defined as a set of trials which follow a certain
sequence which depend on a given set of probabilities known as transition




                                                   i.c
probabilities. These probabilities indicate how a particular activity or
product moves from one state to another.

Applications of Markov Chains in Business
                                      om

The Markov processes or chains are frequently applied as follows:-
1. Brand Switching
                                  om



By using the transitional probabilities we can be able to express the manner
                             as




in which consumers switch their tastes from one product to another.
                         .m




2. Insurance industry

Markov analysis may be used to study the claims made by the insured

persons and also decide the level of premiums to be paid in future.
                w




3. Movement of urban population
By formulating a transition matrix for the current population in the urban
areas, one can be able to determine what the population will be in say 5
years.

4. Movement of customers from one bank to another.
It is a fact that customers tend to look for efficient banks. Therefore at a
certain time when a given bank installs such machinery as computers it will
tend to attract a number of customers who will move from certain banks to
efficient ones.
