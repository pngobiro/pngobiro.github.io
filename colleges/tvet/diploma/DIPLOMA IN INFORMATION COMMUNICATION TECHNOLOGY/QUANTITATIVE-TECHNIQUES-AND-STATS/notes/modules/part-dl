Example
From a pack of playing cards what is the probability of;
(i)   Picking either a ‗Diamond‘ or a ‗Heart‘ → mutually exclusive
                                                   as




(ii)  Picking either a ‗Flower‘ or an ‗Ace‘ → independent events
                                              .m




Solution.
                                          w




(i)    P (Diamond or Heart)
                                 w




       = P (Diamond) + P (Heart)
                           w




             13       13        26
         =                
             52       52        52
         = 0.5

(ii)     P (Flower or Ace)
                = P (Flower) + P (Ace) – P (Flower and Ace)
                           13        4        1
                      =                  
                           52        52       52
                           4
                      =         = 0.31
                           52

         Note: that the formula used incase of independent events is different
         to the one of mutually exclusive.

There are mainly four schools of thought on probability
   i)    the classical to priors approach
   ii)   the relative frequency of empirical approach
   iii)  the axiomatic approach
   iv)   the personalistic approach


The classical approach
This school of thought assumes that all the possible outcomes of an
experiment are mutually exclusive and equally likely.
P (E) = number of outcomes favorable to the occurrence of event E       =     a
