   4. Chi squared test
                             as




   It can be used to test the association between attributes or the
   goodness of fit of an observed frequency distribution to a standard

Example 1
                   w




A certain NGO carried out a survey in a certain community in order to
                w




establish the average at which the girls are married. The results of the
survey indicated that the marriage age for the girls is 19 years
In order to establish the validity of the mean marital age, a sample of 50
women was interviewed and the average age indicated that they got
married at the age of 16 years. However the different ages at which they
were married differed with the standard deviation of 2.1years
The sample data indicates that the marital age is less 19 years. Is this
conclusion true or not?

Required
Conduct a statistical test to either support the above conclusion drawn
from the sample statistics i.e. the marriage age is less than 19 years, use a
level of significance of 5%

  146
Solution
   1. Null hypothesis
       H0: μ (mean marital age) = 19 years
       Alternative hypothesis      H1: μ (mean marital age) < 19 years
   2. The level of significance is 5%
   3. The test statistics is the sample mean age, X = 16 years
   4. The critical value of the one tailed test (one tailed because the
       alternative hypothesis is an inequality) at 5% level of significance is –
       1.65
