                        <h3>What is Algebra?</h3>
                        <p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics in which, instead of using numbers, we use letters to represent numbers.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="example-card">
                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>We all know that 2+3=5.</p>
                        <p>Suppose, though, that we substitute letters for the first two numbers, so that:</p>
                        <pre class="math-example">
2=a
3=b</pre>
                        <p>We can then write:</p>
                        <pre class="math-example">a+b=5</pre>

                        <div class="note-box">
                            <p>All that has happened is that we have replaced the numbers with letters. However, a number is a specific quantity – e.g., 5 is more than 4, but less than 6 – whereas a letter can be used to represent any number. Thus in the above expression, 'a' could be 4 and 'b' could be 1. We only know that they are 2 and 3 respectively because we defined them as such before.</p>
                            <p>The main consequence of this is that algebra uses general expression and gives general results, whereas arithmetic (using numbers) uses definite numbers and gives definite results. Arithmetic is specific whereas algebra is general.</p>
