       There are two methods of classifying the data according to class
       interval namely
   - Exclusive method.
                               as




   - Inclusive method.
                          .m




   (a) Exclusive method.
   When the class interval are so fixed that the upper limit of one class is
                       w




   the lower limit of the next class, it is known as the exclusive method of
                    w




   classification .this can be illustrated as follow.
                 w




   Class interval   No of items
   10-20            5
   20-30            3
   30-40            4
   40-50            6
   50-60            2
   60-70            1


It is clear that the exclusive method ensures continuity of data in as much
as the upper limit of one class is the lower limit of the next class.

Whenever this method is used it is always assumed that the upper limit is
exclusive i.e the observation exactly equals to the upper limit is not
included in that class.


    (b) Inclusive method.
Under this method the upper limit of one class is included in that class
itself.this can be illustrated as below:

Class interval   frequency
1-10             2
11-20            5
21-30            4
31-40            10
41-50            15
51-60            30




                                                        om
61-70            12
71-80            3




                                                    i.c
81-90            2
                                               ng
                                            si
Whenever inclusive method is used for equal class interval is obtained by
                                       om

taking the difference between the two upper limit or lower limit.
