         standard deviation on the other hand is always computed from the

         arithmetic mean because the sum of the squares of the deviation of
         items from arithmetic mean is least.
                                              si
This is one of the most accurate measures of dispersion. It has the following
                                        om

advantages;
    i. It utilizes all the values given
                                  om



    ii. It makes use of both negative and positive values if they occur
    iii.     The standard deviation reflects an accurate impression of how
                                as




             much the sample data varies from the mean. This is because its
             suitability can also be tested using other statistical methods
