   Required:
   a)    Draw a network diagram for the project and determine the critical
         path and its duration.
   b)    Assuming that all activities start as soon as possible, draw a progress
         chart for the project, showing the times at which each activity takes
         place and the manpower requirements.
   c)    The union has decided that any staff employed on the project must
         be paid for the duration of the project whether they work or not, at
         a rate of £500 per day.


                                      265
Assuming that the same staff is employed on the different activities,
determine the work schedule that will minimise labour costs though
not necessarily the project time. What is the cost associated with
this schedule?

Comment on the validity of the assumption.

INTRODUCTION
The activities of a business during a financial year combine investment projects
