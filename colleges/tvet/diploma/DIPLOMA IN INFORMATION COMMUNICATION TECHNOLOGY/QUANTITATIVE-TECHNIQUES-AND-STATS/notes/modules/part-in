1.     EOQ Model with quantity discounts
       Circumstances frequently occur where firms are able to obtain quantity
       discounts for large purchase orders. Buying in bulk has some advantages
       and disadvantages.
                                                278
        Advantages


        i.    (A saving in purchase rule) Decreases in unit cost, which consists of
              the total amount of discount for the period.

        ii.   A reduction in the total ordering costs because fewer orders are
              placed to take advantages of the discounts.
        Disadvantages
Increased holding cost arising from higher stock levels when large quantities are
purchased.

Such as:
i.      Stock out cost
ii.     Insurance.
iii.    Deterioration
