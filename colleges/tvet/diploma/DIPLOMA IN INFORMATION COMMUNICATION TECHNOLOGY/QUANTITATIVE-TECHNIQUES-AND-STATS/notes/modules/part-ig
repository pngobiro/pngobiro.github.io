Profit is measured conventionally by setting against the sales revenue for a
period the costs expired in earning that revenue. That is, sales are matched
against their relevant costs. Profit is therefore more evenly reported than it
would be if all cash receipts and payments, capital and revenue, were fully
reflected in the accounts of the period in which they are received and paid.

The management accountant also adopts the matching principle when preparing
control information in both actual and budgeted form, and also ascertains full
product cost as a starting point for setting selling prices.

This outlines the systems and methods used to control the flow of resources
through production and service cost centres, for their eventual inclusion in
product and period costs.

MATERIAL CONTROL
It is said that "any fool can sell"â€”it is buying at the right price that is more
critical to the achievement of a satisfactory return on capital employed. Buying
price is important of course, but buying the right materials, is equally important
if production targets are to be achieved and investment in inventories to be
minimized.


WHAT TO ORDER
This is governed by product specifications, but an efficient buyer will always
have his ear to the ground to discover new and substitute materials and
components of advantageous quality and price. Other economies can be realized
by reducing the variety of materials purchased by standardization, e.g. reducing
the variety of colors of paint stocked, or by introducing value analysis into the
decision process.
