Three clients of Disrupt, Ltd P, Q and Rare direct competitors in the retail
business. In the first week of the year P had 300 customers Q had 250
customers and R had 200 customers. During the second week, 60 of the
original customers of P transferred to Q and 30 of the original customers of
P transferred to R. similarly in the second week 50 of the original customers
of Q transferred to P with no transfers to R and 20 of the original customers
of R transferred to P with no transfers to Q.

Required
a) Display in a matrix the pattern of retention and transfers of customers
   from the first to the second week
             (4 marks)


  208
b) Re-express the matrix that you have obtained in part (a) showing the
   elements as decimal fractions of the original numbers of customers of P,
   Q and R (2 marks) Refer to this re expressed matrix as B
c) Multiply matrix B by itself to determine the proportions of the original
   customers that have been retained or transferred to P, Q and R from the
   second to the third week.     (4 marks)
d) Solve the matrix equation (xyz)B = (xyz) given that x + y + z = 1
      (8 marks)
e) Interpret the result that you obtain in part (d) in relation to the
   movement of customers between P, Q and R
                          (2marks           (Total 20 marks)

Solution
a). Think of each row element as being the point from which the customer
    originated and each column element as being the destination e.g. 210




                                                               om
    customers move from P to P, 60 move from P to Q and 30 move from P
    to R. The sum of the elements of the first row totaling 300 that is the
    number of customers originally with P.
