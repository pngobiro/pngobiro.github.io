N/B: simple tabulation does not tell us very much – although it may be
enough for the question of the moment.

Complex tabulation has two or more characteristics are shown i.e. two or
more aspects of a problem are dealt with at the same time. It is some times
called two path tables. Such tables show two characteristics and are

formed when either the stub or the caption is divided into two coordinate
parts.

Charting data

One of the most convincing and appealing ways in which data may be
presented is through charts
A chart can take the shape of either a diagram or a graph.

Types of diagrams
    One dimensional diagram e.g. bar graphs
    Two dimensional diagram e.g. rectangles squares
    Pictograms and cartograms (circles)

One dimensional diagram
Bar diagrams is the most common type of diagram used in practice.

Merits of bar diagrams
    They‘re readily understood
    They are simplest and easiest to make
    They are effective if the large number of observation is to be
       compared.
Example


Two dimensional diagrams
As distinguished from one dimensional diagrams in which only the length of
the bar is taken into account in two dimensional diagram the length as well
as the width of the bars is considered. Thus the area of the bar represents
the given data.

Pictograms
