There is a final check before output is dispatched. Calculate the probability
that a unit found faulty at this check has come from section 1, S1

Question Four
Assuming a Binomial Distribution what is the probability of a salesman
making 0, 1, 2,3,4,5 or 6 sales in 6 visits if the probability of making a sale
on a visit is 0.3?

Do not use tables for this question.

Question Five

Records show that 60% of students pass their examinations at first attempt.
Using the normal approximation to the binomial, calculate the probability
that at least 65% of a group of 200 students will pass at the first attempt.

Question Six
A batch of 5000 electric lamps has a mean life of 1000 hours and a standard
deviation of 75 hours. Assume a normal distribution.

    a)   How many lamps will fail before 900 hours?
    b)   How many lamps will fail between 950 and 1000 hours?
    c)   What proportion of lamps will fail before 925 hours?
    d)   Given the same mean life, what would the standard deviation
         have to be to ensure that no more than 20% of lamps fail before
         916 hours?

                                 SAMPLING

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE
At the end of the topic the trainee should be able to:
     Discuss the reasons for sampling;
     Differentiate between sampling and census;
     Discuss the various types of sampling.

Introduction
Census method and sampling method can be used in sampling.
Sampling is the only tool which helps to know the characteristics of the
universe or population by examining only a small part of it.

Advantages of sampling method




                                                         om
   i)    It is cheaper to collect data as only a small part of the whole
         population is studied.




                                                   i.c
   ii)   The data are collected and analyzed more quickly. Thuds

   iii)
         sampling saves a lot of time.

         A good quality of labor with better supervision can be provided
                                            si
         since only a part of the whole population is to be studied.
                                       om

   iv)   An investigation of small part of the population gives us more
         detailed information.
