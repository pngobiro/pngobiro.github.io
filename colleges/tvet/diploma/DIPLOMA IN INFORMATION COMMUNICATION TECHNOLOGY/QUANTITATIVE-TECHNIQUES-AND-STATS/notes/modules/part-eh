Solution
                           w




Here
                       w




                 45
n = 600; p =        = 0.075
                    w




                600
        q = 1 – 0.075 = 0.925

Sp =
        pq
           =
                   0.075 0.925
        n               600

        = 0.011

Population proportion
      = P ± 2.58 (Sp)
      = 0.075 ± 2.58 (0.011)

        = 0.075 ± 0.028


  138
        = 0.047 to 0.10

        = between 4.7% to 10%

d) Estimation of difference between population proportions
Let the two proportions be given by P1 and P2, respectively
Then the difference (absolute) between the two proportions is given by (P1
– P2)
The standard error is given by
                    pq pq             p n  p2 n2
       S P  P  =       where p = 1 1          and q = 1 - p
           1 2      n1 n2               n1  n2


Then given the confidence level, the confidence interval between the two
population proportions is given by




                                                         om
      (P1 – P2) ± Confidence level S P1  P2 




                                                     i.c
                          pq pq
                            
        = (P1 – P2) ± Z
                          n1 n2                  ng
                                             si
             p1n1  p2 n2
Where P =                 always remember to convert P1 & P2 to P.
                                        om

               n1  n2

(a)     Estimation of population mean
                              as




If the sample size is small (n<30) the arithmetic mean of small samples are
not normally distributed. In such circumstances, students‘
                          .m




t-distribution must be used to estimate the population mean.
