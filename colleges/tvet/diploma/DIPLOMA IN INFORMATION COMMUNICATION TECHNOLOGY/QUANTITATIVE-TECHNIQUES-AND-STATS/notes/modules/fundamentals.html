                    <div class="role-card">
                        <h3>1. They provide a tool for scientific analysis</h3>
                        <p>These techniques provides executives with a more precise description of the cause and effect relationship and risks underlying the business operations in measurable terms and this eliminates the conventional intuitive and subjective basis on which management used to formulate their decisions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>2. They provide solution for various business problems</h3>
                        <p>Are used in the field of production, procurement, marketing, finance and other allied fields. Problems like how best can managers and executives allocate available resources to various products so that in a given time the profits are maximized or costs are minimized. Is it possible for an enterprise to arrange the time and quantity of orders of its stocks such that the overall profit with given resources is maximized?</p>
                        
                        <h3>3. They enable proper development of resources</h3>
                        <p>E.g. programmed evaluation and review techniques (PERT) enables us to determine earliest and the latest time for each of the events and activities and thereby helps in the identification of the critical path. All these helps in deployment of resources from one activity to another to enable the project completion on time.</p>
                        
                        <h3>4. They help in minimizing waiting and servicing time</h3>
                        <p>The queuing theory helps management in minimizing the total waiting of servicing costs. It also analyses the feasibility of adding facilities and thereby helping to take correct and profitable decision.</p>
                        
                        <h3>5. They enable management to decide when to buy and how much to buy</h3>
                        <p>The main objective of inventory planning is to achieve balance between the costs of holding stock and benefits of holding stock. Helps in determining when to buy and how much to buy.</p>
                        
                        <h3>6. They assist in choosing an optimum strategy</h3>
                        <p>In a competitive situation game theory helps to determine optimum strategy which maximizes profits or minimizes loses but adopting optimum strategy.</p>
                        
                        <h3>7. They render great help in optimum resource allocation</h3>
                        
                        <h3>8. They facilitate the process of decision making</h3>
                        
                        <h3>9. They provide system understanding</h3>
                        <p>Through various QTs management can know the reactions of the integrated business systems.</p>
