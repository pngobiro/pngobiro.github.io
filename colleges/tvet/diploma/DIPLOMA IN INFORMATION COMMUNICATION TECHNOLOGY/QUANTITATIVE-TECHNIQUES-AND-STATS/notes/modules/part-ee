(b) Estimation of difference between two means
We know that the standard error of a sample is given by the value of the
                                                as




standard deviation (σ) divided by the square root of the number of items in
                                         .m




the sample ( n ).
But, when given two samples, the standard errors is given by
                                   w




                                S A2 S B2
                                w




        S X
               AX B   =           
                        w




                                n A nB
Also note that we do estimate the interval not from the mean but from the
difference between the two sample means i.e. X A  X B  .
The appropriate number of confidence level does not change
Thus the confidence interval is given by;
       X A  X B  ± Confidence level SX  X           A   B
                  = X  X  ± Z S 
                                     A B
                            A      B            X   X

Example
Given two samples A and B of 100 and 400 items respectively, they have the
means X 1 = 7 ad X 2 = 10 and standard deviations of 2 and 3 respectively.
