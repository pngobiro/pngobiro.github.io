assumptions and estimates (e.g. annual demand D, holding costs H, & ordering
costs O) and out solutions have obviously been affected by these. When for
example calculating a deterministic EOQ value with maximization of total
inventory costs as the objective, expected annual demand (D) is taken into
account. If we subsequently find that annual demand has differed from that
expected then we will find that the EOQ we selected was not the optimum and,
as a result, the total inventory cost was not actually minimum.

Illustration:

1.    Assume X Ltd expected annual demand for 1991 for 62,500 units of raw
material X per annum.

3.      Assume that the end of the year actual demand has been found to have
        been for 90,000 units, not the 62,500 expected.
