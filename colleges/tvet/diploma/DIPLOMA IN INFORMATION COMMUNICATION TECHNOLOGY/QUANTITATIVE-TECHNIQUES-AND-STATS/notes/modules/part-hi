Rules of integration
                       w




   i.       The integral of a constant
                    w




         ʃadx = ax +c where a = constant
   Example
   Find the following
          a) ʃ23dx
          b) ʃɤ2dx. (where ɤ is a variable independent of x, thus it is treated
             as a constant).

Solution
            i.       ʃ23dx = 23x + c
            ii.      ʃɤ2dx. = ɤ2 x + c

ii. The integral of x raised to the power n
