    4. They help in minimizing waiting and servicing time.
The queuing theory helps management in minimizing the total waiting of

servicing costs. It also analyses the feasibility of adding facilities and
                   w




thereby helping to take correct and profitable decision.

    5. They enable management to decide when to buy and how much to
        buy.
The main objective of inventory planning is to achieve balance between the
costs of holding stock and benefits of holding stock. Helps in determining
when to buy and how much to buy.
    6. They assist in choosing an optimum strategy.
In a competitive situation game theory helps to determine optimum
strategy which maximizes profits or minimizes loses but adopting optimum
strategy.
    7. they render great help in optimum resource allocation
    8. they facilitate the process of decision making
    9. Through various QTs management can know the reactions of the
        integrated business systems.

   ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS

   Algebra




                                                       om
   Algebra is a branch of mathematics in which, instead of using numbers,
   we use letters to represent numbers.




                                                   i.c
   We all know that 2+3=5.
                                              ng
                                           si
   Suppose, though, that we substitute letters for the first two numbers, so
                                      om

   that:
                                om



   2=a

   3=b
                             as

   We can then write:

       a+b=5
