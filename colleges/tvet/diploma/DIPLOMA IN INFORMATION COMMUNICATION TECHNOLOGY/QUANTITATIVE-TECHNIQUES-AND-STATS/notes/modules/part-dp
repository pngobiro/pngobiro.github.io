P(M and A ) = 0.09
P(F and A ) = 0.13
These probabilities can be express differently as;
P(M) = P(M and A) or P(M and A )

        = 0.36 + 0.09 = 0.45

P(F) = P(F and A) or P(F and A )
       = 0.42 + 0.13 = 0.55

P(A) = P(A and M) + P(A and F) = 0.36 + 0.42 = 0.78

 
P A = P( A and M) + P( A and F) = 0.09 + 0.13 = 0.22

Now calculate the probability that a student is studying accounting given
that he is male.

This is a conditional probability given as P(A|M)
           P(A and M)       0.36
P(A|M) =                           0.80

From the formula above we get that,

P(A and M) = P(M) P(A|M) ……………….. (i)
Note that P(A|M) ≠ P(M|A)

Since P(M|A) =                     this is known as the Bayes‘ rule.

Bayes’ rule/Theorem
                   w




This rule or theorem is given by


        P(A|B) =
                              
                   PA   P B A
                        P(B)
It‘s used frequently in decision making where information is given the in
form of conditional probabilities and the reverse of these probabilities must
be found.

Example
Analysis of questionnaire completed by holiday makers showed that 0.75
classified their holiday as good at Malindi. The probability of hot weather
in the resort is 0.6. If the probability of regarding holiday as good given hot


  116
weather is 0.9, what is the probability that there was hot weather if a
holiday maker considers his holiday good?

Solution

P(A|B) =
                     
           PA   P B A
               P(B)

        Let H = hot weather
               G = Good
               P(G) = 0.75 P(H) = 0.6 and P(G|H) = 0.9 (Probability of regard
               holiday as good given hot weather)

Now the question requires us to get
      P(H|G) = Probability of (there was) hot weather given that the
      holiday has been rated as good).
                                0.60.9
