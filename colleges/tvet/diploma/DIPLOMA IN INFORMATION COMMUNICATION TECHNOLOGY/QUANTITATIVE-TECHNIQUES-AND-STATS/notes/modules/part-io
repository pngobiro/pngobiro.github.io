Broadly there are two types of discount structures:
i.                                               ng
      Fixed discount on "all units" when the order placed is for a minimum
quantity.
                                                si
ii.   Variable discounts for given ranges.

        When evaluating inventory decisions when a fixed discount rate exists,
                              as




        the appropriate procedure is to compare the total costs of the EOQ with
        the total costs when discounts are taken. The option giving lower costs is

The Unit (variable) cost (i.e. Purchase Price) behaves in the following manner.

              C      =       Co            if    0  Q  Qb
                             Co (1 - P)    if    Q  Qb

                  Where              Co    =     basic unit cost without a discount
                             P      =      Discount rate allowed.
                             Qb     =      Break-point (Quantity)—where discounts
become operational.

In order to determine the optimal ordering quantity, it is necessary to include
the costs of the inventory with the carrying ordering costs.

              Total costs of Inventory     =     Total Purchase cost + Total order
cost + Total carrying cost

                                          279
              TC     =       DCo + Q* H +         Do          If 0  Q  Qb (i)
                                   2              Q2

              TC     =       DC. (1 - P) + Q H    +     Do    If Q  Qb     (ii)
                                           2            Q

Note:
Equation (ii) i.e. with discounts will give a lower TC than equation (i) for the
same. The decision whether to go for the discount lies on a trade-off between
extra carrying costs vs. a reduction in acquisition costs.
