Since 11.11 < -1.96, we reject the null hypothesis but accept the
alternative hypothesis at 5% level of significance i.e. the difference

that the fertilizer had a positive effect on the harvest of maize

Example 2
An observation was made about reading abilities of males and females. The
observation lead to a conclusion that females are faster readers than
males. The observation was based on the times taken by both females and
males when reading out a list of names during graduation ceremonies.
In order to investigate into the observation and the consequent conclusion a
sample of 200 men were given lists to read. On average each man took 63
seconds with a standard deviation of 4 seconds
A sample of 250 women were also taken and asked to read the same list of
names. It was found that they on average took 62 seconds with a standard
deviation of 1 second.

Required
By conducting a statistical hypothesis testing at 1% level of significance
establish whether the sample data obtained does support earlier
observation or not
