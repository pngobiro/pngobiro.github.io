LIMITATIONS OF ABC ANALYSIS
Although ABC analysis is a fundamental tool for exercising selective control over
numerous inventory items, it does not, in its present form, permit precise
consideration of all relevant problems of inventory management. For instance, a
never-ending problem in inventory management is that of adequately handling
thousands of low-value `C' items. Low-value purchases frequently require more
items and thereby reduce the time allowance available to purchasing personnel
for value analysis, vendor investigation, and other `B' items.

Besides, if ABC analysis is not periodically reviewed and updated, the very
approach of control may be defeated. For example, `C' items like diesel oil in a
firm, will become most high-value items during power crisis should, therefore,
