and this has to be balanced against the cost of running out of stock. `Stock outs'
may cause loss of customers and the probability of this happening at various

CONTROLLING MATERIAL FLOW
Figure 3 outlines the progressive stages in purchasing, issuing and recording

materials in a manufacturing concern. An efficient system of documenting and
recording is vitally necessary, not only for accounting purposes, but to ensure
                         .m




that the right materials arrive at the right place at the right time.

The purchase requisition submitted to the buyer may be triggered automatically
if the system is computerised, by a message from the stores ledger that the
                w




reorder level has been reached. Other requests to purchase may be raised by
the production planning department for new product materials not yet carried in
stock, and also by any departmental head for supplies and equipment of any
kind.

The buyer, ideally after making enquiries of several suppliers, sends a purchase
order, and eventually the material is received, checked by the good-inwards
department as to quality and quantity, and is detailed on a goods-received note
(GRN). One copy of the GRN goes to the buyer to write off the outstanding order
record; one to the accounts department for checking against the order and
invoiceâ€”the latter authorizing payment to the supplier; and one to the stores
department with the materials.

A stores record is maintained into which the quantity and value of materials
received is entered. Issues of materials to production are made by authorized
materials requisitions which are also entered into the stores ledger to keep that
