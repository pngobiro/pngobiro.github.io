Rules of Probability
                    w




(a)   Additional Rule – This rule is used to calculate the probability of two
                   w




      or more mutually exclusive events. In such circumstances the
      probability of the separate events must be added.

        Example
        What is the probability of throwing a 3 or a 6 with a throw of a die?


        Solution
        P (throwing a 3 or a 6) = 1  1  1
                                   6    6     3

(b)     Multiplicative rule
        This is used when there is a string of independent events for which
        individual probability is known and it is required to know the overall
        probability.

        Example
        What is the probability of a 3 and a 6 with two throws of a die?

        Solution
        P (throwing a 3) and P (6)
              = P (3) and P (6) = 1  1  1

        Note: 1)     In probability ‗and‘ is replaced by ‗x‘ – multiplication.



              2)     P(x) and P(y) ≠ P(x and y) note that these two are
                     different. The first implies P(x) happening and P(y),
                     but if the order of which happened first is unimportant




                                                                         om
                     then we have p(x and y).

Conditional Probability

This is the probability associated with combinations of events but given that
some prior result has already been achieved with one of them.

        It‘s expressed in the form of
               P (x|y) = Probability of x given that y has already occurred.
