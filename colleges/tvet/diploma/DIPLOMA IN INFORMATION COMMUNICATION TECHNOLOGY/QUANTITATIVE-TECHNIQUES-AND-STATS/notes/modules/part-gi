SIMPLE INPUT – OUTPUT ANALYSIS
The input output analysis is a topic which requires application of matrices
The technique analyses the flow of inputs from one sector of the economy
to the other sectors thus the technique is quite useful in studying the
interdependence of sectors within a single economy.
The input – output analysis was first developed by Prof Leontief hence the
Leontief matrix has been developed. See the following example

NB: In the above table, one should be able to interpret the table e.g. of the
total demand of 2060 metric tones from the agricultural sector; 300 is
produced for the agricultural sector, 360 for industrial sector, 320 for the

service sector and 1080 metric tones makes up the final demand.
The final demand is the additional demand besides the sectoral demand

other manufacturers not included in the other sectors.
