c) Estimation of population proportions
                             w




This type of estimation applies at the times when information cannot be
                         w




given as a mean or as a measure but only as a fraction or percentage
                         w




The sampling theory stipulates that if repeated large random samples are
taken from a population, the sample proportion ―p‘ will be normally
distributed with mean equal to the population proportion and standard
error equal to
                          Pq
                    Sp =      = Standard error for sampling of population
                           n
              proportions
Where n is the sample size and q = 1 – p.
The procedure for estimating a proportion is similar to that for estimating a
mean, we only have a different formula for calculating standard.

Example 1
In a sample of 800 candidates, 560 were male. Estimate the population
proportion at 95% confidence level.

Solution
Here
                            560
Sample proportion (P) =         = 0.70
                            800
        q = 1 – p = 1 – 0.70 = 0.30
        n = 800
           pq
              =
                      0.70  0.30 
           n              800

        Sp = 0.016


Population proportion
      = P ± 1.96 Sp where 1.96 = Z.




                                                       om
      = 0.70 ± 1.96 (0.016)




                                                   i.c
        = 0.70 ± 0.03

        = 0.67 to 0.73                            ng
                                              si
                                             om

        = between 67% to 73%
