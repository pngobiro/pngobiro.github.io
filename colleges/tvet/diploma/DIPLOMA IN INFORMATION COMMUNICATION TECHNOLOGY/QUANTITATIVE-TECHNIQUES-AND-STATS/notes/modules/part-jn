For Long castling breweries we have limited machine hours (12hrs/day), which
must be shared among production of Benko and Benoni lagers.
Therefore production must be such that the numbers of machine hours required
is less than or equal to 12 hours per day.
        0.5X1+0.33X2 ≤ 12hrs

Similarly for labor hours we have:
       0.5X1+0.5X2 ≤ 14hrs

Non-Negativity: It is logical assumption to assume that the company cannot
manufacture negative amounts of a product, thus it can only manufacture
either zero product or more. Therefore we have:    X1≥0
                    X2≥0         or    X1, X2≥0

                                       310
Thus the complete linear programming model is;
      Maximize 4X1 + 3X2

Subject to the constraints;
      0.5X1 + 0.33X2 ≤ 12
      0.5X1 + 0.5X2 ≤ 14
      X1 X2 ≥ 0

Solving linear programming problems
The question requires us to optimize (in our case, maximize) the objective (the
contribution function), or in simple terms we are required to solve the linear
programming model.
Solving linear programming model entails finding the values of variables that
satisfy all inequalities simultaneously and optimize the objective.

Graphical solution
This method is used to solve LP models in case where only two variables are




                                                     om
involved. For more than two variables (multivariable) then the simplex
technique (algebraic method may be used).




                                                 i.c
Now in solving the problem above we first draw the axis, taking X1 to be the y
axis and X2 to be the X axis.
                                               ng
                                            si
                                      om

X1
                                om
                              as
                        .m
                     w
                  w
               w

                                                    X2

Next we plot the scales on each axis to approximate the scales to use them, we
consider each constraint equation. We get the value of one of variables putting
the other variable to be zero and by substituting the inequality ≤or ≥ with
equality sign (=).

For:          0.5X1 + 0.33X2 ≤ 12
When          X1 = 0
       0.5(0) + 0.33X2 = 12
       0.33X2 = 12
       X2 = 12/0.33 = 36
Therefore point to plot is        (   36, 0)             … Implying that when
X2 = 36 then X1 = 0
                                      311
When X2 = 0
      0.5X1 + 0.33(0) = 12
      0.5X1 = 12
      X1 = 12/0.5 = 24
Therefore the point is (0, 24)

For   0.5X1 + 0.5X2 ≤ 14
When X1 = 0
      0.5(0) + 0.5X2 = 14
      0.5X2 = 14
      X2 = 14/0.5 = 28
Therefore the point is (28, 0)

When X2 = 0
      0.5X1 + 0.5(0) = 14
      0.5X1 = 14




                                                        om
      X1 = 14/0.5 = 28
Therefore the point is (0, 28)
