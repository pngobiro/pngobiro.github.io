                           σ       5


   ∴ the area between Z = -2 and Z = -1
   Probability area corresponding to Z = -2
      = 0.4772 (the z value to check from the tables is 2)
   Probability area corresponding to Z = -1
      = 0.3413 (the z value for this case is 1)
   ∴ the probability that the age lies between 25 and 30 yrs
     = 0.4772 – 0.3413 (The area under this curve)
     P = 0.1359

   Probability corresponding to Z = 2 = 0.4772 = probability of between 35
      and 45
   ∴ P(Age > 45yrs) = 0.5000 – 0.4772

PRACTICE QUESTION




                                                            om
Question One
The quality controller, Mr. Brooks, at Queensville Engineers has become




                                                     i.c
aware of the need for an acceptance sampling programme to check the

                                                ng
quality of bought-in components. This is of particular importance for a
problem the company is currently having with batches of pump shafts
                                             si
bought in from a local supplier. Mr. Brooks proposes the following criteria
                                        om

to assess whether or not to accept a large batch of pump shafts from this
supplier.
