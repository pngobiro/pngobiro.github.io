The Slope b =

                         = 2.66

and the intercept a =

                   = 5.91
We now insert these values in the linear model giving
           y = 5.91 + 2.66x
or
Delivery time (mins) = 5.91 + 2.66 (delivery distance in miles)

     104
The slope of the regression line is the estimated number of minutes per
mile needed for a delivery. The intercept is the estimated time to prepare
for the journey and to deliver the goods which is the time needed for each
journey other than the actual traveling time.

PREDICTION WITHIN THE RANGE OF SAMPLE DATA
We can use the linear regression model to predict the mean of dependant
variable for any given value of independent variable
For example if the sample model is given by
       Time (min) = 5.91 + 2.66 (distance in miles)
Then if the distance is 4.0 miles then our estimated mean time is
        Ý = 5.91 + 2.66 x 4.0 = 16.6 minutes

Multiple Linear Regression Models
There are situations in which there is more than one factor which influence
the dependent variable

Example




                                                   i.c
Cost of production per week in a large department depends on several
factors;
     i.       Total numbers of hours worked    ng
                                            si
     ii.      Raw material used during the week
                                      om

     iii.     Total number of items produced during the week
     iv.      Number of hours spent on repair and maintenance
                                 om



It is sensible to use all the identified factors to predict department costs
Scatter diagram will not give the relationship between the various factors
and total costs
