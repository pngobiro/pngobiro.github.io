SETS THEORY
Introduction
Sets and set theory
A set is a collection of distinct objects. We may consider all the ocean in
the world to be a set with the objects being whales, sea plants, sharks,
octopus etc, similarly all the fresh water lakes in Africa can form a set.
Supposing A to be a set
          A = {4, 6, 8, 13}


   19
The objects in the set, that is, the integers 4, 6, 8 and 13 are referred to as
the members or elements of the set. The elements of a set can be listed in
any order. For example,
         A = {4, 6, 8, 13} = {8, 4, 13, 6}
Sets are always precisely defined. Each element occurs once and only once
in a set.

The notion  is used to indicate membership of a set. ∉ represents non
membership. However, in order to represent the fact that one set is a
subject of another set, we use the notion  . A set ―S‖ is a subject of
another set ―T‖ if every element in ―S‖ is a member of ―T‖
Example
If A = {4, 6, 8, 13} then

              4  {4, 6, 8, 13} or 4  A; 16 ∉ A




                                                            om

   ii)        {4, 8}  A; {5, 7}  A; A  A
