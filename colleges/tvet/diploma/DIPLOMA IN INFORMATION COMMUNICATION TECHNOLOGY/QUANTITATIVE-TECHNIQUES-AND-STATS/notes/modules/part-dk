Mutually exclusive events

A set of events is said to be mutually exclusive if the occurrence of any one
                                                      om

of the events precludes the occurrence of any of the other events e.g.
when tossing a coin, the events are a head or a tail these are said to be
                                                om



mutually exclusive since the occurrence of heads for instance implies that
tails cannot and has not occurred.

Consider a survey in which a random sample of registered voters is
selected. For each voter selected their sex and political party affiliation
are noted. The events ―KANU‖ and ―woman‖ are not mutually exclusive
because the selection of KANU does not preclude the possibly that the voter

Events are said to be independent when the occurrence of any of the events
does not affect the occurrence of the other(s).
