              Now
                                 .m




              Project duration = 13 days
              Project cost = Shs. 1,300

(c)           Further reducing the critical path by 1 day will require that more than
              one activity is affected because there exist several critical paths.

               Reduce by 1 day            Extra cost           Activities
                                                                critical
               A and B                   60 + 70 = 130            All
               D and E                   40 + 80 = 120            All
               B, C and D                70 + 50 + 40 =           All
                                              160
               A and E                   60 + 80 = 140         A, D, B, E

              From this we realize that reducing D and E is the cheapest.




                                                   254
      However closer examination of the fourth alternative reveals that C is
      now non-critical and has 1 day float. Since we earlier reduced C for Shs.
      50, if we reduce A and E and increase C by a day which will save Shs. 50.

      Then the net cost for 12 day duration = 1,300 + (140 – 50) = 1,390.
