                 3. Power function multiplied by a constant
If given y = Axr, then            dy = rAxr-1
                     dx

                 4. The sum rule
The derivative of the sum of two or more functions equals the sum of the
derivatives of the functions.
For instance
If H(x) = h(x) + g(x)
Then dy or H´(x) = h´(x) + g´(x)
     dx

                 5. The difference rule
                                                224
The derivative of the difference of two or more functions equals the difference
of the derivatives of the functions
If H (£) = h(x) – g(x)
Then H´ (£) = h´(x) – g´(x)
