Methods of set representation

                                                    ng
Capital letters are normally used to represent sets. However, there are two
different methods for representing members of a set:
                                                   si
   i.         The descriptive method and
                                             om

   ii.        The enumerative method
                                      om



The descriptive method involves the description of members of the set in
such a way that one can determine the elements of the set without
                                  as




difficulty.
                             .m




The enumerative method requires that one writes out all the members of
the set within the curly brackets.
                          w




For example, the set of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 can be
                       w




represented ass follows
                    w




         P = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} ,       enumerative method
         P = {X/x = 0, 1, 2…7}                descriptive method
         Or
         P = {x/0 ≤ x ≤7} where x is an integer.


         Types of sets
   a) Finite and infinite sets
A set can be classified as a finite or infinite set, depending upon the
number of elements it has. A finite set has a finite number of elements
whereas an infinite set has an infinite number of elements.

   20
For example, set P below has ten elements and is therefore a finite set. Set
S, on the other hand, is an infinite set since it has an infinite number of
elements.




        P = {2, 4, 6…20}
        S = {1, 3, 5…}
   b) Universal set
The term refers to the set that contains all the elements that an analyst
wishes to study.
The notation U or ξ is generally used to denote universal sets
    c) The null set or empty set




                                                            om
This is a set which contains no elements. It is normally designated by a
Greek letter Ø, or { }.




                                                        i.c
The sets Ø and {Ø} are not the same thing since the former has no elements
                                                    ng
in it, while the later has one element in it, namely zero
                                                si
   d) Equal or equivalent sets
                                          om

Two sets C and D are said to be equal if every member of set C belongs to D
and every member of set D also belongs to C
                                    om
