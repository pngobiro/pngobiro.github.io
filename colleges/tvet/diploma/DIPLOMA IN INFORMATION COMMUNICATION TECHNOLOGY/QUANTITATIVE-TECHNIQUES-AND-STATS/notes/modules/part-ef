At 70% confidence level, then appropriate number is equal to 1.04 (as read
from the normal tables)

We take the absolute value of the difference between the means e.g. the
                                             si
value of X = absolute value of X i.e. a positive value of X.
                                          om

Confidence interval is therefore given by
       = 3± 1.04 (0.25 )      From the normal tables a z value of 1.04 gives a

value of 0.7.

Example 2
A comparison of the wearing out quality of two types of tyres was obtained
by road testing. Samples of 100 tyres were collected. The miles traveled
until wear out were recorded and the results given were as follows
Tyres        T1                   T2
Mean          X1 = 26400 miles X 2 = 25000 miles
Variance     S21= 1440000 miles S22= 1960000 miles
Find a confidence interval at the confidence level of 70%


Solution
X1 = 26400
X 2 = 25000

  136
Difference between the two means
                    
        X 1  X 2 = (26400 – 25000)
               = 1,400




Again we take the absolute value of the difference between the two means
We calculate the standard error as follows

                                                          i.c
                    =      184.4
Confidence level at 70% is read from the normal tables as 1.04 (Z = 1.04).
Thus the confidence interval is calculated as follows
      = 1400 ± (1.04) (184.4)
                                                     ng
                                                  si
                                            om

        = 1400 ± 191.77
