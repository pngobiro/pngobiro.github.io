Total expenditure on shapes each week

QUESTION SIX
Matrix N below shows the number of items of type A, B, and C in warehouses Y
and W. Matrix p shows the cost in pence per day of storing (S) and maintaining
(M) one item each of A, B and C

a) Evaluate the matrix (N×P) and say what it represents.

b) Stock movement occurs as follows:

   At the start of the day 1:
   Withdrawal of 2 type B from warehouse Y, 20 of type A from warehouse
   W.

   At the start of day 2:
   Delivery of 7 type B and 10 of type C to warehouse Y and 15 of type B to
   warehouse W.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
At the end of this topic the trainee should be able to:
     Differentiate algebraic functions;
     Integrate algebraic functions

INTRODUCTION

Calculus is a branch of mathematics which explains how one variable changes
in relationship to another variable. It enables us to find the rate of change of
one variable with respect to another variable.

Example
   i.   The rate at which business revenue is increasing at a particular stage




                                                                   om
        when volume of sales is increasing.
   ii.  The rate at which costs are changing at a particular stage when

        volume of sales is given
   iii. The evaluation of ‗rate of change‘ can help us to identify when the
