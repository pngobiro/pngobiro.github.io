Thus the first test of the maximum points require that the first derivative of a
                      w




function equals zero or
                   w




        dy
             f  x  0

The second text of a maximum point requires that the second derivative of a
function is negative or
       d2y
             f   x   0
       dx 2



Example
Determine the critical value for the following functions and find out the critical
value that constitutes a maximum
       y = x3 – 12x2 + 36x + 8

Solution
       y = x3 – 12x2 + 36x + 8
       then dy        = 3x2 – 24x + 36 +0
                                            231
              dx
   iii.    The critical values for the function are obtained by equating the first
           derivative of the function to zero, that is:
              dy     = 0 or 3x2 – 24x + 36 = 0
              dx
              Hence (x-2) (x-6) = 0
              And x = 2 or 6
The critical values for x are x = 2 or 6 and critical values for the function are y
= 40 or 8
ii. To ascertain whether these critical values of x will give rise to a maximum,
we apply the second text, that is
              d2y    <0
              d2x
              dy     = 3x2 – 24x + 36 and
              dx
              d2y    = 6x - 24
              d2x




                                                        om
           a) When x = 2
              Then d2y = -12 <0
                     d2x



                                                     i.c
           b) When x = 6                        ng
                                                si
              Then d2y = +2 > 0
                                        om

                    d2x
Hence a maximum occurs when x = 2, since this value of x satisfies the second
                                  om



condition. X = 6 does not give rise to a local maximum
                              as




b) Tests for relative minimum
There are two tests for a relative minimum point
