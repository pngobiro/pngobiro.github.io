The table value for t for 9 d.f. at 5% level of significance is 2.26. the
computed value of t is smaller than the table value of t. therefore,
difference is insignificant and the null hypothesis is accepted.


   b) Test of hypothesis about the difference between two means
The t test can be used under two assumptions when testing hypothesis
concerning the difference between the two means; that the two are
normally distributed (or near normally distributed) populations and that the
  158
standard deviation of the two is the same or at any rate not significantly
different.

Appropriate test statistic to be used is
                     X1  X 2
      t      =                     at (n1 + n2 – 2) d.f.
                     S X X 2
                        1 

The standard deviation is obtained by pooling the two sample standard
deviation as shown below.


                  Sp =
                             n1  1 S12   n2  1 S22
                            n1  n2  2
      Where S1 and S2 are standard deviation for sample 1 & 2 respectively.
