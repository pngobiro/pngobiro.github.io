a) Commutative law:                A+B =B+A
b) Associative law: (A + B) + C    = A + (B + C) = A + B + C

Matrix Multiplication


 a) Multiplication of two vectors
Let row vector A represent the selling price in shillings of one unit of




                                                            om
commodity P, Q, R respectively and let column vector B represent the
number of units of commodities P, Q, R sold respectively. Then the vector




                                                        i.c
product A  B will be equal to the total sales value
i. e. A  B =       Total sales value
                                                   ng
                                                si
                                            om

                                   100 
                                       
        Let A =  4 5 6  and B =  200 
                                    om



                                   300 
                                       
                               as




                        100 
                           .m




                            
        then  4 5 6   200  = 400 + 1,000 + 1,800 = Shs 3,200
                        w




                        300 
                            
                     w
                   w




Rules of multiplication
   i.      The row vector must have the same number of elements as the
           column vector
   ii.     The first vector is a row vector and the second is a column vector
   iii.    The corresponding elements in each vector are multiplied
           together and the results obtained are added. This addition is
           always a single number
           Going back to the example given before
                           100 
                               
        A × B =  4 5 6   200  = 4 × 100 + 5 × 200 + 6 × 300=Shs3,200, a single number
                           300 
