Merits of diagrams
    Pictograms have a greater attraction thus stimulate interest in the
      information being presented
    Facts portrayed in pictorial form are generally remembered longer.
Limitations
    They are difficult to construct

Graphs
A large variety of graphs are used in practice. Graphs can be divided under
the following headings
     Time series.
     Z- Charts.
     Scatter graphs
     Semi- logarithmic graphs
     Graphs of frequency distribution

is extremely helpful in analyzing change at different point of time.
Graphs of time series can be constructed either on a natural scale or on a

ratio scale.
