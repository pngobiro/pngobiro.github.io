COMBINED MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION

Sometimes we may need to combine 2 or more samples say A and B. It is
therefore essential to know the new mean and the new standard deviation
                                .m




of the combination of the samples.

Combined mean
Let m be the combined mean
Let x1 be the mean of first sample
Let x2 be the mean of the second sample
Let n1 be the size of the 1st sample
Let n2 be the size of the 2nd sample
Let s1 be the standard deviation of the 1st sample
Let s2 be the standard deviation of the 2nd sample

Example
A sample of 40 electric batteries gives a mean life span of 600 hrs with a
standard deviation of 20 hours.
Another sample of 50 electric batteries gives a mean lifespan of 520 hours
with a standard deviation of 30 hours.
If these two samples were combined and used in a given project
simultaneously, determine the combined new mean for the larger sample
and hence determine the combined or pulled standard deviation.
