 Also note that a low correlation coefficient doesn‘t imply lack of
  relation between variables but lack of linear relationship between the
                                             om

  variables i.e. there could exist a curvilinear relation.
 A further problem in interpretation arises from the fact that the r value
                                     om



  here measures the relationship between a single independent variable
  and dependent variable, where as a particular variable may be
                                   as




  dependent on several independent variables (e.g. crop yield may be
                           .m




  dependent on fertilizer used, soil exhaustion, soil acidity level, season
  of the year, type of seed etc.) in which case multiple correlation should
                       w




  be used instead.

The Rank Correlation Coefficient (R)
Also known as the spearman rank correlation coefficient, its purpose is to
establish whether there is any form of association between two variables
where the variables arranged in a ranked form.
               6 d 2
       R=1-
              n  n 2  1

              Where d = difference between the pairs of ranked values.
                     n = numbers of pairs of rankings

       NOTE: in this example, if we are given the actual marks then we find
