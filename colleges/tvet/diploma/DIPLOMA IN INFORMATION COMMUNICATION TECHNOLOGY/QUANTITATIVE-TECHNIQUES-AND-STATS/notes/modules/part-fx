 b) Multiplication of two matrices
Rules
   i.    Multiplication is only possible if the first matrix has the same
         number of columns as the second matrix has rows. That is if A is
         the order a×b, then B has to be of the order b×c. If the A×B = D,
         then D must be of the order a×c.
  ii.    The general method of multiplication is that the elements in row
         m of the first matrix are multiplied by the corresponding
         elements in columns n of the second matrix and the products
         obtained are then added giving a single number.
We can express this rule as follows

                  a11 a12                   b       b12    b13 
         Let A =                     and b =  11

                                                                  
                  a 21 a 22                  b 21   b 22   b 23 




                                                                 i.c
                           d11 d12         d13 
         Then A  B = D =                       
                           d 21 d 22       d 23 
                                                          ng
                                                       si
        A = 2 x 2 matrix         B = 2 x 3 matrix         D = 2 x 3 matrix
