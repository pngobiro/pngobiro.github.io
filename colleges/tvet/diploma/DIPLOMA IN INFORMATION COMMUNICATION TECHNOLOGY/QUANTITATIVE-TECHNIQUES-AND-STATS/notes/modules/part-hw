Slack
This is the difference between the EST and LST for each event. Strictly it does
not apply to activities but on occasions the terms are confused in examination
questions and unless the context makes it abundantly clear that event slack is
required, it is likely that some form of activity float is required. Events on the
critical path have zero slack.


APPLICATIONS

Cost Scheduling
This is done by calculating the cost of various project durations, cost analysis




                                                         om
seeks to find the cheapest way of reducing the overall cost duration of a
project by increasing labour hours, equipment e.t.c.
