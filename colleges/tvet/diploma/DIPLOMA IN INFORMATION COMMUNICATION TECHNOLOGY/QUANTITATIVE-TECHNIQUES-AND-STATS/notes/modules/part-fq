1. Factor Reversal Test
This test indicates that when the price index is multiplied with a quantity
index i.e. factors are reversed), it should result in the value index.

2. The time reversal test
If we reverse the time subscripts of a price or quantity index, the result
should be reciprocal of the original index.
