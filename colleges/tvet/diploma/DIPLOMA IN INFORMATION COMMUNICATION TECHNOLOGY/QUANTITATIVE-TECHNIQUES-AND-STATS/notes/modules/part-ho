c) Determine the price per unit that will maximize the revenue

QUESTION FIVE
A furniture firm has two operating departments; Production and sales. The
firms‘s operating costs are split between these two departments with the
resultant period of fixed costs of Shs.20,000 and Shs.6,000 respectively. The
production department has a basic variable cost per unit of Shs.6 plus
additional variable cost per unit of Shs.0.0002 which relates to all the
manufactured items during the period. The sales department has a variable
cost per unit of Shs.2. The sales department receives the finished goods from
the production department and pay the basic variable cost per unit plus 80% of
the same.

NB:     Demand Q is given by the following function:

      Q = 40,000 – 2,000P, where P is the selling price of the sales
