The line X1 ≥2 does not affect the feasible region (doesn‘t cause reduction of
the feasible region), this constraint doesn‘t limit attainment of the objective,
thus its known as a redundant constraint.
Now picking a convenient point inside the feasible region, say (6, 10)

We get a total cost of               600 = (6(40)+10(36))
Thus the objective function line of 40X1 + 36X2 = 600

Moving this line parallel toward the origin to locate the last apex before the
line completely fall off the feasible region, we get:

Point X is the point of optimal solution
                  w




The binding constraints here are:
               w




                 X1 ≤ 8
And              5X1 +3 X2 ≥45
Solving this to get coordinates of point X
                 5X1 +3 X2 = 45 (when X1 = 8)
                 40 + 3 X2 = 45
                 X2 = 5/3
Thus the solution is         X1 = 8
                      X2 = 5/3

Shadow or dual prices
Definition: A shadow price or a dual price is the amount increase (or decrease)
of the objective function when one more (or one less) of the binding
constraints is made available.
Consider example 1.

Maximize 4X1 + 3 X2
                                       318
Subject to:     0.5X1 + 0.33X2 ≤ 12 (Machine hours)
                0.5X1 + 0.5X2 ≤ 14 (labor hours)
Starting with machine hours; let‘s assume that one more machine hour is
available (with labor hours remaining constant)
We get:
                0.5X1 + 0.33X2 = 13
                0.5X1 + 0.5X2 = 14
Solving this simultaneously we get the values of X1 and X2 as
                0.17 X2 = 1
                X2 = 5.88
                X1 = 22.12
Thus the contribution is
                4(22.12) + 3(5.88) = Sh.106.12
Comparing this with its original contribution of Sh.100.24 (see example 1) we
see increasing machine hours by one unit has increased contribution by
Sh.5.88, which is the shadow price per machine hour.
Note: This figure is also arrived at if we assume that machine hours are




                                                     om
reduced by 1 unit i.e. 12-1.
Similarly assuming that one more labor hour is made available, and then




                                                 i.c
contribution change is:
                0.5X1 + 0.33X2 = 12
                0.5X1 + 0.5X2 = 15
