MEASURES OF SKEWNESS
     - These are numerical values which assist in evaluating the degree
       of deviation of a frequency distribution from the normal
       distribution.



           -   Following are the commonly used measures of skew ness.
               1. Coefficient Skewness
                                 mean - median 
                   = 3
                                Standard deviation
     81
          2. Coefficient of skewness
                    mean - mode
              =
                  Standard deviation
NB: These 2 coefficients above are also known as Pearsonian measures of
skewness.

          3. Quartile Coefficient of skewness
                  Q3+ Q1- 2Q2
              =
                    Q3+ Q1
               Where Q1 = 1st quartile
                     Q2 = 2nd quartile
                     Q3 = 3rd quartile
NB: The Pearsonian coefficients of skewness usually range between –ve 3
and +ve 3. These are extreme value i.e. +ve 3 and –ve 3 which therefore




                                                           om
indicate that a given frequency is negatively skewed and the amount of
skewness is quite high.




                                                         i.c
Similarly if the coefficient of skewness is +ve it can be concluded that the
amount of skew ness of deviation from the normal distribution is quite high
                                                    ng
and also the degree of frequency distribution is positively skewed.
