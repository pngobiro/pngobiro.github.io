      activity e.g in building a bridge, rails installed. It is represented by a
      circle.

Dummy activity. An activity that doesn‘t consume time or resources, it is
                                  om



    merely to show logical dependencies between activities so as abide by
    rules of drawing a network, it is represented by a dotted arrow
                             as

Rules for Drawing a Network
   a) A network should only have one start point and one finish point (start
       event and finish event )
   b) All activities must have at least one preceding event (tail event) and at
       least one succeeding event (head event), but an activity may not share
       the same tail event and head event.
   c) An activity can only start after its tail event has been reached
   d) An event is only complete after all activities leading to it are complete.
   e) Activities are identified by alphabetical or numeric codes i.e. A,B,C;
       1,2,3 or identification by head or tail events 1-2, 2-4, 3-4,1-4…


                                        245
        f) Loops (a series of activities leading back to the same event) and danglers
           (activities which do not link to the overall project) are not allowed




                                                                       Dangling activity
                              Loop


     Dummy Events
     This is an event that does not consume time or resources, it is represented by
     dotted arrow. Dummies are applied when two or more events occur
     concurrently and they share the same head and tail events e.g. when a car
     goes to a garage tires are changed and break pads as well, instead of
     representing this as;

                         A- Tires Changed




                                                                  om
     Car Arrives (CA)                            Car ready (CR)




                                                           i.c
                        B- Break pads Changed

     These events are represented as;
                                                       ng
                                                      si
                                                om

           B
CA                                    CR
