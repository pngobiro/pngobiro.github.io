ABSORBING STATES
                            .m




A state Si (I = 1, 2, 3 …) of a markov chain is called absorbing if the system
remains in the state, Si once it enters there. Thus a state, Si is absorbing if
                        w




and only if the ith row of the transition matrix p has a 1 on the main
                    w




diagonal and zeroes every where else. See the following example.
                   w




The following matrix, P is a transition matrix of the markov chain.

The States S2 and S5 are absorbing states since the 2 nd and 4th rows have 1
on the main diagonal.

Probability Transition Matrices (Brand switching)
These are matrices in which the individual elements are in the form of
probabilities. The probabilities represent the probability of one event
following another event i.e. the probability of transition from one event to
the next. The probabilities of the various changes applied to the initial
state by matrix multiplication, give a forecast of the succeeding state.
Normally a transition matrix is defined with its columns adding up to one
and state vectors as column vectors.
