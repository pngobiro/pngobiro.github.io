The cofactor of an element
The cofactor of any element aij (known as cij) is the signed minor associated
with that element.
The sign is not changed if (i+j) is even and it is changed if (i+j)is odd. Thus
the sign alternated whether vertically or horizontally, beginning with a plus
in the upper left hand corner.

Hence the cofactor of element a11 is m11 = -3, cofactor of a12 is –m12 = +2
the cofactor of element a13 is +m13 = 3 and so on.

Cofactor of a is written as A, cofactor of b is written as B and so on.
Hence matrix of cofactors of M is written as

The determinant of a n×n matrix




                                                     i.c
The determinant of a n×n matrix can be calculated by adding the products
                                                ng
of the element in any row (or column) multiplied by their cofactors. If we
use the symbol ∆ for determinant.
                                               si
                                           om

Then ∆ = aA + bB + cC
                                     om



             or
        = dD + eE + fF e.t.c
                                as
                           .m




Note: Usually for calculation purposes we take ∆ = aA + bB + cC

                     w




Hence in the example under discussion
                  w




        ∆ = (4  –3) + (2  2) + (3  3) = 1
