very high implying the degree of deviation of the frequency distribution
from the normal distribution is small

Example 2
Using the above data calculate the quartile coefficient of skewness

KURTOSIS
      - This is a concept, which refers to the degree of peaked ness of a
         given frequency distribution. The degree is normally measured
         with reference to normal distribution.
      - The concept of kurtosis is very useful in decision making
         processes i.e. if is a frequency distribution happens to have either
         a higher peak or a lower peak, then it should not be used to make
         statistical inferences.
      - Generally there are 3 types of kurtosis namely;-
         i.       Leptokurtic
         ii.      Mesokurtic
         iii.     Platykurtic
Leptokurtic
      a)      A frequency distribution which is lepkurtic has generally a
              higher peak than that of the normal distribution. The
              coefficient of kurtosis when determined will be found to be
