the company has produce 15 units of P with 95% efficiency.
The cost of operating the new machine is Sh. 4 per hour and Sh. 3 per hour for

The company wishes to optimally allocate the machines in order to minimize

the total manufacturing cost if the total available hours for production in a day

Solution
In minimizing problems we use ≥ (greater or equal to) type inequality.

Step 1: Identifying variables.
Since the problem requires us to appropriately allocate the machines in order
to minimize the costs thus our variables are the new machines and the old
machines, we can let;
                X1 =new machines
                X2=old machines



Step 2: Identify objectives:
The objective is to minimize manufacturing costs.
                                      316
Total manufacturing cost per machine=Operating cost + (inefficiency rate ×
number of units × cost of loss)
Therefore cost for new machines
Cost = 4+ (0.02 × 25 × 2) = Sh. 5 per hour
                 =5 × 8= Sh. 40 per day]
Similarly for old machines
Cost = 3+ (0.05×15×2) = Sh. 4.5 per hour
                 =4.5×8=Sh. 36 per day
Therefore the objective function is to minimize 40X1 + 36X2
Step 3: Identifying constraint functions.
                 X1 ≤ 8
                 X2 ≤ 10
(25 × 8) X1 +(8 × 15) X2 ≥1800 (This can be simplified further as)
200 X1 +120 X2 ≥1800        (dividing through by 40)
5X1 +3 X2 ≥45
X1 ≥2
X1, X2 ≥0




                                                  om
Thus the LP model is:




                                                i.c
Minimize        40X1 + 36X2
Subject to:     X1 ≤ 8
                X2 ≤ 10
                5X1 +3 X2 ≥45
                                          ng
                                          si
                X1 ≥2
                                    om

                X1, X2 ≥0
Plotting this on a graph we get:
                                   om
                            as
