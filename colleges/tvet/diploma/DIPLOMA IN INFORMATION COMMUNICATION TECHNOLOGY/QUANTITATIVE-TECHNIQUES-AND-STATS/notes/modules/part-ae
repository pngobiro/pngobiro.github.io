   All that has happened is that we have replaced the numbers with
               w




   letters. However, a number is a specific quantity – e.g., 5 is more than
   4, but less than 6 – whereas a letter can be used to represent any
   number. Thus in the above expression, ‗a‘ could be 4 and ‗b‘ could be 1.
   We only know that they are 2 and 3 respectively because we defined
   them as such before.

   The main consequence of this is that algebra uses general expression
   and gives general results, whereas arithmetic (using numbers) uses
   definite numbers and gives definite results. Arithmetic is specific
   whereas algebra is general.

Equations
An equation is an expression with an equal sign (=)
Equations are classified into two main groups‘ linear equations and non
linear equations. Examples of linear equations are
       x + 13 = 15
       7x + 6 = 0


Non linear equations in the variable x are equations in which x appears in
the second or higher degrees. They include quadratic and cubic equations
amongst others. For example




                                                        om
       5x2 + 3x + 7 = 0 (quadratic equation)
        2x3 + 4x2 + 3x + 8 = 0 (cubic equation)




                                                    i.c
The solution of equations or the values of the variables for which the
                                                  ng
equations hold is called the roots of the equation or the solution set.
                                               si
Solution of linear equations.
                                         om


Supposing M, N, and P are expressions that may or may not involve
                                     om



variables, then the following constitute some rules which will be useful in
the solution of linear equations
                                as




Rule 1: Additional rule
                           .m




       If M = N then M + P = N + P
                       w




Rule 2: Subtraction rule
                    w




       If M = N, Then M – P = N – P
                  w




Rule 3: multiplication rule
       If M = N and P ≠ O then M x P = N x P
Rule 4: Division rule
       If P x M = N and P ≠ O
       And N/P = Q Q being a raterial number then
       M = N/P

Example
            i.    Solve 3x + 4 = - 8
