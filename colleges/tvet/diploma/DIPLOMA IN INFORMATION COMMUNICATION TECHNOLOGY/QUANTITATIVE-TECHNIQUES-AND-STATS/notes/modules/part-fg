LESSON 6 REINFORCING QUESTIONS

QUESTION ONE
A firm purchases a very large quantity of metal off-cuts and wishes to know
the average weight of an off-cut. A random sample of 625 off-cuts is
weighed and it is found that the mean sample weight is 150 grams with a
sample standard deviation of 30 grams. What is the estimate of the
population mean and what is the standard error of the mean? What would
be the standard error if the sample size was 1225?

QUESTION TWO
A sample of 80 is drawn at random from a population of 800. The sample
standard deviation was found to be 6 grams.
- What is the finite population correction factor?

- What is the approximation of the correction factor?
