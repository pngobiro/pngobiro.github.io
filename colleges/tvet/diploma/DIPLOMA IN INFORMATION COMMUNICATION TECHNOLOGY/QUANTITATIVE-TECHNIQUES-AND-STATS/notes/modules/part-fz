Simplify 3 x 3 determinants as in ii and then evaluate the 4 x 4
determinants.

Inverse of a matrix
If for an n ( n square matrix A, there is another n ( n square matrix B such
that there product is the identity of the order n X n, In, that is A X B = B X A
= I, then B is said to be inverse of A. Inverse if generally written as A-1
        Hence AA-1 = I

Note: Only non singular matrices have an inverse and therefore the inverse
of a singular matrix is non defined.

General method for finding inverse of a matrix

In order to introduce the rule to calculate the determinant as well as the
inverse of a matrix, we should introduce the concept of minor and cofactor.

The minor of an element
Given a matrix A = (aij), the minor of an element aij in row i and column j
(call it mij), is the value of the determinant formed by deleting row i and
column j in matrix A.

Example
                Let A =    EMBED Equation.DSMT4
