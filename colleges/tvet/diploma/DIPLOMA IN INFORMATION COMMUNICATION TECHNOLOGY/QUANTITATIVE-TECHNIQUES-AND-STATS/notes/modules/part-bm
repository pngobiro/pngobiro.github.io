Arithmetic Mean
                              as




The most popular and widely used measure for representing the entire data
                           .m




by one value is an average. Its value is contained by adding together all the
observation and dividing this total by the number of observation
                         w




These is commonly known as average or mean it is obtained by first of all
                    w




summing up the values given and by dividing the total value by the total no.
                 w




of observations.
                         X
        I.e. mean    =
                          n
        Where x = no. of values
              ∑ = summation
              n = no of observations
Example
The mean of 60, 80, 90, 120




   50
                60 + 80 + 90 +120
                          4


                    350
                =
                    4


                = 87.5

The arithmetic mean is very useful because it represents the values of most
observations in the population.
The mean therefore describes the population quite well in terms of the
magnitudes attained by most of the members of the population

Computation of the mean from grouped Data i.e. in classes.
