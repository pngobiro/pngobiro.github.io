   TWO DIMENSITIONAL DIAGRAMS.
    As distinguished from one dimensional diagram in which only the length
   of the bars is taken into account in two dimension diagram, the length
   as well as the width of the bars is considered.
   Thus the area of the bar represents the given data. Two dimensional
   diagrams are also known as surface diagrams example of this are-
   - Rectangles
   - Squares
   - Circles

Pie chart or diagram
This type of diagram enables as to show the partitioning of a total into
component parts.
In constructing a pie chart , the steps involved are:
    - Prepare the data so that the various components values are in
       percentage by applying




                                                        om
   % component = x   x 360

                 Total

                                               ng
                                            si
   -    Draw a circle of appropriate size with a compass.
                                       om

   -    Measure points on the circle representing the size of each component
        with the help of a protractor.
                                 om
                             as
                         .m

Quantitative classification; it refers to the classification of data according
to some characteristics that can be measured such as height, weight,
                                  as




income, sales.

Tabulation of Data
                       w




One of the simplest and most revealing devices of summarizing data and
                     w




presenting them in meaningful fashion is the statistical tables.
                  w




Types of tabulation
Tabulation may be classified as:
   1. simple tabulation
   2. complex or matrix tabulation

Simple tabulation only one characteristic is shown hence this type of table
is also known as one â€“path table. This can be illustrated as follows:
