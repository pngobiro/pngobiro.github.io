d) Explain the value of sensitivity analysis in linear programming problems and
   show how dual values are useful in identifying the price worth paying to
   relax constraints.

e) J.A Computers is a small manufacturer of personal computers. It
   concentrates on production of three models- a Desktop 386, a Desktop 286,
   and a Laptop 486, each containing one CPU Chip. Due to its limited
   assembly facilities JA Computers are unable to produce more than 500
   desktop models or more than 250 Laptop models per month. It has one
   hundred and twenty 80386 chips (these are used in Desktop-386) and four
   hundred 80286 chips (used in desktop 286 and Laptop 486) for the month.
   The Desktop 386 model requires five hours of production time, the Desktop
   286 model requires four hours of production time, and the Laptop 486
   requires three hours of production time. J.A Computers have 2000 hours of
   production time available for the coming month. The company estimates
   that the profit on Desktop 386 is Sh. 5,000. For a desktop 286 the profit is
   Sh.3, 400 and Sh.3,000 profit for a laptop 486.
