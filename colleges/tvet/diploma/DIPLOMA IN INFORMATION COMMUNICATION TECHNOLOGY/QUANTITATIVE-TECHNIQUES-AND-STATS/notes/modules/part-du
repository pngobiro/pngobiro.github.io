STANDARDIZATION OF VARIABLES
                                 om



Before we use the normal distribution curve to determine probabilities of
the continuous variables, we need to standardize the original units of
                             as




measurement, by using the following formula.
                    μ
                          .m




            Z=
                      σ
                      w




Where χ = Value to be standardized
                   w




     Z = Standardization of x
                 w




     µ = population mean
     σ = Standard deviation

Example
A sample of students had a mean age of 35 years with a standard deviation
of 5 years. A student was randomly picked from a group of 200 students.
Find the probability that the age of the student turned out to be as follows
                   i.     Lying between 35 and 40
                   ii.    Lying between 30 and 40
                   iii.   Lying between 25 and 30
                   iv.    Lying beyond 45 yrs
                   v.     Lying beyond 30 yrs
                   vi.    Lying below 25 years

Solution
  122
(i). The standardized value for 35 years
                                      35 - 35
                    Z=            =              =0
                          σ                                5

The standardized value for 40 years
                         40 - 35
            Z=            =         =                  1
                   σ                5


   ∴ the area between Z = 0 and Z = 1 is 0.3413 (These values are checked
     from the normal tables see appendix)
     The value from standard normal curve tables.
     When z = 0, p = 0
     And when z = 1, p = 0.3413
     Now the area under this curve is the area between z = 1 and z = 0
            = 0.3413 – 0 = 0.3413




                                                                           om
     ∴ the probability age lying between 35 and 40 yrs is 0.3413
(ii). 30 and 40 years

                                  30  35     5
                      Z=           =          =      = -1
                          
                                σ                  5
                                                40  35
                                                               ng  5
                                                               si
                    Z=                  =                      =       1
                                                   om
