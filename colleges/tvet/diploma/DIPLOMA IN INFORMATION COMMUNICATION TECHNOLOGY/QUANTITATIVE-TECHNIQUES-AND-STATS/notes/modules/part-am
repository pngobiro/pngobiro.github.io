A combination is a group of times in which order is not important.
For a combination to hold at any given time it must comprise of the same
items but if a new item is added to the group or removed from the group
then we have a new combination

Example

       16
3 items x, y and z will have 6 different permutations but only one
combination.
The following formula is usually used to determine the no. of combinations
in a given situation.

Example
There is a committee to be selected comprising of 5 people from a group of
5 men and 6 women. If the selection is randomly done. Find the possibility
of having the following possibilities (combinations)
    i.    Three men and two women
    ii.   At least one man and at least one woman must be in the
          committee
    iii.  One particular man and one particular woman must not be in the
          committee (one man four women)

Solution
   i.    The committee size = 5 people
         The group size = 5m + 6w

       17
         ∴ assuming no restrictions the committee can be selected in 11C5
         The committee has to consist of 3m & 2w
         ∴ these may be selected as follows.
         5
          C3 × 6C2
         P(committee 3m and 2w)
                5
                 C  6C2
              311         note that this formula can be fed directly to
                   C5
