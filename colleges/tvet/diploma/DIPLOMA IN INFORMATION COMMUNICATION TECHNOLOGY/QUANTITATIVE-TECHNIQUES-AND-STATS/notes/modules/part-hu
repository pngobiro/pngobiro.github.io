   a) Total float. Amount of time by which a path of activities could be
      delayed without affecting the overall project duration. The path in this




                                                        om
      example consists of one activity only i.e. B




                                                       i.c
Total Float = Latest Finish time (LFT) - Earliest Start time(EST) time –
Activity Duration
             Total Float = 50 - 10 - 10
                           = 30 days
                                                  ng
                                              si
                                        om

   b) Free float Amount of time an activity can be delayed without affecting
      the commencement of a subsequent activity at its earliest start time,
                                  om



      but may affect float of a previous activity.
         Free Float = Earliest Finish Time(EFT) - EST - Activity Duration
                             as




                   Free Float = 40-10-10
                           .m




                                 = 20 days
   c) Independent float. Amount of time an activity can be delayed when all
                      w




      preceding activities are completed as late as possible and all succeeding
                   w




      activities commenced as early a possible. Independent float therefore
                w




      does not affect the float of either preceding or subsequent activities.

      Independent float = EFT- Latest Start time (EST) - Activity Duration

               Independent float = 40 - 20 - 10
                                  = 10 days
Note:
 for examination purposes, float always refers to total float
 The total float can be calculated separately for each activity but it is often
   useful to find the total float over chains of non-critical activities between
   critical events

The following represents activities of a network.
