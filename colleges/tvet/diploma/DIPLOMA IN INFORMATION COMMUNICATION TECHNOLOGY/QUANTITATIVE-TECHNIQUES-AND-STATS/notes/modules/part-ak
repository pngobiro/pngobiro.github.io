                          w
                        w




Substitute this value of y into equation (i) or (iii) and obtain the value of x
                   w




         2x – 3y = 8
         2x – 3(-2) = 8
         x=1

Example
Solve the following by substitution method
         2x + y = 8
         3x – 2y = -2
Solution
Solve the first equation for y

   14
        y = 8 – 2x
Substitute this value of y into the second equation and solve for x
        3x – 2y = -2
        3x – 2 (8-2x) = -2
        x=2
Substitute this value of x into either the first or the second original
equation and solve for y
        2x + y = 8
        (2) (2) + y = 8
        y=4

Permutations
                                                      ng
This is an order arrangement of items in which the order must be strictly
observed
                                                   si
                                              om

Example
                                         om



Let x, y and z be any three items. Arrange these in all possible
permutations
                                    as




        1st    2nd     3rd
                             .m




        X      Y       Z
                          w




        X      Z       Y
                       w




        Y      X       Z        Six different permutations
        Y      Z       X
                     w




        Z      Y       X
        Z      X       Y

NB: The above 6 permutations are the maximum one can ever obtain in a
situation where there are only 3 items but if the number of items exceeds 3
then determining the no. of permutations by outlining as done above may
be cumbersome. Therefore we use a special formula to determine such
permutations. The formula is given below
