When one variable is to be represented on x-axis measure time and ion y-
axis in that various points are plotted and joined by one straight line, the
fluctuation of this line show the variation in the variable
                             as

 Solution
Draw a graph
Graphs of frequency distribution
A frequency distribution can be presented graphically in any of the
following ways;
Histogram
Frequency polygon
Smoothes frequency curve
Cumulative frequency curve
Histogram

Histograms are a set of vertical bars whose areas are proportional to the
frequencies represent3ed. Histogram is most widely used for graphical
presentation of a frequency distribution.

40-50                 40
 Solution
Draw a histogram
Frequency polygon
A frequency polygon is a graph of frequency distribution it has more than
four sides




                                                        om
It is particularly effective I comparing two or more frequency distribution.
