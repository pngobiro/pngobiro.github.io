                           PRACTICE QUESTIONS
Question One


  130
A firm purchases a very large quantity of metal off-cuts and wishes to know
the average weight of an off-cut. A random sample of 625 off-cuts is
weighed and it is found that the mean sample weight is 150 grams with a
sample standard deviation of 30 grams. What is the estimate of the
population mean and what is the standard error of the mean? What would
be the standard error if the sample size was 1225?

Question Two
A sample of 80 is drawn at random from a population of 800. The sample
standard deviation was found to be 6 grams.
- What is the finite population correction factor?
- What is the approximation of the correction factor?
- What is the standard error of the mean?

Specific Objectives
At the end of this topic the trainee should be able to:
     Define estimation
     Differentiate between the two types of estimation
     Dertemine the sampling distribution of a statistics
     Determine the confidence interval for a parameter;
     Design a simple hypothesis;
     Define errors in hypothesis testing;
     Test various hypothesis.

Statistical inference
It is the process of drawing conclusions about attributes of a population




                                                   i.c
based upon information contained in a sample (taken from the population).

                                              ng
It is divided into estimation of parameters and testing of hypothesis.
Symbols for statistic of population parameters are as follows.
