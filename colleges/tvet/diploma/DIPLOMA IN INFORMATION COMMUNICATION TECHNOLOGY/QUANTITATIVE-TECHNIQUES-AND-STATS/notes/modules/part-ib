Note:
i)    EST and LST are calculated by the same process we learnt earlier.
ii)   EFT and LFT are calculated by adding the activity time duration to EST
      and LST respectively.
iii)  Critical path is similarly identified by identifying equal EST and LST
      throughout the path.

                     LESSON 8 REINFORCING QUESTIONS

QUESTION ONE
Regal Investments has just received instructions from a client to invest in two
shares; one an airline share, the other an insurance share. The total maximum
appreciation in share value over the next year is to be maximized subject to
the following restrictions:
-      the total investment shall not exceed Sh.100,000
-      at most Sh.40,000 is to be invested in the insurance shares
-      quarterly dividends must total at least Sh.2,600

The airline share is currently selling for Sh.40 per share and its quarterly
dividend is Sh.1per share. The insurance share is currently selling for Sh.50 per
share and the quarterly dividend is Sh.1.50 per share. Regalâ€˜s analysts predict
that over the next year, the value of the airline share will increase by Sh.2 per
share and the value of the insurance share will increase by Sh.3 per share.
