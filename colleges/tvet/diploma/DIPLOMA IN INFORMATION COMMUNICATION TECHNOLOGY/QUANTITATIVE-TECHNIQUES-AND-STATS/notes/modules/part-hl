1. You are given the following marginal revenue function
                           w




       MR  a  a1q                       65
                    w




Find the corresponding total revenue function
                                          70
                 w




Solution                                  A
Total revenue   MR.dq    a  a1q dq
                aq  12 a1q2  c

Example 2
A firm has the following marginal cost function
        MC  a  a1q  a2q 2
Find its total cost function.

Solution
The total cost C is given by
       C     = ʃMC.dq
             = ʃ(a + a1q + a2q2).dq

                aq  21 q 2  32 q3  c
                       a       a


                                               239
Note: Exams focus: Note the difference between marginal function and total
function. You differentiate total function to attain marginal function, this is
common in exams,
total profit = total revenue – total cost.

Example 3.
Your company manufacturers large scale units. It has been shown that the
marginal (or variable) cost, which is the gradient of the total cost curve, is (92
– 2x) Shs. thousands, where x is the number of units of output per annum. The
fixed costs are Shs. 800,000 per annum. It has also been shown that the
marginal revenue which is the gradient of the total revenue is (112 – 2x) Shs.
thousands.

Required
   i.    Establish by integration the equation of the total cost curve
   ii.   Establish by integration the equation of the total revenue curve




                                                       om
   iii.  Establish the break even situation for your company
   iv.   Determine the number of units of output that would




                                                   i.c
         a) Maximize the total revenue and
         b) Maximize the total costs, together with the maximum total
            revenue and total costs

Solution
                                      om

   i.    First find the indefinite integral limit points of the marginal cost as
         the first step to obtaining the total cost curve
                                 om



         Thus ʃ(92 – 2x) dx = 92x – x2 + c
         Where c is constant
                            as

Since the total costs are the sum of variable costs and fixed costs, the constant
term in the integral represents the fixed costs, thus if Tc are the total costs
