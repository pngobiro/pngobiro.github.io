disease and hence determine the variance and the standard deviation for
                     w




the above problem

Solution
Sample size n = 10000
P(a person suffering from the disease) = 0.003 = p
   ∴ expected number of people suffering from the disease
   Mean = λ = 10000 × 0.003
     = 30
      = np = ⋋
Variance = np = 30
   Standard deviation =           np          =⋋
                  = 30
                  = 5.477

NORMAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
In a continuous distribution, the variable can take any value within a
specified range, e.g. 2.21 or 1.64 compared to the specific values taken by
a discrete variable e.g. 1 or 3. The probability is represented by the area
under the probability density curve between the given values.
The uniform distribution, the normal probability distribution and the
exponential distribution are examples of a continuous distribution
The normal distribution is a probability distribution which is used to
determine probabilities of continuous variables
Examples of continuous variables are
          o Distances
          o Times
          o Weights
          o Heights
          o Capacity e.t.c
Usually continuous variables are those, which can be measured by using the




                                                      om
appropriate units of measurement.
Following are the properties of the normal distribution:

                                               ng
            1. The total area under the curve is = 1 which is equivalent to
               the maximum value of probability
                                            si
                                       om

                                                                     Age (Yrs)
           2. The line of symmetry divides the curve into two equal halves
           3. The two ends of the normal distribution curve continuously
              approach the horizontal axis but they never cross it
           4. The values of the mean, mode and median are all equal
NB: The above distribution curve is referred to as normal probability
distribution curve because if a frequency distribution curve is plotted from
measurements of a given sample drawn from a normal population then a
graph similar to the normal curve must be obtained.

It should be noted that 68% of any population lies within one standard
deviation, ±1σ
95% lies within two standard deviations ±2σ
99% lies within three standard deviations ±3σ
