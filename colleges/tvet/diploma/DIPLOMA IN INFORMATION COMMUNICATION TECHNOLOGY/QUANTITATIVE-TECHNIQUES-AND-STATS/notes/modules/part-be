kept in the same order.
A common and helpful arrangement is that of presenting each bar in the
order of magnitude from the largest component at the base of the bar to
the smallest at the end.
To distinguish between the different component, it is useful to use
different shade or colours.
They usually show component totals and the totals.

    (c) multiple bar charts
in multiple bar chart two or more set of interrelated data are represented
.the technigue of drawing such a diagram is the same as that of simple bar
charts.
The only difference is that since more than one phenomenon is represented
,different shades , colours .,dots or crossing are used to distinguish
between the bars. they normally show the component totals only.

    (d) Percentage component bar charts.
They are particularly useful in statistical work which require the portrayal
of relative changes in data.
When such diagrams are prepared , the length of the bars is kept equal to
100 and segment are cut in these bars to represent the component of an
aggregate.
