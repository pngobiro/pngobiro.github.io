The value of t is obtained from students t-distribution tables for the
required confidence level

Example

  139
A random sample of 12 items is taken and is found to have a mean weight
of 50 grams and a standard deviation of 9 grams
What is the mean weight of population?
    a) with 95% confidence
    b) with 99% confidence

Solution
                                                       s    9
X  50; S = 9; v = n – 1 = 12 – 1 = 11;         Sx       
                                                        n   12
µ = x‘ ± tsx

At 95% confidence level
                      9 
      µ = 50 ± 2.262     
                      12 




                                                         om
        = 50 ± 5.72 grams




                                                       i.c
                                                ng
Therefore we can state with 95% confidence that the population mean is
                                             si
between 44.28 and 55.72 grams
                                          om

At 99% confidence level
                     9 
                                   om



      µ = 50 ± 3.25     
                     12 
                              as




        = 50 ± 8.07 grams
                            .m




Therefore we can state with 99% confidence that the population mean is
                      w




between 41.93 and 58.07 grams
                   w
                 w
