Tied Rankings
A slight adjustment to the formula is made if some students tie and have
                                w




the same ranking the adjustment is

               where t = number of tied rankings the adjusted formula
         12
becomes

Coefficient of Determination
                                             om



This refers to the ratio of the explained variation to the total variation and
is used to measure the strength of the linear relationship. The stronger the
                                        as




linear relationship the closer the ratio will be to one.
