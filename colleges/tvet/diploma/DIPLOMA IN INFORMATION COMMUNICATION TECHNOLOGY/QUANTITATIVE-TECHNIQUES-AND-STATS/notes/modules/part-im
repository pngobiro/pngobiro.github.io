                Total Holding Costs =       Quantity Ordered x Holding Costs per
unit

                Therefore total relevant costs (TC) for any order quantity can be
expressed as:

                      TC     =        DO   +      QH
                                      Q           2

                We can determine a minimum of this total cost function by:
