      b.     Expected stock-out cost             =     (Expected annual shortage) x
Shortage cost per item

      c.     Holding cost              =     Buffer stock x cost of holding per item


Important Note:
      If shortage Cs is not taken into account
                      2 x 250 x 4
           EOQ =
                           5


                 =   400 = 20


                                           292
and number of orders       =      250     =     12.5
                            20

       Using this model, we can still develop a table similar to the table worked
out in this problem.

      Graph of total cost against re-order level can be drawn using the table.
The minimum cost and the re-order level can then read from the graph. Once
re-order level is known, safety stock can be worked out.

      In the next example, the initial EOQ value has been taken using the
formula

                                                     i.c
1.    Assume a manufacturer has experienced trouble from stock shortages
                                               ng
      (stock-outs) of raw materials X which is required in a manufacturing
      process. Usage of X averages 6,000 units per year where a year consists
                                               si
      of 50 weeks.

2.    Assume the costs of ordering each batch of X is Shs 30 and the lead time is
                                 om



      2 weeks (known for certain). The annual holding costs amount to Shs 1
      per unit of X held. The cost of a stock-out has been estimated to be Shs 5
                            as




      per unit short.

3.    Assume the demand (usage) is unknown. However, the total usage of raw
                     w




      material X over the 2 week lead time is expected to be as follows:
