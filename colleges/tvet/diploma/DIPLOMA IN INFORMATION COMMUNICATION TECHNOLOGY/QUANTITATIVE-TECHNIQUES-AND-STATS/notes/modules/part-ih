build into the product the optimum of desired value at minimum cost, by
introducing the most up-to-date designs, materials and methods of manufacture.
No more value need be built into the product than is desired by the customer.

For example, moulded plastic bumper bars are now fitted to many cars, because
they are cheaper than and equally as functional as chromium-plated steel ones.

How much to order
Supposing the estimated annual usage of a component by Harambee Agricultural
Machinery Ltd is 20,000 units. Usage is even throughout the year and only one
order per annum is placed with the supplier. Because only one delivery is made,
average stock will be high, i.e. 20,000  2 = 10,000 and consequently
stockholding costs will be very high. On the other hand, the costs of ordering
will be negligible. If two orders are placed there will be less in stock (i.e.
average 5,000), which will reduce holding costs, but ordering costs will increase.
Thus, the higher the number of orders placed, the lower are stockholding costs,
but the higher are ordering costs.

Stockholding costs include interest on the capital invested in stocks, storage,
insurance, rates, security, building maintenance, heating, etc. Ordering costs
include buying-department staff costs, receiving and handling.

Assuming that the cost of each Harambee component is £10, that holding cost is
10% of stock value and the cost of placing an order is £1, the total annual cost of




                                                        om
stockholding and ordering when different numbers of orders are placed, is as
follows:
