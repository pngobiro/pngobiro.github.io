Using the Pearsonian measure of skew ness, calculate the coefficients of
skew ness and hence comment briefly on the nature of the distribution of
the loans.

   It is very important to note that the method of obtaining arithmetic mean (or any other statistic) by misusing
   assumed mean (A) from X and then dividing by c can be abit confusing, if this is the case then just use the
   straight forward method of:

   Arithmetic mean 
                               f .x      where x is the midpoint, the answers are the same.

The coefficient of skewness obtained suggests that the frequency
distribution of the loans given was positively skewed
This is because the coefficient itself is positive. But the skewness is not
