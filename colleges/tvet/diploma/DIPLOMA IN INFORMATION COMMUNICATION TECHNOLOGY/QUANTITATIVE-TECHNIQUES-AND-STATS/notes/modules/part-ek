NB: If the standardized value of the mean is less than –1.65 we reject the
null hypothesis (H0) and accept the alternative Hypothesis (H1) but if the
standardized value of the mean is more than –1.65 we accept the null
hypothesis and reject the alternative hypothesis

The above sketch graph and level of significance are applicable when the
sample mean is < (i.e. less than the population mean)
