                                 .m




   Thus we pick the x4 row and mark the element 6 14 , the row solution
                            w




   variable is changed to x1 and we divide the row by 6 14 to convert the
                       w
                       w




   marked element to 1.
   Therefore;            x1    1    0      3

                                                 25   = 24

   This is the final tableau since the Z row has no values greater than zero thus
   we have the optimal solution.

Interpretation
       to maximize Z we need to produce 24 units x2 and 24 units of x1, we
         obtain these values from the solutions quantity column
                          Thus, Z = 24(45) + 24(80) = 3000

        We have zero slack (unused quantities of constraints).




                                                                         om
       Assume tableau 2 is the final tableau and let the constraint with variable
       x3 be labor hours and x4 are raw materials, the slack would‘ve been
       interpreted as:




                                                                    i.c
              o 150 units of raw materials were unused
                                                              ng
              o To maximize Z we produce 20units of x2 and none of x1.
        The value represents in Z row under slack variable column represents
                                                              si
          shadow prizes. Thus the shadow prize for the first constraint with x 3
                                                    om

          is 7 and the shadow prize for the second constraint with the variable
          x4 is 4.
