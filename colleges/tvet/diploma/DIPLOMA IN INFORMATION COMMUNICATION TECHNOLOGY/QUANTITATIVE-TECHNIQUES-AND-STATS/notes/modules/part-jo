Comparing these values we see that X2 ranges between 0 – 28, therefore we
can have the graph plotted as:
                                               ng
                                             si
                                       om
                                 om
                             as
                        .m
                     w
                  w
               w




Next draw each limitation (constraint) as separate line on the graph.
For 0.5X1 + 0.33X2 ≤ 12
The two points that represent this line are (36, 0) and (0, 24). This is plotted as
a straight line from 36 on X2 axis to 24 on X1 axis.




                                       312
Now including the Non-Negativity constraints since no negative product can be




                                                      om
produced;
X1 ≥ 0; x2 ≥ 0




                                                  i.c
                                              ng
                                            si
                                      om
                                om
                            as
                        .m
                     w
                  w
               w




We must now consider how to choose the production which will maximize
contribution. This we do by plotting a line representing the objective function
(4x1 + 3x2).
                                      313
First choose a convenient point inside the feasible region

                                   E.g. X2(10) +3X1 (20) = 40 +60
                                                    = Sh 100

All of the other product mixes that give a contribution of Sh.100 lies on the
line:

100 = 4X1 + 3X2 ........................................... (i)
<<This line is called a contribution line>>

Picking another point, say X2 =10 ad X1 = 20
Its contribution value is SH 110, thus give a contribution line of

110 = 4X1 + 3X2 ............................................. (ii)

Plotting these two contribution lines to our graph we get two parallel lines.




                                                                om
                                                           i.c
                                                      ng
                                                   si
                                            om
                                      om
                                 as
                            .m
                        w
                     w
                  w




Until we reach the last feasible solution(s) before the line moves entirely out of
the feasible region.
