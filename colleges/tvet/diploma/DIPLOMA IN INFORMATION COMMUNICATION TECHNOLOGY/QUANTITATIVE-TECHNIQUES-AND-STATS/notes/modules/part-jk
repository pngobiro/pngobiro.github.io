     X is the amount of raw material that falls short of the maximum available; S, T
     an U are the respective number of hours short of maximum weekly input of
     forming, firing and packing time.

                   ITRODUCTION TO LINEAR PROGRAMMING

Specific Objectives
At the end of this to the trainee should be able to:
     Explain the model concepts;
     Describe the various types of models;
     State the requirements of LP models;
     Model decision problems as linear models;
     Solve LP models.

INTRODUCTION
These are mathematical technique that deals with optimism of linear function
variables known as objective functions. It is a method of determine an
optimum program of independent activities in view of available resources.
Linear programming is a technique of decision making used by managers to




                                                       om
allocate limited resources e.g. machinery, raw materials and labor in order to
minimize costs or maximize production. Decision variable are the amounts of




                                                   i.c
each product to be made in a given time period. Linear programming assumes
that the variable has a linear relationship.

N.B; it is a technique concerned with scarce resources.
