(¢} In a certain donor funded institution, a cheque must be signed by four people; Chief
Executive, Chairman, Finance officer and donor representative. The probabilities
of the four signatories being available in a weck are as follows: chicf exccutive
0.94, chairman 0.70, finance officer 0.96, and donor representative 0.85. Cheques arc
drawn at random as need arises. The organisation wants to estimate the mean number
of weeks when a cheque will fail to be fully signed by all the signatorics in a period of
15 weeks.
Using the following random numbers, simulatc the problem using Montce Carlo method.

©) A businessman is confronted with choosing only one of the three investment options;
A, B and C. If he chooses A and succeeds, then he makes a profit of Ksh 2000 but if he
fails, then he loses Ksh 1250. If he chooses B and succeeds, then he makes a profit of
Ksh 1800 but if he fails, then he loses Ksh 300. If he chooses C and succeeds, then he
makes a profit of Ksh 3000 but if he fails, then he loses Ksh 1500.

@) A mineral water processing plant packages water in bottles labelled as 1500 litres. The
Kenya Bureau of Standards took a random sample of 256 bottles from the production
tine and found them to have a mean capacity of 1497 litres and a standard deviation of
24 litres. The bottles must have the correct capacity because less capacity implies
cxploitation of the consumer while cxcess capacity antagonises the factory’s objective
to maximise profit. Test whether this label of (500 litres on the boliles is true at the 5%
level of significance. {6 marks)
