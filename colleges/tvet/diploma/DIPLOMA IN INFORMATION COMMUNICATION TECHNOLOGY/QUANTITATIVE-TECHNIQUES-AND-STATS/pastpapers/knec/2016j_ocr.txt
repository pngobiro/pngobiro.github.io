(©)  Anagricultural researcher carried out a study on the relationship between crop yield per
sack and the quantity of fertilizer in bags per plot. A random sample of 10 plots in different
regions was taken. The data in Table 3 shows the quantity of fertilizer in bags and the crop
yield in sacks produced.

- the fourth, fifth and sixth characters must any be numeric digits. ]
- the seventh character must be a letter of the alphabet.
The letters ‘I’ and ‘O’ must not be used, and a registration must not start with ‘KAF’ since
this is preserved for the air force. Determine the maximum number of vehicles which can
be registered using this system. (6 marks)
