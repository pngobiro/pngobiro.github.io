                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Simplification of Data:</strong> Statistics simplifies complex and large datasets into understandable forms through measures like averages (mean, median, mode), dispersion (range, standard deviation), and graphical representations (charts, graphs).</li>
                                <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> It provides tools and techniques (like averages, ratios, percentages, coefficients) to compare different datasets or different groups within a dataset, enabling meaningful analysis of variations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Forecasting/Prediction:</strong> Statistical methods like time series analysis and regression analysis help in analyzing past data to predict future trends and outcomes, aiding in planning and decision-making.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hypothesis Testing:</strong> Statistics provides a framework for formulating hypotheses about populations and testing them based on sample data, allowing for drawing scientific conclusions and making informed decisions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Formulation and Testing of Policies:</strong> Governments and organizations use statistical data and analysis to formulate policies (e.g., economic, social) and evaluate their effectiveness.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li><strong>Primary Data:</strong> Data collected first-hand by the researcher specifically for the purpose of the current study or investigation. It is original data gathered directly from the source through methods like surveys, interviews, observations, or experiments. It is often more relevant and reliable for the specific research question but can be time-consuming and expensive to collect.</li>
                                <li><strong>Secondary Data:</strong> Data that has already been collected by someone else for a different purpose but is available for use by other researchers. Sources include published reports (government, industry), books, journals, websites, and internal company records. It is generally cheaper and quicker to obtain but may not perfectly fit the researcher's needs or could have issues with accuracy, relevance, or timeliness.</li>

                                <li><strong>Observer Bias:</strong> The observer's presence or personal biases can influence the behavior of those being observed (Hawthorne effect) or affect the interpretation of what is observed.</li>

                                <li><strong>Time-Consuming and Expensive:</strong> Depending on the scope and duration, observation can require significant time and resources, especially if continuous or long-term observation is needed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ethical Concerns:</strong> Observing individuals, especially without their knowledge or consent (covert observation), raises ethical issues regarding privacy and informed consent.</li>

                                <li><strong>Kurtosis:</strong> Measures the "tailedness" or peakedness of a distribution relative to a normal distribution. It describes how heavily the tails of a distribution differ from the tails of a normal distribution.

                            <h5>(a) Sampling vs. Census:</h5>
                            <p>Sampling method may be preferred over census method under the following circumstances:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Large Population:</strong> When the population size is very large or infinite, conducting a census becomes impractical due to time, cost, and logistical constraints. Sampling provides a feasible alternative.</li>
                                <li><strong>Limited Resources:</strong> If resources such as time, budget, and trained personnel are limited, sampling is more economical and efficient than a census.</li>
                                <li><strong>Destructive Testing:</strong> When the process of measuring or testing the units involves destroying them (e.g., testing the breaking strength of materials, lifespan of bulbs), sampling is necessary as a census would destroy the entire population.</li>
                                <li><strong>Need for Quick Results:</strong> If results are needed quickly, sampling allows for faster data collection and analysis compared to the lengthy process of a census.</li>
                                <li><strong>Higher Accuracy Potential (Non-sampling errors):</strong> Sometimes, the focused effort possible with a smaller sample (better training, supervision, measurement) can lead to lower non-sampling errors compared to a large-scale census where controlling such errors is more difficult, potentially resulting in more accurate overall findings despite the presence of sampling error.</li>

                                <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> Measures the strength and direction (positive, negative, or none) of the linear association between two quantitative variables. It indicates how closely the variables move together, typically represented by a correlation coefficient (like Pearson's r) ranging from -1 to +1. It does not distinguish between independent and dependent variables and does not imply causation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Regression:</strong> A statistical method used to model and quantify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting line (or curve) to describe how the dependent variable changes as the independent variable(s) change. It allows for prediction of the dependent variable based on the independent variable(s) and estimates the magnitude of the relationship (slope).</li>

                                <li><strong>Asymptotic:</strong> The curve approaches the horizontal axis asymptotically, meaning it gets closer and closer but never actually touches it on either side, extending infinitely in both directions.</li>

Example: Tossing a coin twice; the outcome of the first toss does not influence the outcome of the second toss. Mathematically, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).</li>

                                <li><strong>Secular Trend (T):</strong> The long-term underlying movement or general direction (upward, downward, or stable) in the time series data, observed over a significant period, ignoring short-term fluctuations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Seasonal Variation (S):</strong> Patterns or fluctuations in the data that repeat regularly over a specific period, usually a year (e.g., higher sales in summer, lower in winter). Caused by seasons, weather, holidays, or social customs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cyclical Variation (C):</strong> Long-term oscillations or wave-like movements in the data that occur over periods longer than a year (often several years). Associated with business cycles (boom, recession, depression, recovery). Less regular than seasonal variations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Irregular/Random Variation (I):</strong> Unpredictable, non-systematic fluctuations in the data that remain after accounting for trend, seasonal, and cyclical components. Caused by chance events like strikes, natural disasters, or measurement errors.</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Generally less expensive to administer than interviews, especially for large samples spread over a wide geographical area (e.g., postal or online questionnaires).</li>
                                <li><strong>Anonymity and Reduced Bias:</strong> Can offer anonymity, potentially encouraging more honest responses to sensitive questions. Reduces interviewer bias as the respondent answers directly.</li>
                                <li><strong>Convenience for Respondents:</strong> Respondents can complete the questionnaire at their own pace and convenience, potentially leading to more thoughtful answers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> All respondents receive the exact same questions in the same order, ensuring consistency and comparability of data.</li>
                                <li><strong>Easy Analysis (for closed-ended questions):</strong> Data from closed-ended questions is often easier and faster to code, enter, and analyze statistically.</li>

                                <li><strong>(i) Null Hypothesis (H₀):</strong> A statement about a population parameter that is assumed to be true for the purpose of testing. It typically represents the status quo, a baseline, or a statement of "no effect" or "no difference". The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine if there is enough statistical evidence to reject this assumption.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Level of Significance (α):</strong> The probability threshold below which the null hypothesis will be rejected. It represents the maximum acceptable risk of making a Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis). Common values are 0.05 (5%) and 0.01 (1%). If the p-value of the test statistic is less than α, the result is considered statistically significant, and H₀ is rejected.</li>

                                <li><strong>Complex or Sensitive Topics:</strong> When the subject matter is complex, requires detailed explanation, or deals with sensitive personal issues, an interviewer can clarify questions, probe for deeper answers, and build rapport to encourage honest responses.</li>
                                <li><strong>Low Literacy Levels:</strong> If the target population has low literacy levels or language barriers, an interviewer can read questions and record answers, ensuring participation from individuals who might struggle with a written questionnaire.</li>
                                <li><strong>Need for High Response Rate:</strong> Personal interviews generally achieve higher response rates compared to mail or online surveys, as it's harder for respondents to refuse participation face-to-face.</li>
                                <li><strong>Observation Opportunity:</strong> Allows the interviewer to observe the respondent's non-verbal cues and environment, which can provide additional context or insights.</li>
                                <li><strong>Control over Environment:</strong> The interviewer can ensure the interview is conducted in a suitable environment, free from distractions, and can verify the identity of the respondent.</li>

                                <li><strong>(ii) Re-order Level (ROL):</strong> The inventory level that triggers a new order to be placed.

                                <li><strong>Measure Changes Over Time:</strong> Index numbers are primarily used to measure the relative change in the magnitude of a variable (like price, quantity, or value) over time compared to a base period.</li>
                                <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> They facilitate comparison between related variables or groups of variables, even if they are measured in different units (e.g., comparing price changes of different commodities).</li>
                                <li><strong>Economic Barometers:</strong> Indices like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or stock market indices serve as indicators of the overall state of the economy or specific sectors.</li>
                                <li><strong>Deflating:</strong> Index numbers (especially price indices) are used to adjust monetary values for the effects of inflation, allowing for comparison of "real" values over time (e.g., converting nominal wages to real wages).</li>
                                <li><strong>Policy Formulation:</strong> Governments and businesses use index numbers (e.g., CPI for wage adjustments, cost of living analysis) to inform policy decisions.</li>

                                <li><strong>(i) Payoff Table:</strong> A table used in decision theory to organize the potential outcomes (payoffs) for each possible combination of a decision alternative (chosen by the decision-maker) and a state of nature (an uncertain future event outside the decision-maker's control). Rows typically represent alternatives, and columns represent states of nature.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Decision Tree:</strong> A graphical representation of the decision-making process. It uses nodes (squares for decision points, circles for chance/state of nature points) and branches (representing alternatives or outcomes) to map out the sequence of decisions, possible states of nature, probabilities, and payoffs, helping to visualize and analyze complex decisions.</li>
