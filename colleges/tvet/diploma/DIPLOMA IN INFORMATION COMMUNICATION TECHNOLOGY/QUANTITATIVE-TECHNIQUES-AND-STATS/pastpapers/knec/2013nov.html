                        <p>(c) In a certain donor funded institution, a cheque must be signed by four people: Chief Executive, Chairman, Finance officer and donor representative. The probabilities of the four signatories being available in a week are as follows: chief executive 0.94, chairman 0.70, finance officer 0.96, and donor representative 0.85.</p>
                        <p>Cheques are drawn at random as need arises. The organisation wants to estimate the mean number of weeks when a cheque will fail to be fully signed by all the signatories in a period of 15 weeks.</p>

                            <h5>(a) Linear Programming Terms:</h5>
                            <p><strong>(i) Non-negativity Condition:</strong> This fundamental constraint in linear programming states that the decision variables (representing quantities like products produced, resources used, etc.) cannot take negative values. They must be greater than or equal to zero (e.g., x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0). This reflects the real-world scenario where it's impossible to produce a negative quantity of a product.</p>
                            <p><strong>(ii) Implication of Slack Variable > 0 at Optimum:</strong> A slack variable represents the unused amount of a resource corresponding to a 'less than or equal to' (≤) constraint. If a slack variable is greater than zero in the optimal solution, it means that the resource associated with that constraint is not fully utilized. There is a surplus or leftover amount of that resource, and it is not a binding constraint on the optimal solution.</p>

                            <h5>(a) Spurious Correlation:</h5>
                            <p>Spurious correlation refers to a statistical relationship between two variables that appears causal but is not. The correlation exists, often due to coincidence or the influence of a third, unobserved variable (a confounding factor or lurking variable) that affects both variables independently. For example, ice cream sales and crime rates might be positively correlated, but the actual cause is likely a third variable, such as warmer weather, which increases both.</p>

                            <h5>(b) Steps in Simplex Method:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Formulate the LP Problem:</strong> Define the objective function (to be maximized or minimized) and all constraints based on the problem description.</li>
                                <li><strong>Convert to Standard Form:</strong> Introduce slack variables for '≤' constraints, surplus variables for '≥' constraints, and artificial variables for '=' or '≥' constraints (if needed for initial feasible solution). Ensure all RHS values are non-negative. Rewrite the objective function with all variables on one side (e.g., Z - c<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> - ... = 0).</li>
                                <li><strong>Create the Initial Simplex Tableau:</strong> Set up a table containing the coefficients of the variables from the objective function and constraints, including slack/surplus/artificial variables. The initial basic feasible solution usually consists of the slack/artificial variables.</li>
                                <li><strong>Check for Optimality:</strong> Examine the objective function row (Z-row). If maximizing, the solution is optimal if all coefficients in the Z-row are non-negative. If minimizing, the solution is optimal if all coefficients are non-positive. If not optimal, proceed to the next step.</li>
                                <li><strong>Select Entering Variable (Pivot Column):</strong> Choose the variable with the most negative coefficient (for maximization) or most positive coefficient (for minimization) in the Z-row. This column is the pivot column.</li>
                                <li><strong>Select Leaving Variable (Pivot Row):</strong> Calculate the ratio of the RHS values to the corresponding positive coefficients in the pivot column for each constraint row. Select the row with the smallest non-negative ratio. This row is the pivot row. The element at the intersection of the pivot column and pivot row is the pivot element.</li>
                                <li><strong>Perform Pivot Operation:</strong> Use elementary row operations to make the pivot element equal to 1 and all other elements in the pivot column equal to 0.

                                        <li>Divide the pivot row by the pivot element.</li>
                                        <li>For all other rows (including the Z-row), subtract a multiple of the new pivot row to make the element in the pivot column zero. (New Row = Old Row - (Pivot Column Coefficient * New Pivot Row)).</li>

                                <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Go back to Step 4 (Check for Optimality) with the new tableau and repeat the process until the optimal solution is found.</li>

                            <p>Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic simulation technique that uses repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. It models systems with inherent uncertainty by defining inputs as probability distributions. By running the simulation many times with different random inputs drawn from these distributions, it generates a range of possible outcomes and their probabilities, allowing for analysis of risk and uncertainty. It's widely used in finance, project management, engineering, and science.</p>

                                <li><strong>Model Building Complexity:</strong> Developing an accurate simulation model that truly represents a complex real-world system can be difficult, time-consuming, and requires significant expertise. Oversimplification can lead to inaccurate results.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cost and Resources:</strong> Simulation projects can be expensive, requiring specialized software, powerful computing resources (especially for complex models run many times), and skilled personnel to build, run, and interpret the models.</li>
                                <li><strong>Interpretation of Results:</strong> Simulation outputs are statistical estimates based on random inputs. Interpreting these results requires statistical knowledge to understand confidence intervals, variance, and the significance of the findings. It doesn't always provide a single "optimal" answer like analytical methods might.</li>
                                <li><strong>Time-Consuming Runs:</strong> Complex simulations, especially those requiring many iterations (like Monte Carlo) to achieve stable results, can take a long time to run, potentially delaying decision-making.</li>

                                <li><strong>Linearity:</strong> The objective function and all constraints must be linear equations or inequalities. This means relationships between variables are directly proportional, with no exponents or cross-products.</li>
                                <li><strong>Certainty:</strong> All parameters in the model (coefficients in the objective function and constraints, resource availability) are known constants and do not change during the period being considered.</li>
                                <li><strong>Divisibility:</strong> Decision variables are continuous and can take on any non-negative fractional value. It assumes that products or resources can be divided into smaller units.</li>
                                <li><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> Decision variables must have non-negative values (≥ 0), as it's generally impossible to produce negative quantities or use negative resources.</li>
                                <li><strong>Additivity:</strong> The total value of the objective function and the total resource usage are the sum of the individual contributions from each decision variable.</li>

                            <p>Pre-testing involves administering a questionnaire or survey instrument to a small sample of respondents similar to the target population before the main survey. Its importance includes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Identifying Ambiguities:</strong> Helps uncover unclear, confusing, or poorly worded questions that respondents might misinterpret.</li>
                                <li><strong>Assessing Question Flow and Length:</strong> Checks if the questionnaire flows logically and isn't too long or fatiguing for respondents.</li>
                                <li><strong>Testing Instructions:</strong> Ensures instructions for respondents and interviewers (if applicable) are clear and understandable.</li>
                                <li><strong>Evaluating Response Formats:</strong> Determines if the chosen response options (e.g., multiple-choice, scales) are appropriate and capture the intended information.</li>
                                <li><strong>Estimating Time and Cost:</strong> Provides a realistic estimate of the time required to complete the survey, aiding in planning and budgeting.</li>

The Kenya Bureau of Standards took a random sample of 256 bottles from the production line and found them to have a mean capacity of 1497 litres and a standard deviation of 24 litres. The bottles must have the correct capacity because less capacity implies exploitation of the consumer while excess capacity antagonises the factory’s objective to maximise profit. Test whether this label of 1500 litres on the bottles is true at the 5% level of significance. (6 marks)</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Mail Survey:</strong> Questionnaires are sent and returned via postal mail. Allows for wide geographic coverage and respondent anonymity, but often suffers from low response rates and lack of clarification opportunities.</li>
                                <li><strong>Online Survey:</strong> Questionnaires are distributed and completed electronically (e.g., via email links, web forms). Cost-effective, quick data collection, allows multimedia, but can exclude those without internet access and raise concerns about sample representativeness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Face-to-Face Interview:</strong> An interviewer asks questions and records answers in person. Allows for clarification, probing, and observation of non-verbal cues, suitable for complex questions, but is expensive, time-consuming, and prone to interviewer bias.</li>
                                <li><strong>Telephone Interview:</strong> An interviewer asks questions over the phone. Quicker and cheaper than face-to-face, allows clarification, but excludes those without phones and can be perceived as intrusive.</li>
                            </ol>
                             *(Note: Only three ways were required)*

                            <h5>(b) Primary vs. Secondary Data:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Primary Data:</strong> Data collected firsthand by the researcher specifically for the current study or purpose. It is original data gathered directly from the source through methods like surveys, interviews, observations, or experiments. It is often more relevant and reliable for the specific research question but can be time-consuming and expensive to collect.</li>
                                <li><strong>Secondary Data:</strong> Data that has already been collected by someone else for a different purpose but is used by the researcher for their current study. Sources include government publications, company records, academic journals, websites, and previously conducted surveys. It is generally cheaper and quicker to obtain but may not perfectly fit the research needs or be fully reliable/accurate.</li>

                                <li>Future Value (FV) after 10 years must be ≥ Loan Amount</li>
                                <li>Let PV = Current Minimum Value</li>
                                <li>Formula: FV = PV * (1 - r)<sup>n</sup>  <- Incorrect formula for collateral. We need the PV that will cover the loan *now*. The collateral value *now* must be sufficient. The depreciation/appreciation is relevant if considering the value *at the end* of the loan, which isn't usually the primary collateral requirement. The question likely implies the *current* value must cover the loan.</li>
                                <li>Re-interpretation: The current value of the collateral must be at least the loan amount. The depreciation/appreciation might be relevant for the lender's risk assessment over time, but the minimum *current* value is typically the loan amount itself, or sometimes higher depending on Loan-to-Value ratios set by the lender.</li>

                            <h5>(a) Reasons to Prefer Sample Survey over Census:</h5>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Conducting a census (surveying the entire population) is extremely expensive due to the large scale of data collection, processing, and personnel required. A sample survey is significantly cheaper as it involves a smaller group.</li>
                                <li><strong>Time:</strong> Collecting and analyzing data from an entire population takes considerably longer than doing so for a sample. Sample surveys provide results much faster, which is often crucial for timely decision-making.</li>
                                <li><strong>Accuracy/Quality of Data:</strong> With a smaller sample, it's possible to employ more highly trained interviewers, use more sophisticated measurement techniques, and exercise greater supervision and control over the data collection process, potentially leading to higher quality and more accurate data than a large-scale census might achieve.</li>
                                <li><strong>Feasibility:</strong> In cases where the population is very large, geographically dispersed, or difficult to reach, a census might be practically impossible to conduct. A sample survey offers a feasible alternative.</li>
                                <li><strong>Destructive Testing:</strong> If the process of measuring the item destroys it (e.g., testing the lifespan of a lightbulb), a census is impossible, and sampling is the only option.</li>
                            </ol>
                             *(Note: Only three reasons were required)*

                            <h5>(b) Discounting Rate vs. Discounting Factor:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Discounting Rate (or Discount Rate):</strong> This is the interest rate (expressed as a percentage, e.g., 10%) used to calculate the present value of future cash flows. It reflects the time value of money and the risk associated with receiving the cash flow in the future. A higher discount rate implies a higher required return or greater risk, resulting in a lower present value.</li>
                                <li><strong>Discounting Factor (or Present Value Factor):</strong> This is a numerical value (less than 1) derived from the discount rate and the time period. It represents the value today of one unit of currency (e.g., $1 or Ksh 1) to be received at a specific point in the future. It is calculated as 1 / (1 + r)<sup>n</sup>, where 'r' is the discount rate per period and 'n' is the number of periods. Multiplying a future cash flow by its corresponding discount factor gives its present value.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>(c) Analysis of Absent Students Data:</h5>
                            <p><i>Note: Relative frequencies for 0, 5, 6, and 7 absent students are missing from Table 7 in the OCR data (line 153). The sum of given relative frequencies (0.20 + 0.18 + 0.04 + 0.02 = 0.44) is less than 1. Calculations require the complete distribution. Assuming the missing frequencies are for 0 students = 0.40, 5 students = 0.10, 6 students = 0.04, 7 students = 0.02 (to make the sum = 1.00) for demonstration.</i></p>

                            <p><strong>(ii) Median:</strong></p>
                            <p>The median is the value of x where the cumulative relative frequency first reaches or exceeds 0.50.</p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Since the cumulative frequency exceeds 0.50 at x=1, the median is <strong>1</strong> absent student.</p>

                            <p>The mode is the value of x with the highest relative frequency.</p>
                            <p>Based on the assumed frequencies, the highest relative frequency is 0.40 for x=0. The mode is <strong>0</strong> absent students.</p>

                            <p>First, calculate the variance (σ²):</p>
                            <p>σ² = Σ[(x - μ)² * P(x)] = 3.83040</p> <!-- Corrected variance sum -->
                            <p>Then, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance:</p>
                            <p>σ = √σ² = √3.83040 ≈ <strong>1.96</strong> absent students</p>
