            <li>‚úì It is a worldwide (global or an international) network of computers that provide a variety of resources and data to the people that use it.</li>
            <li>‚úì Internet refers to a global inter-connection of computers and computer networks to facilitate global information transfer. It is an interconnection of computers throughout the world, using ordinary telecommunication lines and modems.</li>

        <h2>üìö Features and functions of the Internet</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
          <ol type="i">
            <li>The Internet is a collection of networks; it is not owned or controlled by any single organization, and it has no formal management organization. However, there is an <strong>Internet Society</strong> that co ordinates and sets standards for its use.
              <p>In addition, Networks have no political boundaries on the exchange of information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Networks are connected by <strong>Gateways</strong> that effectively remove barriers so that one type of network can ‚Äútalk‚Äù to a different type of network.</li>
            <li>To join the Internet, an existing network will only be required to pay a small registration fee and agree to certain standards based on TCP/IP.
              <p>The costs are low, because the Internet owns nothing, and so it has no real costs to offset. Each organization pays for its own network & its own telephone bills, but these costs usually exist independent of the Internet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Networks that join the Internet must agree to move each other‚Äôs traffic (data) at no charge to the others, just as it is the case with mail delivered through the International Postal system. This is why all the data appear to move at the cost of a local telephone call, making the <strong>Net</strong> a very cheap communication media.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <section id="internet-services" class="content-section">
        <h2>üìö Internet Services</h2>

          <ol type="i">
            <li>Electronic mail (e-mail).</li>
            <li>Fax services.</li>
            <li>Conference services.</li>

            <li>Video Conferencing.</li>
            <li>Access & Use of other computers.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Electronic Mail (E-mail).</h3>
          <p>An <strong>E-mail</strong> is a system that enables sending & receiving of messages electronically through computers. It is used for communication between organizations or departments in the same organization.</p>
          <p>E-mail is a quick, cheap, efficient & convenient means of communication with both individuals and groups. It is faster than ordinary mail, easy to manage, inexpensive and saves paper.</p>
          <p>With Internet mail, it is possible to send and receive messages quickly from businesses, friends or family in another part of the world. An E-mail message can travel around the world in minutes.</p>

          <h3>Fax services.</h3>
          <p>Fax services enable individuals & businesses to send faxes through e-mail at a lower cost compared to the usual international Fax charges.</p>

          <h3>Conference services.</h3>
          <p><strong>Conferencing on the Web</strong> can be defined as the dynamic exchange of all kinds of information ‚Äì text, graphics, audio, video, etc ‚Äì in a situation whereby the conversations are organized by item and allows a participant to contribute spontaneous responses to any item in the conversation.</p>

          <h4>Application of Conferencing on the Web.</h4>
          <p>The conversation can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>ÔÇ∑ Provide important information that can assist in decision-making.</li>
            <li>ÔÇ∑ Provide any required technical support.</li>
            <li>ÔÇ∑ Help in community-building, project management & distance learning.</li>
            <li>ÔÇ∑ Help to organize electronic meetings, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Internet also allows you to have access to various types of information you might require to make accurate and informed decisions, E.g., it provides information on business, education, sports, politics, etc.</p>

          <h3>Chatting.</h3>
          <p><strong>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</strong> is a chatting system on the Internet that allows a large no. of people from various locations of the world who are on the computer to chat (i.e., simultaneously hold live and interactive electronic conversations) among themselves.</p>
          <p>You can join discussion groups on the Internet and meet people around the world with similar interests. You can ask questions, discuss problems and read interesting stories.</p>
          <p>Anyone interested in chatting can join a discussion forum on one of the listed topics. Only people who happen to be signed on at the same time are able to talk because messages are not stored.</p>
          <p>This discussion can be an effective business tool if people who can benefit from interactive conversation set a specific appointment to meet and talk on a particular topic.</p>

          <h4>Disadvantage.</h4>
          <ol type="i">
            <li>Usually, the topic is open to all without security; so intruders can participate.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Information retrieval.</h3>
          <p>The Internet is a voluntarily decentralized network with no central listing of participants or sites. Therefore, End-users, usually working from PCs are able to search & find information of interest located in different sites assisted by special software and data stored in readily usable formats.</p>
          <p>The Internet gives you information on almost any subject. This is because of the Worldwide Web (www).</p>
          <p><strong>The World Wide Web</strong> is a global (an international) system of connected Web pages containing information such as, text, pictures, sound and video. The WWW is <strong>hypertext based</strong> (i.e., it is able to access text and graphical data formatted for easy search, retrieval and display).</p>
          <p>With the WWW, you can review Newspapers, magazines, academic papers, etc. In addition, Governments, colleges, universities, companies and individuals offer free information on the Internet. E.g., you can inquire (find out) about universities in Britain or America.</p>

          <h3>Dowloading of Programs.</h3>
          <p>There are thousands of programs available on the Internet. These programs include; Word processors, Spreadsheets, Electronic cards, etc.</p>
          <p>You can therefore, look for the latest software over the Internet, e.g., you can get the latest Anti-virus software, and in addition, retrieve a free trial issue.</p>

          <h3>Entertainment.</h3>
          <p>There are hundreds of simple games available on the Internet. These include; Chess, Football, etc. The Internet also allows you review current Movies and hear Television theme songs.</p>

          <h3>Online Shopping.</h3>
          <p>You can order goods and services on the Internet without leaving your desk. E.g., you can view a catalogue of a certain clothes shop over the Internet and fill in an online Order form.</p>
          <p>Commercial enterprises use the Web to provide information on demand for purposes of customer support, marketing and sales.</p>

          <h3>File Transfer.</h3>
          <p>Data in the form of files can be transferred across the Internet from one site to another using the <strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</strong>. FTP software is needed at both ends to handle the transfer. It is through FTP that the two pieces of software manage to 8understand9 each other.</p>

          <h3>Discussion Groups.</h3>
          <p>A <strong>Discussion group</strong> is a collection of users who have joined together to discuss some topic. There are many discussions on different topics including Cooking, Skydiving, Politics, Education, recreational, scientific research, etc.</p>
          <p>Two of the commonly used discussion groups for business are;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>ÔÇ® Usenet newsgroups.</li>
            <li>ÔÇ® List Servers.</li>
          </ul>
          <ol type="a">
            <li><strong>Usenet newsgroups.</strong>
              <p>These are the most formally organized of the discussion groups.</p>
              <p>Using a facility on the Internet called <strong>USENET</strong>, individuals can gain access to a very wide variety of information topics.</p>
            </li>

      <section id="browsing-the-web" class="content-section">
        <h2>üìö Browsing the Web</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
          <p>This is also known as <strong>Navigating</strong> or <strong>‚ÄòSurfing‚Äô the Web</strong>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>ÔÅ∂ To <strong>Browse</strong> is to navigate the Internet or the contents of your computer.</li>
            <li>ÔÅ∂ <strong>Browsing</strong> can also be defined as moving around and between Web pages.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Using a Web browsing software you can read documents, listen to music, watch videos, make purchases, participate in surveys, advertise products, do research, share interests and download files on the Web.</p>

          <h3>EXPLORING / BROWSING THE INTERNET.</h3>
          <p>Use the <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> on your Windows desktop to browse the Web.</p>
          <p>There are several ways in which you can browse the Web pages or <surf the net=""></surf>.</p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>When viewing a Web page, you can navigate the Internet by clicking <strong>Links</strong>, <strong>Underlined text</strong> or special features that cause you to jump to another Web page.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Hyperlinks.</h3>
          <p>A <strong>Hyperlink</strong> is a coloured or underlined text or a graphic that you click to 8jump9 from one location to another. The hyperlinks enable the user to 8jump9 to another file, or to another location in the same file.</p>
          <p>All Web pages have hyperlinks. These links:</p>
          <ol type="i">
            <li>Connect one part of a Web page to another part of the same Web page. This is useful if the Web page is large.</li>
            <li>Connect one Web page to another Website somewhere on the Web.</li>
            <li>Connect a page to a file, such as a sound clip, video, a Spreadsheet or a Word document.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The links can connect to objects stored anywhere on the Internet.</p>
          <p><strong>Hypertext links</strong> are indicated by underlined text highlighted usually in blue. Hyperlinks can also be represented by buttons, graphics or pictures.</p>
          <p>To find hyperlinks on a page, move your mouse pointer over the page and where there is a hyperlink, the mouse pointer will change into a hand with a pointing finger. When you click a link, another Web page appears.</p>
          <p>As you browse the Web, Internet Explorer stores the sites and pages that you visit. Usually, the hyperlinks you previously selected are colored differently. Internet Explorer does this to remind you that you have already visited the page identified by this link.</p>
          <ol type="b" start="2">
            <li>You can also use the Standard toolbar buttons in the Internet Explorer to move between Web pages, or to search the Internet.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>History.</h3>
          <p>Internet Explorer remembers the Websites and Web pages that you have visited. It keeps record of each Web page as it is downloaded. This is the <strong>History</strong> feature.</p>
          <p>You can therefore, easily return to the page you have visited. To redisplay the page you have just left, click on the <strong>Back</strong> button. To move to the next page (available only if you have moved back), click the <strong>Forward</strong> button.</p>

          <h3>Web Hosting.</h3>
          <p>A <strong>World Wide Web Server</strong> is a computer with programs that answer requests for documents from <strong>Clients</strong> (browsers) over the Internet. Files containing Web sites are placed on these servers.</p>
          <p>A <strong>Host computer</strong> is any computer connected to the Internet and stores information that has been made available to the Web.</p>
          <p>ISPs also use host computers to store user‚Äôs electronic mail messages, Web sites and other related facilities such as, support software and appropriate security.</p>
