        <h2>üìö Introduction to Databases</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
          <p>A <strong>database</strong> is an organized collection of data. It is the collection of tables, queries, reports, views, and other objects. The data are typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.</p>
          <p>A <strong>database management system (DBMS)</strong> is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases. Well-known DBMSs include MySQL, Oracle and MS Access</p>

      <section id="traditional-file-organization" class="content-section">
        <h2>üìö Traditional File Organization</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
          <p>Traditional file organization refers to an approach to organizing computer-based or electronic files. Prior to computer databases, many businesses simply organized files by creating folder structures and placed documents and files into folders based on category or type. This method has given way to database systems in many cases. However, traditional filing is sometimes advantageous if you have a relatively small number of files.</p>

          <h3>Simple to Use</h3>
          <p>The traditional filing system is very simple to set up and use, assuming the number of files you maintain is small. If you have five basic categories of documents and a limited number of files in each, for instance, you don't need a database system to easily store, maintain and retrieve your files. You also don't have to worry about learning a software system and training employees to use it.</p>

          <h3>Minimal Investment</h3>
          <p>If you're using a traditional filing system, you also don't have to make an investment in a software database that may include an upfront purchase and ongoing licensing fees. Naturally, you need a computer, which is fairly commonplace in business whether you store files or not. Your basic file structure is maintained right in your computer's hard drive. Alternatively, you can purchase a very inexpensive external hard drive that allows you to transport files from one computer to another.</p>

          <h3>Poor Data Integration</h3>
          <p>A major deficiency of the traditional filing system is that it doesn't enable cross-file data integration or data sharing. With a software-based filing system, you can maintain various folders but you can cross-match searches to retrieve documents in multiple files. Additionally, you can enable multiple employees to search through shared data files. This integration reduces time to search through all individual files, a benefit that's especially important if you maintain a large amount of files or have a large client base.</p>

          <h3>Duplication and Lack of Security</h3>
          <p>You also risk duplication of data if you don't integrate your files through a database. In a traditional system, your computer doesn't recognize that you create similar documents and store them in different file locations. Additionally, your traditional filing system doesn't offer nearly the level of security that a carefully crafted database filing system does. Encrypted data and current security are key features as company's regularly develop enhanced database systems.</p>

        <h2>üìö What are Data Models? Type of Data Models.</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
          <p>A model is a representation of reality, 'real world' objects and events, associations. It is an abstraction that concentrates on the essential, inherent aspects an organization and ignores the accidental properties. A data model represents the organization itself. It should provide the basic concepts and notations that will allow database designers and end users unambiguously and accurately to communicate their understanding of the organizational data.</p>
          <p><strong>Data Model</strong> can be defined as an integrated collection of <strong>concepts</strong> for describing and manipulating data, relationships between data, and constraints on the data in an organization.</p>

          <h3>A data model comprises of three components:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>‚úì A structural part, consisting of a set of rules according to which databases can be constructed.</li>
            <li>‚úì A manipulative part, defining the types of operation that are allowed on the data (this includes the operations that are used for updating or retrieving data from the database and for changing the structure of the database).</li>
            <li>‚úì Possibly a set of integrity rules, which ensures that the data is accurate.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The purpose of a data model is to represent data and to make the data understandable. There have been many data models proposed in the literature. They fall into three broad categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Object Based Data Models</li>
            <li>Physical Data Models</li>
            <li>Record Based Data Models</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The object based and record based data models are used to describe data at the conceptual and external levels, the physical data model is used to¬∑ describe data at the internal level.</p>

          <h3>Object Based Data Models</h3>
          <p>Object based data models use concepts such as entities, attributes, and relationships. An entity is a distinct object (a person, place, concept, and event) in the organization that is to be represented in the database. An attribute is a property that describes some aspect of the object that we wish to record, and a relationship is an association between entities.</p>
          <p>Some of the more common types of object based data model are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Entity-Relationship</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Object Oriented</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Semantic</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Functional</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The Entity-Relationship model has emerged as one of the main techniques for modeling database design and forms the basis for the database design methodology. The object oriented data model extends the definition of an entity to include, not only the attributes that describe the state of the object but also the actions that are associated with the object, that is, its behavior. The object is said to encapsulate both state and behavior. Entities in semantic systems represent the equivalent of a record in a relational system or an object in an OO system but they do not include behaviour (methods). They are abstractions 'used to represent real world (e.g. customer) or conceptual (e.g. bank account) objects. The functional data model is now almost twenty years old. The original idea was to' view the database as a collection of extensionally defined functions and to use a functional language for querying the database.</p>

          <h3>Physical Data Models</h3>
          <p>Physical data models describe how data is stored in the computer, representing information such as record structures, record ordering, and access paths. There are not as many physical data models as logical data models, the most common one being the Unifying Model.</p>

          <h3>Record Based Logical Models</h3>
          <p>Record based logical models are used in describing data at the logical and view levels. In contrast to object based data models, they are used to specify the overall logical structure of the database and to provide a higher-level description of the implementation. Record based models are so named because the database is structured in fixed format records of several types. Each record type defines a fixed number of fields, or attributes, and each field is usually of a fixed length.</p>
          <p>The three most widely accepted record based data models are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Hierarchical Model</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Network Model</li>
            <li>‚Ä¢ Relational Model</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The relational model has gained favor over the other two in recent years. The network and hierarchical models are still used in a large number of older databases.</p>

        <h2>üìö Introduction to Microsoft Access</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
          <p>MS Access is a database management tool that enables one to have good command of data collected. The programme enables one to retrieve, sort, summarize and report results speedily and effectively. It can combine data from various files through creating relationships, and can make data entry more efficient and accurate.</p>
          <p>Microsoft Access (MS Access) enables one to manage all important information from a single database file. Within the file, one can use:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>‚úì Tables to store your data.</li>
            <li>‚úì Queries to find and retrieve specific data of interest.</li>
            <li>‚úì Forms to view, add, and update data in tables.</li>
            <li>‚úì Reports to analyze or print data in a specific layout.</li>
            <li>‚úì Data access pages to view or update, the data.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In MS Access, data is stored once in one table, but can be viewed from multiple locations. When the data is updated in a Table, Query or Form, it is automatically updated everywhere it appears</p>
          <p><strong>Microsoft Access</strong> is a relational database management system for windows. Using this package, following tasks can be performed.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>ÔÇß Organize data into manageable related units Enter, modify and locate data</li>
            <li>ÔÇß Extract subsets of data based on specific criteria Create custom forms and reports</li>
            <li>ÔÇß Automate common database tasks Graph database relationships</li>
            <li>ÔÇß Add clipart to forms and reports</li>
            <li>ÔÇß Create macros for automating various functions</li>
            <li>ÔÇß Create database applications, consisting of modules linked through menus, dialog boxes, and command buttons.</li>
            <li>ÔÇß In Access, the term Database refers to a single file that contains a collection of information. Each Access Database consists of tables, queries ,forms reports, macros and modules</li>

        <h2>üìö Database Concepts</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
          <h3>Field Names</h3>
          <p>These should be meaningful, without spaces or punctuation, such as SNAME (surname), FNAME (first name), DOB (date of birth), ADDRESS1 (first line of address), TOWN, PCODE, PHONE etc. You cannot have two fields with the same name.</p>

          <h3>Field Types</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>ÔÇß Text for text and whole numbers that aren‚Äôt going to be used in calculations(e.g., age, phone number)</li>
            <li>ÔÇß Date/Time for dates and time</li>
            <li>ÔÇß Numbers for decimals and numbers that are going to be used in calculations, e.g. sales figures</li>
            <li>ÔÇß Currency for money</li>
            <li>ÔÇß Yes/No for true/false logical values, e.g. a 5married6 field, field could be logical.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Field length</h3>
          <p>This has to be fixed, so you need to plan your database structure beforehand (although you can alter the length later).</p>

          <h3>Required Fields</h3>
          <p>This box is for when you want to force the user to enter data in a field</p>

          <h3>Primary keys</h3>
          <p>These are used to sort the records to allow fast access. Access encourages you choose one field</p>
