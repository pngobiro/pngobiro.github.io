    <h3>Introduction to Spreadsheets</h3>
        <p>A spreadsheet is used to carry out everything from simple addition to complex financial and statistical analyses. Spreadsheet programs can also help you create charts and graphs based on the data you've entered.</p>
        <p>A <strong>spreadsheet</strong> is a computer program (or a document produced by such a program) that we can use for arithmetic computations. A spreadsheet offers major advantages over the use of a hand calculator (just as a word processing program offers many advantages over typewriting).
         Among the advantages of a spreadsheet over a hand calculator:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A spreadsheet produces a document that can be read, printed, and stored and retrieved.</li>
            <li>A spreadsheet can have its calculations done in a fashion by which they may be redone automatically if any of the data values upon which they depend, are changed.</li>
            <li>The numbers that appear in a spreadsheet are easily used as the foundation of "charts" or "graphs" that may be used to illustrate the relationships among these numbers. We can build bar charts, pie charts, line charts, etc.</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
       </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3>The Main Spreadsheets</h3>
        <p>Numerous spreadsheets have been produced by the main software companies. The main spreadsheets are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>, in the <em>Microsoft Office</em> office suite</li>
            <li><strong>Sun StarOffice Calc</strong>, in the <em>StarOffice</em> suite</li>
            <li><strong>OpenCalc</strong>, in the <em>OpenOffice</em> suite</li>
            <li><strong>IBM/Lotus 1-2-3</strong> in the <em>SmartSuite</em> suite</li>
            <li><strong>Corel Quattro Pro</strong> in the <em>WordPerfect</em> suite</li>
           <li><strong>KSpread</strong> in the <em>KOffice</em> free suite from Linux</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples and the notes in this document bases on the <em>Microsoft Excel</em> spreadsheet, but the other spreadsheets contain the same functionalities.</p>

       <h3>Editing a Spreadsheet</h3>
         <h4>Inserting Columns</h4>
         <p>ACTIVITY: The regional manager says we need to start tracking the number of visitors to our story each day. She wants us to insert a new <Visitors= column BETWEEN the current <Days of the Week= column and the <Customers= column in order to track this data.</p>
        <ol>
           <li> Click into any cell within the column that will become the first column to the right of the new column. Which column is that for us??</li>
            <li>Now click on INSERT and choose COLUMN. You will see a new column appear. (in Excel 2007, in the CELL quick menu, click the word INSERT, select INSERT SHEET COLUMNS)</li>
        </ol>
       <p> ACTIVITY: Starting in B2, type the following number of visitors for each day: 30, 32, 45, 90, 65, 200, 130.</p>
        <h4>Inserting Rows</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Click into any cell within the row that will become the first row below the new row.</li>
          <li>Click on INSERT and choose ROW. (in Excel 2007, in the CELL quick menu, click the word INSERT, select INSERT SHEET ROWS)</li>
          <li>You will see a new row appear.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Inserting Cells</h4>
       <ol>
            <li>Click into the cell where a new cell needs to be inserted.</li>
          <li>Click on INSERT and click on CELLS (in Excel 2007, in the CELL quick menu, click the word INSERT, select INSERT CELLS)</li>
          <li>Choose one of the four choices that appear:</li>
           <ol type = "a">
            <li>SHIFT CELLS RIGHT means that when you insert the new cell, the existing cell will be shifted to the right.</li>
             <li>SHIFT CELLS DOWN means that when you insert the new cell, the existing cell will be shifted down.</li>
            <li> The other two choices, ENTIRE ROW, and ENTIRE column are alternative ways to inserting rows and columns.</li>
           </ol>
        </ol>
       </section>

       <section>
        <h3>Copy and Pasting</h3>
         <p> In Excel, you use the Copy and Paste feature when you want to duplicate a cell or block of cells in another location within the spreadsheet. The original cell will remain in the original location, but a second copy is found at the new location.</p>
        <p> ACTIVITY: The regional manager wants a total number of visitors for the week. We can copy the formula from C9 into box B9.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Click on C9 (the source cell).</li>
            <li>Click on EDIT and choose COPY.</li>
            <li>Click on cell B9 (the destination cell) and click on EDIT and choose PASTE.</li>
          <li> See the total appear.</li>
          <li> *NOTE* Excel converts the formula9s column <C= references into column <B= references. To prevent this automatic adjustment, which is called Relative Cell Referencing, place $ signs in front of the column and/or row reference that you don9t want Excel to adjust when that cell is copied to another location. For example, if C9 contained <=SUM($C$2:$C$8)=, when it is copied to B9, it will still read <=SUM($C$2:$C$8)=. When Excel9s relative cell referencing is blocked by $ signs, it is known as Absolute Cell Referencing.</li>
           <li>With Excel 2007, use the CLIPBOARD quick menu to access copy and paste features. You may access the copy and paste options by clicking the right mouse button to bring up the quick menu.</li>
        </ol>
       </section>

       <section>
         <h3>Cutting and Pasting</h3>
         <p> Use this function when you want to move a cell or block of cells from one location to another. No trace of the cell(s) will remain in the original location.</p>
         <ol>
          <li>Click on the cell(s) you would like to cut (the source cell).</li>
           <li>Click on EDIT and choose CUT.</li>
          <li>Click on the cell where you want this cell to reappear (the destination cell) and click on EDIT and PASTE.</li>
         <li>See the cut-cell reappear in the new location.</li>
           <li>With Excel 2007, use the CLIPBOARD quick menu to access copy and paste features. You may access the copy and paste options by clicking the right mouse button to bring up the quick menu.</li>
        </ol>

       <h3>Formatting a Spreadsheet</h3>
         <h4>Formatting a Cell</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>You must highlight the cell or block of cells you want to format.</li>
           <li>After you highlight the cells, choose FORMAT from the menu and select CELLS to see your choices.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Number: Allows you to select the format for the type of data within the cells. For example, choose CURRENCY if you are using dollar values, and Excel will add a $ sign in front of the cells.</li>
               <li>Alignment: Allows you to control the positioning of the text or number in your cell. If you have a lot of text in one cell, and you don9t want to expand the cell9s width, you can choose WRAP TEXT.</li>
                <li>Font: You can change the style and size of the highlighted text or numbers, including making them bold, underlined or italic. This is the same as the Microsoft Word formatting.</li>
                <li>Border: Allows you to add vertical or horizontal lines to different parts of the worksheet. You can choose where you9d like the grid lines to print out, the line style, and even the line color.</li>
                <li>Patterns: Allows you to control the background color of the highlighted cells and to add patterns. Use this to visually isolate data.</li>
                <li>Protection: Allows you to lock cells and hide formulae from careless or unauthorized users. Remember, if you password protect your spreadsheet, make sure you remember the password!</li>
               <li> In Excel 2007, you can access most of these features from the quick menus under the HOME tab. To access the features for border, pattern, and protection, click the small arrow from the FONT, ALIGNMENT, or NUMBER quick menus to access these and other formatting features.</li>
               </ul>
