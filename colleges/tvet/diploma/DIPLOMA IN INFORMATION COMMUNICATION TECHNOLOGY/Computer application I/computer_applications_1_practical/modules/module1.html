                <h2>Computer Application/Application software</h2>
                <p>An application program (app or application for short) is a computer program designed to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the benefit of the user.</p>
                <p>Recall is as the non-physical parts of the computer. A computer uses to get the job done. They are the instructions given to the computer.Software needs to be accessed before it can be used. There are many terms used for process of accessing software including running, executing, starting up, opening, and others.</p>

             <section class="sub-section">
                <h2>Types of Software</h2>
                <p>The three basic types of software are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Commercial</strong> - prepackaged and is available from software stores and through the Internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shareware</strong> - developed by individual and small companies that cannot afford to market their software worldwide or by a company that wants to release a demonstration version of their commercial product.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open source software</strong> - created by generous programmers and released into the public domain for public use.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Software can be used as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Switch on the computer.</li>
                    <li>Open the application software</li>
                    <li>Input data</li>
                    <li>Processing</li>
                    <li>Store/Output</li>
                    <li>Close file</li>
                    <li>Close the application</li>
                    <li>Turn off the computer.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Classification of Computer software</h2>
                <p>Computer software is classified as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>System Software</strong> - Software that handle the running of your computer's hardware.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application Software</strong> - Software that has been developed to solve a particular problem, or perform specific task for the user. System Software controls the location and usage of hardware resources and enables the application software to run.</li>
                </ul>

               <section class="sub-section">
                  <h2>System software</h2>
                 <p>This is the type of software that enables the computer to manage its resource. It is further divided into;</p>
                   <ul>
                     <li><strong>Firmware</strong> - system software fixed into hardware components e.g. BIOS.</li>
                     <li><strong>Network</strong> - type of computer software that enable computers to communicate over a network</li>
                     <li><strong>Utility</strong>3 used to manage computer files, diagnose and repair computer problems e.g. antivirus, compilers, diagnostic tools etc</li>
                     <li><strong>Operating systems</strong> 3 provides the interface between the user, the hardware and the application software</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h2>Application software</h2>
                   <p>This is the type of software that solve specific problems or perform specific tasks. It is divided into;</p>
                   <ul>
                     <li><strong>Off</strong> 3 the 3 shelf application software 3 programs developed by software engineers and made available in the market for sale. Normally sold in bundles called program suites e.g. the Microsoft Office programs suite.</li>
                     <li><strong>In</strong> 3 house 3developed packages 3also referred to as tailor 3made 3 application software. Designed or tailored t solve problems specific to an organisation.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Example of operating system: Ms DOS, PC DOS, UNIX, Linux, Windows etc.</p>

                <h2>Stating the applications in a computers</h2>
                <p>Here we will learn how to Open and Close an application. An application, sometimes called a program, performs a certain task. There are literally hundreds of applications and it would be impossible for us to know them all. The good news is that applications Open (start) and Close (end) in the same manner.</p>
                 <h3>Open an Application via the Desktop</h3>
                <p>Let8s review a few concepts we covered on a previous lessons. The Desktop is the image you see when your computer powers on. Located on your Desktop are Icons and these Icons are graphic images that when clicked will Open or 5start6 a program. Placed on your Desktop is an Icon to a commonly played card game called Solitaire. We will use this application to practice Opening and Closing an application.</p>
                 <p>Click on the Solitaire Icon to open the application.</p>
                 <figure class="content-image">
                 <img src="../assets/images/module1-solitaire_icon.jpg" alt="The Solitaire Icon on the Desktop" width="600" height="300">
                   <figcaption>The Solitaire Icon</figcaption>
                  </figure>

                <h3>Close an Application</h3>
                 <p>After clicking on the Solitaire Icon, the application will Open or start. A screen similar to below will appear.</p>

                <figure class="content-image">
                 <img src="../assets/images/module1-solitaire_open.jpg" alt="Solitaire application open" width="600" height="400">
                   <figcaption>Solitaire Game Window</figcaption>
                  </figure>

                <p> On the screen in the upper right corner is a red X : . Click on the  to close the application. Closing the application will stop or end the program, putting it away.</p>

            </section>
             <section class="sub-section">
               <h3>Open an Application via the Start Menu</h3>
                <p>Earlier we opened the Solitaire application by clicking the Solitaire Icon on the Desktop. Now, let8s use the Start button to open the Solitaire application. The Start button is located in the lower left corner of the Desktop and looks like this:</p>

                <figure class="content-image">
                 <img src="../assets/images/module1-start_button.jpg" alt="Start button on the Desktop" width="600" height="300">
                   <figcaption>Start Button</figcaption>
                  </figure>
               <p>Click on the Start Button located on your Desktop. The Start Menu will appear. The Start Menu allows for accessing your applications, getting help, or changing options on your computer. Slowly move your mouse to the All Programs.</p>

               <figure class="content-image">
                 <img src="../assets/images/module1-start_menu.jpg" alt="Start menu options" width="600" height="400">
                   <figcaption>Start Menu</figcaption>
                  </figure>

              <p>The All Programs menu will expand showing you the programs in your computer. The All Programs menu may vary from computer to computer as each computer could have different programs loaded. In the list of programs, look for the menu option that says Games and looks like:</p>
               <figure class="content-image">
                 <img src="../assets/images/module1-games_menu.jpg" alt="Games menu option" width="600" height="300">
                   <figcaption>Games Menu Icon</figcaption>
                  </figure>

             <p>Notice there is a triangle beside the word Games. The triangle is referred to as an arrow and indicates there are more menu options. If you move your mouse to the arrow the other options will appear. Move your mouse to the arrow and the Games Menu appears. The list of games may be different from computer to computer.</p>

               <figure class="content-image">
                 <img src="../assets/images/module1-games_list.jpg" alt="List of games available" width="600" height="400">
                   <figcaption>Games Menu List</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                <p>Slowly move your mouse over to the list of games and down (not diagonally - straight over and then straight down!) to Solitaire. Once your mouse is on Solitaire click your mouse to open the application. Solitaire should open as you saw earlier. Once again, you can close the application with the X in the upper right hand corner.</p>
               <p><strong>Important!</strong></p>
               <p>It's a good idea to close any open applications before you shut down your computer!</p>

              <p><strong>Interesting bit</strong></p>
              <p>Many of the games on the computer will help strengthen your mouse skills, so it is like mouse practice!</p>
