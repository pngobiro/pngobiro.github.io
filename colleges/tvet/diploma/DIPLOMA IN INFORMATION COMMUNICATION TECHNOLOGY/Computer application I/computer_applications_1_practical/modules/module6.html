        <h2>üìö Introduction to Desk Top Publishing</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
          <p><strong>Desktop publishing (abbreviated DTP)</strong> is the creation of documents using page layout skills on a personal computer primarily for print. Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic quality text and images comparable to traditional typography and printing.</p>
          <p>The term <strong>Desktop Publishing</strong> (-or <strong>DTP</strong> for short) covers a broad range of activities. In it's widest sense, it can mean anything concerned with creating a printed document on a desktop PC.</p>
          <p>Desktop Publishing [is] anything where you need <strong>precise control</strong> over the position of text and/or graphics on the printed page. DTP software is an enhanced combination of word processor and graphics software that allow manipulation of text, graphics and typefaces on screen before finally printing a design on paper</p>
          <p>However, most simple documents can be handled by a <strong>Word Processor</strong> and do not require the more advanced facilities of a dedicated <strong>DTP application</strong> and so we normally refer to Desktop Publishing as anything where you need <strong>precise control</strong> of the position of text and/or graphics on the printed page. Typical DTP candidates include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Books containing diagrams</li>
            <li>Newsletters</li>
            <li>Advertising Flyers</li>
            <li>Leaflets</li>
            <li>Anything that requires multi-column output</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            <p>graphics falls into five major categories; photographs, illustrations, texture, line drawings and cartoon or caricature</p>
          </div>
          <p>A DTP package allows the different types of graphics be incorporated in a publication</p>

          <h3>Types of DTP software</h3>
          <p>DTP software may divide into two:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Layout based software</strong> ‚Äì combines text and graphics to create publication. Single page artistic layouts or short documents that combines text and graphics requires a page layout tool that provides extensive typographic control and graphic loading capabilities which is a feature of layout based software. Typical projects for page layout tools include fliers, posters and business cards
              <p>i.e. ‚Äì MS Publisher, Page maker</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Print and draw software</strong> ‚Äì provides an environment for drawing and manipulating graphics. There are two main types of graphics packages
              <ol type="a">
                <li><strong>Vector graphics</strong> ‚Äì use/create vector image. Vector image are made up of individual, scalable objects defined by mathematical equations. Objects here consist of lines, curves and shapes with editable attributes as color, fill and outline.
                  <p>i.e. ‚Äì Corel draw and Illustrator</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bitmap graphics</strong> ‚Äì use/create bitmap image. Bitmap image also called raster image are made up of pixels. Pixels are picture elements made up of tiny dots of individual color that make up/define an image.
                  <p>i.e. ‚Äì Photoshop and MS paint</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>

        <h2>üìö Microsoft Publisher</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
          <p><strong>Microsoft Publisher</strong> is an entry-level desktop publishing application from Microsoft, differing from Microsoft Word in that the emphasis is placed on page layout and design rather than text composition and proofing</p>
          <p>Publisher is included in higher-end editions of Microsoft Office, reflecting Microsoft's emphasis on the application as an easy-to-use and less expensive alternative to the "heavyweights" with a focus on the small business market where firms do not have dedicated design professionals available to make marketing materials and other documents. However, it has a relatively small share of the desktop publishing market, which is dominated by Adobe Applications.</p>
          <p>In Microsoft Office 2007, while most of Microsoft Office apps adopted ribbons in their user interface, Publisher retained its toolbars and did not adopt ribbons until the next version</p>

          <h3>Publisher Basics and Feature</h3>
          <p>Microsoft Publisher 2007 is a desktop publishing program that can be used to create a variety of publications. Using Publisher, you can easily create business cards, greeting cards, calendars, newsletters and much, much more.</p>
          <p>Unlike the other programs in Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Publisher 2007 uses the Microsoft Office Toolbar and a Menu system in place of the Microsoft Office Ribbon.</p>

          <h4>Some Useful Definitions:</h4>
          <dl>
            <dt>Frame</dt>
              <dd>‚Äì Most publications are divided into several different areas called frames. A frame can contain a variety of objects such as graphics, tables, or text boxes. Frames can be resized, moved and manipulated to suit your needs.</dd>
            <dt>Handles</dt>
              <dd>‚Äì When you click on a frame, small circles appear around the edge of the frame. These are called handles. You can click and drag on the handles to resize your frame.</dd>

        <h2>üìö Working with Color Schemes</h2>
        <div class="content-box">
          <p>A color scheme is a set of colors that you group together to use with your publication. You may want to create a color scheme for specific projects or simply to maintain and quickly access the colors you use most frequently. A color scheme can also be used to develop a consistent, polished look for your publication. Colors in a color scheme may be applied to any element of the publication. This document contains sections on the following topics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creating a Custom Color Scheme</li>
            <li>Applying a Color Scheme</li>
            <li>Using the Colors of a Color Scheme</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Creating a Custom Color Scheme</h3>
          <p>Your color scheme will most likely consist of colors that complement each other as well as some that provide contrast. You can create and save multiple schemes for use in a variety of publications.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create or open a publication</li>
            <li>On the Publisher task pane, click <strong>COLOR SCHEMES</strong> OR From the <strong>Format</strong> menu, select <strong>Color Schemes...</strong> The <strong>Color Schemes</strong> task pane appears.</li>

You can apply one of these or a custom scheme that you have created.

          <h3>Using the Colors of a Color Scheme</h3>

          <p>You can add a line border of any color or thickness, a predesigned border, or a custom border to a page, text box, AutoShape, picture, or around a group of objects in your publication.</p>
          <p>You can also use a picture that is designed to be a border. For example, you can insert a page border clip from Clip Art and Media on Microsoft Office Online, and then change the size to fit the page or object that you want to add a border to.</p>
          <p>If the page, text box, AutoShape, picture, or group of items already has a border, you can change or remove it.</p>

          <h3>Add a border to a page</h3>
          <p>To add a border to a page, draw a rectangle around the page and then add the line or predesigned border you want. To add a border to all the pages in your publication, add the border to a master page, and then apply the master page to the pages in your publication.</p>

            <li>Note the minimum margins.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>To make sure that all sides of the border will print, you can preview your publication by clicking <strong>Print Preview</strong> on the <strong>File</strong> menu.</p>

            <li>Click the <strong>Colors and Lines</strong> tab.</li>

              <h4>Add a line border of any color or width</h4>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Under <strong>Line</strong>, choose the color and line options you want.</li>
                <li>To add the border equally to both the inside and the outside of the rectangle, rather than to the inside only, clear the <strong>Draw border inside frame</strong> check box.
                  <p>This helps to prevent the border from overlapping objects that are located inside of the rectangle.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Add a predesigned pattern border</h4>

                <li>In the <strong>Create Custom Border</strong> dialog box, to add a picture from a file that is located on your computer's hard disk without adding it to the Microsoft Clip Organizer, clear the <strong>Use Clip Organizer to select the picture</strong> check box.</li>
                <li>Click <strong>Select Picture</strong>.</li>
                <li>In the <strong>Insert Picture</strong> dialog box, browse to the location that contains the picture you want, click the picture, and then click <strong>Insert</strong>.</li>

              </ol>
              <p>If the file size of the picture that you select is too large (greater than 64 KB), or if the picture contains text, you may receive an error message, and the border may not be created. If this occurs, repeat step 2 through step 5 to select a picture that has a smaller file size.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Add a clip art border</h3>

          </div>
          <p>After you plan and create a Web publication in Microsoft Office Publisher 2007, you can publish it to the web, a network server, or a shared folder on your own computer. Whatever the destination, Publisher creates filtered HTML files from the Web publication. You can open and read these HTML files in any Web browser, such as Windows Internet Explorer.</p>
          <div class="summary-box">
            <strong>In this article</strong>

          </div>

          <h3>Prepare your website</h3>
          <p>Your website is an extension of you, your business, and your business branding. Before you create your website, plan it. For help with doing so, see the article Plan your Web site. <strong>What is the best tool?</strong></p>
          <p>As you plan your site and the information that it will provide, consider which authoring tool is right for your needs. Office Publisher 2007 is an excellent authoring tool to use when you want to quickly create, publish, and manage simple, static websites that match your business brand and that require revisions of only text and graphics. Office Publisher 2007 is not the appropriate tool in the following cases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>ÔÇ∑ If your website needs interactivity or database-driven content, so that visitors can respond in a Web log (blog) or purchase items in a shopping cart</li>
            <li>ÔÇ∑ If your website requires data validation, such as for verifying credit card numbers</li>
            <li>ÔÇ∑ If you expect to later alter the raw HTML code in an HTML editor after you create your website in Office Publisher 2007, which combines HTML, XML, and VML code to produce websites</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Create your website</h3>
          <p>You can create a new Web publication in Office Publisher 2007. If you want to work on an existing website for which you have no Web publication, you can copy and paste content from the published Web pages into a new Web publication, which recreates the website as a Web publication, or you can use an HTML editing tool.</p>
