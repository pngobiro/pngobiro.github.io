<p>(i) Using the AVERAGEIF() function, write a formula which could be used to calculate the average of commissions whose property value is greater than Kshs. 230,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>The formula to calculate the average commission for property values greater than Kshs. 230,000 using the AVERAGEIF() function is:</p>
<p><code>=AVERAGEIF(B2:B5,"&gt;230000",C2:C5)</code></p>
<p>This formula checks the range B2:B5 for values greater than 230000, and if the condition is met, it averages the corresponding values in the range C2:C5.</p>

</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>The formula to extract the largest commission using the MAX() function is:</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>(iii) Suppose a user entered the formula SUMIF(B2:B5,"&lt;25,000",A2:A5) in cell C6. State the expected output.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>The expected output of the formula <code>SUMIF(B2:B5,"&lt;25000",A2:A5)</code> in cell C6 would be 0.</p>
<p>This is because the SUMIF function is set to sum values in the range A2:A5 where the corresponding cells in B2:B5 are less than 25,000. However, the property values are in column B and commissions are in column C. The formula is incorrectly referencing the property values (Column B) for the condition and then attempting to sum the property values again (Column A) based on a commission condition that will never be met as commissions are all greater than 25,000. Since no property values meet the condition of corresponding commission being less than 25,000, the sum will be zero.</p>

<p>3. (a) Differentiate between magnetic and optical storage media, giving two examples in each case.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Magnetic Storage Media:</b> Magnetic storage media stores data by magnetizing a ferromagnetic material. Data is accessed by reading and writing magnetic patterns on the surface of the media. Magnetic media is generally sensitive to magnetic fields and physical impact. Examples include Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Magnetic Tapes.</p>
<p><b>Optical Storage Media:</b> Optical storage media uses lasers to read and write data on reflective surfaces. Data is encoded as variations in reflectivity on the disc surface, and read by sensing the reflection of laser light. Optical media is less susceptible to magnetic fields but can be damaged by scratches or dust. Examples include CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b> Magnetic storage uses magnetic fields for data storage and retrieval, while optical storage uses lasers. Magnetic media is generally faster for read/write operations but more sensitive to magnetic interference. Optical media is more durable against magnetic fields but can be slower and more susceptible to physical damage from scratches.</p>

<p>(c) Joseph has been advised by his supervisor to appropriately align the text on a memo he was formatting using a word-processing software. Outline four types of alignments he could use.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Left Alignment:</b> Text is aligned along the left margin, creating a ragged right edge. This is the most common alignment for body text as it is generally considered the easiest to read.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Center Alignment:</b> Text is centered between the left and right margins. This alignment is often used for titles, headings, or short lines of text to create a balanced and formal appearance.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Right Alignment:</b> Text is aligned along the right margin, creating a ragged left edge. This alignment is typically used for dates, addresses, or captions, often to position them at the side of a page or column.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Justify Alignment:</b> Text is aligned along both the left and right margins, creating straight edges on both sides. This alignment is achieved by adjusting the spacing between words and sometimes letters, often used in formal documents and newspapers for a clean, block-like text appearance.</p>

<p data-number="3"><b>Font Style (Serif/Sans-serif):</b> The heading and body text may use different font styles (e.g., heading in a serif font and body in sans-serif, or vice versa) to create visual hierarchy.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Indentation:</b> The lines under "Marketing Consortium Ltd." are indented, setting them apart from the heading and structuring the information.</p>
<p data-number="5"><b>Line Spacing:</b> There appears to be single line spacing within paragraphs and potentially more space between paragraphs to improve readability.</p>
<p data-number="6"><b>Capitalization:</b> "Marketing Consortium Ltd." uses title case capitalization, while the body text uses sentence case.</p>
<p data-number="7"><b>Alignment (Justify or Left):</b> The body text is likely justified or left-aligned to create a neat and professional appearance.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>(b) Differentiate between portrait and landscape print options used in desktop publishing.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Portrait Orientation:</b> In portrait orientation, the page is oriented vertically, meaning the height of the page is greater than its width. This is the standard orientation for documents like letters, reports, and essays, and is suitable for text-heavy documents.</p>
<p><b>Landscape Orientation:</b> In landscape orientation, the page is oriented horizontally, meaning the width of the page is greater than its height. This orientation is often used for presentations, brochures, certificates, and documents containing wide tables or images, as it provides more horizontal space.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b> Portrait is vertical (taller than wide), ideal for text documents. Landscape is horizontal (wider than tall), better for visual content and wide layouts.</p>

<p>(c) Mary realized that the text she inserted into a text box while using desktop publishing program could not fit in the box. Describe two ways she could use to have the text fit.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Reduce Font Size:</b> Decreasing the font size of the text within the text box will make the text smaller, allowing more text to fit within the same box dimensions. This is a straightforward method to fit more content without altering the box size or text content significantly.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Resize the Text Box:</b> Increasing the size of the text box by dragging its handles will expand the area available for text. Making the box larger provides more space to accommodate the existing text without needing to reduce the font size or edit the content itself.</p>

<p>(ii) Differentiate between tailor made and off-the-shelf programs as used in computer software.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Tailor-made (Custom) Programs:</b> Tailor-made programs are software applications specifically developed to meet the unique requirements of a particular organization or user.

<p>(c) Explain two circumstances under which a user would apply a cropping feature in a desktop publishing software.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>To Remove Unwanted Areas of an Image:</b> Cropping is used to eliminate unnecessary or distracting parts of an image, focusing attention on the main subject. For instance, removing background clutter or irrelevant details to emphasize a specific element within the photograph, improving visual clarity and impact.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>To Resize an Image to Fit a Layout:</b> Cropping can adjust the dimensions and aspect ratio of an image to fit a specific space or layout requirement in a document. This is useful when an image is too large or has the wrong proportions for a designated area, allowing it to be resized appropriately without distorting the main subject matter.</p>

</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>When copied to cell E2:</b> The formula <code>=D3*E6</code> will change to <code>=G3*H6</code>. Relative references (D3 and E6) adjust based on the relative movement of the copy operation (3 columns to the right).</p>
<p><b>When copied to cell E3:</b> The formula <code>=A$8</code> will remain <code>=A$8</code>. The absolute row reference ($8) ensures that the row number does not change when copied, but the relative column reference (A) will change to D because E is 3 columns to the right of B. Therefore, it becomes <code>=D$8</code>.</p>
<p><b>When copied to cell E5:</b> The formula <code>=$D$5</code> will remain <code>=$D$5</code>. Both column ($D) and row ($5) are absolute references, so they do not change regardless of where the formula is copied.</p>

<p><img src="Screenshot_2025-02-24_at_18-33-12_2015nov.pdf.png" alt="" width="576" height="280" /></p>
<p>State the function of each specification for the given field properties.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Default Value:</b> Specification '0' sets the default value for the field to zero. If a new record is added and no value is explicitly entered for this field, it will automatically be populated with '0'. This ensures that the field always has a value and can be useful for numerical fields where zero is a meaningful default.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Validation Rule:</b> Specification '&lt;4000' defines a rule that restricts the acceptable values for this field to be less than 4000. Any attempt to enter a value greater than or equal to 4000 will be rejected by the database, ensuring data integrity by limiting the range of valid inputs.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Validation Text:</b> Specification 'Try again' sets the error message that will be displayed to the user when they violate the validation rule (i.e., enter a value of 4000 or more). This provides user feedback, guiding them to correct their input to comply with the defined validation rule.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Required:</b> Specification 'Yes' makes it mandatory for this field to have a value in every record. The database will not allow a new record to be saved or an existing record to be updated if this field is left empty, ensuring that critical data is always provided.</p>
<p data-number="5"><b>Indexed:</b> Specification 'Yes(Duplicate ok)' creates an index on this field. Indexing improves the speed of data retrieval operations, such as searching and sorting, on this field. '(Duplicate ok)' indicates that the index allows duplicate values in this field, which is suitable for fields where uniqueness is not required but faster searching is beneficial.</p>
<p data-number="6"><b>Text Align:</b> Specification 'Center' sets the text alignment for this field to be centered within its display area in forms and datasheets. This is a formatting property that affects the visual presentation of the data in the field, making it centered for better aesthetics or readability.</p>
