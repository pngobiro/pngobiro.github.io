<p>Explain the function of each of the following data types as used in a database table.</p>
<p>(1) OLE object;</p>
<p>(ii) Hyperlink.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) OLE Object:</b></p>
<p>The OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) Object data type allows you to embed or link objects from other applications into a database table. It is used to store complex data types like documents, spreadsheets, images, audio, and video files directly within the database. When an object is embedded, it becomes part of the database file; when linked, the database stores a pointer to the object's file location. OLE objects enhance database capabilities by allowing integration of multimedia and document data.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Hyperlink:</b></p>
<p>The Hyperlink data type is used to store web addresses (URLs), email addresses, or paths to files on a network or local computer. When clicked in a database record, a hyperlink automatically opens the associated web page, email client, or file. This data type is useful for creating links to external resources or related documents directly from within the database, facilitating easy access to connected information and resources.</p>

<h3>2. (c) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Distinguish between data source and main document as used in word processing programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Data Source:</b></p>
<p>In mail merge, the data source is a file or database that contains variable information to be inserted into a main document. It typically consists of records organized in rows and columns, where each row represents a record (e.g., a person's details) and each column represents a field (e.g., name, address, etc.). Common data sources include spreadsheet files, database tables, or address books. The data source provides the specific, unique information that will be personalized in each copy of the main document.</p>
<p><b>Main Document:</b></p>
<p>The main document is the template file in a mail merge process that contains the static text and formatting that remains the same in all output documents. It includes placeholders, known as merge fields, which are inserted at locations where variable data from the data source should be placed. The main document is created in a word processor and serves as the base structure for generating personalized documents when combined with the data source. It defines the layout and constant content of the final documents.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>The data source holds the variable data that changes for each output document, while the main document is the static template. The data source provides the information to be inserted, and the main document specifies where and how to insert it. Together, they enable the creation of personalized documents in a mail merge process.</p>

<p>Distinguish between a macro and a module as used in databases.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Macro:</b></p>
<p>A macro in a database is a tool that allows users to automate a series of tasks or operations without writing code. It is created using a visual interface where users select actions from a predefined list and arrange them in a sequence. Macros are primarily used for simple automation tasks like opening forms, running reports, or performing data validation. They are event-driven and can be attached to database objects like buttons or form events.</p>
<p><b>Module:</b></p>
<p>A module in a database is a collection of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code that is written to perform more complex and custom database operations. Modules provide a programming environment for creating procedures, functions, and classes to extend database functionality beyond what macros can achieve. Modules are used for tasks such as complex data manipulation, custom error handling, and integration with external applications. They offer greater flexibility and control but require programming knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>Macros are created using a visual interface for simple automation, while modules are written in VBA code for complex tasks. Macros are easier to create and use for basic automation, whereas modules offer more power and flexibility for advanced database programming. Modules require programming skills, but macros do not.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the errors generated when a wrong formula is entered in cell C1 and cell C2 in a worksheet.</p>
<p>Write the formula that may have been entered in the cells to generate the errors in cell C1 and C2.</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot_2025-02-24_at_11-58-45_2021n.pdf.png" alt="" width="366" height="91" /></p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Formula for cell C1 to generate #NULL! error:</b></p>
<p><code>=A1 C1</code></p>
<p>The #NULL! error occurs when you specify an intersection of two ranges that do not actually intersect. In this case, assuming the intention was to multiply A1 and B1 (or A1 and A2, etc.), but instead, 'C1' was mistakenly entered as the second cell reference, resulting in a space-separated range "A1 C1" which is interpreted as an intersection. Since there is no intersection between cell A1 and cell C1 in a typical contiguous range scenario, the #NULL! error is produced.</p>
<p><b>Formula for cell C2 to generate #NAME? error:</b></p>
<p><code>=AVERAGEE(A2:B2)</code></p>
<p>The #NAME? error appears when Microsoft Excel does not recognize text in a formula. This commonly happens when there is a misspelling in a function name. In this case, "AVERAGEE" is likely a misspelling of the correct function name "AVERAGE". Excel interprets "AVERAGEE" as an undefined name, thus returning the #NAME? error.</p>

<p>Transition in presentation programs refers to the visual effects applied when moving from one slide to the next during a slide show. Transitions add visual interest and smoothness to the presentation flow, making it more engaging for the audience. They control how a slide enters and replaces the previous slide on the screen.</p>
<p><b>Example 1: Fade Transition</b></p>
<p>In a fade transition, the current slide gradually fades out while the next slide simultaneously fades in. This creates a smooth and gentle shift between slides, making the transition subtle and professional, suitable for presentations where a seamless flow is desired.</p>
<p><b>Example 2: Wipe Transition</b></p>
<p>In a wipe transition, the new slide progressively covers the previous slide in a sweeping motion, like wiping a screen clean. This type of transition is more dynamic and noticeable than a fade, often used to indicate a clear change of topic or to add a bit of visual flair to the slide progression.</p>

<p>Julie intends to add a table in a database she created. Outline four ways she could achieve this.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Create Table in Datasheet View:</b> Julie can open the database and, in the "Create" tab on the Ribbon, select "Table" in the "Tables" group. This opens a new table in Datasheet View, allowing her to directly enter column headings (field names) and start inputting data rows. Access automatically assigns default data types, which can be modified later.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Create Table in Design View:</b> In the "Create" tab, Julie can select "Table Design". This opens a new table in Design View, where she can define each field's name, data type, and properties before entering any data. Design View provides more control over table structure and is suitable for setting up tables with specific field requirements and validation rules.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Import Table from External Data Source:</b> Julie can import a table from an external data source such as Excel, another database, or a text file. In the "External Data" tab, she can choose the data source type and follow the import wizard to bring in data as a new table, specifying import options and table structure as needed.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Create Table using a Table Template:</b> In some database programs, pre-designed table templates are available. Julie can explore available templates (if offered by her database software) and choose one that fits her needs, such as a template for contacts, products, or tasks. Templates provide a quick starting point with predefined fields and structures that can be customized.</p>

<p>Distinguish between tracking and leading as used in desktop publishing applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Tracking:</b></p>
<p>Tracking, also known as character spacing, refers to the uniform adjustment of space between characters across a range of text. It affects the overall density and tightness of text blocks. Increasing tracking widens the space between all characters evenly, making the text appear more spread out. Decreasing tracking reduces the space, making the text appear tighter. Tracking is used to adjust the visual density of text, improve readability at different sizes, and fit text into specific layout areas.</p>
<p><b>Leading:</b></p>
<p>Leading (pronounced "ledding") is the vertical space between lines of text, measured from baseline to baseline. It controls the vertical distance between lines in a paragraph or text block. Increasing leading adds more vertical space, making the text appear more airy and easier to read. Decreasing leading reduces vertical space, making the lines closer together. Leading is crucial for readability and visual appeal of text blocks, especially in longer paragraphs and body text.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>Tracking adjusts horizontal space between characters, affecting text density, while leading adjusts vertical space between lines, affecting line spacing and readability. Tracking is about character spacing within a line, and leading is about line spacing vertically. They both contribute to the overall typography and legibility of text in desktop publishing.</p>

</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) Formula to round to the nearest integer:</b></p>
<p><code>=ROUND(A1, 0)</code></p>
<p>This formula uses the ROUND function to round the value in cell A1 to the nearest integer. The '0' as the second argument specifies that the number should be rounded to zero decimal places, which effectively rounds to the nearest whole number. For 13000.8779, this formula will return 13001.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Formula to round as a multiple of 5:</b></p>
<p><code>=MROUND(A1, 5)</code></p>
<p>This formula uses the MROUND function to round the number in cell A1 to the nearest multiple of 5. The '5' as the second argument specifies the multiple to which the number should be rounded. For 13000.8779, this formula will return 13000 because 13000 is the nearest multiple of 5 to 13000.8779.</p>

<p>Outline three ways that could be used to align text in a paragraph while designing a brochure in a desktop publishing application.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Left Alignment:</b> Left alignment aligns text to the left margin, creating a straight left edge and a ragged right edge. This is commonly used for body text in brochures for readability and a natural reading flow.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Center Alignment:</b> Center alignment centers each line of text within the paragraph, creating ragged left and right edges. This is often used for headings, titles, or short lines of text in brochures to create a balanced and symmetrical appearance.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Justified Alignment:</b> Justified alignment aligns text to both the left and right margins, creating straight edges on both sides. This is used to create a clean, block-like appearance, often seen in columns of text in brochures for a formal and structured layout.</p>

<p>Explain the circumstance that would necessitate the use of each of the following operators when querying a database.</p>
<p>(1) AND:</p>
<p>(ii) OR.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) AND Operator:</b></p>
<p>The AND operator is used in database queries when you need to retrieve records that meet multiple criteria simultaneously. It narrows down the search results by requiring that all specified conditions must be true for a record to be included in the result set. For example, if you want to find all customers who live in 'Nairobi' AND have made purchases in '2023', you would use the AND operator to combine these two conditions. Only records satisfying both conditions will be returned.</p>
<p><b>(ii) OR Operator:</b></p>
<p>The OR operator is used in database queries when you need to retrieve records that meet at least one of several specified criteria. It broadens the search results by including records that satisfy any of the given conditions. For instance, if you want to find all employees who work in the 'Sales' department OR have a salary greater than 50000, you would use the OR operator to combine these conditions. Records meeting either the first condition, the second condition, or both will be included in the query result.</p>

<p>Sam intends to view a report created using a database program before printing. Explain two ways he could use to achieve this.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Print Preview:</b> Most database programs offer a "Print Preview" option. By selecting this option, Sam can view the report on screen exactly as it will appear when printed. Print preview allows him to check the layout, formatting, page breaks, margins, and overall appearance of the report before actually printing it. This helps identify and correct any layout issues or errors, saving paper and ensuring the printed report meets expectations.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Report View:</b> Database programs typically have a "Report View" mode, which displays the report in a format optimized for on-screen viewing, closely resembling the final printed output. In Report View, Sam can navigate through pages, review data presentation, and check calculations or summaries within the report. While it may not be an exact pixel-perfect representation of the print, it provides a good visual check of the report's content and structure, allowing for necessary adjustments before printing.</p>
