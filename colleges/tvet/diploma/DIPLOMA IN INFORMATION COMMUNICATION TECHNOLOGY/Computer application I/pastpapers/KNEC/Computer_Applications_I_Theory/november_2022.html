<p>Describe each of the following terms as used in desktop publishing applications:</p>
<p>(i) bleed;</p>
<p>(ii) crop.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Bleed:</b></p>
<p>Bleed refers to the area of a document that extends beyond the trim edge. It ensures that after trimming, no white edges are visible, especially for images or colored backgrounds that are intended to reach the edge of the printed page. Bleed is essential for professional printing to achieve edge-to-edge printing without any margin of error during the cutting process.</p>
<p><b>Crop:</b></p>
<p>Crop is the process of removing unwanted outer areas of an image to improve framing, emphasize the subject, or change the aspect ratio. In desktop publishing, cropping tools allow users to trim images directly within the layout software, focusing on the desired portion of the graphic and eliminating distracting or unnecessary elements. This is important for visual composition and efficient use of space in design layouts.</p>

<h3>1. (c) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Distinguish between device drivers and firmware as used in computers.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Device Drivers:</b></p>
<p>Device drivers are software programs that enable the operating system to interact with hardware devices. They act as translators between the OS and the hardware, providing instructions on how to communicate and operate the specific device. Drivers are OS-specific and can be updated or changed independently of the hardware itself. They are typically installed after the OS and hardware are in place, allowing new or updated hardware to function correctly with the system.</p>
<p><b>Firmware:</b></p>
<p>Firmware is a specific type of software that is embedded directly into hardware devices. It provides the basic operational instructions for the hardware and is usually stored in non-volatile memory like ROM or flash memory. Firmware is more closely tied to the hardware than drivers, often controlling fundamental functions at a lower level. Updating firmware involves rewriting the software directly on the hardware's memory chip, and it is less frequently changed compared to device drivers. Firmware is essential for the initial boot process and basic hardware operations before the operating system fully takes over.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>Drivers are software that allows the OS to communicate with hardware, while firmware is software embedded in the hardware itself to control its basic operations. Drivers are OS-dependent and frequently updated, whereas firmware is hardware-dependent and updated less often. Drivers operate at a higher software level, while firmware operates at a lower, more fundamental hardware level.</p>

<h3>2. (b) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Rose was tasked to design a database for an organizations' data storage. Outline four types of keys she may use while creating the database fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Primary Key:</b> A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a database table. It must contain unique values and cannot be null. It ensures that each record is distinguishable and serves as the main reference point for data retrieval and relationships.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Foreign Key:</b> A foreign key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a link between the two tables, creating a relationship and enabling data to be joined and accessed across related tables. Foreign keys enforce referential integrity.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Composite Key:</b> A composite key is a primary key made up of two or more attributes (fields) within a table that, when combined, uniquely identify each record. It is used when a single attribute is insufficient to guarantee uniqueness, and the combination of attributes is necessary for unique identification.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Candidate Key:</b> A candidate key is any attribute or set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record in a table. A table can have multiple candidate keys, but one is chosen as the primary key. The remaining candidate keys are considered alternate keys. They possess the properties of uniqueness and non-null values, making them suitable for primary key selection.</p>

<h3>2. (c) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>A company's technician was required to design a network operating system. Explain two types of operating system design he could apply.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Client-Server Design:</b></p>
<p>In a client-server design, the network operating system is structured around servers that provide resources and services, and clients that request and utilize those services. Servers are centralized and manage functionalities such as file storage, printing, email, and database access. Clients are typically individual workstations that rely on the server for shared resources and applications. This model offers centralized management, enhanced security, and efficient resource sharing, making it suitable for organizations with structured IT infrastructure.</p>
<p><b>Peer-to-Peer Design:</b></p>
<p>In a peer-to-peer design, all computers on the network act as both clients and servers. There is no central server; instead, each computer can share its resources directly with others. This design is simpler to set up and manage, often used in small networks without dedicated IT staff. Peer-to-peer networks are less centralized, offering more distributed control and potentially lower costs, but they can be less secure and harder to manage as the network scales up in size and complexity.</p>

<p>Outline the function of each formula in a spreadsheet program:</p>
<p>(i) IF;</p>
<p>(ii) Len;</p>
<p>(iii) Concatenate.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>IF:</b></p>
<p>The IF function performs a logical test and returns one value if the condition is true and another value if it is false. It is used for decision-making within a spreadsheet, allowing for different calculations or outputs based on whether a specified condition is met or not. It is fundamental for creating conditional logic in spreadsheets.</p>
<p><b>Len:</b></p>

<p>Explain one circumstance in each case, that would necessitate the use of the following features in a word processing program:</p>
<p>(i) split window;</p>
<p>(ii) zoom.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Split window:</b></p>
<p>A circumstance that necessitates the use of a split window is when a user needs to view and edit two different parts of a long document simultaneously. For example, when cross-referencing information from a section at the beginning of a document to a section at the end, splitting the window allows for both sections to be visible on screen at the same time. This eliminates the need to scroll back and forth repeatedly, enhancing efficiency in tasks like comparing sections, copying and pasting between distant parts of the document, or maintaining consistency across the document.</p>
<p><b>Zoom:</b></p>
<p>A circumstance that necessitates the use of zoom is when a user needs to adjust the viewing scale of a document to improve readability or detail visibility. For instance, when working with a document that contains fine details, such as intricate diagrams or small font sizes, zooming in allows for a closer and clearer view of these elements. Conversely, zooming out can be necessary to get an overview of the document layout, check page breaks, or assess the overall structure and formatting of the document on screen. Zoom functionality is essential for accommodating different viewing preferences and document complexities.</p>

<h3>3. (c) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>Distinguish between ruler guides and column guides as applied in desktop publishing programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Ruler Guides:</b></p>
<p>Ruler guides are horizontal and vertical lines that users can drag from the rulers (typically located at the top and left edges of the document window) onto the page layout in desktop publishing software. They are non-printing lines used for precise alignment of objects and text boxes on the page. Ruler guides are manually positioned by the user and are flexible, allowing for custom placement anywhere on the page to aid in the visual arrangement and alignment of design elements across the entire page.</p>
<p><b>Column Guides:</b></p>
<p>Column guides are predefined vertical lines that divide the page into columns for text and other content in desktop publishing. They are typically set up in the document setup or master page settings and are used to create a structured grid layout for text flow and element placement within columns. Column guides help maintain consistency in text width and spacing across pages, particularly in multi-column documents like newspapers, magazines, or brochures. They provide a framework for organizing content into readable and visually balanced columns.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>Ruler guides are manually placed for general alignment across the page, while column guides are predefined for structuring content into columns. Ruler guides are flexible and can be positioned anywhere, whereas column guides are typically set up for consistent column layout throughout the document. Ruler guides assist in aligning individual elements, and column guides structure the overall page content flow.</p>

<p>Agnes intends to align text in a slide created using a presentation program. Outline four text alignment options she could apply.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Left Align:</b> Text is aligned along the left margin, creating a straight left edge and a ragged right edge. This is commonly used for body text as it enhances readability by providing a consistent starting point for each line.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Center Align:</b> Text is centered within the text box or slide width, with both left and right edges being ragged. Center alignment is often used for titles, headings, and short lines of text to create a balanced and formal appearance.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Right Align:</b> Text is aligned along the right margin, creating a straight right edge and a ragged left edge. Right alignment is less common for body text in left-to-right languages but can be used for specific design elements or in right-to-left languages.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Justify Align:</b> Text is aligned along both the left and right margins, creating straight edges on both sides. Spaces between words are adjusted to achieve this effect. Justification is often used in formal documents and publications to create a neat and structured block of text, but it may sometimes lead to uneven word spacing if not carefully managed.</p>

<p>Lydia intends to use tab stop feature to align text in a document created using a word processing program. Outline four examples of tab stops that she could apply.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Left Tab:</b> Left tab stop aligns the start of the text at the tab stop position. As you type, the text extends to the right of the tab stop. This is commonly used for aligning lists of items or creating simple columns of text where the left edges of the items are aligned.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Center Tab:</b> Center tab stop centers the text around the tab stop position. As you type, the text expands equally to the left and right of the tab stop. This is useful for centering headings or text within columns or for creating symmetrically aligned lists.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Right Tab:</b> Right tab stop aligns the end of the text at the tab stop position. As you type, the text extends to the left of the tab stop. This is often used for aligning numbers in columns, especially in financial documents, where the right edges of the numbers need to be aligned for readability.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Decimal Tab:</b> Decimal tab stop aligns numbers at the decimal point. It is a specialized type of tab stop primarily used for aligning columns of numbers with decimal points, ensuring that the decimal points are vertically aligned, making it easier to compare numerical data in columns, particularly in financial or statistical reports.</p>

<p>Ann inserted two graphics in a desktop publishing publication and they appeared as shown in Figure 1. Explain two tools she could use to have the graphics appear as shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p><img src="Screenshot_2025-02-24_at_11-51-55_2022nov.pdf.png" alt="" width="623" height="258" /></p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Cropping Tool:</b></p>
<p>Ann could use the cropping tool to remove unwanted parts of the graphics. In Figure 1, the graphics appear to be full images, while in Figure 2, they seem to be focused on a specific part. By using the cropping tool, Ann can trim the outer edges of the graphics in Figure 1 to focus on the central elements, achieving a more refined composition similar to Figure 2. Cropping allows for selective removal of image areas, changing the visual focus and aspect ratio as needed for the layout.</p>
<p><b>Masking Tool:</b></p>
<p>Ann could employ a masking tool to selectively hide portions of the graphics, creating a desired shape or revealing only certain parts. While cropping permanently removes image areas, masking is non-destructive and allows for flexibility in revealing or concealing parts of an image. In this context, masking could be used to shape the graphics, perhaps creating rounded edges or isolating specific elements within the images to achieve the appearance in Figure 2. Masking provides more control over the visibility of image areas and can create complex visual effects without altering the original image data.</p>

<p>Outline the function of each of the following data types in a database:</p>
<p>(1) AutoNumber;</p>
<p>(ii) Memo;</p>
<p>(iii) LookUp Wizard.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>AutoNumber:</b></p>
<p>The AutoNumber data type automatically assigns a unique sequential number to each new record added to a database table. It is primarily used to create primary keys that are automatically incremented, ensuring each record has a unique identifier without manual input. AutoNumber simplifies record management and guarantees uniqueness, essential for database integrity and relationships.</p>
<p><b>Memo:</b></p>
<p>The Memo data type is used to store large blocks of text, such as notes, descriptions, or comments, that exceed the character limit of a standard text field. It is designed to accommodate variable-length text data, from short sentences to lengthy paragraphs, without imposing a fixed length constraint. Memo fields are suitable for storing detailed textual information that does not fit into regular text or character-limited fields.</p>
<p><b>LookUp Wizard:</b></p>
<p>The LookUp Wizard is not a data type itself, but a tool used to create a lookup field in a database table. It allows a field to display values from another table or a predefined list. When creating a field using the LookUp Wizard, it guides the user to set up a relationship with another table or specify a value list. This simplifies data entry by providing users with selectable options, ensuring data consistency and referential integrity. It is used to create dropdown lists or combo boxes in forms and tables, linking fields to predefined sets of values.</p>

<p>Distinguish between rotate and flip operations as used in desktop publishing applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Rotate:</b></p>
<p>Rotation in desktop publishing refers to turning an object or image around a central point by a specified angle. Rotation changes the orientation of the object without mirroring it. The object maintains its shape and content but is presented at a different angle relative to its original position. Rotation is commonly used for adjusting the slant of text, graphics, or shapes to fit design layouts or create visual effects. The orientation change is in a circular direction, either clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>
<p><b>Flip:</b></p>
<p>Flipping, also known as mirroring, creates a reversed image of an object or graphic, either horizontally or vertically. Horizontal flip creates a mirror image from left to right, while vertical flip creates a mirror image from top to bottom. Flipping changes the object's orientation by creating a reflection across an axis, reversing its content along that axis. It is used for creating reflections, reversing object direction, or achieving symmetrical designs. The object's content is reversed, but its shape remains fundamentally the same.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>Rotation turns an object around a point, changing its angle, while flipping mirrors an object across an axis, reversing its content. Rotation maintains the object's orientation relationship but changes its angle, whereas flipping reverses the orientation. Rotation changes the angle, and flip creates a mirror image.</p>

</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) Formula to compute total revenue in cell G2:</b></p>
<p><code>=SUM(B2:F2)</code></p>
<p>This formula uses the SUM function to add up the values in cells B2, C2, D2, E2, and F2, which represent the revenue for the five years from 2014 to 2018. The result, which is the total revenue, will be displayed in cell G2.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Formula using IF function in cell B5 to display "PROFIT" or "LOSS":</b></p>
<p><code>=IF(B2&gt;B3,"PROFIT","LOSS")</code></p>
<p>This formula uses the IF function to compare the revenue in cell B2 (for the year 2014) with the expenditure in cell B3 (for the year 2014). If the revenue (B2) is greater than the expenditure (B3), the formula will display "PROFIT" in cell B5. Otherwise, if the revenue is not greater than the expenditure (meaning expenditure is greater than or equal to revenue), the formula will display "LOSS" in cell B5. This formula checks the profitability for the year 2014 and provides a textual comment accordingly.</p>

<p>Explain each of the following features as used in a spreadsheet program:</p>
<p>(1) sort;</p>
<p>(ii) filter.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Sort:</b></p>
<p>The sort feature in a spreadsheet program rearranges the rows of data in a worksheet based on the values in one or more columns. Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order, either alphabetically for text data or numerically for numbers and dates. It allows users to organize data to easily find specific items, identify trends, or present data in a logical order. Sorting can be applied to a selected range of cells or the entire dataset, enabling efficient data organization and analysis.</p>
<p><b>Filter:</b></p>
<p>The filter feature in a spreadsheet program temporarily hides rows that do not meet specified criteria, displaying only the rows that match the defined conditions. Filtering allows users to focus on a subset of data that is relevant to their analysis or task. Criteria can be set based on values in one or more columns, using conditions such as equal to, greater than, contains, or begins with. Filters are non-destructive, meaning they do not delete or alter the original data, and they can be easily applied and removed, providing dynamic data viewing and analysis capabilities.</p>

<p>With the aid of a sketch in each case, describe the following components of an entity data model in databases:</p>
<p>(1) attribute;</p>
<p>(ii) relationship.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) Attribute:</b></p>
<p>An attribute is a characteristic or property of an entity in an entity-relationship model. It describes a detail or feature of an entity. Attributes are represented as ovals connected to their respective entity rectangles in an ER diagram. Each attribute has a name and a data type, defining the kind of information it holds. Attributes can be simple (atomic), composite (composed of multiple attributes), single-valued, multi-valued, or derived. They provide specific details about each instance of an entity.</p>
<p><b>Sketch Description:</b> Imagine an entity called "STUDENT" represented by a rectangle. Attributes of STUDENT could be "StudentID", "Name", "Course", and "DateOfBirth". Each of these attributes would be represented by an oval connected to the STUDENT rectangle. "StudentID" could be underlined to denote it as a key attribute. For example:</p>
<p><code>
                    [Rectangle: STUDENT] -- (Oval: StudentID) &lt;--(Key Attribute) <br />
                                        -- (Oval: Name) <br />
                                        -- (Oval: Course) <br />
                                        -- (Oval: DateOfBirth)
                    </code></p>
<p>In this sketch, StudentID, Name, Course, and DateOfBirth are attributes that describe the entity STUDENT. StudentID is the key attribute uniquely identifying each student.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Relationship:</b></p>
<p>A relationship represents an association or link between two or more entities in an entity-relationship model. Relationships describe how entities are related to each other in the database. Relationships are represented by diamond shapes connected to the entities they relate in an ER diagram. Each relationship has a name and a cardinality, defining the type and degree of association between entities (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). Relationships are crucial for structuring data and enabling meaningful connections between different types of data.</p>
<p><b>Sketch Description:</b> Consider two entities, "STUDENT" and "COURSE", represented by rectangles. A relationship between them could be "ENROLLS_IN", indicating that students enroll in courses. This relationship would be represented by a diamond shape labeled "ENROLLS_IN" connected to both the STUDENT and COURSE rectangles. Cardinality can be indicated next to the lines connecting the relationship to the entities, for example, '1' for one and 'N' for many to show a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship if needed. For example:</p>
<p><code>
                    [Rectangle: STUDENT] -- (Line) -- (Diamond: ENROLLS_IN) -- (Line) -- [Rectangle: COURSE]
                    </code></p>
<p>In this sketch, "ENROLLS_IN" is the relationship connecting the STUDENT and COURSE entities, indicating how students are associated with courses. The cardinality (not shown in simple sketch) would further specify if one student can enroll in many courses (one-to-many from STUDENT to COURSE) or if many students can enroll in many courses (many-to-many).</p>
