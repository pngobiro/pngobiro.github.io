<p>Outline three types of user interfaces used in operating systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</b> This interface uses visual icons, menus, and windows for user interaction. It is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for non-technical users to operate the system.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Command Line Interface (CLI):</b> This interface requires users to type text commands to interact with the operating system. It is efficient and powerful for experienced users but can be less intuitive for beginners.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Natural Language Interface (NLI):</b> This interface allows users to interact with the system using natural human language, such as speech or typed text in a conversational manner.

<p>With the aid of two examples in each case, explain the folowing terms as used during relational database design:</p>
<p>(i) entity;</p>
<p>(ii) attribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) Entity:</b></p>
<p>In relational database design, an entity represents a real-world object or concept about which data is collected and stored. It is a distinguishable thing that can be uniquely identified. Entities become tables in a relational database.</p>
<p><b>Example 1:</b> In a university database, 'STUDENT' is an entity. Each student is a unique individual with specific properties that need to be recorded.</p>
<p><b>Example 2:</b> In a library system, 'BOOK' is an entity. Each book is a distinct item with attributes like title, author, and ISBN that the library needs to manage.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Attribute:</b></p>
<p>An attribute is a property or characteristic of an entity. It describes a piece of information about the entity. Attributes become columns in a relational database table.</p>
<p><b>Example 1:</b> For the entity 'STUDENT', attributes could include 'StudentID', 'Name', 'Course', and 'DateOfBirth'. These attributes describe different aspects of a student.</p>
<p><b>Example 2:</b> For the entity 'BOOK', attributes could be 'BookTitle', 'Author', 'ISBN', and 'PublicationYear'. These attributes provide details about a book.</p>

<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Byte:</b> This field size stores numbers from 0 to 255. It is suitable for small positive integers and occupies 1 byte of storage space. It is efficient for fields that only need to store very small whole numbers.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Integer:</b> This field size stores integers between -32,768 and 32,767. It is used for storing whole numbers within this range and occupies 2 bytes of storage space. It is appropriate for fields requiring a moderate range of integer values.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Long Integer:</b> This field size stores integers between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. It is used for storing large whole numbers and occupies 4 bytes of storage space. It is suitable for fields needing a wide range of integer values.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Decimal:</b> This field size stores exact numeric values with up to 28 decimal places. It allows for specifying precision and scale to control the number of digits before and after the decimal point. It is ideal for storing monetary values or any numbers where precise decimal representation is crucial and occupies a variable storage size based on precision.</p>

<p>Explain the term search engine as used in the Internet, giving two examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>A search engine is a software system designed to carry out web searches. It crawls the World Wide Web in a systematic way, indexes the content it finds, and allows users to quickly locate information by querying for specific keywords or phrases. Search engines return a list of results, often ranked by relevance, to help users find the information they are seeking on the internet.</p>
<p><b>Example 1: Google Search</b> is a widely used search engine that indexes billions of web pages and provides results based on complex algorithms to match user queries with relevant web content.</p>
<p><b>Example 2: Bing</b> is another popular search engine developed by Microsoft. It offers web search services, including image, video, and map searches, and competes with Google in providing comprehensive search results.</p>

<p>Describe each of the following types of operating systems:</p>
<p>(i) single user single task;</p>
<p>(ii) single user multitasking.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) Single User Single Task Operating System:</b></p>
<p>This type of operating system is designed to allow only one user to work on the computer at a time, and that user can perform only one task at any given moment. It is very basic and straightforward, suitable for simple devices or environments where only one operation is needed from a single user at a time. Examples are older mobile phones or embedded systems performing dedicated functions.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Single User Multitasking Operating System:</b></p>
<p>This operating system is designed for a single user to perform multiple tasks concurrently. It allows one person to work on several applications or processes at the same time, switching between them as needed. This is the most common type of OS for personal computers, enabling users to browse the web, write documents, and play music all at once. Examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions used on desktop and laptop computers.</p>

<p>A student keyed in data in a worksheet created using a spreadsheet program. Explain two types of data types the student could have used in the worksheet.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Number:</b> This data type is used for numerical values that can be used in mathematical calculations. Numbers can be integers, decimals, or scientific notation. Spreadsheet programs allow various formatting options for numbers, such as currency, percentage, and date formats, but fundamentally, they are treated as numerical data for computation.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Text (String):</b> This data type is used for sequences of characters, including letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces, that are treated as non-numerical data. Text data is primarily used for labels, descriptions, names, and any information that is not intended for mathematical operations. While text can contain numbers, they are treated as characters rather than numerical values for calculations unless converted.</p>

<p>Naks Company intends to connect its computers to the Internet. Explain two internet requirements they need for this connectivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Internet Service Provider (ISP):</b> Naks Company requires the services of an ISP to gain access to the Internet. An ISP provides the physical connection to the internet infrastructure and handles the data transmission between the company's network and the broader internet. They offer different service plans based on bandwidth, speed, and data volume to suit various business needs.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Networking Hardware:</b> To establish internet connectivity, Naks Company needs networking hardware such as modems, routers, and network cables or wireless access points. A modem is needed to interface with the ISP's connection (e.g., cable, DSL, fiber).

<p>Peter applied each of the following keyboard keys combination in a word processing program:</p>
<p>(i) Ctrl + C;</p>
<p>(ii) Ctrl + Z;</p>
<p>(iii) Alt + F4;</p>
<p>(iv) Alt + Tab.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) Ctrl + C (Copy):</b> This key combination is used to copy selected text or objects to the clipboard. When applied, it duplicates the selected content without removing it from its original location, allowing it to be pasted elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Output:</b> The selected text or object is copied to the clipboard, and the original content remains unchanged in the document.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Ctrl + Z (Undo):</b> This key combination is used to undo the last action performed. It reverses the most recent operation, allowing users to correct mistakes or backtrack through a series of actions.</p>
<p><b>Output:</b> The word processor reverts to the state before the most recent action, effectively undoing the last change made to the document.</p>
<p><b>(iii) Alt + F4 (Close Application):</b> This key combination is used to close the currently active application window. When applied in a word processing program, it will attempt to close the program.</p>
<p><b>Output:</b> The word processing application will attempt to close. If there are unsaved changes, the program will typically prompt the user to save before closing.</p>
<p><b>(iv) Alt + Tab (Switch Applications):</b> This key combination is used to switch between open applications. Holding down Alt and pressing Tab repeatedly cycles through the list of running applications.</p>
<p><b>Output:</b> A window appears showing icons of currently running applications, allowing Peter to select and switch to a different open application.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>Differentiate between a footnote and an endnote as used in a word processing document.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Footnote:</b></p>
<p>A footnote is a reference or additional piece of information that appears at the bottom of the page on which the reference is made. Footnotes are used to provide brief explanations, citations, or comments that are related to the text on the same page. They are indicated in the main text by a superscript number or symbol and the corresponding note is placed at the bottom of that page. Footnotes keep related references close to the text they annotate, improving readability for page-specific information.</p>
<p><b>Endnote:</b></p>
<p>An endnote is a reference or additional piece of information that appears at the end of a section or at the end of the entire document, rather than at the bottom of the page. Endnotes are used for similar purposes as footnotes—to provide explanations, citations, or comments—but are collected together at the end. Like footnotes, they are indicated in the main text by a superscript number or symbol, with the corresponding note listed at the document's end. Endnotes are useful when references are numerous or when placing notes at the page bottom would disrupt the document layout.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>Footnotes appear at the bottom of the page, while endnotes appear at the end of the document or section. Footnotes are page-specific, keeping notes local to their references, whereas endnotes collect all notes at the document's conclusion. Footnotes are for page-level references, and endnotes are for document or section-level references.</p>

<p>A publication designer inserted a picture on a brochure created using a desktop publishing application. Outline four ways he could manipulate the picture.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Resizing:</b> The designer could resize the picture, changing its dimensions (width and height) to fit the layout requirements of the brochure. Resizing can be done proportionally to maintain aspect ratio or non-proportionally to stretch or compress the image.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Cropping:</b> The designer could crop the picture to remove unwanted areas and focus on the most important part of the image. Cropping involves trimming the edges of the picture, altering its visible area without changing its scale.</p>

<p>Describe each of the following features as applied in databases:</p>
<p>(i) Sorting;</p>
<p>(ii) Indexing.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) Sorting:</b></p>
<p>Sorting in databases is the process of arranging data in a specific order based on one or more columns. It allows users to organize records either in ascending or descending order, alphabetically for text data or numerically for numbers and dates. Sorting helps in analyzing data, finding specific records quickly, and presenting information in a structured and understandable format. It reorders the actual rows in a query result or a table view.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Indexing:</b></p>
<p>Indexing in databases is a technique to create an index on one or more columns of a table to improve the speed of data retrieval operations. An index is a separate data structure that contains a subset of the data from a table, organized in a way that allows for faster lookups. It works similarly to an index in a book, allowing the database system to quickly locate rows that match query conditions without having to scan the entire table. Indexing enhances query performance, especially for large tables, by reducing the data that needs to be examined to find the requested records.</p>

<p>Terry intends to design a brochure for a soap manufacturing company using a desktop publishing program. Explain two types of margins she is likely to set.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Page Margins:</b> Terry would set page margins, which are the blank spaces around the edges of the page, on all four sides (top, bottom, left, right). Page margins define the printable area on each page of the brochure and ensure that content is positioned within these boundaries. They are essential for providing white space around the text and graphics, improving readability and visual appeal, and preventing content from being too close to the page edges.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Column/Gutter Margins:</b> If the brochure layout involves multiple columns of text, Terry might set column or gutter margins. Gutter margins are the spaces between columns of text. They separate columns visually, enhancing readability by preventing text from columns from running too close together. Setting appropriate gutter margins ensures that text in adjacent columns is distinct and easy to follow, particularly in multi-column layouts typical of brochures.</p>

<p>(i) New Window;</p>
<p>(ii) Arrange All;</p>
<p>(iii) Move Splitters.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) New Window:</b> The "New Window" command opens a second window displaying the current presentation. This function is useful for viewing and working on different parts of the same presentation simultaneously. For example, a user can compare slides side-by-side, edit one section while referencing another, or view the presentation in different views (e.g., Slide Sorter in one window and Normal View in another) concurrently. Changes made in one window are reflected in the other as they both refer to the same file.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Arrange All:</b> The "Arrange All" command is used when multiple presentation windows are open. It automatically resizes and arranges all open presentation windows so that they are visible on the screen at the same time, typically tiling them side-by-side or stacked. This is helpful for users who are working with multiple presentations or multiple windows of the same presentation and need to see all of them at once to manage or compare content across them.</p>
<p><b>(iii) Move Splitters:</b> The "Move Splitters" command (or simply splitters functionality) allows users to divide the presentation window into multiple panes. Splitters are adjustable bars that can be dragged to resize the panes. This feature enables users to view different parts of a long presentation or different aspects of the same slide (e.g., slide view and outline view) in the same window. It is particularly useful for navigating and editing large presentations by providing simultaneous views of various sections within a single window interface.</p>

<p>Write a formula that may have been used to generate the status in cell C2:C5. (4 marks)</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Since Figure 2 is missing, I will provide a general formula based on the question's description that would generate "Accept" or "Reject" status in cells C2:C5 based on whether the IRR in column B is above the percentage in cell B6.</p>
<p>Assuming the IRR for Project 1 is in cell B2, Project 2 in B3, and so on, and the threshold percentage is in cell B6, the formula for cell C2, which can be copied down to C3, C4, and C5, would be:</p>
<p><code>=IF(B2&gt;B$6, "Accept", "Reject")</code></p>
<p><b>Explanation:</b></p>
<p><b>IF(B2&gt;B$6, "Accept", "Reject"):</b> This is an IF function that performs a logical test.</p>
<p><b>B2&gt;B$6:</b> This is the logical test. It checks if the value in cell B2 (IRR for Project 1) is greater than the value in cell B6 (the threshold percentage). The <b>$</b> before <b>6</b> in <b>B$6</b> makes the reference to row 6 absolute, so when you copy the formula down, the row for B6 remains fixed, while the row for column B (project IRR) adjusts.</p>
<p><b>"Accept":</b> If the logical test is TRUE (i.e., IRR is greater than the threshold), the formula returns the text "Accept".</p>
<p><b>"Reject":</b> If the logical test is FALSE (i.e., IRR is not greater than the threshold), the formula returns the text "Reject".</p>
<p>By entering this formula in cell C2 and then dragging the fill handle down to C5, the status for each project will be automatically determined based on its IRR compared to the threshold in cell B6.</p>

<p>Distinguish between slide tab and outline tab as used in presentation programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Slide Tab:</b></p>
<p>The Slide Tab (often found in the left pane in Normal View) in presentation programs displays thumbnail images of all slides in the presentation in a vertical list. It provides a visual overview of the entire slide sequence, allowing users to easily navigate between slides, reorder them by dragging and dropping, and select individual slides for editing in the main slide pane. The Slide Tab is primarily used for visual slide management and quick access to individual slides.</p>
<p><b>Outline Tab:</b></p>
<p>The Outline Tab (often located next to or below the Slide Tab) displays the text content of the presentation in an outline format. It shows slide titles and the main text content within each slide, structured hierarchically. The Outline Tab focuses on the textual structure of the presentation, allowing users to review and edit the text content, reorganize sections by moving outline points, and get a content-centric overview without visual slide elements. It is useful for focusing on the flow and organization of the presentation's text content.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b></p>
<p>The Slide Tab provides a visual overview of slides as thumbnails for visual navigation and slide management, while the Outline Tab provides a text-based outline of slide content for content-focused review and organization. The Slide Tab is visually oriented, and the Outline Tab is text-oriented. They serve different purposes in presentation editing and navigation, catering to visual and textual aspects respectively.</p>

<p>(i) Left Rotation of 90°;</p>
<p>(ii) Flip Vertical.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) Left Rotation of 90°:</b></p>
<p>Left rotation of 90 degrees means turning the object 90 degrees counter-clockwise around its center point. For object 'I' (a pentagon as depicted), rotating it 90 degrees to the left will change its orientation, making the top-left vertex now point upwards, and the overall shape will appear turned to the left.</p>
<p><b>Sketch Description:</b></p>
<p>Imagine the pentagon 'I' with one point directly facing upwards. After a 90° left rotation, the pentagon will appear rotated counter-clockwise such that the point that was originally at the top-left is now pointing straight up. The base of the pentagon will be on the right side, and the original right side will now be at the bottom.</p>
<p><b>Result:</b> The pentagon 'I' is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Flip Vertical:</b></p>
<p>Flip Vertical transformation creates a mirror image of the object across a horizontal axis passing through its center. For object 'I', flipping it vertically will reverse its top and bottom parts. The top portion of the pentagon will become the bottom, and vice versa, while the horizontal orientation remains unchanged.</p>
<p><b>Sketch Description:</b></p>
<p>Imagine the pentagon 'I' again with one point facing upwards. After a vertical flip, the point that was originally at the top will now be at the bottom, and the entire pentagon will appear upside down. The left and right sides will remain in their original positions, but the vertical orientation is inverted.</p>
<p><b>Result:</b> The pentagon 'I' is flipped vertically, appearing upside down.</p>

<p>(i) field size;</p>
<p>(ii) validation rule;</p>
<p>(iii) validation text.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) Field Size:</b> Field size is a property that defines the maximum amount of storage space allocated for a field in a database table. It is primarily relevant for text and number data types, determining the maximum number of characters or digits that can be stored in the field. Setting an appropriate field size optimizes storage usage and ensures data integrity by limiting the length of entries.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Validation Rule:</b> A validation rule is an expression that sets conditions on the data that can be entered into a field. It is used to ensure data accuracy and consistency by restricting the values that are accepted. When a user attempts to enter data that violates the validation rule, the database system prevents the entry and may display a validation text message.</p>
<p><b>(iii) Validation Text:</b> Validation text is a user-defined message that is displayed when a validation rule is violated. It provides instructions or feedback to the user about why the entered data is invalid and what type of data is expected. Clear validation text helps users understand the data requirements and correct their input, improving data entry accuracy and user experience.</p>

<p>Ben applied timing transition effects on the slides he created using a presentation program. Outline four such effects he could have applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Fade:</b> A fade transition gradually changes the slide's visibility, typically by fading in the new slide from transparent to opaque while the previous slide fades out. Fade effects are subtle and create a smooth, gentle transition between slides, suitable for maintaining a professional and seamless flow.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Wipe:</b> A wipe transition progressively reveals the new slide by "wiping" across the screen in a specific direction (e.g., from left to right, top to bottom). Wipe effects are more noticeable than fades and can add a dynamic element to slide transitions, directing the viewer's eye across the screen.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Push:</b> A push transition moves the new slide onto the screen by pushing the previous slide off the screen in a specified direction. Push effects create a sense of motion and direction, making the transition more pronounced and indicating a clear progression from one slide to the next.</p>
<p data-number="4"><b>Dissolve:</b> A dissolve transition changes from one slide to the next by gradually breaking up the first image and intermingling it with fragments of the next image. Dissolve effects can create a textured or fragmented transition, offering a visually interesting and less abrupt change between slides compared to hard cuts.</p>

<p>Explain one circumstance that would necessitate an organization to use each of the following data processing techniques:</p>
<p>(i) batch processing;</p>
<p>(ii) online processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>(i) Batch Processing:</b></p>
<p>A circumstance that necessitates batch processing is when an organization needs to process large volumes of data that can be collected over a period and processed together in a non-interactive, scheduled manner. For example, payroll processing is typically done in batches. Employee hours and pay-related data are collected throughout a pay period, and then, at a scheduled time (like end of the month), all payroll calculations, deductions, and check generations are processed together in a batch. This approach is efficient for handling large, recurring tasks that do not require immediate, real-time responses and can be scheduled for off-peak hours.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Online Processing:</b></p>
<p>A circumstance that necessitates online processing is when an organization requires immediate and real-time processing of transactions or data inputs, where results are needed instantly for interactive operations. For example, in e-commerce, online transaction processing (OLTP) is critical. When a customer makes a purchase on a website, the transaction needs to be processed immediately to update inventory, process payment, and confirm the order in real-time. Online processing is essential for applications that demand immediate responses, user interaction, and up-to-the-second data accuracy, such as point-of-sale systems, banking transactions, and reservation systems.</p>

<p>Explain the type of integrity constraints applied in (i) and (ii).</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Figure 3 is missing, thus I am unable to provide a definitive answer for this question. However, based on typical database integrity constraints, I can provide potential explanations assuming common scenarios for fields like 'Student ID', 'Semester', and 'Age'.</p>
<p>Assuming (i) refers to the 'Student ID' field and (ii) refers to the 'Age' field:</p>
<p><b>(i) Student ID Field: Likely Entity Integrity Constraint</b></p>
<p>Entity Integrity Constraint ensures that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable. Typically, this is enforced through a primary key. For the 'Student ID' field, it is highly likely that an Entity Integrity Constraint is applied, making 'Student ID' the primary key. This would mean:</p>
<p>- <b>Uniqueness:</b> Each Student ID must be unique within the table to uniquely identify each student record.</p>
<p>- <b>Not Null:</b> Student ID cannot be null, ensuring every student record has a valid identifier.</p>
<p>This constraint ensures each student is uniquely recorded in the database, which is fundamental for relational database integrity.</p>
<p><b>(ii) Age Field: Likely Domain Integrity Constraint</b></p>
<p>Domain Integrity Constraint ensures that all values in a column adhere to a predefined set of valid data types, formats, or ranges. For the 'Age' field, a Domain Integrity Constraint is likely applied to ensure that the age is a valid number within a reasonable range and of the correct data type (likely integer). This could involve:</p>
<p>- <b>Data Type Check:</b> Ensuring that the 'Age' field only accepts numerical data, rejecting non-numeric entries.</p>
<p>- <b>Range Check:</b> Restricting the acceptable values for age to a plausible range (e.g., age must be between 15 and 100 years, depending on the context of students). This prevents illogical entries like negative ages or excessively high ages.</p>
<p>This constraint maintains the quality and validity of the data entered in the 'Age' field, ensuring it represents realistic and meaningful age values.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Without Figure 3, these are assumptions based on common database practices for fields like 'Student ID' and 'Age'. The actual constraints applied could vary.</p>
