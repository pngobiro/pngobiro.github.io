<h3>1. (c) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>(c) Distinguish between an attribute and an entity as used in database programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Entity:</b> An entity is a real-world object or concept about which data is stored in a database. It can be a person, place, thing, event, or concept that is distinguishable and needs to be represented in the database. For example, in a student database, 'Student' is an entity.</p>
<p><b>Attribute:</b> An attribute is a characteristic or property of an entity. It describes a piece of information about the entity. Attributes are the columns in a database table. For example, for the 'Student' entity, attributes could be 'StudentID', 'Name', 'Course', and 'DateOfBirth'.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b> An entity is the subject of the data (the table itself), while an attribute is a specific detail or piece of information about that subject (a column in the table). Entities are the primary objects, and attributes define them.</p>

<h3>2. (a) (ii) (2 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>(ii) A student in an ICT class wrote the formula = B4 + $C8 in cell D5. If the formula was copied to cell F7, write the resultant formula.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>If the formula <code>=B4 + $C8</code> in cell D5 is copied to cell F7, the resultant formula will be <code>=D6 + $C8</code>.</p>
<p><b>Explanation:</b></p>
<p>When copying from D5 to F7, the cell reference moves 2 columns to the right (from D to F) and 2 rows down (from 5 to 7).</p>
<p>- The relative cell reference <code>B4</code> will adjust by the same amount, moving 2 columns right (B to D) and 2 rows down (4 to 6), becoming <code>D6</code>.</p>
<p>- The absolute column and absolute row reference <code>$C$8</code> remains unchanged as <code>$C$8</code> because the dollar signs ($) fix both the column and row, preventing adjustment during copying.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>4. (a) (i) Outline two disadvantages of a file based system.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:</b> File-based systems often lead to data redundancy because data may be duplicated across multiple files. This redundancy can cause data inconsistency, where the same piece of information has different values in different files, making it difficult to maintain data integrity.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Data Isolation:</b> In a file-based system, data is often scattered across different files, making it difficult to access and integrate data from various files. This isolation hinders efficient data sharing and can complicate tasks that require combining data from multiple sources, limiting the system's ability to provide a unified view of information.</p>

<h3>4. (b) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>(b) Distinguish between caption and bookmark as used in word processing programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Caption:</b> A caption is a numbered label that you can add to figures, tables, equations, or other objects in a document. Captions typically appear below figures and above tables, providing a brief description or title for the object. They are automatically numbered and can be easily updated if objects are added or removed, helping to maintain consistent referencing throughout the document.</p>
<p><b>Bookmark:</b> A bookmark is a named location in a document that you can assign to a specific text passage, image, or place. Bookmarks act as targets for hyperlinks and cross-references within the document or from external sources. They allow users to quickly navigate to specific parts of a document, and are primarily used for document navigation and linking rather than labeling objects.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b> Captions are for labeling and numbering figures and tables, primarily for referencing objects. Bookmarks are for naming locations in a document, mainly for navigation and linking to specific parts of the document.</p>

<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="i"><b>(i) Tab Stop:</b> This feature, indicated by the icon at position (i) in Figure 3, is used to set tab stops in a word processing document. Tab stops define specific horizontal positions within a line of text where the cursor will jump to when the Tab key is pressed. This is essential for aligning text in columns, creating indents, or positioning elements at precise locations on a line.</p>
<p data-number="ii"><b>(ii) Margin Control:</b> Feature (ii) in Figure 3 represents margin control, likely indicating the ability to adjust document margins. Margin controls allow users to set the amount of white space around the text on all sides of the page. Adjusting margins is crucial for controlling text layout, fitting content on a page, and adhering to formatting requirements for different types of documents.</p>

<h3>4. (d) (3 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>(d) Marion intends to create three objects on top of each other using a presentation program. Outline three ordering options she could use to achieve her goal.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p data-number="1"><b>Bring to Front:</b> This ordering option moves a selected object to the very top of the stacking order, ensuring it is displayed in front of all other overlapping objects. This is used when you want a particular object to be completely visible and not obscured by any other object.</p>
<p data-number="2"><b>Send to Back:</b> This option moves a selected object to the very bottom of the stacking order, placing it behind all other overlapping objects. It is useful when you want an object to serve as a background element or to be positioned behind other objects.</p>
<p data-number="3"><b>Bring Forward/Send Backward:</b> These options allow for incremental ordering adjustments. "Bring Forward" moves an object one step up in the stacking order, bringing it in front of the object immediately in front of it. "Send Backward" moves an object one step down, placing it behind the object immediately behind it. These are useful for fine-tuning the layering of objects in a presentation.</p>

<div class="question-content">
<p>(ii) Explain the term defragmentation as used in computer systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p>Defragmentation is the process of reorganizing data on a hard disk drive (HDD) to store file pieces contiguously. Over time, files can become fragmented, meaning parts of files are scattered across the disk, which slows down read/write times. Defragmentation consolidates these file fragments, placing them closer together to improve disk access speed and overall system performance.</p>

<h3>5. (b) (4 marks)</h3>
<div class="question-content">
<p>(b) Distinguish between object linking and object embedding as used in DTP programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer-section">
<h4>Answer</h4>
<div class="answer-content">
<p><b>Object Linking:</b> Object linking in DTP programs establishes a dynamic connection between a document and an external source file (like an image or spreadsheet). When an object is linked, the document displays a representation of the object, but the actual data remains in the external file. Any changes made to the source file are automatically reflected in the document when it is opened or updated. This is useful for keeping documents updated with the latest version of external content and for reducing document file size.</p>
<p><b>Object Embedding:</b> Object embedding inserts a copy of an object from another file directly into the document. Once embedded, the object becomes part of the document file and is no longer linked to the external source. Changes made to the original source file will not affect the embedded object in the document. Embedding is suitable when you need to include content as a static part of the document and want to ensure it remains consistent regardless of changes to the source file.</p>
<p><b>Key Differences:</b> Linking creates a dynamic reference to an external file for live updates and smaller document size, while embedding inserts a static copy of the object into the document, making it independent of the source file but increasing document size.</p>
