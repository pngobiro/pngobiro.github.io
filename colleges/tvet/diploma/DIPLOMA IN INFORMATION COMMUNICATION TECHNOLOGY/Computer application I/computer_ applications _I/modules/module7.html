                <div class="content-block">
                     <h2>Introduction to the Internet</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is a large no. of connected computers (or a large set of computer networks) linked together that communicate with each other, over telephone lines.</li>
                        <li>It is a worldwide computer network connecting thousands of computer networks, through a mixture of private & public data using the telephone lines.</li>
                        <li>It is a worldwide (global or an international) network of computers that provide a variety of resources and data to the people that use it.</li>
                        <li>Internet refers to a global inter-connection of computers and computer networks to facilitate global information transfer. It is an interconnection of computers throughout the world, using ordinary telecommunication lines and modems.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <h2>Features and functions of the Internet</h2>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>The Internet is a collection of networks; it is not owned or controlled by any single organization, and it has no formal management organization. However, there is an <b>Internet Society</b> that co ordinates and sets standards for its use. In addition, Networks have no political boundaries on the exchange of information.</li>
                        <li>Networks are connected by <b>Gateways</b> that effectively remove barriers so that one type of network can ‚Äútalk‚Äù to a different type of network.</li>
                        <li>To join the Internet, an existing network will only be required to pay a small registration fee and agree to certain standards based on TCP/IP. The costs are low, because the Internet owns nothing, and so it has no real costs to offset. Each organization pays for its own network & its own telephone bills, but these costs usually exist independent of the Internet.</li>
                        <li>Networks that join the Internet must agree to move each other‚Äôs traffic (data) at no charge to the others, just as it is the case with mail delivered through the International Postal system. This is why all the data appear to move at the cost of a local telephone call, making the Net a very cheap communication media.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h2>Functions of the Internet</h2>
                    <p>The Internet carries many kinds of traffic, and provides users with several functions. Some of the most important functions are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Communication</b>. Many people all over the world use the Internet to communicate with each other. Internet communication capabilities include; E-mail, Usenet Newsgroups, Chatting and Telnet. You can send e-mails to your friends anywhere in the world, chat with your friends, send instant messages, etc.</li>
                        <li><b>Information retrieval</b>. The Internet is a library. Thousands of books, magazines, newspapers and encyclopedias can be read on the Internet.</li>
                        <li><b>Easy-to-use offerings of information and products</b>. You can find information for your school assignments, buy books online, check what the weather is like anywhere in the world, and much more.</li>
                    </ol>

                     <h2>Electronic Mail (E-mail).</h2>
                    <p>An <b>E-mail</b> is a system that enables sending & receiving of messages electronically through computers. It is used for communication between organizations or departments in the same organization.</p>
                    <p>E-mail is a quick, cheap, efficient & convenient means of communication with both individuals and groups. It is faster than ordinary mail, easy to manage, inexpensive and saves paper.</p>
                    <p>With Internet mail, it is possible to send and receive messages quickly from businesses, friends or family in another part of the world. An E-mail message can travel around the world in minutes.</p>
                     <h2>Fax services.</h2>
                    <p>Fax services enable individuals & businesses to send faxes through e-mail at a lower cost compared to the usual international Fax charges.</p>
                     <h2>Conference services.</h2>
                    <p><b>Conferencing on the Web</b> can be defined as the dynamic exchange of all kinds of information ‚Äì text, graphics, audio, video, etc ‚Äì in a situation whereby the conversations are organized by item and allows a participant to contribute spontaneous responses to any item in the conversation.</p>
                     <h2>Application of Conferencing on the Web.</h2>
                    <p>The conversation can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide important information that can assist in decision-making.</li>
                        <li>Provide any required technical support.</li>
                        <li>Help in community-building, project management & distance learning.</li>
                        <li>Help to organize electronic meetings, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Internet also allows you to have access to various types of information you might require to make accurate and informed decisions, E.g., it provides information on business, education, sports, politics, etc.</p>
                     <h2>Chatting.</h2>
                    <p><b>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</b> is a chatting system on the Internet that allows a large no. of people from various locations of the world who are on the computer to chat (i.e., simultaneously hold live and interactive electronic conversations) among themselves.</p>
                    <p>You can join discussion groups on the Internet and meet people around the world with similar interests. You can ask questions, discuss problems and read interesting stories.</p>
                    <p>Anyone interested in chatting can join a discussion forum on one of the listed topics. Only people who happen to be signed on at the same time are able to talk because messages are not stored.</p>
                    <p>This discussion can be an effective business tool if people who can benefit from interactive conversation set a specific appointment to meet and talk on a particular topic.</p>
                     <h3>Disadvantage.</h3>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Usually, the topic is open to all without security; so intruders can participate.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h2>Information retrieval.</h2>
                    <p>The Internet is a voluntarily decentralized network with no central listing of participants or sites. Therefore, End-users, usually working from PCs are able to search & find information of interest located in different sites assisted by special software and data stored in readily usable formats.</p>
                    <p>The Internet gives you information on almost any subject. This is because of the Worldwide Web (www).</p>
                    <p><b>The World Wide Web</b> is a global (an international) system of connected Web pages containing information such as, text, pictures, sound and video. The WWW is <b>hypertext based</b> (i.e., it is able to access text and graphical data formatted for easy search, retrieval and display).</p>
                    <p>With the WWW, you can review Newspapers, magazines, academic papers, etc. In addition, Governments, colleges, universities, companies and individuals offer free information on the Internet. E.g., you can inquire (find out) about universities in Britain or America.</p>
                     <aside class="learning-tip">
                        <h3>üí° Note.</h3>
                        <p>Its major problem is finding what you need from among the many storehouses of data found in databases and libraries all over the world.</p>
                    </aside>
                     <h2>Dowloading of Programs.</h2>
                    <p>There are thousands of programs available on the Internet. These programs include; Word processors, Spreadsheets, Electronic cards, etc.</p>
                    <p>You can therefore, look for the latest software over the Internet, e.g., you can get the latest Anti-virus software, and in addition, retrieve a free trial issue.</p>
                     <h2>Entertainment.</h2>
                    <p>There are hundreds of simple games available on the Internet. These include; Chess, Football, etc. The Internet also allows you review current Movies and hear Television theme songs.</p>
                     <h2>Online Shopping.</h2>

                    <p>Commercial enterprises use the Web to provide information on demand for purposes of customer support, marketing and sales.</p>
                     <h2>File Transfer.</h2>
                    <p>Data in the form of files can be transferred across the Internet from one site to another using the <b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</b>. FTP software is needed at both ends to handle the transfer. It is through FTP that the two pieces of software manage to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô each other.</p>
                     <h2>Discussion Groups.</h2>
                    <p>A <b>Discussion group</b> is a collection of users who have joined together to discuss some topic. There are many discussions on different topics including Cooking, Skydiving, Politics, Education, recreational, scientific research, etc.</p>
                    <p>Two of the commonly used discussion groups for business are;</p>

                        <li>Usenet newsgroups.</li>
                        <li>List Servers.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <h3>(a). Usenet newsgroups.</h3>
                    <p>These are the most formally organized of the discussion groups.</p>
                    <p>Using a facility on the Internet called <b>USENET</b>, individuals can gain access to a very wide variety of information topics.</p>

                        <h3>üí° Browsing</h3>
                        <p>can also be defined as moving around and between Web pages.</p>
                    </aside>
                    <p>Using a Web browsing software you can read documents, listen to music, watch videos, make purchases, participate in surveys, advertise products, do research, share interests and download files on the Web.</p>
                     <h2>EXPLORING / BROWSING THE INTERNET.</h2>
                    <p>Use the <b>Internet Explorer</b> on your Windows desktop to browse the Web.</p>
                    <p>There are several ways in which you can browse the Web pages or ‚Äúsurf the net‚Äù.</p>
                     <h3>(a).</h3>
                    <p>When viewing a Web page, you can navigate the Internet by clicking <b>Links</b>, <b>Underlined text</b> or special features that cause you to jump to another Web page.</p>
                     <h2>Hyperlinks.</h2>
                    <p>A <b>Hyperlink</b> is a coloured or underlined text or a graphic that you click to ‚Äòjump‚Äô from one location to another. The hyperlinks enable the user to ‚Äòjump‚Äô to another file, or to another location in the same file.</p>
                    <p>All Web pages have hyperlinks. These links:</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Connect one part of a Web page to another part of the same Web page. This is useful if the Web page is large.</li>
                        <li>Connect one Web page to another Website somewhere on the Web.</li>
                        <li>Connect a page to a file, such as a sound clip, video, a Spreadsheet or a Word document.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The links can connect to objects stored anywhere on the Internet.</p>
                    <p><b>Hypertext links</b> are indicated by underlined text highlighted usually in blue. Hyperlinks can also be represented by buttons, graphics or pictures.</p>
                    <p>To find hyperlinks on a page, move your mouse pointer over the page and where there is a hyperlink, the mouse pointer will change into a hand with a pointing finger. When you click a link, another Web page appears.</p>
                    <p>As you browse the Web, Internet Explorer stores the sites and pages that you visit. Usually, the hyperlinks you previously selected are colored differently. Internet Explorer does this to remind you that you have already visited the page identified by this link.</p>
                     <h3>(b).</h3>
                    <p>You can also use the Standard toolbar buttons in the Internet Explorer to move between Web pages, or to search the Internet.</p>
                     <h2>History.</h2>
                    <p>Internet Explorer remembers the Websites and Web pages that you have visited. It keeps record of each Web page as it is downloaded. This is the <b>History</b> feature.</p>
                    <p>You can therefore, easily return to the page you have visited. To redisplay the page you have just left, click on the <b>Back</b> button. To move to the next page (available only if you have moved back), click the <b>Forward</b> button.</p>
                     <h2>Web Hosting.</h2>
                    <p>A <b>World Wide Web Server</b> is a computer with programs that answer requests for documents from <b>Clients</b> (browsers) over the Internet. Files containing Web sites are placed on these servers.</p>
                    <p>A <b>Host computer</b> is any computer connected to the Internet and stores information that has been made available to the Web.</p>
                    <p>ISPs also use host computers to store user‚Äôs electronic mail messages, Web sites and other related facilities such as, support software and appropriate security.</p>
                     <h2>Web Address (Uniform Resource Locator ‚Äì URL).</h2>
                    <p>An <b>Address</b> is the location of a file.</p>
                    <p>Each Web page in the world has a unique Internet address or location. Internet addresses are also called the <b>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</b>. E.g., the general URL for Microsoft is <a href="http://www.Microsoft.com./">http://www.Microsoft.com./</a></p>
                    <p>You can use addresses to find files on the Internet & your computer. You can instantly display any Web page if you know its URL. E.g., <a href="http://www.compaq.com">http://www.compaq.com</a>.</p>
                    <p><b>AutoComplete</b> - A feature in the Address Bar. When you begin typing a previously used address, this feature finishes it as you type.</p>

                    <p>Each <b>Client computer</b> needs an application software package called a <b>Web browser</b>, such as Navigator, Internet Explorer.</p>
                    <p>Each <b>Server</b> on the network needs an application software package called a <b>Web Server</b>. There are many different Web servers, such as those produced by Netscape, Microsoft and Apache.</p>
                    <p>In order to get a page from the Web, the user must type the <b>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</b> for the desired page, or click on a link that provides the URL. The URL specifies the Internet address of the Web Server, the directory and the name of the specific page required. If no directory or page is specified, the Web server will display whatever page has been defined as its Home page. If no server name is specified, the Web browser will assume that the address is on the same server and directory as the last request.</p>

                     <h2>About e-mail.</h2>
                    <p><b>Electronic mail</b> (also known as <b>e-mail</b>) is one of the common services provided by the Internet.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>E-Mail</b> is a worldwide system for sending & receiving electronic messages from one computer to another.</li>
                        <li><b>E-Mail (Electronic mail)</b> refers to electronic messages sent over the Internet or a network. E-mail can contain both text & files.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With e-mail, users can create and send messages to one user, several users, or all the users on a distribution list.</p>
                    <p>Most e-mail software enable users to send text messages. In addition, users can attach files from Word processors, Spreadsheets, Reports, production data, etc, and then send them by e-mail.</p>
                    <p>Most E-mail packages allow you to do the same things you do with regular paper mail. You can file messages in electronic file cabinets, forward copies of messages to other users, send ‚Äúcarbon copies‚Äù of messages, and so on. The E-mail packages also allow you to filter or organize messages by priority. E.g., all messages from a particular user (e.g., your boss) could be given top priority, so that they always appear at the top of your list of messages.</p>
                    <p>However, E-mail is a much faster, economical & convenient way of sending messages to family, friends and colleagues than the paper mail (usually called ‚ÄúSnail mail‚Äù). Messages can be sent or received 24-hrs a day. With ‚ÄúSnail mail‚Äù a message or a letter is sent to the recipient through the Post office and takes days or weeks before reaching the destination.</p>
                     <h2>Components required.</h2>
                    <p>For one to be able to communicate using e-mail, the following components are needed:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>A Computer</b> - where you will send or receive the e-mail messages.</li>
                        <li><b>An E-mail program</b>. Your computer must be installed with an e-mail program that lets you send, receive and manage your e-mail messages. Examples of E-mail programs;
                            <ul>
                                <li>Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, & Microsoft Exchange from Microsoft.</li>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Each Client computer in the Local Area Network (LAN) runs an e-mail software package called <b>User Agent</b>, e.g., Eudora, Lotus Notes, Outlook Express, Microsoft Outlook, etc.</p>
                    <p>The user writes the e-mail messages using one of the User Agents, which formats the message into 2 parts;</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li><b>The Header</b>, which lists the source and destination e-mail addresses.</li>
                        <li><b>The Body</b>, which is the message itself.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The User agent sends the message header & body to a <b>Mail Server</b> that runs a special application package called a <b>Message Mail Transfer Agent</b>. The Message Mail Transfer Agent in the Mail Server reads the envelope & then sends the message through the network (possibly through dozens of Message Transfer Agents) until the message arrives at the Mail Server of the receiver.</p>
                    <p>The Message Transfer Agent on this server then stores the message in the receiver‚Äòs mailbox on the server.</p>
                    <p>When the receiver accesses his/her e-mail, the User Agent on the receiver‚Äòs Client computer contacts the Message Transfer Agent on the Mail Server, and asks for the contents of the user‚Äòs mailbox. The Message Transfer Agent sends the e-mail message to the client computer, which the user reads using the user agent.</p>
                     <h2>E-MAIL STANDARDS.</h2>
                    <p>Several standards have been developed to ensure the compatibility between different e-mail software packages.</p>
                    <p>The 3 commonly used standards are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).</li>
                        <li>X-400.</li>
                        <li>Common Messaging Calls (CMC).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>All the 3 e-mail standards work in the same basic fashion.</p>
                     <h3>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).</h3>
                    <p>SMTP is the most commonly e-mail standard used on the Internet.</p>
                    <p>SMTP defines how Message Transfer Agents operate and how they format messages sent to them. As the name suggests, SMTP is a simple standard that permits only the transfer of text messages. Non-text files such as graphics or Word processing documents are not permitted.</p>
                    <p>However, several standards for non-text files have been developed that can operate together with SMTP. They include; Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME), Unencoded & Bin Hex.</p>
                    <p>A different standard called <b>Post Office Protocol (POP)</b> defines how User agents operate and how messages to & from the Mail Transfer Agents are formatted.</p>
                    <p>POP is gradually being replaced by a newer standard called <b>Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP)</b>.</p>
                    <p>The main difference between POP & IMAP is that, before a user can read a mail message with a POP user agent; the e-mail message must be copied to the client‚Äòs hard disk and deleted from the mail server. With IMAP, e-mail messages can remain stored on the mail server after they have been read. Therefore, IMAP is beneficial to users who read their e-mail from many different computers (e.g., at home, in office & in computer labs), because all e-mail is stored on the server until it is deleted.</p>
                     <h3>X-400</h3>
                    <p>The X-400 e-mail standard was developed in 1984. It is a set of seven (7) standards that define how e-mail is to be processed by the User agents and the Mail Transfer Agents.</p>
                     <h3>Common Messaging Calls (CMC).</h3>
                    <p>The CMC standard is a simpler version of the X-400 standard.</p>
                    <p>It was developed in 1994.</p>
                    <p>It is more popular than X-400, because it is simple & it is also supported by a large no. of leading vendors/sellers.</p>
                     <h2>File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</h2>
                    <p>FTP enables you to send and receive files over the Internet. FTP requires an application program on the client server and an application program on the FTP Server. Many application packages use the FTP standard (e.g., WS-FTP).</p>
                    <p>Almost anyone can establish a FTP server, which permits anyone on the Internet to log in, send and receive files.</p>
                    <p>There are 2 types of FTP sites;</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Closed.</li>
                        <li>Anonymous.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h3>Closed FTP site.</h3>
                    <p>A Closed site requires users to have permission before they can connect and gain access to the files. Access is granted after the user provides an Account name with a secret password.</p>
                    <p>For example, a Network Manager would write a Web page using software on his/her client computer and their user FTP to send it to a specific account on the Web Server.</p>
                     <h3>Anonymous FTP site.</h3>
                    <p>Anonymous is the most common type of an FTP site.</p>
                    <p>It permits any Internet user to log in using the account of anonymous.</p>
                    <p>When using the anonymous FTP, you will still be asked for a password. You can enter your Internet e-mail address as the password.</p>
                    <p>Many files and documents available via FTP have been compressed to reduce the amount of disk space they require.</p>
                     <aside class="learning-tip">
                        <h3>üí° Note.</h3>
                        <p>If a file that you want has been compressed by a compression program that is not in your computer, you cannot access the file until you get the decompression program it used.</p>
                    </aside>
                     <h2>Using Lotus Notes.</h2>
                    <p>One of the problems with e-mail is that, it lacks a structured way to support an ongoing discussion. Each mail message is a separate item, unrelated to the other messages. Usually, you can group and file e-mail messages into separate file folders, but it not possible to combine them.</p>
                    <p>Using Lotus Notes (a document database of text and graphics), documents with different sections can be organized into a hierarchical structure of sections, documents and folders.</p>
                    <p>Lotus Notes can be used as a computer Bulletin board to support ongoing discussions. Several topics and sub-topics can be created, and everyone or selected individuals in the organization can be given access.</p>
                    <p>Lotus Notes can also be used to organize a discussion among certain people such as a Project team working to improve manufacturing quality. It might reduce the amount of time the team spent in face-to-face meetings, because many of the issues might be discussed before the meeting actually starts.</p>
                    <p>Lotus Notes also could be used to replace standard Word processors in preparing reports. Each team member could use Lotus Notes to write a portion of report, which could then be passed to other team members for editing or comments.</p>
