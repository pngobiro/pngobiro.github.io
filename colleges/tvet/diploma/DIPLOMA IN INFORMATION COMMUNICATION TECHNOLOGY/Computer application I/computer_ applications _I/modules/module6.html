                <div class="content-block">
                     <h2>Introduction to Desk Top Publishing</h2>
                    <p><b>Desktop publishing</b> (abbreviated <b>DTP</b>) is the creation of documents using page layout skills on a personal computer primarily for print. Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic quality text and images comparable to traditional typography and printing.</p>
                    <p>The term <b>Desktop Publishing</b> (-or <b>DTP</b> for short) covers a broad range of activities. In it's widest sense, it can mean anything concerned with creating a printed document on a desktop PC.</p>
                    <p>Desktop Publishing [is] anything where you need <b>precise control</b> over the position of text and/or graphics on the printed page. DTP software is an enhanced combination of word processor and graphics software that allow manipulation of text, graphics and typefaces on screen before finally printing a design on paper</p>
                    <p>However, most simple documents can be handled by a Word Processor and do not require the more advanced facilities of a dedicated DTP application and so we normally refer to Desktop Publishing as anything where you need <b>precise control</b> of the position of text and/or graphics on the printed page. Typical DTP candidates include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Books containing diagrams</li>
                        <li>Newsletters</li>
                        <li>Advertising Flyers</li>
                        <li>Leaflets</li>
                        <li>Anything that requires multi-column output</li>
                    </ul>
                     <aside class="learning-tip">
                        <h3>üí° Note:</h3>
                        <p>graphics falls into five major categories; photographs, illustrations, texture, line drawings and cartoon or caricature</p>
                    </aside>
                    <p>A DTP package allows the different types of graphics be incorporated in a publication</p>
                     <h2>Types of DTP software</h2>
                    <p>DTP software may divide into two:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Layout based software</b> ‚Äì combines text and graphics to create publication. Single page artistic layouts or short documents that combines text and graphics requires a page layout tool that provides extensive typographic control and graphic loading capabilities which is a feature of layout based software. Typical projects for page layout tools include fliers, posters and business cards i.e. ‚Äì MS Publisher, Page maker</li>
                        <li><b>Print and draw software</b> ‚Äì provides an environment for drawing and manipulating graphics. There are two main types of graphics packages
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li><b>Vector graphics</b> ‚Äì use/create vector image. Vector image are made up of individual, scalable objects defined by mathematical equations. Objects here consist of lines, curves and shapes with editable attributes as color, fill and outline. i.e. ‚Äì Corel draw and Illustrator</li>
                                <li><b>Bitmap graphics</b> ‚Äì use/create bitmap image. Bitmap image also called raster image are made up of pixels. Pixels are picture elements made up of tiny dots of individual color that make up/define an image. i.e. ‚Äì Photoshop and MS paint</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </section>

             <section class="content-section">
                <h2>üìö Microsoft Publisher</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <h2>Microsoft Publisher</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Publisher is an entry-level desktop publishing application from Microsoft, differing from Microsoft Word in that the emphasis is placed on page layout and design rather than text composition and proofing</p>
                    <p>Publisher is included in higher-end editions of Microsoft Office, reflecting Microsoft's emphasis on the application as an easy-to-use and less expensive alternative to the "heavyweights" with a focus on the small business market where firms do not have dedicated design professionals available to make marketing materials and other documents. However, it has a relatively small share of the desktop publishing market, which is dominated by Adobe Applications.</p>
                     <aside class="learning-tip">
                        <h3>üí° Note:</h3>
                        <p>In Microsoft Office 2007, while most of Microsoft Office apps adopted ribbons in their user interface, Publisher retained its toolbars and did not adopt ribbons until the next version</p>
                    </aside>
                     <h2>Publisher Basics and Feature</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Publisher 2007 is a desktop publishing program that can be used to create a variety of publications. Using Publisher, you can easily create business cards, greeting cards, calendars, newsletters and much, much more.</p>
                    <p>Unlike the other programs in Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Publisher 2007 uses the Microsoft Office Toolbar and a Menu system in place of the Microsoft Office Ribbon.</p>

                        <p>‚Äì Most publications are divided into several different areas called frames. A frame can contain a variety of objects such as graphics, tables, or text boxes. Frames can be resized, moved and manipulated to suit your needs.</p>

                    <p>You can also use a picture that is designed to be a border. For example, you can insert a page border clip from Clip Art and Media on Microsoft Office Online, and then change the size to fit the page or object that you want to add a border to.</p>
                    <p>If the page, text box, AutoShape, picture, or group of items already has a border, you can change or remove it.</p>
                     <h3>Add a border to a page</h3>
                    <p>To add a border to a page, draw a rectangle around the page and then add the line or predesigned border you want. To add a border to all the pages in your publication, add the border to a master page, and then apply the master page to the pages in your publication.</p>

                <h2>üìö CHAPTER 6: PRESENTATIONS</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                     <h2>Introduction to Presentation</h2>
                    <p>A <b>presentation program</b> is a software package used to display information in the form of a <b>slide show</b>. It has three major functions: an editor that allows text to be inserted and formatted, a method for inserting and manipulating graphic images, and a slide-show system to display the content.</p>
                    <p>Presentation software (sometimes called "presentation graphics") is a category of application program used to create sequences of words and pictures that tell a story or help support a speech or public presentation of information. Presentation software can be divided into business presentation software and more general multimedia authoring tools, with some products having characteristics of both. Business presentation software emphasizes ease- and quickness-of learning and use. Multimedia authoring software enables you to create a more sophisticated presentation that includes audio and video sequences. Business presentation software usually enables you to include images and sometimes audio and video developed with other tools.</p>
                    <p>Some very popular presentation software, such as Microsoft's Powerpoint and Lotus's Freelance Graphics, are sold stand-alone or can come as part of office-oriented suites or packages of software. Other popular products include Adobe Persuasion, Astound, Asymetrix Compel, Corel Presentations, and Harvard Graphics. Among the most popular multimedia authoring tools are Macromedia Director and Asymetrix's Multimedia Toolbook. These authoring tools also include presentation capability as well. Most if not all of these products come in both PC and Mac versions.</p>
                    <p>Recently, a new presentation tool has arrived: your Web browser and the tools for creating Web pages, such as Microsoft's FrontPage and Adobe's PageMill. The ubiquity of these tools and the browser as a playback device make this a popular approach, especially when a presentation can combine HTML pages on the hard disk with links to outside sites (if you have a live Internet connection).</p>
                     <h2>Microsoft PowerPoint</h2>
                    <p>"PowerPoint" refers to Microsoft PowerPoint, a program that allows the user to design a presentation that consists of multiple slides. These slides may contain images, text, video clips, and related types of information. PowerPoint is useful for delivering a speech, because the user can utilize text on the screen to remind him or herself of the information to be conveyed to the audience or to summarize his/her dialogue into more manageable and "friendly" sizes, as well as to entertain or explain graphs, charts, and related data.</p>

                     <h3>Using the AutoContent Wizard</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If necessary, chose File > New to display the New Presentation pane</li>
                        <li>On the New Presentation pane, click on the AutoContent Wizard link</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>You will be walked through a series of questions about the presentation you are making, including a category for the type of information being presented and the method of delivery. The Wizard then applies a background and text as well as an outline of text you may use as a guide. This is the preferred method for creating a presentation in the least of amount of time.</p>
                     <h3>Using a Design Template</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If necessary, choose File > New to display the New Presentation pane</li>
                        <li>On the New Presentation pane, click on the From Design Template link</li>
                        <li>The Slide Design pane will display on the right side of the screen with a variety of different templates to choose from</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>This will open a new presentation with no template. You will provide the content, background, color scheme, text format, etc. This method gives you the most freedom, but also requires the most amount of time to complete.</p>
                     <h2>Adding a new slide</h2>
                    <p>Once you have opened a new presentation, the next step is to add and format the content. PowerPoint provides a selection of pre-defined slide layouts based on different types of content that you can use to quickly add content to the slides. For each of the 27 Slide Layouts provided, PowerPoint combines the four types of placeholders in different combinations; each placeholder will be replaced with the following type of content:</p>

                     <h2>How to Change the Layout for any Slide</h2>
                    <p>PowerPoint will try to guess what layout you want to use for new slides that are added to the presentation. If you want a different layout for the slide you can quickly change the layout for any slide.</p>

                    <p>Working in the Outline Tab allows you to type and edit text for the presentation in a more word processing-like environment than the Slide pane. The Outline tab displays in the pane on the left side of the screen when you are working in the Normal view.</p>
                    <p>Information in the Outline tab is arranged by levels. The Title of each slide appears as the first, left-most level next to a numbered icon of the slide. Bulleted text is indented one to four levels to the right of the title. The Outline tab has an Outlining toolbar that displays to the left of the pane.</p>

                    <p>Effective visuals emphasize the key content points in a presentation. PowerPoint provides a selection of professionally designed pictures, or clip art, that you can use in your presentations. These clip art images include many different themes such as animals, people, buildings, food, holidays, business, and more.</p>

                    </ol>
                     <h2>How to Resize a Clip Art Image</h2>
                    <p>Once you have added a clip art object to your slide, you can resize it to make it fit better into your presentation.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click on the Clip Art object to select it.</li>
                        <li>Put the arrow on one of the resize handles at the corner of the picture until the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow.</li>
                        <li>Depress the mouse button and drag the handle toward or away from the center to make the image larger or smaller. The corner handles resize the image proportionally and the handles on the sides of the image increase or decrease the height or width of the image. When you release the mouse button, the object appears in its new size.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h2>Editing Slide Text</h2>
                    <p>You know how to enter text into your presentation, but what happens if you decide you want to change the text?</p>

                    </ol>
                    <p>You can also use the Alignment buttons on the Formatting toolbar to left-align, center, and right-align text.</p>
                     <h2>Line Spacing</h2>
                    <p>Line spacing is the vertical distance between two lines of text. By default, line spacing is set to single-line spacing, which means that the amount of space between lines of text depends on the size of the font used. For example, if the font size is 12, then single-line spacing will be 12 pts between lines of text. If you applied double-line spacing, then the lines would be separated by 24 pts of space.</p>
                     <h3>Setting Line Spacing</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place the cursor in a paragraph, or select the paragraphs you want to affect.</li>
                        <li>Choose Format > Line Spacing.</li>
                        <li>In the Line Spacing dialog box, click on the arrows to increase or decrease line spacing options, or enter an exact setting.</li>
                        <li>Click OK.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h3>Line Spacing Options</h3>
                    <p>In the Line Spacing dialog box, there are three options for changing the amount of space between lines and bullet items on a slide.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Line Spacing</b> - the amount of space between selected lines of text. By default, line spacing is set to 1.</li>
                        <li><b>Before Paragraph</b> - increase or decrease the spacing before the first line of each selected paragraph.</li>
                        <li><b>After Paragraph</b> - the amount of space after the last line of each selected paragraph</li>
                    </ul>
                     <h2>Indents</h2>
                    <p>In PowerPoint, indents are used to align bullets and text at a set distance from the margins. When the horizontal ruler in PowerPoint is displayed, you will find one set of the following indent markers on the left edge of the ruler for each level of bullets on the slide:</p>

                        <li>To adjust the subsequent lines in a paragraph, click and drag the upper marker for that indent to a desired position on the ruler.</li>
                        <li>To maintain the relationship between the first line and the rest of the paragraph (to move both markers at once), click and drag the bottom half of the lower marker to a desired position on the ruler.</li>

                     <h2>Preparing to Deliver a Presentation</h2>
                    <div class="content-block">
                    <p>After adding all of the content to a presentation, it is time to put the finishing touches on it. There are multiple ways to check for spelling errors, inconsistencies, or other problems. There are also several ways to enhance the presentation.</p>
                     <h2>Spell Check a Presentation</h2>
                     <h3>AutoCorrect</h3>
                    <p>Autocorrect corrects many common spelling errors automatically as you type. It is similar to the version used in Microsoft Word. Autocorrect fixes spelling errors as well as instances such as double capital letters at the beginning of a word, capitalizing the days of the week and the first words of a sentence. Common typing mistakes such as letter transposition are also automatically corrected as you type.</p>
                     <aside class="learning-tip">
                        <p>There may be times when you do not want Autocorrect turned on. To access options for Autocorrect, go under the Tools menu and choose Autocorrect Options. Each function in AutoCorrect can be selected or deselected by clicking in the check box associated with each function.</p>

                     <h3>Spellchecking a PowerPoint Presentation</h3>
                    <p>PowerPoint provides you with a powerful spellchecker that works in the same fashion as the one in Microsoft Word.</p>
                     <aside class="learning-tip">
                        <p>As with that spellchecker, it's always a good idea to proofread your presentation yourself; however, the spell checker can sometimes be a lifesaver.</p>
                    </aside>
                    <p>To check an entire presentation, don't select any text. If you run the spellchecker with specific text selected, it will only check that text. You don't have to click the insertion point at the beginning of a presentation to begin spellchecking, as the spellchecker will wrap around until it has checked the entire presentation.</p>
                    <p>There are four ways to access the spellchecker:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the Tools menu, choose Spelling.</li>
                        <li>Click the Spelling button on the Toolbar.</li>
                        <li>Press [F7].</li>
                        <li>Right-click on a flagged spelling error and choose Spelling.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once the spellchecker is running, you can use the various options to help you find and correct spelling errors in your presentation. PowerPoint's spellchecker compares words with its internal dictionary. If PowerPoint does not recognize a word, there are several options you can have it perform, as described below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the correction you want is already highlighted in the Suggestions list box, click Change.</li>
                        <li>If the correction you want is in the Suggestions list box but not highlighted, select that word and click Change.</li>
                        <li>If the correction you want is not suggested, you can type the correction in the top text box and click Change.</li>
                        <li>You can click Change All to automatically correct any further occurrences of the particular spelling error.</li>
                        <li>If the spellchecker comes across a word that has been repeated, you can click Delete to delete on of the instances of a word.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>PowerPoint can check your spelling as you type. If it thinks you've misspelled a word, PowerPoint lets you know by drawing a wavy red line under the word. To correct one of these erros, right-click on the erroneous word and either choose one of the suggested changes or open the Spell Check dialog box and make the change there as described above.</p>
                     <h2>View the Slide Show</h2>
                    <p>While putting together a PowerPoint slide show, it is often useful to actually run the show to see what it will really look like when it is presented to an audience. This can provide a "reality check" and give a better idea of how the show is actually going to look.</p>
                     <h3>Slide Show View</h3>
                    <p>Use the Slide Show view to see the slide show on your computer screen one slide at a time, using the full screen, as you will when actually presenting the show. You can move the subsequent slides by either clicking your mouse button, clicking the [Page Up] and [Page Down] buttons, or by using the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.</p>
                     <h3>To view the Slide Show:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When you use the Slide Show view button, PowerPoint starts the show at the currently selected slide. So, go to the first slide in your presentation.</li>
                        <li>Click the Slide Show view button.</li>
                        <li>To move to the next slide, click the mouse button or push the right arrow key. At the end of the show, PowerPoint will display, "End of slide show, click to exit".</li>
                        <li>You can exit a slide show at any point by pressing the [Esc] key.</li>
                        <li>When you exit a slide show, PowerPoint returns to Normal view.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h2>Microsoft Office PowerPoint 9</h2>
                     <h2>Arrange Slides in a Presentation</h2>
                    <p>The ability to reorder slides in a presentation after you've created them enables you to easily reorder slides after you've created them, as well as giving you the freedom to organize a new presentation out of an older one. This can be essential in using the same material for different audiences without having to recreate and entire slide show presentation. PowerPoint also lets you hide selected slides in a presentation, in case you want to reuse a slide show for an audience and omit certain parts of the presentation that don't apply to that particular presentation.</p>
                     <h3>Slide Sorter View</h3>
                    <p>Choose View/Slide Sorter, or click on the Slide Sorter view button. PowerPoint changes to the Slide Sorter view and opens the slide sorter toolbar.</p>
                    <p>In Slide Sorter view, you see the thumbnail representations of the slides comprising your slide show. This is a great way to see the whole presentation at once, in the order in which they will appear in the slide show. After you are finished creating and editing your presentation, you can come to Slide Sorter view to shuffle slides around, and copy, delete, or hide slides, until you've got it right. Slide Sorter view also allows you to set up special effects to the slides in the presentation.</p>
                    <p>As you look through your slides in Slide Sorter view, and find a slide that you need to further edit, just double-click on that slide and it will be displayed in Normal view.</p>
                     <h3>Rearranging Slides in Slide Sorter View</h3>
                    <p>You can often make a presentation better by playing with the order in which the slides appear. Sometimes, you may wish to entirely hide a slide that doesn't apply to your audience. All of this happens in Slide Sorter view. To rearrange slides in Slide Sorter view:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click on the Slide Sorter view button (or choose View/Slide Sorter).</li>
                        <li>Click on the slide you wish to move, copy, delete, or hide to select it.</li>
                        <li>Now move, copy, delete, or hide the slide:</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h2>Adding Transitions to a Slide Show</h2>
                    <p>One way to add a nice touch of professionalism to a slide show is to add transitions to the slides. Transitions affect the way one slide goes to the next slide. Transitions add interest to your slide show, but care should be taken to be sure they do not become a distraction from the show itself. It is often best to choose one transition you like and use it for the entire slide show.</p>
                     <h3>Slide Selection in Sorter View</h3>
                    <p>In Slide Sorter view, you can select one slide, two or more slides that are next to each other, or two or more slides that are not next to each other.</p>

                     <h2>How to Set Transition Effects</h2>
                    <p>For each slide in a presentation, you can set a different transition effect and determine how fast the transition will happen. To set transition effects:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Switch to Slide Sorter view.</li>
                        <li>Select the slides to which you want to assign a transition.</li>
                        <li>Choose Slide Show/Slide Transition or click the Transition button on the Slide Sorter toolbar to open the Slide Transition task pane.</li>
                        <li>From the Apply to Selected Slides list box, select the transition effect you want to apply. PowerPoint previews the effect on the selected slides and displays a Preview Animation button beneath each selected slide.</li>
                        <li>In the Modify Transition section, select a speed (Slow, Medium, or Fast) for the transition effect. Once again, PowerPoint previews the effect on the selected slides.</li>
                        <li>To preview the effect again, click the Animation Preview button beneath the slide on the left side.</li>
                        <li>Close the Slide Transition pane.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h2>Animating Text</h2>
                    <p>Normally, when you have a slide with multiple bullets, PowerPoint will display all the text bullets at once when you go to that slide during a slide show. One nice effect, however, is having the different bullets appear as you speak can be accomplished by using PowerPoint's animate text feature.</p>
                    <p>Animation of text in PowerPoint refers to the manner in which individual text or other objects appear as they enter or exit a slide. Normally, all objects on a slide appear at the same time when you display the slide. However, you can have different objects appear and exit at different times under your control as the show proceeds. To add animation to text in a presentation:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In Normal view, select a line of bulleted text.</li>
                        <li>Choose Slide Show/Custom Animation to open the Custom Animation task pane.</li>
                        <li>Click the Add Effect button to display the drop-down list.</li>
                        <li>From the Entrance sub-menu, choose the animation effect of your choice. You can choose More Effects if the effect you want isn't listed. PowerPoint displays the animation effect in the list box on the Custom Animation task pane.</li>
                        <li>In the Modify section, set the direction and speed.</li>
                        <li>Close the Custom Animation task pane.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h2>Printing Slides, Speaker Notes, and Handouts</h2>
                    <p>PowerPoint enables you to easily print handouts, slides, and your own speaker notes that you can reference while giving a presentation.</p>
                     <h3>Handouts</h3>
                    <p>You can use PowerPoint to create handouts of the slides in your presentation. You can decide how many slides you wish to appear on a page. Usually, it is best to have no more than 4 in order that they remain readable. You can choose layouts from the Print dialog box right before you print. PowerPoint automatically formats everything for you.</p>
                     <h2>Print Options</h2>
                    <p>There are many options for printing your presentation. You can print slides, notes pages, handout pages, or outlines.</p>
                    <p>You can print the current slide, or select a range of slides to print. You can also select other print options. To print various things from PowerPoint:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Choose File > Print to display the Print dialog box.</li>
                        <li>Under the Print What heading, select the type of printout.</li>
                        <li>Select any other options you want.</li>
                        <li>Click OK.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h2>Creating a Custom Design Template</h2>
                    <p>While PowerPoint offers a nice variety of design templates, it is also useful at times to create your own. A design template, once created, can be used over and over again. For instance, if your department wanted all presentations to include your company's logo in one corner, with its colors as the background, you could create designs templates with these features and reuse it again and again.</p>
                     <h2>Master Slides</h2>
                    <p>A master slide is one that is a part of every presentation that controls certain text characteristics such as font type, size, and color, as well as background color and style. Masters can affect all the slides in a presentation. There are masters that control the title slide, notes pages, and handout pages. When you apply a template to a presentation, you apply a new set of masters that control the presentation's look and format. There are four types of masters used in PowerPoint, as described below.</p>

                     <h2>Inserting Graphics</h2>
                    <p>One element you can add to every slide is a graphic of some sort. To add a graphic to one or all slides:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Display an individual slide or the Slide Master for all slides.</li>
                        <li>Choose Insert > Picture > From File.</li>
                        <li>Navigate to the folder that contains the picture that you wish to insert.</li>
                        <li>Select the picture file.</li>
                        <li>Click Insert.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>PowerPoint allows you to insert most popular graphic formats into your presentation.</p>
                     <h2>Adding Footers</h2>
                    <p>Footers serve many uses in PowerPoint presentations. You can use them to provide information like slide numbers, footer text, and date. All of the information goes at the bottom of each slide in your design template.</p>
                     <h3>Components of Footer</h3>
                    <p>A Footer in PowerPoint is text that you create once, but it appears on the bottom of each slide. It can consist of text, slide numbers, and a date. To add footer:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Display the Slide Master.</li>
                        <li>Choose View > Header and Footer.</li>
                        <li>In the Date and Time section, select the options that you want.</li>
                        <li>Check the Slide Number box to add a number to each slide.</li>
                        <li>Under the checked Footer check box, click in the text box and enter the footer text.</li>
                        <li>Click Apply To All.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h3>Formatting a Footer</h3>
                    <p>You can change the way footer looks at any time. On the Slide Master, select the placeholder that contains the information you want to change and format the text as you would any normal text. You can also drag the placeholder around if you wish to change its location.</p>
                     <h3>Modify the Slide Master Font</h3>
                    <p>PowerPoint allows you to change the way that the text in each individual part of your presentation looks. If you have a very long presentation, for example, but decide that you no longer like the font for each title, PowerPoint makes it easy to change the font for each title at once. To change the appearance of the Slide Master text:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>View the Slide Master.</li>
                        <li>Select the text you want to change.</li>
                        <li>Change the font to a different font.</li>
                        <li>Change the font size.</li>
                        <li>Apply a text effect, such as bold.</li>
                        <li>Return to Normal view.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h2>Some Tips for Effective Slide Shows</h2>
                    <p>Here are a few tips that will help your PowerPoint slide shows look professional and promote effective visual clues to help you get your points across:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Limit animation.</li>
                        <li>Stay with one slide transition.</li>
                        <li>Use sans-serif fonts.</li>
                        <li>No tiny font sizes; remember the folks in the back row.</li>
                        <li>Keep your slides simple and uncluttered</li>
                        <li>If you are presenting in a light room, use a light slide background.</li>
                        <li>If you are presenting in a dark room, use a dark slide background.</li>
                        <li>Make sure to use high-contrast text and slide backgrounds.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <h2>Automate simple tasks - Create a macro in PowerPoint</h2>
                    <p>The macro recorder, used to automate frequent tasks, is not available in Microsoft PowerPoint 2013 or PowerPoint 2016. Instead, you can use Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to create or edit macros. This includes editing those that were created in earlier versions of PowerPoint.</p>
                     <h3>To create or edit a macro by using Visual Basic for Applications, do the following:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>On the View tab, choose Macros.</li>
                        <li>In the Macro dialog box, type a name for the macro.</li>
                        <li>In the Macro in list, click the template or the presentation that you want to store the macro in.</li>
                        <li>In the Description box, type a description for the macro.</li>
                        <li>Click Create to open Visual Basic for Applications.</li>
