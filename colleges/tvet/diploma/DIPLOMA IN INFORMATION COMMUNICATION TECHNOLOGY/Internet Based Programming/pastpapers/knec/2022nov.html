                <ol>
                    <li><b>Reliability and Uptime:</b> The hosting company should guarantee a high uptime percentage (ideally 99.9% or higher) to ensure the website is consistently accessible to students and staff. Reliable hosting minimizes downtime and ensures continuous availability of online resources.</li>
                    <li><b>Security Measures:</b> The hosting provider must have robust security measures in place to protect the college's website and data from cyber threats. This includes firewalls, malware scanning, DDoS protection, and regular security updates. Security is paramount to safeguard sensitive college information.</li>
                    <li><b>Scalability and Performance:</b> The hosting solution should be scalable to accommodate future growth in website traffic and content. It should also offer sufficient bandwidth and server resources to ensure fast loading times and optimal website performance, even during peak usage periods.</li>

            <section class="question-answer sub-question">
                <h4>(i) Using the protocol https in the website address; (6 marks)</h4>
                <div class="answer-section">
                    <h4>Answer:</h4>
                    <p>[Sample Answer]</p>
                    <p><b>Reason:</b> Using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) encrypts all communication between the user's browser and the web server. This encryption protects sensitive information, such as login credentials, personal details, and financial transactions, from being intercepted by third parties. It ensures data confidentiality and integrity during transmission, building trust and security for website users.</p>

                    <h4>Answer:</h4>
                    <p>[Sample Answer]</p>
                    <p><b>Reason:</b> A Web Application Firewall (WAF) filters and monitors HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet. It helps protect web applications from common web attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). By analyzing and blocking malicious requests, a WAF enhances the security posture of the website and prevents potential data breaches and application vulnerabilities from being exploited.</p>

                    <h4>Answer:</h4>
                    <p>[Sample Answer]</p>
                    <p><b>Reason:</b> Daily testing, including security testing and functionality testing, helps to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities and issues in a website. Regular testing ensures that security measures remain effective, new vulnerabilities are promptly detected, and website functionality is continuously validated. This proactive approach minimizes the risk of security breaches, operational disruptions, and ensures the website remains secure and reliable over time.</p>

                <p>[Sample Answer]</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Scheme:</b> The scheme is the first part of a URL and specifies the protocol used to access the resource. It indicates how the browser should communicate with the server. Common schemes include 'http' (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for standard web pages, 'https' (HTTP Secure) for secure web pages, and 'ftp' (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfer. Example: In 'https://www.example.com', 'https' is the scheme.</li>
                    <li><b>Host:</b> The host, also known as the domain name, identifies the server where the resource is located. It typically follows the scheme and is the address of the web server. It's the part that a user usually types into the browser's address bar to reach a website. Example: In 'https://www.example.com', 'www.example.com' is the host.</li>

            <div class="answer-section">
                <h4>Answer:</h4>
                <p>[Sample Answer]</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>type:</b> The 'type' attribute specifies the type of numbering or lettering for the list items. Common values include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"1": (default) Numbers (1, 2, 3...)</li>
                            <li>"a": Lowercase letters (a, b, c...)</li>
                            <li>"A": Uppercase letters (A, B, C...)</li>
                            <li>"i": Lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii...)</li>
                            <li>"I": Uppercase Roman numerals (I, II, III...)</li>
                        </ul>
                        Example: <ol type="a">...</ol> will create a list with lowercase letters.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>start:</b> The 'start' attribute specifies the starting value of the list. By default, an ordered list starts numbering from 1. The 'start' attribute allows you to begin the numbering from a different number. Example: <ol start="5">...</ol> will start the list numbering from 5.</li>
                    <li><b>reversed:</b> The 'reversed' attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that the list should be ordered in reverse order (descending order). Example: <ol reversed>...</ol> will create a list numbered in reverse order (e.g., 3, 2, 1).</li>

                    <li><b>Accuracy and Credibility:</b> Website content must be accurate, factual, and reliable. The committee should ensure that information is well-researched, up-to-date, and free from errors. Credible content builds trust with users and enhances the company's reputation.</li>
                    <li><b>Relevance and Value:</b> The content should be relevant to the target audience and provide value to website visitors.

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Ensuring User Needs are Met:</b> Gathering user requirements helps to understand what users need and expect from the website. This ensures that the developed website is user-centric and effectively addresses the target audience's needs, leading to higher user satisfaction and engagement.</li>
                    <li><b>Defining Project Scope and Functionality:</b> User requirements define the scope of the project and the necessary functionalities of the website. This clarity helps developers to focus on building the right features and avoid scope creep, ensuring efficient resource allocation and project management.</li>
                    <li><b>Reducing Development Costs and Rework:</b> By understanding user needs upfront, developers can avoid building features that are not required or are poorly designed. This reduces the likelihood of costly rework and modifications later in the development process, saving time and resources.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Incorrect File Path or URL:</b> If the 'src' attribute in the <img> tag specifies an incorrect file path or URL to the image file, the browser will not be able to locate and load the image. This could be due to typos in the file name, incorrect directory structure, or a broken link to an external image source.</li>
                    <li><b>Image File Format Not Supported:</b> Web browsers support various image file formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP). If the image file is in a format not supported by the browser, or if the file is corrupted, the browser will fail to load and display the image.</li>
                    <li><b>Network Connectivity Issues:</b> If there are network connectivity problems, such as a slow internet connection or no internet access, the browser may not be able to download the image file from the server.

                <ol>
                    <li><b>action:</b> The 'action' attribute specifies the URL where the form data should be sent when the form is submitted. This URL is typically a server-side script or application that will process the form data. Example: <form action="/submit-form.php">...</form> will send the form data to "/submit-form.php" on the server.</li>
                    <li><b>method:</b> The 'method' attribute specifies the HTTP method used to submit the form data to the 'action' URL. Common values are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"get": Appends form data to the URL in the query string. Used for non-sensitive data and form submissions that should be bookmarkable.</li>

                    <p><b>disable:</b> When the 'disabled' attribute is applied to an option button (radio button or checkbox), it makes the button un-clickable and un-selectable by the user. A disabled option button is typically greyed out visually to indicate that it is inactive.  It also prevents the value of the disabled option button from being submitted with the form data. Example: <input type="radio" name="option" value="value1" disabled>Option 1</p>

                    <p>[Sample Answer]</p>
                    <p><b>label:</b> The 'label' attribute is not directly used with option buttons (radio buttons or checkboxes). Instead, the <label> tag is used to associate a text label with an input element, including option buttons. While there is no 'label' attribute for <input type="radio"> or <input type="checkbox">, the <label> tag itself is crucial for accessibility and user experience. It provides a clickable area for the option button's label, making it easier for users to select the option, especially on touch devices. It also improves accessibility for users with screen readers. To associate a label with an option button, you use the 'for' attribute in the <label> tag and the 'id' attribute in the <input> tag. Example: <input type="radio" id="option1" name="option" value="value1"><label for="option1">Option 1</label></p>

                    <li><b>Data Appended to URL:</b> In a GET request, form data is appended to the URL in the query string. This means the data is visible in the browser's address bar.</li>
                    <li><b>Limited Data Size:</b> GET requests have limitations on the amount of data that can be sent, as URLs have a maximum length. This makes GET unsuitable for sending large amounts of form data.</li>
                    <li><b>Bookmarkable and Shareable:</b> Because the data is part of the URL, GET requests are bookmarkable and shareable. The same request can be repeated by simply accessing the bookmarked or shared URL.</li>
                    <li><b>Non-Sensitive Data:</b> GET requests are generally used for non-sensitive data because the data is visible in the URL and may be stored in browser history and server logs. It is not recommended for transmitting sensitive information like passwords or personal details.</li>

            <h3>7. (b) The load time is the time it takes to download and display the entire content of a web page. Explain three considerations that a web developer should consider to improve the load time. (6 marks)</h3>
            <div class="answer-section">
                <h4>Answer:</h4>
                <p>[Sample Answer]</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Optimize Images:</b> Large image files significantly increase page load time. Developers should optimize images by:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Compression:</b> Use image compression techniques to reduce file size without significant loss of quality.</li>
                            <li><b>Appropriate Format:</b> Choose the right image format (e.g., WebP, JPEG, PNG) based on the image type and requirements.</li>
                            <li><b>Responsive Images:</b> Serve appropriately sized images for different devices and screen sizes using responsive image techniques (<picture> or srcset attribute).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Minimize HTTP Requests:</b> Each resource (images, stylesheets, scripts) on a webpage requires an HTTP request. Reducing the number of requests can significantly improve load time. Strategies include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>CSS Sprites:</b> Combine multiple small images into a single image sprite and use CSS to display individual parts.</li>
                            <li><b>Combine Files:</b> Concatenate CSS and JavaScript files to reduce the number of files to download.</li>
                            <li><b>Inline Critical Resources:</b> Inline critical CSS and JavaScript directly into the HTML to avoid extra requests for initial rendering.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Leverage Browser Caching:</b> Browser caching allows browsers to store static resources locally and reuse them on subsequent visits, reducing server load and improving load time. Developers should:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Set Proper Cache Headers:</b> Configure server-side cache headers (e.g., Cache-Control, Expires) to instruct browsers on how long to cache resources.</li>
                            <li><b>Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN):</b> CDNs distribute website content across multiple servers geographically closer to users, improving content delivery speed and leveraging browser caching effectively.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><b>click:</b> The 'click' event is triggered when a user presses and releases the mouse button over an element. It is one of the most fundamental mouse events and is commonly used to trigger actions like button clicks, link activation, and interaction with interactive elements.</li>
                    <li><b>mouseover:</b> The 'mouseover' event is triggered when the mouse pointer is moved onto an element. It's often used to create hover effects, display tooltips, or dynamically change element styles when the mouse cursor is over them.</li>

                    <p><b>Type of testing:</b> Link Testing (or Broken Link Testing).</p>
                    <p><b>Reason:</b> Orphan pages are pages on a website that are not linked to from any other pages within the same website. Checking for orphan pages is a part of link testing because it involves verifying the integrity of links within the website's structure. Orphan pages can be considered broken links from a site navigation perspective as they are not reachable through the website's internal linking structure. Identifying and addressing orphan pages improves website navigation, SEO, and overall website quality by ensuring all pages are properly connected and accessible to users and search engines.</p>

                    <p><b>Type of testing:</b> Security Testing (specifically, Authorization/Access Control Testing).</p>
                    <p><b>Reason:</b> This scenario focuses on verifying the security of web directories and files by ensuring that they are not publicly accessible without proper authorization. This falls under security testing, specifically authorization or access control testing, because it aims to confirm that access restrictions are correctly implemented. The objective is to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive directories and files, ensuring that they are only accessible through intended channels, such as a controlled download option. This type of testing helps to protect sensitive data and prevent security vulnerabilities related to unauthorized file access.</p>

                    <p><b>Type of testing:</b> Compatibility Testing (or Cross-Browser/Cross-Device Testing).</p>
                    <p><b>Reason:</b> This type of testing is conducted to ensure that a website functions correctly and consistently across different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (e.g., desktops, tablets, smartphones) that users might use to access the site. The aim is to identify and resolve any compatibility issues that may arise due to differences in browser rendering engines, device capabilities, and screen sizes. Ensuring cross-browser and cross-device compatibility provides a consistent and optimal user experience for all visitors, regardless of their browser or device.</p>

                <h4>Answer:</h4>
                <p>[Sample Answer]</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>parseInt():</b> The 'parseInt()' function parses a string and returns an integer. It converts the string to an integer up to the point where it encounters a character that is not a digit. It can also take a second argument to specify the radix (base) of the number. Example: 'parseInt("123")' returns 123, 'parseInt("123.45")' returns 123, 'parseInt("10", 2)' returns 2 (binary to decimal).</li>
                    <li><b>parseFloat():</b> The 'parseFloat()' function parses a string and returns a floating-point number. It converts the string to a floating-point number up to the point where it encounters a character that is not a digit or a decimal point. Example: 'parseFloat("123.45")' returns 123.45, 'parseFloat("123")' returns 123, 'parseFloat("3.14e2")' returns 314.</li>
                    <li><b>Number():</b> The 'Number()' constructor attempts to convert a string to a number. It can handle both integers and floating-point numbers. If the string cannot be converted to a number, it returns 'NaN' (Not-a-Number). Example: 'Number("123")' returns 123, 'Number("123.45")' returns 123.45, 'Number("abc")' returns NaN.</li>

                <p>[Sample Answer]</p>
                <pre><code><p id="triangleArea"></p>

<script>
    function calculateTriangleArea(base, height) {
        return 0.5 * base * height;
    }

    var baseLength = 400;

    document.getElementById("triangleArea").textContent = "The area of the triangle is ... " + area;
</script>
</code></pre>
                <p><b>Explanation:</b> This code first defines a paragraph element with the id "triangleArea" where the result will be displayed. Then, it includes a JavaScript section with a function 'calculateTriangleArea' that takes base and height as arguments and returns the area of a triangle. It then sets the 'baseLength' to 400 and 'triangleHeight' to 100, calls the function to calculate the area, and finally updates the text content of the paragraph element with the calculated area, displaying "The area of the triangle is ... [area value]" on the webpage.</p>
