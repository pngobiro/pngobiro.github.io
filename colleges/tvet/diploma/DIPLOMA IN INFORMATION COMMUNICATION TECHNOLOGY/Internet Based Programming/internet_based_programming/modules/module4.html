        <h2>üìö T4.1) Description of web design tool</h2>
        <p>Web design is the process of creating websites. It encompasses several different aspects, including webpage layout, content production, and graphic design. While the terms web design and web development are often used interchangeably, web design is technically a subset of the broader category of web development.</p>
        <p>Websites are created using a markup language called HTML. Web designers build webpages using HTML tags that define the content and metadata of each page. The layout and appearance of the elements within a webpage are typically defined using CSS, or cascading style sheets. Therefore, most websites include a combination of HTML and CSS that defines how each page will appear in a browser.</p>

        <h3>Tools of web-design</h3>
        <p>Some web designers prefer to hand code pages (typing HTML and CSS from scratch), while others use a "WYSIWYG" editor like Adobe Dreamweaver. This type of editor provides a visual interface for designing the webpage layout and the software automatically generates the corresponding HTML and CSS code.</p>
        <p>Another popular way to design websites is with a content management system like WordPress or Joomla. These services provide different website templates that can be used as a starting point for a new website. Webmasters can then add content and customize the layout using a web-based interface.</p>
        <p>While HTML and CSS are used to design the look and feel of a website, images must be created separately. Therefore, graphic design may overlap with web design, since graphic designers often create images for use on the Web. Some graphics programs like Adobe Photoshop even include a "Save for Web‚Ä¶" option that provides an easy way to export images in a format optimized for web publishing.</p>

        <h2>üìö T4.2) Features of web design tools</h2>
        <h3>Basic Features of Web Design Tools</h3>
        <p>A perfect web design tool should incorporate most and preferably all the features listed below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Freedom to create.</b> I need a tool where I don't feel crippled, where I can realize my own vision. Templates are great, but I also need to tweak and change things the way I want.</li>
          <li><b>Responsive design for any screen.</b> Phones, tablets, watches, 4K monitors - screens are becoming more fragmented every day. Many tools seem to ignore this completely, others do it very hard to use.</li>
          <li><b>SEO support.</b> Very important, and needs to be updated as best practices change. E.g. keywords are no longer relevant to Google.</li>
          <li><b>Rich content.</b> Video, animations, interactive widgets. The web is an interactive medium and should be treated as such.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Details of Features of Web Design Tools</h3>
        <h4>Feature #1: Views</h4>
        <p>Most web authoring software provides multiple views of the web page you're working on.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Standard, normal, or design view</b> - This is typically the default view, which is a blank screen on which you type, paste, or insert content. This is very similar to a word processor screen.</li>
          <li><b>Code view</b> - Allows you to view and work directly with the HTML code.</li>
          <li><b>Split</b> - Both of the above views are displayed simultenously in separate windows.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Examples from common applications</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In Macromedia Dreamweaver, you can switch between views using the View menu.</li>
          <li>In Microsoft FrontPage, you can switch between views using tabs that appear in the lower left corner of the application window.</li>
          <li>In Netscape Composer, you can switch between views using either of the above methods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Activity</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Find how to switch between views in your web authoring software. Does the software provide more than one way to do this? Try typing something on the screen in Normal or Design View, then switch to Code View to see the HTML that was generated by the web authoring tool.</li>
          <li>Ask your instructor for instructions on how to open and save files with your web authoring software in your school's computing environment.</li>
          <li>Now open your portfolio file unit6.htm in your web authoring software. At this point the page should have a banner, a navigation menu, and a pair of W3C icons. Practice switching between views and exploring your page using your web authoring tool.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Feature #2: Creating Headings and SubHeadings</h4>
        <p>In Normal or Design View, Web authoring software is very similar to word processing software. One or more toolbars appear across the top of the application window. A text formatting toolbar typically includes buttons for bolding and italicizing text, and probably additionally includes some means of identifying a heading or subheading.</p>

        <h4>Examples from common applications</h4>
        <h4>Example #1</h4>
        <p>The following is a sample toolbar from Macromedia Dreamweaver. To create an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading in Dreamweaver, simply select the button labeled h1, type your heading text, then press Enter.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-toolbar-macromedia-dreamweaver.png" alt="Macromedia Dreamweaver Toolbar Sample" style="width:600px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>

        <h4>Example #2</h4>
        <p>The following is a sample toolbar from Microsoft FrontPage. To create an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading in FrontPage, use the dropdown menu to select Heading 1, type your heading text, then press Enter.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-toolbar-microsoft-frontpage.png" alt="Microsoft FrontPage Toolbar Sample" style="width:600px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>

        <h4>Activity</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a main heading "Unit 6: Web Authoring Software" to your web page, just beneath the menu. Since you already know how to do this with source code, try doing it using the graphic view, then check your source code to see what code was inserted by the software.</li>
          <li>Now add a subheading "My Web Authoring Software" beneath this.</li>
          <li>As in previous lessons, add a named anchor to this heading with name="software". In some web authoring tools, this feature may be called a bookmark. See if you can figure out how to add it using your software's menu system or graphic interface.</li>
          <li>Beneath this subheading, write a short paragraph identifying what web authoring software you're using, including the version number.</li>
          <li>After you've added this content to your web page, switch to Code View to see the HTML that was generated by the web authoring tool. Does it differ at all from the HTML you would have used if you were coding this page manually?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Feature #3: Inserting Links</h4>
        <p>In many web authoring software products, you add a link to a document by selecting <b>Insert</b> from the menu, then <b>Link</b> or <b>Hyperlink</b>. A dialog box will appear, prompting you for the link text that you want to display, the destination of the link, and possibly other information. Most web authoring software tools additionally provide a button or icon that allows you to quickly insert a link.</p>

        <h4>Activity</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Explore your software, and find out how many ways there are to add a link to your web page.</li>
          <li>Create a new section in your web page with subheading "List of Links", and a named anchor "links"</li>
          <li>In this new section, use your software's graphic interface to add an unordered list of links to a few of your favorite websites.</li>
          <li>Now switch to Code View to see the HTML that was generated by the web authoring tool.</li>
          <li>Open your portfolio home page (index.htm) in your web authoring software. See if you can figure out how to link to a specific named anchor within a document. In the appropriate places on your home page, convert items to links to the new sections in your Unit 6 document.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Feature #4: Inserting Images</h4>
        <p>In many web authoring software products, you add an image to a document by selecting <b>Insert</b> from the menu, then <b>Image</b> or <b>Picture</b>. A dialog box will appear, prompting you for the location of the image. After you have inserted the image into your webpage, you can edit its attributes in a Properties dialog box or panel. For example, you can change the image's height and width, put a border around it, make it into a link, and add alternate text for users who can't see the image. Image Properties are typically accessed by right clicking on the image and selecting Properties from the popup menu (if you are a Mac user, you can achieve the same result by pressing CTRL and clicking on the image to see the popup menu).</p>

        <h4>Examples from common applications</h4>
        <p>The following is the Picture Properties dialog from Microsoft FrontPage:</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-picture-properties-dialog-frontpage.png" alt="Picture Properties Dialog from Microsoft FrontPage" style="width:600px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>

        <h4>Activity</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Explore your software, and find out how to insert a picture.</li>
          <li>Create a new section in your web page with heading "Inserting an Image" and named anchor "image".</li>
          <li>In the new section, insert the 3D Box image that you created in the lesson on Basic Image Manipulation.</li>
          <li>Explore the various options that are available for image properties. Try chang some of these properties to see what happens. Be sure to add alternate text to the image for the benefit of those who can't see it.</li>
          <li>After changing image properties, switch to Code View to see the HTML that was generated by your changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>üìö T4.3) Web authoring protocols</h2>
        <p>The Internet relies on a number of <b>protocols</b> in order to function properly. A protocol is simply a standard for enabling the connection, communication, and data transfer between two places on a network. Here are some of the key protocols that are used for transferring data across the Internet from website to users.</p>

        <h4>HTTP</h4>
        <p><b>HTTP</b> stands for <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</b>. It is the standard protocol for transferring web pages (and their content) across the Internet.</p>
        <p>When you browse a web page, the URL might be preceded by <code>http://</code>. This is telling the web browser to use HTTP to transfer the data. Most browsers will default to HTTP if you don't specify it. You can test this by typing in say... <a href="http://www.quackit.com">www.quackit.com</a> (instead of <a href="http://www.quackit.com">http://www.quackit.com</a>).</p>

        <h4>HTTPS</h4>
        <p><b>HTTPS</b> stands for <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer</b>. Think of it as a secure version of HTTP. HTTPS is used primarily on web pages that ask you to provide personal or sensitive information (such as a password or your credit card details).</p>
        <p>When you browse a web page using HTTPS, you are using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). For a website to use HTTPS it needs to have an SSL certificate installed on the server. These are usually issued by a trusted 3rd party, referred to as a Certificate Authority (CA).</p>
        <p>When you browse a web page using HTTPS, you can check the details of the SSL certificate. For example, you could check the validity of it. You could also check that the website does actually belong to the organization you think it does. You can usually do this by double clicking on the browser's padlock icon. The padlock icon only appears when you view a secure site.</p>
        <p>Here's an example of Firefox's padlock icon from Firefox's address bar:</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-rollover-animation.png" alt="Firefox's Padlock Icon" style="width:200px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>
        <p>Firefox also displays a padlock at the bottom right of the browser window, along with the common name of the organization that the certificate was issued to:</p>

        <h4>FTP</h4>
        <p><b>FTP</b> stands for <b>File Transfer Protocol</b>. It is used to transfer files across the Internet. FTP is commonly used by web developers to publish updates to a website (i.e. to upload a new version of the website).</p>
        <p>Where HTTP is used for displaying the file in your browser, FTP is used simply to transfer the file from one computer to a specified location on another computer. You can use FTP to transfer the files from your computer to a remote computer (such as a web server), or to transfer from the remote computer to your local computer.</p>

        <h4>Internet Protocol Address (IP Address):</h4>
        <p>A numeric code that uniquely identifies a particular computer on the Internet. 127.0.0.1 is an example of an IP address. The browser uses IP addresses to find websites on the Internet.</p>

        <h2>üìö T4.4) Characteristics of a good web design</h2>
        <p>Despite the innumerable variables, there are specific and telling features/characteristics of impeccably built websites, no matter the kind of business or industry, which any company can use a barometer to measure against. Below are some of the most important features/ characteristics of well-built web design of which to take note. These features are absolutely necessary for every website in order to deliver the exceptional results that site visitors and owners expect.</p>

        <h4>1. Quality Web Content.</h4>
        <p>There8s one primary reason people use search engines and browse websites, and that is to search for information. People desire information every day, and want if delivered in a fast and reliable fashion. Whether to entertain, entice or educate, superior content is a must in every frequently visited website, especially if search engine optimization is part of the website's overarching marketing strategy.</p>
        <p>For business websites, content should include important information and come in the forms that are pertinent to the business. Retail sites for example, need high quality pictures of their products, while consulting firms are more apt to highlight client testimonials. A best practice for most search engine optimization gurus is also ensuring the most relevant content is prominent on the webpages.</p>

        <h4>2. Clear, User-friendly Navigation.</h4>
        <p>A stellar web design must contain a user-friendly navigation scheme that allows visitors to quickly find the information needed. Important links must be easy to find and given logical, simple, and include easy-to-understand labels. Calls to action are placed in conspicuous spots within the navigation8s scheme. If there is a plethora of content, then a search box is suggested to make it faster to reach more specific pages within a website.</p>

        <h4>3. Simple and Professional Web Design.</h4>
        <p>Bells and whistles may seem nice in concept, but they rarely add much value to an effectively constructed and sensible web design. Typically, the websites best at effectively converting site visitors into buying customers, maintain an attractive layout, but keep it clean and simple. Google is an excellent example of such a site. Actually, users found Google8s initial design over simplified during the initial testing phases. Thus in order to keep a simple interface, but prevent the appearance of site constructed without much thought, Google added the 7I8m Feeling Lucky8 button underneath the search box. Despite the fact that hardly anyone clicks on this button, its addition balances the layout in such a way that delivers a better user experience.</p>
        <p>To keep websites simple, without making them look bland such as in Google8s case, a balanced distribution of content and graphics is required and the use of slightly contrasting colours and clear fonts is key. Colours that are scream, are overtly contrasting, and font sizes that are difficult to read will put a strain on visitors8 eyes. Also, one should break up sizeable blocks of text with either spacing or images as appropriate.</p>

        <h4>4. Webpage Speed.</h4>
        <p>People inherently lose patience quickly, and that holds true when visiting a website. The longer a website takes to load, the more likely a person will leave before it fully renders. Beautiful graphics and substantial content become useless if a site8s speed hampers its ability to deliver content quickly.</p>
        <p>Several factors affect site speed, including server speed, the number of graphics, website traffic, etc. A web design company must make sure to minimize all controllable factors slowing down site speed by using reliable site hosting, proper website code, and optimized graphics.</p>

        <h4>5. Search Engine Optimization.</h4>
        <p>A well-designed website generally will receive many visitors, and one method to attract visitors is search engine optimization. This entails the insertion of search keywords in website content, an appropriate link profile, social media signals, and over 200 other factors.</p>

        <h4>6. Web Compatibility.</h4>
        <p>The variety of browser and platforms which one can now be view web design can present a challenge to developers, but talented ones are accustomed to handling such factors. A site should easily render on various resolutions, screen sizes, and browsers; and with the increasing popularity of mobile devices, websites should function properly on the plethora of these types of devices.</p>
        <p>When it comes to web design, remember that not all that glitters is gold. Know what truly makes a well-built site and you8ll soon find your website quickly on its way to attracting and retaining customers</p>

        <h2>üìö T4.5) Description of authoring tools</h2>
        <p>Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications,</p>
        <p>A <b>platform</b> is the underlying programming language that the site will utilize. The most popular development platforms are HTML, PHP, .NET, and JSP.</p>
        <p><b>Dream weaver</b> is one of the applications that help manage webpages developed in the above platforms‚Ä¶ and so are synonymously regarded as web platforms too though are only web development tools</p>

        <h3>Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver</h3>
        <h4>What is Dreamweaver?</h4>
        <p>Dreamweaver helps you to create web pages while it codes html (and more) for you. It is located on the bottom tray  or in the start menu, under Macromedia.</p>

        <h4>Manage a website in Dreamweaver</h4>
        <p><b>Before you begin</b>: <b>Webspace</b>: your webpage must be on your webspace to be accessible from the internet. store all components of the website in one folder. It is recommended that you create a separate 5images6 folder within the main one to keep track of your images. The main folder must be on your webspace. <b>Planning</b>: it helps if you know how you want your webpage to look <b>before</b> using Dreamweaver. Think about colors, uniformity among pages and organization of links and topics.</p>

        <h4>Creating a new page:</h4>
        <p>Under 5File6, select 5New6. Make sure it is set on 5Basic Page6 and 5HTML6.</p>

        <h4>The Dreamweaver Windows</h4>
        <p>The <b>Document window</b> displays the current, editable page.</p>
        <p>The <b>Site Panel</b> allows you to easily access, view and manage the files and folders that make up your site. This is <b>optional</b>, but useful.</p>
        <p>From the top menu, select <b>Site</b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b>New Site</b><b>ÔÉÜ</b>click the 5<b>Advanced</b>6 tab. Fill in the <b>Site Name</b> (5bob8s site6), the <b>Local Root Folder</b> (the folder where all pages of your website are contained), and the <b>http address</b> (the exact online location of your site‚Äî <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~bob/main_folder_name">http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~bob/main_folder_name</a>).</p>
        <p>The two commonly used tool bars are the <b>Insert bar</b> and the <b>Properties inspector</b>. If they are not visible on your screen, pull down these options under <b>Windows</b> (<b>Insert</b> and <b>Properties</b>) at the top, or press F4 on your keyboard.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-dreamweaver-windows.png" alt="Dreamweaver Windows Interface" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>

        <h4>The Property Inspector</h4>
        <p>The <b>Property Inspector</b> allows you to view and change properties of selected objects or texts.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-property-inspector.png" alt="Dreamweaver Property Inspector" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>

        <h4>The Insert Bar</h4>
        <p>The <b>Insert bar</b> contains buttons for inserting various types of objects, e.g. images, tables and text into your page.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-insert-bar.png" alt="Dreamweaver Insert Bar" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>

        <h4>The Document toolbar</h4>
        <p>The <b>Document toolbar</b> contains buttons and pop -up menus that provide different views of the Document window (e.g. Design view, Code view) and gives you access to references and a preview of your page in the browser of your choice. If the document toolbar is not already visible, go to <b>View</b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b> Toolbars</b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b> Document</b> in the top menu.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-document-toolbar.png" alt="Dreamweaver Document Toolbar" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>
        <p>To preview your page in a browser click on the <b>Browser Preview</b> on the Document toolbar or choose <b>File </b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b> Preview in Browser</b>. You must save the page first to see changes.</p>

        <h4>Page Title and Page Properties</h4>
        <h4>Page Title:</h4>
        <p>It is important to title new web pages. A good habit to adopt is to title your page before you do anything else. The page title appears in the top title bar of the browser window and if bookmarked, the title of the bookmark. Without a title, 5Untitled document6 will appear. You can yype in the page title in the Title box located in the Document toolbar.</p>

        <h4>Page Properties</h4>
        <p>The default appearance of text, background color, page margins, color of links, and other properties can be changed in the <b>Page Properties</b> window. Go to <b>Modify </b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b>Page Properties</b> or press <b>Control + J</b> on your keyboard to open the Page Properties dialog box. It is important to establish defaults on text as different browsers may have different defaults.</p>

        </figure>

        <h4>Creating Basic Web Page Elements</h4>
        <p>Dreamweaver's basic authoring functions are quite straightforward though manipulating the properties of basic elements, such as tables and images, may be a little less obvious.</p>

        <h4>Creating Basic Web Page - Text</h4>
        <p>In this section, to cover the basic functions, we will create a simple personal home page with the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text</li>
          <li>Table</li>
          <li>Image</li>
          <li>Hyperlink</li>
          <li>Mailto: link</li>
          <li>Background color</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
          ‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Note</b>: <b>SAVE YOUR PAGE NOW</b>. Saving a page before inserting elements helps avoid prompts for defining full web sites and will help keep the code references calling for links and images relative to the document.
        </div>

        <h4>Backgrounds:</h4>
        <p>You can set your background color here. It is important to consider readability4good contrast between the text and background color. Neons are bad!</p>
        <p>If you have an image to use as background on your page, select 7Browse8 and click on the image you want to use as your background. The image will tile (repeat the image) over the entire page.</p>

        <h4>Working with Text - Text - Inserting</h4>
        <p>As with most web authoring programs, the essential method of inserting text with Dreamweaver is this</p>
        <p>To insert text:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Click somewhere on the page.</li>
          <li>Type.</li>
          <li>When finished, stop typing.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can also copy and paste from most any other text-based document but the result is a pretty boring chunk-o-text. Text must be formatted to achieve a more interesting look and easy-to-read layout.</p>

        <h4>Text - Formatting</h4>
        <p>Text formatting (e.g., size, typeface, color, etc.) can be accomplished in a number of ways. More sophisticated web sites will use Style Sheets for much of this. Style Sheets are a set of commands that control the look and layout of web pages. Depending on how they are used, they can be applied to multiple pages or a portion of a single page. Though Style Sheets are beyond the scope of this introductory document, they are becoming standard and are worth learning as your skills and interest progress.</p>
        <p>The most common way to format text in simple web pages is to apply formatting commands to individual words, phrases or lines of text. This is done by selecting the text and using the Properties palette to make changes.</p>
        <p>To format text:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Drag the mouse across the desired text to select it.</li>
          <li>Use the Properties Palette to change the text appearance. If you are formatting text in a table cell, the Properties palette will show text commands on the upper half of the palette and table/cell commands in the lower half.</li>
        </ol>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-properties-palette-text.png" alt="Dreamweaver Properties Palette Text Formatting" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>

        <h4>Key to formatting commands on the Properties palette:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Paragraph/Heading.</b> If you are formatting a line of text that is essentially a headline introducing a section of the document, choose one of the Heading sizes from the drop menu. The appearance will be similar to choosing a text size, but headings provide structural markup to the document-- which browsers for disabled users depend on.</li>
          <li><b>Font style.</b> "Default" applies no style and leaves the appearance up to the browser when the page is displayed. Because the success of declaring a font style requires that other people's computers have that font installed, the five main choices on this list are pretty safe for most browsers. Each of the five selections has a 2nd and 3rd choice that will be applied if the preferred font is unavailable.</li>
          <li><b>Text color.</b> Type a 6-digit hex code into the text field or click on the small down arrow near the upper left to reveal a color palette. The mouse pointer becomes an "eyedropper" that can choose a color from the color palette or can be pointed at an element (text, image, etc.) on the web page to duplicate its color.</li>
          <li><b>Bold and Italics.</b> Functions like most word processors. Choose one or both to apply that style to selected text.</li>
          <li><b>Alignment.</b> Selected text can be left-justified, centered or right justified.</li>
          <li><b>Bullets and numbers.</b> Select multiple lines of text then click one of these to make the list bulleted or numbered. To add to the list later, place the cursor at the end of a line and press the Enter key. Note that if you wish to format numbers and bullets, you may do so by going to the Text Menu and clicking on "List."</li>
          <li><b>Indent/Outdent.</b> Selected text will be moved left or right.</li>
          <li><b>Text size.</b> Drop menu of relative text sizes.</li>
          <li><b>Alignment within a cell.</b> Click in the desired cell and use the Horizontal and Vertical Alignment drop menus on the Properties panel to set how everything in the cell aligns. Commonly, text will be aligned 7top8 and 7left.8</li>
          <li>(You can also drag the mouse from one corner cell to the opposite corner, selecting all cells, and THEN set the alignments for all the cells at the same time.</li>
        </ul>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-properties-palette-alignment.png" alt="Dreamweaver Properties Palette Alignment Options" style="width:200px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>

        <h4>Continuing our little exercise...</h4>
        <h4>Suggested formatting for the Home Page header text.</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Select "John Smith, PhD." by dragging the mouse across the text.</li>
          <li>Click on the Size drop menu on the Properties palette and choose "+2"</li>
          <li>Click on the Color palette and use the eyedropper to choose a color</li>
          <li>Click on the Bold button on the Properties palette</li>
        </ol>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-properties-palette-text.png" alt="Dreamweaver Properties Palette Text Formatting" style="width:200px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>
        <p>The selected text should now be a little larger, bolder, and have a different color than the rest of the text in the cell.</p>

        <h4>Tables</h4>
        <p>Tables are great for organizing and giving structure to the page.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Place cursor where you want the table.</li>
          <li>Choose the Table icon on the Insert bar or at the top choose <b>Insert</b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b>Table</b>.</li>
          <li>Specify the number of columns and rows.</li>
        </ol>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-table-dialog.png" alt="Dreamweaver Table Dialog Box" style="width:500px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>
        <p><b>Cell Padding</b> 3 specifies the amount of spacing between the content and the cell edge (wall) <b>Cell Spacing</b> 3 specifies the amount of spacing between each table cell, not including the border</p>
        <p><b>Table Width</b> 3 specifies the width of the table in pixels or as a percentage of the browser window. For precise layout of text and images, it is recommended that you specify tables in pixels.</p>
        <p><b>Nested tables</b>: When creating nested tables, i.e. table(s) within table(s), designate specific pixels on the outside table. 700 is one standard. Another option is to the outside table at 100%.</p>
        <p>For tables inside main table percentages are generally used rather than pixels.</p>
        <p><b>Border thickness</b>: specifies the width of the table border. A border of 506 means the lines will appear invisible.</p>
        <p><b>Background Color of Table, Cell or Border</b>:</p>
        <p>Select the entire table or a cell and click the Background color or Border button in the Property Inspector.</p>

         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-properties-inspector-table.png" alt="Dreamweaver Properties Inspector Table Options" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>
        <p><b>Split/Merge Cells</b>: You can split (divide the selected cell) or merge (unify selected cells) by selecting the appropriate cell(s) and clicking either the split or merge icon in the properties inspector.</p>

        <h4>Inserting Images</h4>
        <p>It is recommended that your image be the size you want it to appear on your Web page, rather than enlarging or shrinking the image in your HTML editor. You should set the image resolution to 72 dpi (close to standard computer display resolution) to hold down image file size. Photoshop can help you do this (use the 5Save Images for the Web6 option).</p>
        <p>To insert an image:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Place the cursor where you want the image to appear on the page and then click the <img src="../assets/images/module4-insert-image-icon.png" alt="Image Icon" style="width:20px; vertical-align: middle;"> Image icon on the Insert bar, or go to <b>Insert </b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b> Image</b> on the top menu.</li>
          <li>In the dialog box that appears, click Browse to choose a file. It must be in your website folder.</li>
          <li>Click 8OK9</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Inserting Rollovers page animation</h4>
        <p>A rollover is an image that changes when the mouse cursor moves across it. A rollover consists of two images: the primary image (the image displayed when the page first loads) and the rollover image (the image that appears when the cursor rolls over the primary image).</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-rollover-animation.png" alt="Rollover Animation Example" style="width:200px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>
        <p>To create a rollover:</p>
        <p>It is essential that both images are exactly the same size or the images will not appear correctly. You can do this in a drawing program.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In Dreamweaver, place the cursor in the Document window where you want the rollover to appear.</li>
          <li>On the Insert bar, click the <img src="../assets/images/module4-insert-rollover-image.png" alt="Rollover Image Icon" style="width:20px; vertical-align: middle;"> Rollover icon or go to <b>Insert </b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b> Image Objects </b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b> Rollover Image</b>.</li>
          <li>The <b>Insert Rollover Image</b> dialog box will appear. Browse to select an image file for the original and rollover image.</li>
        </ul>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-insert-rollover-image-dialog.png" alt="Insert Rollover Image Dialog Box" style="width:500px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure the <b>Preload Rollover Image</b> option is checked so that the rollover image loads when the page opens in a browser. This ensures a quick transition between the images.</li>
          <li>To create link, in the 7When clicked go to URL8 box, browse to select a file.</li>
          <li>Click OK.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Creating Links and Email Links - Creating Links</h4>
        <p>Links are used to navigate between pages in your site and to introduce material from other web sites.</p>
        <p>To create a link</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Highlight text or an image in the Document window.</li>
          <li>To link to a document inside your site, click the folder icon to the right of the <img src="../assets/images/module4-link-icon.png" alt="Link Icon" style="width:20px; vertical-align: middle;"> Link field to browse and select a file. The path to the linked document appears in the URL field.</li>
          <li>To link to a document outside your site, enter an absolute path including the <code>http://</code> (i.e., for a link to NASA, the absolute path is <a href="http://www.nasa.gov">http://www.nasa.gov</a>)</li>
        </ul>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-properties-inspector-link.png" alt="Dreamweaver Properties Inspector Link Options" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>

        <h4>Creating Email Links</h4>
        <p>An email link opens a new message window (using the mail program associated with the user's browser) when clicked. In the email message window, the To: field is automatically filled with the address specified in the email link.</p>
        <p>To create an email link:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the Document window, position the insertion point where you want the email link to appear, or select the text you want to appear as the email link.</li>
          <li>On the Insert bar, select the <img src="../assets/images/module4-email-icon.png" alt="Email Icon" style="width:20px; vertical-align: middle;"> Email icon (looks like an addressed envelope). Or you can go to <b>Insert </b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b> Email Link</b> in the top menu.</li>
          <li>In the <b>Text</b> field of the <b>Email Link</b> dialog box, type or edit the text to appear in the document as an email link.</li>
          <li>In the <b>Email</b> field, type the email address that will appear in the To: field.</li>
          <li>Click OK.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Inserting a Last Updated Date</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Place cursor where you want the date inserted.</li>
          <li>From the Insert bar, select the <img src="../assets/images/module4-date-icon.png" alt="Date Icon" style="width:20px; vertical-align: middle;"> Date icon.</li>
          <li>A dialogue box will appear, choose the day, date and time format you desire. Check the box for "update automatically on save" to have the date change whenever you save the web page file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Inserting Anchors</h4>
        <p>Anchors mark specific positions in a page(s). Use named anchors to jump to a marked position in the current document or to link to a marked position in a different document.</p>
        <p>To create a named anchor:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the Document window, place the cursor where you want the named anchor.</li>
          <li>Click on the <img src="../assets/images/module4-named-anchor-icon.png" alt="Named Anchor Icon" style="width:20px; vertical-align: middle;"> Named Anchor icon on the Insert bar or go to <b>Insert </b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b> Named Anchor</b> from the top menu.</li>
          <li>Enter a name (no spaces) for the anchor in the dialog box that appears. (If the anchor marker doesn't appear at the cursor location, choose <b>View </b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b> Visual Aids</b><b>ÔÉÜ</b><b>Invisible Elements</b>.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To link to a named anchor:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Select text or an image in the Document window.</li>
          <li>In the Property inspector, enter a pound sign (#) and the name of the anchor in the Link box. For example to link to an anchor named "two" in the current file, type #two.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To link to an anchor named "two" in a different file in the same folder, type filename.html#two.</p>

        <h4>Saving</h4>
        <p>It is good practice to save web pages without capitals, spaces, or funny characters. This will ensure that the page will appear on all browsers, as well as make it easier to type in the address correctly.</p>
        <p>The homepage of your website should be saved as 5index6. This means that instead of getting a file directory (where everyone can see ALL the files in your folder) your homepage automatically loads. In any folder, the file named 5index6 is the homepage.</p>
        <p>You can tell if a page hasn8t been saved or not if the tag selector has an asterisk. 5index.html6*</p>
        <p>A quick and dirty way to use a page as a template is to either create a copy with a different name or copy and paste the code.</p>

        <h4>Working with Layers</h4>
        <p>We're going to a look at some of the characteristics of layers, and then work with them and apply some behaviors to them.</p>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Layers are squares that can be placed wherever you want in the Page, we can insert HTML content in them. Those layers can be hidden and overlapped between them. This gives you a great variety to design.</p>
        <p>Layers can be moved from their positions by just clicking on the the white square in its lerft top corner, and whilst keeping the mouse pressed, dragging it to the new position.</p>
        <p>They can also can be resized by clicking on the black squares and dragging them until the size you want is reached.</p>
        <p>You can insert text, tables, images, and flash animations inside the layer's square, and also all the elements that an HTML file can contain.</p>

        <h4>Inserting a layer</h4>
        <p>Layers can be inserted in a Page through the <b>Insert</b> menu, and then selecting the <b>Design object</b> option, and <b>Layer</b>.</p>
        <p>Once the layer is inserted, you can edit its attributes by selecting it.</p>
        <p>You can select layers through many different ways. One of them is clicking on the  icon. This is not useful when there are many layers in the same file because all layers have an image like this one associated, and it's very easy to select the wrong one.</p>
        <p>When there are many layers in the same file, it's recommendable to select them through the <b>Layers</b> tab in the <b>Design</b> panel, which can be opened through the <b>Window</b> menu, and then the <b>Layers</b> option. If the <b>Layers</b> option isn't in the menu, it may possibly be in the <b>Others</b> option. Also, it can be opened just by pressing F2.</p>
        <p>In the panel are the names of all existing layers in the actual file, and you only need to click on the layer name to select it.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-layers-panel-layers-tab.png" alt="Dreamweaver Layers Panel" style="width:200px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>

        <h4>Layer format</h4>
        <p>Layer's properties are shown through its <b>properties inspector</b></p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-properties-inspector-layers.png" alt="Dreamweaver Properties Inspector Layers Options" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>
        <p><b>Layer ID</b> is the layer's name. You can change it through the <b>Layers</b> panel, and double clicking it.</p>
        <p><b>L</b> and <b>T</b> indicate the pixels distance between left and top limits of the document and the layer.</p>
        <p><b>W</b> and <b>H</b> indicate the layer's width and the height.</p>
        <p><b>Z-Index</b> is the depth order of the layer. This value can be changed through the <b>Layers</b> panel. A layer will be overlapped by others which greater Z-index.</p>
        <p><b>Vis</b> indicates the inital view of the layer. Visibility can accept four types.</p>
        <p><b>Default</b> (Browser view),</p>
        <p><b>Inherit</b> (the layer of the Page that is being displayed is shown)</p>
        <p><b>Visible</b> (It shows the layer although the Page isn't being seen)</p>
        <p><b>Hidden</b> (the layer is hidden).</p>
        <p>You can also change the view through the <b>Layers</b> panel by clicking on the eye image. The open eye indicates <b>Visible</b>, and the closed eye indicates <b>Hidden</b>.</p>
        <p>Through <b>Bg Image</b> and <b>Color</b> you can indicate an image or a background color for the layer.</p>
        <p><b>Overflow</b> controls how the layers appear in a browser when the content exceeds the specified size of the layer.</p>
        <p><b>Visible</b> indicates that the layer would be amplified to make its content fit.</p>
        <p><b>Hidden</b> specifies the additional content will not be shown in the browser.</p>
        <p><b>Scroll</b> specifies that the browser should add scrolling bars to the layer although they are or not needed.</p>
        <p><b>Auto</b> makes the browser show the scrolling bar when they are needed (when the layer content is bigger than its limit).</p>

        <h4>Using Frames</h4>
        <p>We are going to see what <b>Frames</b> are and when they must be used. We will also see how to insert a simple frame into a website and how to work with it.</p>

        <h4>Creating frames</h4>
        <p>There are many ways of creating a frame. We will only learn one.</p>
        <p>To create a frame, you first need to open a file. It can be new or an existing one.</p>
        <p>After this, you need to go to the <b>Insert</b> menu, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>Frames</b>. Through this option you can select the type of frame you want to create.</p>
        <p>We are going to look at the <b>Left frame</b> option.</p>
        <p>If we click on <b>Left</b>, a new frame will be created in the left side of the current file.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-frame-example.png" alt="Dreamweaver Frame Example" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>
        <p>As you can see in the image, there is a line splitting the document.</p>
        <p>In this case we will have three files: the left one, the right one, and the one which has the set of frames. The right one is the file we had at the start. It is in the frame known as <b>Main Frame</b>.</p>
        <p>To select the file that has the set of frames you have to click on the line that splits the frames. This is only possible in case of not having been previously saved.</p>

        <h4>Selecting frames</h4>
        <p>If you want to select the frames of a document you have to go to the <b>Frames</b> panel which can be opened through the <b>Window</b> menu. If the <b>Frame</b> option isn't in this menu, it may be in <b>Others</b> option. You can also open the <b>Frames</b> panel by pressing the combination of <b>Shift+F2</b> keys.</p>
        <p>The frames that are in the frame document are found in the <b>Frames</b> panel, and we can go through them by clicking on them in the panel. You can also select the frame Page by clicking on the border that sorrounds the frames.</p>
        <p>Select the frames to edit the document they may contain.</p>
        <p>Select the frames to specify the specific properties of each one of them.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-frames-panel.png" alt="Dreamweaver Frames Panel" style="width:200px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>

        <h4>Saving Frames</h4>
        <p>All documents that have frames must have a Page inside each one of them. This is why when you create a frame, new pages are loaded by default in each one of them (apart from the frame that has the original page).</p>
        <p>These new pages can be replaced later by other existing pages as we'll soon see.</p>
        <p>If you save the page that has the set of frames, each one of the pages included in their frames we'll be saved too.</p>
        <p>It is not recommendable to save the frames for the first time using the  Save all icon, because we can make mistakes when naming the new files.</p>
        <p>It's preferible saving each file (one by one) unless all the frames had an already existing page, because in this case the unique file that will have to be named will be the one that has the set of frames.</p>
        <p>To save a file that has a set of frames, you have to previously select it.</p>
        <p>To save each one of the documents, you just have to place the cursor on one of them and click on the Save icon.</p>

        <h4>Setting up Frames</h4>
        <p>After selecting a frame through the <b>Frames</b> panel, its properties can be established through the <b>properties inspector</b>.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-properties-inspector-frames.png" alt="Dreamweaver Properties Inspector Frames Options" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>
        <p>Each frame has a name assigned that can be changed through the <b>Frame name</b> option. The name cannot have blank spaces.</p>
        <p><b>Src</b> is the HTML file name that is displayed in the frame.</p>
        <p>In <b>Borders</b> you can select a line that splits the frame from the rest of the frames. In case of showing the border, a color for this can be specified through <b>Border color</b>. You can also establish a width for the border through the <b>Width</b> option.</p>
        <p><b>Scroll</b> will indicate whether scrolling bars will be shown or not when the frame file cannot be completely seen.</p>
        <p>If the <b>No resize</b> option is activated, it indicates that users won't be able to change the frame size in the browser.</p>
        <p>The <b>Margin width</b> and <b>Margin height</b> set the separation between the content of the frame and its right-left and top-bottom borders.</p>
        <p>If all the sets of frames are selected, then the <b>Properties inspector</b> will display the following options:</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-properties-inspector-frameset.png" alt="Dreamweaver Properties Inspector Frameset Options" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>
        <p>In <b>Borders</b> you can add a line to split the frame from the rest of the frames. In case of showing the border, a color for this can be specified through <b>Border color</b>. You can also establish a width for the border through the <b>Width</b> option.</p>
        <p>The <b>Column</b> field (or <b>Row</b>) is used to set the frame size, and it can be introduced as <b>Pixels</b>, in <b>Percent</b> (of the window) or <b>Relative</b> (proportional to the rest of the frames).</p>
        <p>You will usually use two frames, one of them with size in <b>Pixels</b>, which will contain the browser bar, and the other frame with a <b>Relative</b> size, to adjust it to the rest of the browser window.</p>

        <h4>Frame content</h4>
        <p>As you have seen, the frame content can be established through the <b>Src</b> field of the properties inspector.</p>
         <figure>

        </figure>
        <p>When we work with frames, our aim is to load different files in at least one of them.</p>
        <p>Through the <b>Src</b> field of the properties inspector, it's only possible to specify the file that will be loaded in the frame in first time, but we can change this later using links.</p>

        <h4>Using behaviors</h4>
        <p>In this unit we're going to learn the basic characteristics of the <b>behaviors</b>, and also look at a pair of examples of possible applications.</p>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>behaviors are actions that happen when the user does something over an object, for example moving the mouse over an image, clicking on a text, double-clicking on an image map, etc.</p>

        <h4>Inserting a behavior</h4>
        <p>When there is an established browser, you can insert behaviors.</p>
        <p>The first thing to do is to select the object on which the behavior is going to be applied, it can be an image, a text fragment, etc.</p>
        <p>When you click on the  button of the <b>Behavior</b> panel you will see the <b>Show Events for</b> option. Also, you will see a list of all possible actions in the browser previously selected, so you can select one.</p>
        <p>Depending on the element on which you want to apply the behaviuor, you can select some actions, and others not.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-insert-rollover-image-dialog-2.png" alt="Dreamweaver Behaviors Panel" style="width:300px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>
        <p>In this case the <b>Validate form</b> action cannot be selected because there isn't any form in the Page.</p>
        <p>After choosing any action, the corresponding behavior appears in the <b>Behaviors</b> panel. In this case, two behaviors have been inserted.</p>
        <p>As you can see, each behavior has an action and an event associated to it.</p>
        <p>Actions are the ones which have been selected in the previous list, and the event indicates the action by itself (when it is done).</p>
        <p>To clear any behavior, you need to select it in the <b>Behaviors</b> panel and click on the  button. You can also change the order of the behaviors applied to an object, by selecting them and arranging their order through the  buttons.</p>

        <h4>Show and Hide layer behavior</h4>
        <p>One of the most habitual and interesting behaviors is <b>Show and Hide layers</b>. It is obvious that when you want to apply this behavior there need to be layers present in the document.</p>
        <p>In the previous Page you had an example of this type. Let's see which events and actions you need to establish in order to produce the behavior.</p>
        <p>After selecting the image you need to select an action from the list by clicking on the  button. In this case the action has to be <b>Show-Hide layers</b></p>
        <p>After selecting the action, you must specify which layers have to be shown and which hidden for the event. For this you need to click twice on the action in the <b>Behavior</b> panel.</p>
        <p>A new window is then shown, with the list of all the layers in the page, where you can indicate the view variation for each one of the layers.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-rollover-image-dialog-2.png" alt="Show Hide Layers Dialog Box" style="width:400px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>
        <p>You can indicate whether they are going to be Shown, Hidden, or if they are going to acquire the initial view (Predetermined). To determine the state of each one of the layers it's necessary to select them one by one, indicating the state through the buttons at the bottom of the window.</p>
        <p>It's not necessary to apply a different view to all the layers of the page, only the ones you want to change at the moment of producing the event. For example, in this case the "catmonth" layer has not been applied a different view, because we don't want it to change when the event plays out.</p>
        <p>If you want to clear an established view for any of the layers, you only need to click again on the button of the applied view. For example, to clear the view applied to the "catweek" layer, we would have to click again on the Show button.</p>
        <p>You need to be careful about what you want - in this case it is that when you place the mouse on the image the layer is shown, and when the mouse is out of the image the layer is hidden again. For this you need to insert two <b>Show-Hide layers</b> behaviors with the action. One of them will show the layer for the event <b>onMouseOver</b> (when the mouse is over), while the other will hide it for the event <b>onMouseOut</b> (when the mouse is out).</p>

        <h4>Using JavaScript Code</h4>
        <p>Another behavior that can be applied on any object is <b>Call JavaScript</b>. This behavior allows us to insert JavaScript code inside the file.</p>
        <p>For example, it's possible to make the browser window close when you click on an object. To do this you need to insert a "window.close();" JavaScript line.</p>
        <p>The same as the layers example, the first thing to do is to select the object on which the behavior is going to be applied. After this you need to select the <b>Call JavaScript</b> action through the  button.</p>
        <p>Then a new window shows up and you now need to introduce the JavaScript line.</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-insert-rollover-image-dialog-2.png" alt="Call JavaScript Dialog Box" style="width:400px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>
        <p>Once the behavior is inserted in the <b>Behavior</b> panel, you need to establish an <b>onclick</b> event to produce the call to JavaScript when clicking on the object.</p>
        <p>By clicking twice on the action the previous window is opened again, and it's possible to modify the line code.</p>

        <h3>Introduction to Adobe Flash</h3>
        <p><b>Adobe Flash</b> (formerly called Shockwave Flash, often just called Flash) is a multimedia software platform used for production of animations, rich Internet applications, desktop applications, mobile applications and mobile games. Flash displays text, vector graphics and raster graphics to provide animations, video games and applications. It allows streaming of audio and video, and can capture mouse, keyboard, microphone and camera input.</p>

        <h4>Introduction to Macromedia Flash</h4>
        <p><b>Macromedia Flash Mx/8</b> is a powerful Web authoring application used to create animation, interactive enviroments and data driven applications for use on Web sites. Flash Mx/8 is one of the leading Web authoring programs for creating vector-based animations or "Flash movies" for Web sites. A working Flash document should have the file extension of .fla. A compiled Flash document exported to web is abreviated as a .swf file.</p>
        <p>Flash creates vector-based graphics rather than bitmap graphics. Vector graphics are created using lines and curves, whereas bitmap graphics are described by pixels of color. Bitmap images are resolution dependent; therefore, resizing a bitmap image can lead to distortion. Vector-based graphics, on the other hand, are drawn using mathematical formulas. Resizing a vector-based image means the formula is recalculated, resulting in a scaled version of the original image and no distortion.</p>
        <p>Flash MX supports the importing of bitmap graphics. This feature gives the Web developer a great deal of flexibility. The addition of a Flash movie to a Web site invites interactivity and provides an opportunity for visitors to have a more engaging experience.</p>

        <h4>Using Layers in Flash Mx/8</h4>
        <p>Layers are like clear sheets of acetate or glass. Layers can be stacked on top of each other. Each layer can have its own artwork, sound or action on it. Use as many layers as you need to keep everything separate and organized. Be consistent with the way you order and name layers, so that if you have to put the .flaw away and work on it down the road, you won't be totally lost. This is a good practice to adopt. Suggested layer order and layer names are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Actions --- any frame actions assigned can all be here.</li>
          <li>Labels --- Name keyframes that have actions</li>
          <li>Sounds --- Any sounds can be placed in keyframes here.</li>
          <li>Object 1 (whatever you have on this layer)</li>
          <li>Background</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Name layers with short meaningful names that you will be able to identify at a glance. Such as "red ball bounce," or "button home." These aren't read by Flash, so they just have to have meaning to you.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          üí° <b>NOTE</b>: You can have as many layers as you want (or as your system can handle). Layers do not add to file size.
        </div>

        <h4>Creating New Layers</h4>
        <p>There are several ways to create a new layer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click on the 5+6 button in the lower left corner of the Timeline. or,</li>
          <li>From the <b>Insert</b> menu, choose <b>Layer</b>. or,</li>
          <li>Right3click (Windows) or Control+Click (Macintosh) on an existing layer and choose <b>Insert Layer</b> from the dropdown menu.</li>
        </ul>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-layers-panel.png" alt="Dreamweaver Timeline with Layers" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>
        <p>Create a guide layer by choosing <b>Modify > Layer</b> and selecting the "guide" option. A guide layer is used to help in drawing. Any layer can be made into a guide layer. The artwork appears in your work area, but not in the published movie. When you see this icon next to the layer name, then it is a guide layer.</p>

        <h4>Layer Attributes</h4>
        <p>You can change the order of the layers by dragging them up or down in the Timeline. The icons across the top of the Timeline control different attributes of the layers.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first changes the visibility of the layer to Off or On. This is helpful if you don't need to see that layer to work on a different layer. Even if you have the visibility of the layer turned Off, it will still show up in the published movie. If you want the layer to be visible, but not show up in the published movie, change the layer to a guide layer. The page icon on the layer will then change to a 5t square shape6</li>
          <li>The Lock icon locks the layer so that you can't make changes on it.</li>
          <li>The Box will change whatever artwork is on the layer into an outline. It will show up as the artwork, not as an outline in the movie.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also change the height of the layer. This may be necessary if you have a sound file on a frame and you want to see the whole sound wave representation. To change the height, Control+Click on the layer (Macintosh) or right-click (Windows) and choose <b>Properties</b>. Adjust the layer height in the <b>Layer Height</b> box at the bottom of the menu box.</p>

        <h4>Creating Colors in Flash MX</h4>
        <p>There are several ways to select color with Flash MX. The Swatches panel displays the 216 Web safe colors and also stores custom mixed colors created by the Mixer panel. To open the Swatches and Mixer panel, from the <b>Windows</b> menu and then <b>Swatches</b> and then <b>Mixer</b>.</p>
        <p>When working with colors in Flash, you may want to organize the Swatches, Mixer and Fill panels into one window. These three panels are used together very often with colors, and you can save and recall this panel layout.</p>

        <h4>Adding a New Color to the Swatches Panel</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Click on the Mixer panel tab. Select the color swatch next to the bucket symbol. This is the Fill color.</li>
        </ul>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-color-mixer-panel.png" alt="Dreamweaver Color Mixer Panel" style="width:300px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-color-swatches-panel.png" alt="Dreamweaver Color Swatches Panel" style="width:300px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>
        <p>Select another color from the drop down swatches menu or by using the sliders from the RGB sliders on the right. These sliders can be switched from RGB (Red, Green, Blue) to HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance) or HEX (Hexidecimal) using the left pointing arrow on the Mixer panel.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When the color and transparency is set, select <b>Add Swatch</b> from the right pointing arrow on the Mixer panel.</li>
          <li>Switch to the Swatches panel. The color you created is at the bottom of the color swatches. Now you have a custom swatch palette that you can save and call into other Flash sites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Saving a Custom Swatches Panel</h4>
        <p>Select the Swatches panel. Use the pull-down menu from the top right arrow and choose <b>Save Colors</b>. Save your swatches in your chosen directory.</p>

        <h4>Adding a New Gradient Fill</h4>
        <p>Let's make a new gradient that has one solid color and one transparent color.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>From the Swatches panel, choose the green radial gradient type. (You can change the type of gradient later.)</li>
          <li>From the upper right arrow choose <b>Duplicate Swatch</b>.</li>
          <li>To alter a portion of the gradient, select one of the color boxes under the bar that defines the gradient. Next, use the "color fill" box above to choose another color.</li>
          <li>Now select the other color and choose a new one. You can change the gradient type from the pull-down menu to create various types of gradients.</li>
          <li>Change the gradient type to <b>Linear</b>.</li>
          <li>Now look at your swatches and you'll see the new gradient you made at the end of the gradients.</li>
          <li>Gradient color swatches can only be used in fills. Transparent fills can only be applied to new objects. They will not replace a fill already there. You will have to select and delete the fill before refilling with the transparent color. This might have to be a two-step process. If there is no stroke on your object, add a temporary one with the inkwell tool. Use that to define the area to be filled, then you can delete the stroke again.</li>
        </ul>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-gradient-fill-panel.png" alt="Dreamweaver Gradient Fill Panel" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>

        <h4>Modifying the gradient's size, position and rotation inside of a filled object.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Make a shape and fill it with your newly created gradient.</li>
          <li>Select the "fill transform" tool on the Toolbox.</li>
        </ul>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-gradient-transform-tool.png" alt="Dreamweaver Fill Transform Tool" style="width:200px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-gradient-shape-stage.png" alt="Shape on Stage with Gradient Fill" style="width:300px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>
        <p>Click on your filled shape on the stage.</p>
        <p>A center point appears in the center of the shape and with a Radial fill a circular transform modifier surrounds the shape. The square handle is an adjustment handle. Linear and Bitmap fills will a display a center point and two vertical lines on either side of the shape. On the right line, the square adjustment handle appears.</p>

        <h4>Bitmap Fills</h4>
        <p>In the Fill panel, choose <b>Bitmap</b> from the Fill Menu. Click on a bitmap that appears in the Fill panel. You can modify a Bitmap fill the same as a Linear fill.</p>

        <h4>Drawing in Flash MX</h4>
        <p>If you're familiar with Photoshop or other drawing, image manipulation and paint programs, then Flash tools will look familiar. Let's go over some of the drawing methods unique to Flash.</p>

        <h4>Overlapping Shapes</h4>
        <p>When one shape overlaps another and the two shapes are on the same layer and and are not selected, these objects merge into one object. You can still select one section of the object, but when you move it, the part of the other object that was overlapped will be erased.</p>

        <h4>Exercise:</h4>
        <p>Draw a shape on the stage in one color. Draw an overlapping shape in another color. Select one of the color areas and drag the shape. You see that the part of the shape that was covered by the overlapping shape is gone. Keep this in mind when you're creating graphics. If you don't want this to happen, put the shapes on different layers, group them or make them symbols.</p>

        <h4>Pencil Tool</h4>
        <p>The Pencil tool works like a regular pencil tool with some cool options. The Pencil tool draws in three modes: Straighten, Smooth and Ink. These modes appear in the Options section of the Toolbox.</p>
        <p>Choose <b>Straighten</b> and draw a box. The lines you draw have been straightened. Try this with the other two modes. <b>Smooth</b> makes nice curves averaged from the curve you drew. <b>Ink</b> leaves the line as you've drawn it.</p>

        <h4>Selecting edges and lines in Flash MX</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>To select a line segment or the fill of an object, use the Arrow tool and click once over the line or fill.</li>
          <li>Double clicking on a line will select all the curves in that line.</li>
          <li>Choose the selection (Arrow) tool and deselect any shapes or lines that are on the stage. With the selection arrow, move it over one of the shape edges. The pointer arrow changes when you're over the edge of a shape that hasn't been grouped or made into a symbol. If it's over a curved line or curved edge of a fill, it is a pointer with a curve next to it and will move the curve if you press and drag. Over a corner or endpoint, it is a pointer with a corner, and will move the point or corner maintaining the straight lines. This will pull both stroke and fill alike.</li>
          <li>To reshape lines and fills, select them. Use the <b>Smooth</b> or <b>Straighten</b> mode from the Modify Menu or from the Options section of the Toolbox. (You can adjust the amount of smoothing or straightening by choosing <b>Preferences</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.)</li>
          <li>Control-drag (Windows) or option-drag (Macintosh) a line to create a new corner point.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Optimizing Shapes</h4>
        <p>The fewer curved sections in a shape, the lower the amount of data Flash has to maintain on that shape. Optimizing shapes is highly recommended to reduce file size and increase playback speed of the Flash movie. To reduce the amount of curves in an object, choose <b>Optimize</b> from the <b>Modify</b> menu. The <b>Optimize Curves</b> dialog box allows you to reduce the number of curves contained in a shape. Observe the shape as you smooth it and stop before it changes the shape unacceptably. If it's a simple shape, the number of curves may not change at all. Optimizing all objects in a movie, can significantly reduce the movie file size and increase the playback speed.</p>

        <h4>Exercise:</h4>
        <p>Draw a shape. Select it and choose <b>Optimize</b> from the <b>Modify</b> menu. Use the slider to adjust the amount of smoothing to apply to the curve. (You can always choose <b>Undo</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu.) The option 'Use multiple passes' will repeat the smoothing process until no more optimizing is possible. This is the same thing as choosing <b>Optimize</b> from the <b>Modify</b> menu over and over again.</p>

        <h4>Pen Tool</h4>
        <p>If you are familiar with Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop, Macromedia Freehand or Fireworks, you've seen this tool before. The Pen tool allows you to place points and create curves and lines that are repositionable.</p>
        <h4>Exercise to create a straight line:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Select the Pen tool.</li>
          <li>Click once anywhere in the stage window.</li>
          <li>Click again, and a straight line is created between the two points.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Exercise to create a curved line:</h4>
        <p>Position the Pen icon where you want it to begin on the stage. Press and hold the mouse and slide in the</p>

        <h4>Making Buttons in Flash MX</h4>
        <p>One of the most powerful features of Flash MX is the interactivity you can build into your Web site. The button symbol is something you'll use often. Buttons can be as simple or as complex as you want. Buttons can contain movies and actions inside.</p>
        <p>Buttons are actually interactive movies consisting of four frames. The first three frames define three states of the button, while the fourth frame defines the hit area, or the area that is "hot." The four frames are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Up</b> -- what button looks like in inactive state, when the pointer is not over the button;</li>
          <li><b>Over</b> -- what the button looks like when the pointer is over it;</li>
          <li><b>Down</b> 3 what the button looks like when the mouse is clicked on it; and</li>
          <li><b>Hit</b> -- the area that is 5hot6 that will trigger the button states.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Exercise to build a simple button:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>From the <b>Insert</b> menu, choose <b>New Symbol</b>. In the <b>Symbol Properties</b> window that opens, choose <b>Button</b> as the Behavior type. Name it: b, simple button. Click OK.</li>
          <li>This opens up the symbol editing window.</li>
        </ul>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-rollover-animation.png" alt="Dreamweaver Timeline - Button Symbol" style="width:700px; border:1px solid black;">
        </figure>
        <p>You will see 4 labeled frames in the Layers and Timeline area. These frames represent the 4 states for your button: Up, Over, Down, and Hit. This is where you will create the artwork for the different states for your button.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click in the 5Up6 state frame.</li>
          <li>On the stage, draw a blue filled circle. The Up state is done.</li>
          <li>To create the "Over", "Down" and "Hit" states, select each frame (state) and from the <b>Insert</b> menu choose <b>Keyframe</b>. This will put the last keyframe (Up state frame) in the selected frame. Then you can go back to each new frame and change the button.</li>
          <li>We want the "Over" state of the button to look like the "Up" state except with a different fill color.</li>
          <li>Select the "Over" state frame. If you click directly on the frame, it will select all objects in that frame. If you click over the frame, on the state label, it will go to the correct frame, but not select the objects in that frame. If the object is not selected, choose the selection arrow and select the blue filled circle on the 5Over6 state. While it is selected, choose a new color by the fill bucket to change the fill color.</li>
          <li>Now select the "Down" state frame. Let's make the Down state a little different. Change the fill color to yellow the same way as in the Over state. Add some little dashes like radiating rays from the sun around the circle.</li>
          <li>Let's leave the "Hit" state the way it is.</li>
          <li>Click on the Scene 1 icon in the upper left hand corner of the work area.</li>
          <li>If the Library window is not open, select <b>Window/Library</b>. (The key command will be indicated in the pull-down menu, if you'd rather use keys than the pull-down menus all the time.)</li>
          <li>The simple button you made shows up in the Library list.</li>
          <li>Select the button and the "Up" state of the button will appear in the upper portion of the Library window along with a right pointing arrow. Click this right pointing arrow and you'll see all four states of the button played.</li>
          <li>Drag this button onto your stage.</li>
          <li>To see your button in action, from the <b>Control</b> menu, select <b>Enable Simple Buttons</b>. Rollover your button and click on it. It should turn a different color when you roll over it, and turn into a yellow sun when you click on it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Exercise to create a button to perform an action:</h4>
        <p>One of the most common button actions is to call up a different URL. We'll put this action on the button we just made and placed on the stage.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>From the <b>Control</b> menu turn off <b>Enable Simple Buttons</b> so you can interact with the button on the stage without testing the movie. (Enable Simple Buttons will not show you movies in keyframes.)</li>
          <li>From the <b>Window</b> menu, choose <b>Actions</b>. This will open up the Object Actions window, one of the most powerful tools in Flash MX. Check and see that it is set on <b>Normal</b> mode and not <b>Expert Mode</b> by clicking on the arrow in the upper right corner. (Normal mode gives you clues and blanks to fill in with the proper syntax. Expert mode allows you to type in your own syntax.) For our purposes, we will choose <b>Basic Actions</b> from the list on the left hand side. Scroll through the list and select 5<b>Get URL</b>6.Either double click on it, or drag it over to the right hand side. It will show up with the proper syntax, and an area to fill in on the bottom of the Object Actions window. (This action defaults to the 5on release6 action. If you want to change this, click on that line in the Object Actions window, and you'll see a new set of options for that line on the bottom.) With "Get URL" selected, Flash asks you for the URL you want this button to direct the user to. If you don't have a URL to use, type in this one: <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">http://www.utexas.edu/</a></li>
          <li>Now you're ready to test your button. There are several ways to do this:
            <ol>
              <li>from the <b>Control</b> menu, choose <b>Test Movie</b> or</li>
              <li>from the <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Publish Preview/HTML</b> or</li>
              <li>from the <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Publish Preview/Flash</b>.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Test the button by rolling over it and clicking on it.</p>

        <h4>Exercise to create a fancier button:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Select the b, simple button in the Library window. Click on the Options arrow and from the drop-down menu select Duplicate. Name this button 'copy b, movie button'. Leave the behavior as Button. Click OK.</li>
          <li>Create a movie to place in the Down state of the button.</li>
          <li>First, let's copy the sun and rays from the Down state of the simple button.</li>
          <li>Click on the Symbols icon in the upper right hand corner of the stage, scroll down and choose your old button. The symbol editor opens.</li>
          <li>Click on the Down frame, select the sun and rays, and from the <b>Edit</b> menu, choose <b>Copy</b>.</li>
          <li>From the <b>Insert</b> menu, choose <b>New Symbol</b>. Select <b>Movie Clip</b> and name it 'm,sunny'. Click OK. The symbol editor is now open.</li>
          <li>From the <b>Edit</b> menu, choose <b>Paste in Place</b>. You should see your sun from the 5Down6 state of the simple button.</li>
          <li>From the <b>Insert</b> menu, choose <b>Keyframes</b> at frame 5 and frame 10.</li>
          <li>Go to frame 5. Scale the sun up a little (i.e., make the image bigger). From the <b>Modify</b> menu, choose <b>Transform</b> and then <b>Scale</b>. Grab one of the square handles and make the image a little bigger. Now lets make a tween between keyframe 1 and 5, and 5 and 10.</li>
          <li>Click on a frame between 1 and 5. The area on the Timeline turns black.</li>
          <li>Now open the <b>Frames</b> panel. From the <b>Window</b> menu, choose <b>Panels</b> and then <b>Frame</b>. Choose <b>Shape Tweening</b> from the pull-down menu. (Shape tweening is for objects that have not been turned into symbols or grouped together. You can tell if it's a raw graphic by the selection. It will select and fill the object with black and white noise if its still raw. Grouped objects and symbols will have a bounding box instead. The shape tween is represented by a light green background with a solid line arrow on top. Dashed lines means something is not right.)</li>
          <li>The tween should make a smooth upward scale between frame 1 and 5. Do the same thing between frame 5 and 10.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Let's make this even more fun.</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Add a layer above the scaling sun layer. Name it 'spiral.' Double-click on the Layer to change the layer name.</li>
          <li>Insert a keyframe on the first frame.</li>
          <li>Select the first frame on the spiral layer and draw a darker yellow or orange spiral on top of the sun.</li>
          <li>Select the spiral and make it a symbol by choosing <b>Convert to Symbol</b> from the <b>Insert</b> menu. Name it 'm,spiral movie clip.' The behavior is movie clip.</li>
          <li>Create a Keyframe in frame 10.</li>
          <li>Select frame 10 which still contains the unconverted graphic. Select the image, delete it and drag the spiral symbol from the Library window into its place. You can use the arrow keys to line up the center crosshairs. It should be in registration with the first one on the first frame.</li>
          <li>Let's make the spiral rotate one complete revolution for 10 frames. Select the area between frames 1 and 10 and open the Frame panel (from the <b>Window</b> menu, chooose <b>Panels</b> and then <b>Frame</b>). In the Tweening box select <b>Motion</b>. In Motion Tweening, you can indicate the direction of the Rotation. Select <b>CCW</b> for counter-clockwise. In the "times" box, put 1 for 1 revolution. Motion tweens work on symbols. The tween on the Timeline will look blue, with a solid line arrow.</li>
          <li>Create a new layer and move it to the top. Call it 'actions.'</li>
          <li>On the actions layer, select frame 10 and insert a keyframe by choosing <b>Keyframe</b> from the <b>Insert</b> menu.</li>
          <li>Choose <b>Window/Actions</b>. The Frame Actions window opens.</li>
          <li>Select <b>Basic Actions</b> and 5<b>Go To</b>." It will be an action on this frame sending it to a frame number or label. It defaults to frame 1 which is fine in this case. Now this movie will loop endlessly. (The timelines in movies are independent of the Timeline on the main stage, so frame 1 is unique to this movie.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Putting the movie into the button</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Click on the symbols icon in the upper right hand corner and select 'copy b, movie button.' You are still in the symbol editor, but you are back in the duplicate of the first button you made.</li>
          <li>Go to the Down state (frame) and delete the sun graphic.</li>
          <li>From the library, drag in the copy b, movie button you just finished making. You can line up the center crosshairs with the arrow keys.</li>
          <li>Go back to Scene 1 (upper left). Now your movie button has an animated down state.</li>
          <li>Test your movie.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Using Symbols in Flash MX</h4>
        <p>One of the most efficient ways to use Flash MX is to use symbols whenever you need more than one occurrence of a graphic, or animation or sound. A symbol is a graphic, button, movie clip, or sound that you create once, then reuse in your movie or other movies. Flash allows you to have an item saved in the Library that you can pull out onto your stage over and over again without busting your file size budget. You can also modify certain parameters on each instance such as scale, rotation, alpha and overall color. If you modify the symbol, it will change all the instances, but if you modify the instance, then just that instance is affected.</p>

        <h4>Symbol Types</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Movie Clip</b> - A symbol that can include animation(s), buttons, graphics, other symbols, and operates independently of the main stage Timeline.</li>
          <li><b>Button</b> - A symbol that allows interactivity and that responds to mouse clicks or rollovers. Buttons can also have movies placed in one of the states.</li>
          <li><b>Graphic</b> 3 A symbol that is used for static images or is controlled by main stage Timeline. Interactive controls and sounds won't work in this symbol.</li>
          <li><b>Sound</b> - The Sound symbol is created automatically when you import a sound.</li>
          <li><b>Font</b> - Create this type of symbol from the Library window options so you don't have to embed fonts in your site.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Naming conventions</h4>
        <p>The Library stores symbols in alphabetical order. In order to keep symbol types grouped together, name each symbol using the first letter of the type of symbol that is it first, followed by a comma, then the name of the symbol. When you are working with many symbols, this helps you find the particular symbol quickly and consistently.</p>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>g, balloon</li>
          <li>m, balloon movie</li>
          <li>s, balloon squeaky sound</li>
          <li>b, balloon button</li>
          <li>ac, balloon movement action script in movie</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Exercise:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a simple shape on the stage, such as a red balloon.</li>
          <li>Let's save this shape into the Library by making the balloon a graphic symbol.
            <ul>
              <li>Using the Arrow tool, draw a selection box around the whole balloon.</li>
              <li>With it selected, from the <b>Insert</b> menu, choose <b>Convert to Symbol</b>.</li>
              <li>A <b>Symbol Properties</b> dialog box appears with 3 Behavior options. Flash defaults to the Movie Clip behavior.</li>
              <li>Select the <b>Graphic</b> behavior.</li>
              <li>Name your symbol: g, balloon. Click OK.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Delete the balloon from the stage.</li>
          <li>From the <b>Window</b> menu, choose <b>Library</b>. You'll see your balloon symbol in the Library window.</li>
          <li>Drag the balloon symbol (g, balloon) out of the library onto the stage.</li>
          <li>Now you have an 5instance6 of the balloon on the stage.</li>
          <li>Let's change the appearance of the balloon instance.
            <ul>
              <li>Using the properties menu, change the alpha to 50%, change the tint, and change the scale and rotation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>You'll see the original symbol is unaffected. You can keep pulling in the same symbol over and over again but change each instance any way you want. These attributes can also be changed for different keyframes.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="info-box">
          üí° <b>Note</b>: If you plan on animating each instance independently, put each instance on a separate layer. Animation requires "tweening", which will only work on one symbol on one layer at a time.
        </div>

        <h4>Making a movie symbol from the balloon graphic symbol</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>From the <b>Insert</b> menu, choose <b>New Symbol</b>.</li>
          <li>Choose <b>Movie Clip</b> as the Behavior if it's not already selected, and name your symbol: "m, balloon movie." Click OK. Movie symbols have their own timeline. This can get confusing.</li>
          <li>You are now in the symbol editor, which looks just like the stage (because it has its' own independent timeline). One way you can tell you are in symbol editing mode is by looking at the upper left hand corner, which will have the movie symbol you just named after the scene name.</li>
          <li>In the Library window, drag the "g, balloon" symbol out onto the m, balloon movie stage.</li>
          <li>Select frame 10 on your timeline and then from the <b>Insert</b> menu, choosing <b>Keyframe</b> from the top menu. (Keyframe will duplicate the last keyframe with something in it.)</li>
          <li>Move the animation scrubber to the second keyframe and select the balloon or click on that frame (this will pick everything in that keyframe).</li>
          <li>Modify the balloon instance by rotation, scale, alpha and/or color.</li>
          <li>Now we need to create a "tween" between the first keyframe and the second keyframe. To do this:
            <ul>
              <li>Click in the Timeline somewhere between the first and second keyframes.</li>
              <li>In the property inspector, select the <b>Motion</b> option from the Tween dropdown menu. You can only use the motion tween on symbols. You can also add automatic rotation, easing, and other options at this point in the frame window.</li>
              <li>There should be an arrow displayed in the Timeline area between the two keyframes. If you select something else, the motion tween should show up on a light blue field. (Shape tweens are green.)</li>
              <li>Now if you scrub through the frames, you'll see the balloon changing smoothly from frame to frame.</li>
              <li>Let's make this action loop continuously. To do that, let's assign an action to the last keyframe, telling it to return to the first frame of its Timeline again.</li>
              <li>Click on the last frame and choose window>actions, the Frame Actions dialog box appears.
                <ul>
                  <li>Make sure you are in normal mode in the Frame window. (check upper right pull-down arrow)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Click on the "Actions" book display action catagories, select the "Movie Controls" book and find <b>GoTo</b>. It will default to frame 1, which is fine. Now, the movie will loop continuously.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Button Symbol</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Now we will make a button using both the g, balloon and the m, balloon movie. The button symbol has 4 default states: Up, Over, Down and Hit. These states reflect what's happening when the button is doing nothing, when the mouse is over it, when the mouse clicks on it, and the hit zone for the button.</li>
          <li>Go back to the main stage.</li>
          <li>From the <b>Insert</b> menu, choose <b>New Symbol</b>.</li>
          <li>Choose <b>Button</b> option and name it: 'b, balloon.' You are now in the symbol editing mode again.</li>
          <li>Select the 5Up6 frame. Drag the g, balloon symbol from the Library onto the stage. This is what the button will look like 5at rest.6</li>
          <li>For the "Over" state, we want the exact same position, but another color, so we're going to copy the 5Up6 frame and paste it into the 5Over6 frame (or, click to select the "over" frame and hit F6, or you can also just choose Keyframe from the Insert menu, and it will copy the contents of the last keyframe).</li>
          <li>change the color of the balloon using the property inspector.</li>
          <li>Now when you rollover this button, it will change color.</li>
          <li>Next, select the 5Down6 keyframe area. From the <b>Insert</b> menu, choose <b>Keyframe</b> and drag in m, balloon movie from the Library.</li>
          <li>For the 5Hit6 area, it doesn't show at all, so you can use the symbol or draw a hit area in this state.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your button is created now. Let's test it.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Go back to Scene 1 and drag your new 5b, balloon6 out onto the stage.</li>
          <li>Test your button by choosing <b>Test Movie</b> from the <b>Control</b> menu.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Congratulations! You've made a movie, and a button with a movie in it!</p>

        <h4>Animating in Flash - Shape Tween</h4>
        <p>Animation in Flash is easy! Let's look at a couple of different ways to achieve animation in Flash. We built tweens in the 5Button and Symbols making" tutorial, but let's do a quick review.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Draw a shape at frame 1. (Try a simple shape, like a heart.)</li>
          <li>Insert a blank keyframe at frame 30 in the Timeline. Draw another shape (like a star) in a different color at frame 30. The two shapes should be on the same layer. Click on the area between the two frames in the Timeline. The area will turn black.</li>
          <li>Now, open the Frames panel and choose <b>Shape Tween</b>. A light green bar with a solid arrow will appear between the two frames. When you scrub back and forth in the Timeline, the heart morphs to the star, and changes color.</li>
        </ul>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module4-rollover-animation.png" alt="Timeline Shape Tween" style="width:200px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>

        <h4>Motion Tween</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a symbol or pull one out of the Library onto a new layer on frame 1.</li>
          <li>Insert a keyframe at frame 30. This will keep the symbol on frame 30.</li>
          <li>Modify the symbol by changing the position, scale, rotation, and alpha. (Use the Effects panel for the alpha). Select the area between the frames on the timeline and it will turn black.</li>
          <li>Open the Frames Panel and choose <b>Motion Tween</b>. A light blue bar with a solid arrow will appear between the two frames. When you scrub back and forth in the Timeline, the symbol will move, scale, rotate and the alpha will change.</li>
          <li>Motion Tween has other options. You can choose the direction of the rotation from the pull-down menu in the Frames Panel and have the tween automatically rotate the object the number of times you specify.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Animating along a Path</h4>
        <p>Let's say you want a small airplane to follow a path from the ground up to the clouds.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a movie symbol of a little airplane with an animated propeller.</li>
          <li>Drag the symbol out onto the stage. You may want to add a runway and some clouds in the sky to make your animation more complete.</li>
          <li>Select the airplane layer and from the <b>Insert</b> menu, choose <b>Motion Guide</b>. This creates a new layer called a Guide Layer on top of the airplane layer.</li>
          <li>Insert another keyframe in the Guide:airplane layer at the point where you want the motion to stop.</li>
          <li>Using the Pencil tool, draw a curve that you want the airplane to follow from the runway to the clouds. (It won't show up in the movie)</li>
          <li>Select the first keyframe in the airplane layer. Select the Arrow tool and move the airplane to the beginning of the curve.</li>
          <li>Now select the last keyframe. Move the airplane along the curve to the end of the curve.</li>
          <li>Double-click the first keyframe to open the Frame panel. Choose <b>Motion</b> from the Tweening menu and check <b>Snap</b> (snaps the registration point to the path).</li>
          <li>Scrub along the Timeline, and the airplane will follow the curve from first to last frame. When you publish, the plane's propellers will move. (Movie animations do not display in Flash on the stage.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Frame by Frame Animation</h4>
        <p>This is the most file-size intensive method, but sometimes it's the only way to get the effect you want.You can turn on a nifty feature called <b>Onion Skinning</b> to see surrounding frames so you can more accurately draw your frame.</p>

        <h4>Exercise:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In frame one, draw a dog.</li>
          <li>In frame seven, from the <b>Insert</b> menu, choose <b>Keyframe</b>. This copies the dog from frame one through frame seven.</li>
          <li>Insert a new layer above the dog layer. You can call it "feet."</li>
          <li>Click on the Onion Skin icon from the options under the Timeline. You will see a faded version of the first frame.</li>
          <li>Click and move each of the dog's legs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Using Sound in Flash MX - Importing</h4>
        <p>There are several ways to use sound in Flash MX. You can loop sounds to play continuously, independent of the timeline, or synchronize your sounds to an animation. You can import and edit your sounds in the Sound Panel.</p>
        <p>Import sounds into Flash by choosing <b>Import</b> from the <b>File</b> menu. The following audio file formats can be imported into Flash:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>WAV</li>
          <li>AIFF</li>
          <li>MP3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have QuickTime 4 or higher, you can also import these file formats:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sound Designer II (Macintosh)</li>
          <li>Sound Only QuickTime Movies (Macintosh and Windows)</li>
          <li>Sun AU (Macintosh and Windows)</li>
          <li>System 7 Sounds (Macintosh)</li>
          <li>WAV (Macintosh and Windows)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Flash stores audio files in the Library as a symbol along with the graphics, movies and buttons. Sound files are indicated by a loudspeaker icon. Because the sound is a symbol,</p>

        <h4>Two types of sounds in Flash -- event sounds and stream sounds</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Event sounds</b> must download completely before they start playing and they will continue playing until explicitly stopped (usually by a stop action). Event sounds are associated with an event such as a mouse click, and are independent of the Timeline.</li>
          <li><b>Stream sounds</b> begin playing as soon as there's enough data to play. These sounds are synchronized to the timeline. Flash forces the animation to keep in sync with the sound. If it can't draw frames fast enough, Flash will drop frames to keep the sound in sync.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Editing with the Sound Panel</h4>
        <p>The Sound Panel allows you to modify the properties of the selected sound, for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>specify if the sound is an <b>Event</b> or <b>Stream</b></li>
          <li>start a new sound, or <b>Stop</b> the sound</li>
          <li>apply effects to the sounds, such as <b>None</b> (which strips any previous effects off the sound), <b>Fade In</b> or <b>Out</b>, <b>Left to Right</b>, etc.</li>
          <li>If you choose <b>Custom</b>, you can modify the in and out points of the fade, the duration, etc. in the window that opens up. Click on the boxes at the corners of each channel and also add points along the line by clicking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Exercise:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Import a sound file by choosing <b>Import</b> from the <b>File</b> menu. You can download a sample .wav file named slide_whistle_3x.wav. If you have Flash you can download the finished sound.fla file. If you don't have Flash, a 30-day trial version is available at Macromedia.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Saving and Publishing in Flash MX/8 - Saving Flash movies</h4>
        <p>To save your working site with all its layers, animations, etc. from the <b>File</b> menu, choose <b>Save</b>. Flash will save it as a Flash movie with a .fla extension. This is similar to Photoshop where you save your working site with all its layers, channels and text as a .psd file. Archive this file. When you're ready to show your creation to the world, you</p>

        <h4>Publishing Flash movies on the World Wide Web</h4>
        <p>One of the most popular ways to make your multimedia project available to the world is by putting it on the World Wide Web. An easy way to accomplish this is by choosing <b>Publish Settings</b> from the
