        <h3>What is Internet programming</h3>
        <p>Internet programming it a process of web development. It is where _ programming procedures are designed and added into the internet _ websites.</p>
        <p><b>Internet-based</b>, In general, an organization (with or without a physical or brick-and-mortar presence) that has its own website with information content, e-mail, and e-commerce facilities.</p>

        <h2>üìö T1.2) World Wide Web</h2>
        <p>The <b>World Wide Web</b> (abbreviated <b>WWW</b> or <b>the Web</b>) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.</p>
        <p>An information system on the Internet that allows documents to be connected to other documents by hypertext links, enabling the user to search for information by moving from one document to another.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          üìö <b>Collection of internet resources</b> (such as FTP, telnet, Usenet), hyperlinked text, audio, and video files, and remote sites that can be accessed and searched by browsers based on standards such as HTTP and TCP/IP. Also called the web, it was created in 1989 by the UK physicist Tim Berners-Lee while working at the European Particle Physics Laboratory (called CERN after its French initials Conseil Europeen de Reserches Nucleaires) in Switzerland, as an easier way to access information scattered across the internet.
        </div>

        <h3>Website</h3>
        <p>A location connected to the Internet that maintains one or more pages on the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>A set of interconnected webpages, usually including a homepage, generally located on the same server, and prepared and maintained as a collection of related information by a person, group, or organization. (The website content is stored under a common name, the website name)</p>
        <p>Virtual location on WWW, containing several subject or company related webpages and data files accessible through a browser. Each website has its own unique web address (see uniform resource locator) which can be reached through an internet connection. The opening page of a website is usually called homepage which contains hyperlinks to other pages on the same or other site(s). A single web server may support multiple websites and a single website may reside on multiple web servers, sometimes thousands of miles apart.</p>

        <h3>URL</h3>
        <h4>Computers</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Uniform Resource Locator</b>: a protocol for specifying addresses on the Internet.</li>
          <li>An address that identifies a particular file on the Internet, usually consisting of the protocol, as http, followed by the <b>domain name</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Short for <b>Uniform Resource Locator</b>. An Internet address (for example, <a href="http://www.hmco.com/trade/hometrade.html">http://www.hmco.com/trade/ hometrade.html</a>), usually consisting of the access protocol (http), the domain name (<a href="http://www.hmco.com">www.hmco.com</a>), and optionally the path to a file (hometrade.html) or resource residing on that server (trade).</p>

        <h3>Domain name/website name</h3>
        <p>A domain name is a unique name that identifies a website. For example, the domain name of the Tech Terms Computer Dictionary is "techterms.com." Each website has a domain name that serves as an address, which is used to access the website.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          üí° <b>Note</b>: All domain names have a domain suffix, such as .com, .net, or .org. The domain suffix helps identify the type of website the domain name represents. For example, ".com" domain names are typically used by commercial website, while ".org" websites are often used by non-profit organizations. Some domain names end with a country code, such as ".dk" (Denmark) or ".se" (Sweden), which helps identify the location and audience of the website.
        </div>

        <p>When you access a website, the domain name is actually translated to an IP address, which defines the server where the website located. This translation is performed dynamically by a service called DNS.</p>
        <p><b>"Domain Name System."</b> Domain names serve as memorizable names for websites and other services on the Internet. However, computers access Internet devices by their IP addresses. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing you to access an Internet location by its domain name.</p>
        <p>Thanks to DNS, you can visit a website by typing in the domain name rather than the IP address. For example, to visit the Tech Terms Computer Dictionary, you can simply type "techterms.com" in the address bar of your web browser rather than the IP address (67.43.14.98). It also simplifies email addresses, since DNS translates the domain name (following the "@" symbol) to the appropriate IP address.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          üìö A name owned by a person or organization and consisting of an alphabetical or alphanumeric sequence followed by a suffix indicating the top-level domain: used as an Internet address to identify the location of particular Web pages:
          <br><br>
          (Computing) a unique name, corresponding to one or more numeric IP addresses, used to identify a particular web page or set of web pages on the internet
        </div>

        <h3>Http</h3>
        <p><b>Hypertext transfer protocol</b>: the standard protocol for transferring hypertext documents on the World Wide Web.</p>

        <h3>Webpage</h3>
        <p>A document on the World Wide Web, consisting of an HTML file and any related files for scripts and graphics, and often hyperlinked to other documents on the Web. The content of webpages is normally accessed by using a browser.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          üìö <b>Electronic (digital) document</b> created with HTML and, therefore, accessible with a browser. In addition to text and graphics, webpages may also contain downloadable data files, audio and video files, and hyperlinks to other pages or sites. A website is usually a collection of webpages.
        </div>

        <h3>Browser</h3>
        <p>A <b>browser</b> is an application program that provides a way to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web. The word "browser" seems to have originated prior to the Web as a generic term for user interfaces that let you browse (navigate through and read) text files online.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          üìö A <b>web browser</b> (commonly referred to as a <b>browser</b>) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information resources on the World Wide
          <br><br>
          Computer program (The two most popular browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer and Firefox. Other major browsers include Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Opera) that enables internet users to access, navigate, and search World Wide Web sites. Browsers interpret hypertext links ('hotlinks') and allow documents formatted in hypertext markup language (HTML) to be viewed on the computer screen, and provide many other services including email and downloading and uploading of data, audio, and video files. Also called web browser.

        <h2>üìö T1.3) Role of web sites in organizations</h2>
        <h3>The Importance of Having a Website for Businesses, Communities and Public Organizations</h3>
        <h4>Not Only for Individuals and Corporations</h4>
        <p>The importance of having a website cannot be understated whether it8s a website for a business, a community or a public organization. Websites have a huge payoff in a variety of ways without a huge investment of time or money. In fact, having a website doesn8t even need a ton of technical expertise. What is important is to get a website up and running to begin reaping the rewards.</p>

        <h4>Advertising</h4>
        <p>One of the things that highlight the importance of having a website is advertising. A website allows a user to quickly update addresses, phone numbers, products, services, events and any other relevant details. These changes are far less expensive and less time consuming than physically reprinting all sorts of different paper marketing materials. Online advertising on websites also has no limits on size 3 there can be a huge amount of information included in full detail and color without worrying about added costs of printed materials.</p>

        <h4>Market Expansion</h4>
        <p>Having a website allows the market to increase substantially. In fact, the internet knows no limits! People all over the world can view information about the company, group or organization being represented on a website. There will be no limits on the market that can be reached because of time zones, countries, borders or even languages. Many web browsers will translate websites to the language of the user8s choice at the click of a button. All of this market expansion is possible at a cost much less than other forms of advertising such as print mailers, newspaper ads or television commercials.</p>

        <h4>Client Expectations</h4>
        <p>We are living in an ever increasingly digital world. People expect automatic answers to questions and honestly assume that nearly everyone has their own website. In fact, the internet has largely taken over directory assistance, yellow pages or even local phone books for contact information. If your information cannot be found online, it is almost as though you don8t exist. It is also important that a website is fully functional from mobile devices such as smart phones for clients who are constantly on the go.</p>

        <h4>Legitimacy of the Group or Business</h4>
        <p>Because so many different groups 3 both for profit and non-profit groups4and businesses have their own website, those without lack a certain amount of legitimacy. People who are interested in receiving more information may get the wrong impression on the size, scope and professionalism of a group without a website. Websites for all manner of groups, companies and even individuals are so common that potential clients may be more than put off by groups lacking one. These groups may be seen as technologically stymied at best and inferior quality at worst.</p>

        <h4>24/7 Availability</h4>
        <p>Most businesses and groups simply cannot run as consistently as a website can. A website can offer information to interested parties 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with no regard to vacation time or even statutory holidays. People often visit websites outside of normal working hours and this may even be the only time that they have available to find out about your organization. Information simply must be available at all times when people live in such a busy world and a website is the most cost effective way to provide an unlimited amount of information at all times.</p>

        <h4>Client Relations</h4>
        <p>Part of the importance of having a website is to strengthen client relations. The website itself helps to develop and strengthen relations with current and prospective customers. The website can proactively target marketing efforts to specific people at certain times. It can let customers become familiar with a company8s brand, marketing materials, products, core beliefs, philosophies, history and even employees. It opens up an entirely different venue for communication and dialogue between a group and the people which it serves.</p>

        <h4>Additional Sales</h4>
        <p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, a website provides a venue for additional sales. Websites can be set up to sell products and accept payments with the help of e-commerce technologies. Even if the group seeking a website is not a physical product, potential clients can research what the group does have to offer and develop more avenues to increase the group8s size and reach.</p>
        <p>Whether a website is being sought for a public organization, community or business, it is imperative to establish an online presence as soon as possible. Without a website, the group is losing out on a variety of opportunities that other organizations are not just letting slip through their fingers. Jump onboard the internet bandwagon and see what it can do for you.</p>

        <h4>What are some other benefits of having a business website?</h4>

        <h4>Cost Effective</h4>
        <p>You know exactly how much your website is going to cost you and it8s ongoings 3 a brick and mortar store, on the other hand, is susceptible to many out of the ordinary occurrences which could blow out the costs such as leaving the lights on, theft, damage, extra staff etc.</p>
        <p>A strategically developed website and online presence solution provides tremendous benefits and costing outlines.</p>

        <h4>Accessible around the clock</h4>
        <p>Your website and social media accounts are accessible 24/7/365. Imagine that you want to buy from a store. You put in all the effort required to go to the store, but when you get there, it8s closed. We all know how irate we feel in that situation. You8ll think twice about going back given the bad taste its left (ok might have been your fault for not checking but hey, this is proving the point here!). You will just find another store that is more easily accessible.</p>
        <p>Since your website is operational around the clock, from the convenience of the local coffee shop, their couch or their bed, your customers and clients can easily access your website and services.</p>

        <h4>Convenient</h4>
        <p>What is more convenient: driving outside to look for different stores that are available to shop in, or sitting in the comfort of your own home and shopping for the products you8re looking for? Pretty obvious answer, unless you like aimlessly driving around. Smart businesses realise this and thus have their own website housing their products and services so that potential customers can browse online for the products they want to purchase.</p>

        <h4>Credibility</h4>
        <p>By building a website you are giving your business the opportunity to tell consumers why they should trust you and the testimonials and facts to back up those opportunities. Believe it or not, most people will search the internet for a product or service before the purchase to check the credibility first. When you provide good service or product, positive word-of-mouth about your business is likely to spread. Which in turn, delivers more repeat and new business.</p>
        <p>People tend to trust a business after they have done business with it. Using your website, you can continuously serve consumers online and increase your credibility as a business owner.</p>

        <h4>Sales</h4>
        <p>Without sales, or selling more than you spend, your business is doomed. By having an online presence you allow for the sale of your products or services around the clock to whoever whenever with no or hardly any limitations; Unless you run out of stock or overworked, but that8s a good problem to have right! Giving your business the online presence it deserves is crucial to your brand and accountants smile.</p>

        <h4>Marketing</h4>
        <p>Having a website and online presence strategy allows you to market your business online. There are lots of marketing strategies you can use to advertise and market your business. All online marketing strategies have been proven to be effective. Which ones you choose depends on the type of business you are in. Speak to us to see which are best for your business.</p>
