        <h2>üìö T5.1) Describing Java Script and ASP</h2>
        <p><b>JavaScript</b> is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a <b>client-side scripting language</b>, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.</p>
        <p>Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage. However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML, while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage. It can also be referenced in a separate .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser.</p>
        <p>Below is an example of a basic JavaScript function that adds two numbers. The function is called with the parameters 7 and 11. If the code below were included in the HTML of a webpage, it would display the text "18" in an alert box.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
 function sum(a,b)
 {
  return a + b;
 }
 var total = sum(7,11);
 alert(total);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module5-javascript-alert-box.png" alt="JavaScript Alert Box Example" style="width:300px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>
        <p>JavaScript functions can be called within <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags or when specific events take place. Examples include <code>onClick</code>, <code>onMouseDown</code>, <code>onMouseUp</code>, <code>onKeyDown</code>, <code>onKeyUp</code>, <code>onFocus</code>, <code>onBlur</code>, <code>onSubmit</code>, and many others. While standard JavaScript is still used for performing basic client-side functions, many web developers now prefer to use JavaScript libraries like jQuery to add more advanced dynamic elements to websites.</p>
        <p><b>ASP</b> has two different meanings in the IT world: 1) Application Service Provider, and 2) Active Server Page.</p>

        <h4>1) Application Service Provider</h4>
        <p>An <b>Application Service Provider</b> is a company or organization that provides software applications to customers over the Internet. These Internet-based applications are also known as "software as a service" (SaaS) and are often made available on a subscription basis. This means ASP clients often pay a monthly fee to use the software, rather than purchasing a traditional software license. Some SaaS applications can be accessed via a web browser, while others operate over a proprietary secure port.</p>

        <h4>2) Active Server Page</h4>
        <p>An <b>Active Server Page</b>, commonly called an "ASP page," is a webpage that may contain scripts as well as standard HTML. The scripts are processed by an ASP interpreter on the web server each time the page is accessed by a visitor. Since the content of an ASP page can be generated on-the-fly, ASP pages are commonly used for creating dynamic websites.</p>
        <p>ASP is similar to other scripting platforms, like PHP and JSP, but supports multiple programming languages. While the default ASP language is VBScript, ASP pages can include other programming languages as well, such as C# and JavaScript. However, alternative languages must be defined before the script code using the following declaration:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Language="C#"%&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>ASP pages are part of the ASP.NET web application framework developed by Microsoft. Therefore, ASP pages are most often found on Windows-based web servers that run Microsoft Internet Information Services, or IIS. You can tell if you are accessing an ASP page in your browser if the URL has an ".asp" or ".aspx" suffix.</p>
        <p>PHP Stands for "Hypertext Preprocessor." (It is a recursive acronym, if you can understand what that means.) PHP is an HTML-embedded Web scripting language. This means PHP code can be inserted into the HTML of a Web page. When a PHP page is accessed, the PHP code is read or "parsed" by the server the page resides on. The output from the PHP functions on the page are typically returned as HTML code, which can be read by the browser. Because the PHP code is transformed into HTML before the page is loaded, users cannot view the PHP code on a page. This make PHP pages secure enough to access databases and other secure information.</p>

        <h2>üìö T5.2) Data Input procedures</h2>
        <h3>Input & data entry design</h3>
        <p>To develop user-friendly interface and process for getting quality data into the information system in a timely and accurate fashion</p>

        <h4>Documenting Data Entry Procedures</h4>
        <h4>Objectives:</h4>
        <p>generally, most work done on improving the standards of data entry covers the entry of data for operational, financial or administrative applications. These are either developed for the Department or acquired as Commercial products. This Activity presents some Good Practices for ensuring that all data entry procedures are properly documented.</p>
        <h4>Scope of usage:</h4>
        <p>generally, this would apply to data entry for operational, administrative and financial application software. However, in some cases, there are data entry procedures that are covered by Office Technology products.</p>
        <h4>Risks:</h4>
        <p>not having proper data entry procedures would lead to the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improper entry of data causing errors, rework and possibly damages with citizens and other users of the data.</li>
          <li>Erroneous or slow entry of data leading to loss of time and re-entry</li>
          <li>More rigorous training of new staff</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Standard Operating Procedure:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>For each data entry form in each software application, a detailed Data Entry Procedure is to be prepared. Generally, the software would have such procedures if it is well documented. In such a case, the Department should check if such procedures are sufficient, otherwise, they would be used as the basis for a redeveloped Data Entry Procedure.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Data Entry procedure would be used in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Training</li>
          <li>Day to day entry tasks</li>
          <li>Validation and consistency checking</li>
          <li>Auditing purposes</li>
          <li>Refreshing the user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A Sample Data Entry Procedure is presented in the Appendix of Supplementary Material.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>On preparing a Data Entry Procedure, it should be tested to ensure that all data elements are clearly explained and that the procedure is easy to understand and use.</li>
          <li>Whenever the Department is developing its own systems or requesting such systems to be developed by third parties, it is essential to follow some Data Entry standards or Good Practices. These are presented in the Appendix of Supplementary Material.</li>
          <li>Error analysis should be carried out. When errors are reported, they should be registered and totaled. If specific forms are found to generate more errors than others, then there is the possibility that the form is not being properly understood or that it may have programming problems.</li>
          <li>Use Audit Trails whenever possible. Audit Trails are rigorous ways of verifying proper data entry. Throughout the years, the term got distorted to mean the following:</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>üìö T5.4) Implement Java Script and ASP</h2>
        <h3>Implementing JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>

        <h4>JavaScript - Syntax</h4>
        <p>JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the <code>&lt;script&gt;... &lt;/script&gt;</code> HTML tags in a web page.</p>
        <p>You can place the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within your web page, but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags.</p>
        <p>The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags as a script. A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as follows.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script ...&gt;
 JavaScript code
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>The script tag takes two important attributes ‚àí</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Language</b> ‚àí This attribute specifies what scripting language you are using. Typically, its value will be javascript. Although recent versions of HTML (and XHTML, its successor) have phased out the use of this attribute.</li>
          <li><b>Type</b> ‚àí This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting language in use and its value should be set to "text/javascript".</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Your First JavaScript Script</h4>
        <p>Let us take a sample example to print out "Hello World". We added an optional HTML comment that surrounds our JavaScript code. This is to save our code from a browser that does not support JavaScript. The comment ends with a "//-->". Here "//" signifies a comment in JavaScript, so we add that to prevent a browser from reading the end of the HTML comment as a piece of JavaScript code. Next, we call a function <code>document.write</code> which writes a string into our HTML document.</p>
        <p>This function can be used to write text, HTML, or both. Take a look at the following code.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt;
  &lt;!--
  document.write("Hello World!")
  //--&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>This code will produce the following result ‚àí</p>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module5-javascript-example-output.png" alt="JavaScript Hello World Output" style="width:300px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>

        <h4>Whitespace and Line Breaks:</h4>
        <p>JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines that appear in JavaScript programs. You can use spaces, tabs, and newlines freely in your program and you are free to format and indent your programs in a neat and consistent way that makes the code easy to read and understand.</p>

        <h4>Semicolons are Optional:</h4>
        <p>Simple statements in JavaScript are generally followed by a semicolon character, just as they are in C, C++, and Java. JavaScript, however, allows you to omit this semicolon if each of your statements are placed on a separate line. For example, the following code could be written without semicolons.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt;
 &lt;!--
 var1 = 10
 var2 = 20
 //--&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>But when formatted in a single line as follows, you must use semicolons ‚àí</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt;
 &lt;!--
 var1 = 10; var2 = 20;
 //-->
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

        <div class="info-box">
          üí° <b>Note</b> ‚àí It is a good programming practice to use semicolons.
        </div>

        <h4>Case Sensitivity:</h4>
        <p>JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that the language keywords, variables, function names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.</p>
        <p>So the identifiers <code>Time</code> and <code>TIME</code> will convey different meanings in JavaScript.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          ‚ö†Ô∏è <b>NOTE</b> ‚àí Care should be taken while writing variable and function names in JavaScript.
        </div>

        <h4>Comments in JavaScript:</h4>
        <p>JavaScript supports both C-style and C++-style comments, Thus ‚àí</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any text between a <code>//</code> and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript.</li>
          <li>Any text between the characters <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> is treated as a comment. This may span multiple lines.</li>
          <li>JavaScript also recognizes the HTML comment opening sequence <code>&lt;!--</code>. JavaScript treats this as a single-line comment, just as it does the <code>//</code> comment.</li>
          <li>The HTML comment closing sequence <code>--&gt;</code> is not recognized by JavaScript so it should be written as <code>//--&gt;</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>The following example shows how to use comments in JavaScript.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt;
 &lt;!--

 // This is a comment. It is similar to comments in C++

 /*
  * This is a multiline comment in JavaScript
  * It is very similar to comments in C Programming
  */

 //-->
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h4>JavaScript in <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> Sections</h4>
        <p>You can put your JavaScript code in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section altogether as follows ‚àí</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  &lt;!--
  function sayHello() {
  alert("Hello World")
  }
  //--&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  &lt;!--
  document.write("Hello World")
  //--&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;

  &lt;input type="button" onclick="sayHello()" value="Say Hello" /&gt;

 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
         <figure>
          <img src="../assets/images/module5-javascript-sections-output.png" alt="JavaScript in Head and Body Output" style="width:300px; border:1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
        </figure>
        <p>This code will produce the following result ‚àí</p>

        <h4>JavaScript in External File</h4>
        <p>As you begin to work more extensively with JavaScript, you will be likely to find that there are cases where you are reusing identical JavaScript code on multiple pages of a site.</p>
        <p>You are not restricted to be maintaining identical code in multiple HTML files. The <code>script</code> tag provides a mechanism to allow you to store JavaScript in an external file and then include it into your HTML files.</p>
        <p>Here is an example to show how you can include an external JavaScript file in your HTML code using <code>script</code> tag and its <code>src</code> attribute.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="filename.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
  .......
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>To use JavaScript from an external file source, you need to write all your JavaScript source code in a simple text file with the extension ".js" and then include that file as shown above.</p>
        <p>For example, you can keep the following content in filename.js file and then you can use <code>sayHello</code> function in your HTML file after including the filename.js file.</p>
        <pre><code>function sayHello() {
 alert("Hello World")
}
</code></pre>

        <h4>JavaScript Datatypes</h4>
        <p>One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language.</p>
        <p>JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types ‚àí</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Numbers</b>, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.</li>
          <li><b>Strings</b> of text e.g. "This text string" etc.</li>
          <li><b>Boolean</b> e.g. true or false.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, <b>null</b> and <b>undefined</b>, each of which defines only a single value. In addition to these primitive data types, JavaScript supports a composite data type known as <b>object</b>. We will cover objects in detail in a separate chapter.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
          üí° <b>Note</b> ‚àí Java does not make a distinction between integer values and floating-point values. All numbers in JavaScript are represented as floating-point values. JavaScript represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard.
        </div>

        <h4>JavaScript Variables</h4>
        <p>Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.</p>
        <p>Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the <b>var</b> keyword as follows.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 &lt;!--
 var money;
 var name;
 //-->
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>You can also declare multiple variables with the same <b>var</b> keyword as follows ‚àí</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 &lt;!--
 var money, name;
 //-->
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>Storing a value in a variable is called <b>variable initialization</b>. You can do variable initialization at the time of variable creation or at a later point in time when you need that variable.</p>
        <p>For instance, you might create a variable named <b>money</b> and assign the value 2000.50 to it later. For another variable, you can assign a value at the time of initialization as follows.</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
 &lt;!--
 var name = "Ali";
 var money;
 money = 2000.50;
 //-->
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

        <div class="info-box">
          ‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Note</b> ‚àí Use the <b>var</b> keyword only for declaration or initialization, once for the life of any variable name in a document. You should not re-declare same variable twice.
        </div>

        <p>JavaScript is <b>untyped language</b>. This means that a JavaScript variable can hold a value of any data type. Unlike many other languages, you don't have to tell JavaScript during variable declaration what type of value the variable will hold. The value type of a variable can change during the execution of a program and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.</p>

        <h3>Implementing ASP</h3>
        <p>ASP stands for <b>Active Server Pages</b></p>
        <p>ASP is a development framework for building web pages.</p>
        <p>ASP supports many different development models:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Classic ASP</li>
          <li>ASP.NET Web Forms</li>
          <li>ASP.NET MVC</li>
          <li>ASP.NET Web Pages</li>
          <li>ASP.NET API</li>
          <li>ASP.NET Core</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The ASP Technology</h4>
        <p>ASP and ASP.NET are server side technologies.</p>
        <p>Both technologies enable computer code to be executed by an Internet server.</p>
        <p>When a browser requests an ASP or ASP.NET file, the ASP engine reads the file, executes any code in the file, and returns the result to the browser.</p>
        <p>An Active Server Page (ASP) is an HTML page that includes one or more scripts (small embedded programs) that are processed on a Microsoft Web server before the page is sent to the user. An ASP is somewhat similar to a server-side include or a common gateway interface (CGI) application in that all involve programs that run on the server, usually tailoring a page for the user. Typically, the script in the Web page at the server uses input received as the result of the user's request for the page to access data from a database and then builds or customizes the page on the fly before sending it to the requestor.</p>
