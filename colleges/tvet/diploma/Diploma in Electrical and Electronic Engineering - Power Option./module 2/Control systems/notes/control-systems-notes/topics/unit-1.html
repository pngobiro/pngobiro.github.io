                        <p><strong>Linear system:</strong> A system is known as linear if and only if it possesses both homogeneity and superposition properties. Superposition implies that an input $r_{1}(t)$ gives an output $c_{1}(t)$ and another input $r_{2}(t)$ gives the output $c_{2}(t)$. If two inputs are applied together then the output will be the sum of two outputs:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$R_{1}(t)+R_{2}(t)=C_{1}(t)+C_{2}(t)$$</div>
                        <p>If our input-output relationship is a straight line passing through the origin, then the system obeys the superposition property. The straight line passing through origin means that the output is zero (0) for zero (0) input.</p>
                        <p>If the input increases for any system K time from $r_{1}(t)$ to $Kr_{1}(t)$ then the magnitude of the output is also increased from $c_{1}(t)$ to $Kc_{1}(t)$ then this property is known as homogeneity. This property is a necessary condition for a system to be linear.</p>
                        <p><strong>Non-Linear System:</strong> Non-linear system does not satisfy the superposition principle or homogeneity property, or it is the system whose output is not directly proportional to its input. Here, the stability of the non-linear system depends upon the input and initial status of the system.</p>
                        <p>In a linear system, if the input is sinusoidal and starts increasing, then the output will also increase but the form will remain the same.</p>
                        <p>However, in a non-linear system, the form may change with changes in the magnitude of the input. It means if the input is sinusoidal then the output is non-sinusoidal, i.e., the non-linear system.</p>

                        <p>Servomechanism is a powered mechanism producing motion or forces at a higher level of energy than the input level, e.g. in the brakes and steering of large motor vehicles, especially where feedback is employed to make the control automatic.</p>
                        <p>A servomechanism, sometimes also called Servo, is an automatic device that uses error-sensing negative feedback to correct the performance of a mechanism and is defined by its function.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Working of Servomechanism:</h3>
                        <p>Servomechanism is an automatic closed loop control system. Here instead of controlling a device by applying variable input signal, the device is controlled by a feedback signal generated by comparing output signal and reference input signal.</p>

                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_05_fe94132467efe45f3516g-011-1.jpg" alt="Block diagram of a servomechanism showing Input Command Signal -> Amplifier -> Error signal -> Motor -> Gear system -> Output shaft, with Potentiometer providing feedback." class="content-image">
                        <p>Carefully observe the figure above and think. When reference input signal or command signal is applied to the system, it is compared with output reference signal of the system produced by output sensor, and a third signal produced by feedback system. This third signal acts as input signal of controlled device. This input signal to the device presents as long as there is a logical difference between reference input signal and output signal of the system. After the device achieves its desired output, there will be no longer logical difference between reference input signal and reference output signal of the system. Then, third signal produced by comparing theses above said signals will not remain enough to operate the device further and to produce further output of the system until the next reference input signal or command signal is applied to the system.</p>
                        <p>Hence the primary task of a servomechanism is to maintain the output of a system at the desired value in the presence of disturbances.</p>
