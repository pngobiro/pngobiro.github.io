                                We need to select a Nyquist plot that should enclose all the poles and zeroes present on the right-half of the s-plane except the singular points. The singular points are considered as the points lying on the imaginary axis. Hence, these points are avoided.<br>
                                If the transfer function has a pole at zero or origin, the contour encloses all the poles and zeroes except the origin.<br>
                                If there are no poles on the imaginary axis, the contour will appear as:

                                For mapping, the contour needs to be analytical. Let's first discuss about mapping.</span>

                                A singular point (point on the imaginary axis) is not analytical. Hence, it is generally avoided. The Nyquist contour is mapped to determine the encirclement of the point -1 + j0. The contour is drawn based on the transfer function is G(s)H(s).<br>
                                There are four sections C1, C2, C3, and C4. The Nyquist criterion pot is divided into four sections so that the process can be easily carried out section wise. At last, all the sections are combined to produce the desired Nyquist plot. Let the four sections be:

                                The order of these sections is somewhat similar as shown above.</span>

                                We know that the Nyquist range is from -infinity to infinity, and the value of $\omega$ in section C1 ranges from 0 to infinity. The contour will be drawn in G(s)H(s) plane with respect to the above range, and it will be the locus plot of $G(j\omega)H(j\omega)$.<br>
                                We can use various methods of mapping the first section C1, such as sketching the locus from the given transfer function, finding the frequency by equating the real and imaginary parts to zero, using the polar plot method (type and order of the system), and separating the magnitude and the phase..</span>

                                The second section is generally of infinite radius. Here, it is a semi-circle of infinite radius. The range of the second section is from -90 degrees to +90 degrees. It can be obtained by: <!-- MMD says -90 to +90, but the angle should be +90 to -90 for standard contour direction -->

                                If the transfer function is in the form $G(s)H(s) = K(1 + sT)/[s(1 + sT1)(1 + sT2)]$, the term $(1 + sT)$ can be assumed as $sT$. <!-- MMD example doesn't match this explanation fully -->
                                The value of the transfer function at the specific value of theta will be:

The locus of the third section is just the inverse of the polar plot of $G(j\omega)H(j\omega)$. We can also say that it is the inverse of the first section.

                                The value of the transfer function at the specific value of theta will be:

                         <p>Since, the transfer function has no numerator in terms of s, there are no zeroes present in the function. There are only three poles (at s=0, s=-2, s=-10).</p>

                         <p>The value of $\omega$ in section C1 ranges from $0^+$ to infinity. The contour will be drawn in G(s)H(s) plane with respect to the above range will be the locus plot of $G(j\omega)H(j\omega)$.</p>

                         <p>The corresponding imaginary term will be 0 and the resulted frequency will be the crossover phase frequency, which is given by:</p>

                         <div class="equation">$$ s = \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} Re^{j\theta} \quad \text{where } \theta = +\frac{\pi}{2} \text{ to } -\frac{\pi}{2} $$</div>
                         <p>If the transfer function is in the form $G(s)H(s) = 0.05K/[s(1 + 0.5s)(1 + 0.1s)]$, for large $s$, the term $(1 + sT)$ can be assumed as $sT$. It is given by:</p>
                         <div class="equation">$$ G(s)H(s) \approx \frac{0.05K}{s(0.5s)(0.1s)} = \frac{0.05K}{0.05s^3} = \frac{K}{s^3} $$</div>
                         <!-- <p>Let, the value of s be:</p> MMD text redundant -->
                         <div class="equation">$$ G(s)H(s)|_{s=Re^{j\theta}} = \frac{K}{(Re^{j\theta})^3} = \frac{K}{R^3 e^{j3\theta}} = \frac{K}{R^3} e^{-j3\theta} $$</div>
                          <p>As $R \to \infty$, $|G(s)H(s)| \to 0$.</p>
                         <p>The value of the transfer function at the specific value of theta will be:</p>
                         <p>At $\theta = +\pi/2$, Angle = $-3(\pi/2) = -270^\circ$</p>
                         <p>At $\theta = -\pi/2$, Angle = $-3(-\pi/2) = +270^\circ$</p>
                         <p>Thus, the section C2 varying from -270 degrees to 270 degrees will appear as the plane shown in the below image:</p> <!-- Angles are phase of G(s)H(s) -->

                         <p><strong>Step 4: Mapping of section C3</strong></p>
                         <p>We know that the section C3 is simply the inverse (mirror image across real axis) of section C1. Thus, the locus plot of the section C3 will be the increase on the real axis at the same point, as shown below:</p>

                         <p><strong>Step 5: Mapping of section C4</strong></p>
                         <p>Let's plot the C4 section of the Nyquist plot.</p>
                         <p>The argument of the fourth section varies from -90 degrees to 90 degrees. The Nyquist contour of this section has a semicircle of zero radii. The condition gives the mapping of the section C4:</p>
                         <div class="equation">$$ s = \lim_{r \rightarrow 0} re^{j\theta} \quad \text{where } \theta = -\frac{\pi}{2} \text{ to } +\frac{\pi}{2} $$</div>
                         <p>If the transfer function is in the form $G(s)H(s) = 0.05K/[s(1 + 0.5s)(1 + 0.1s)]$, for small $s$ (near origin), the term $(1 + sT)$ can be assumed as 1. It is given by:</p>
                         <div class="equation">$$ G(s)H(s) \approx \frac{0.05K}{s(1)(1)} = \frac{0.05K}{s} $$</div>
                          <!-- <p>Let, the value of s be:</p> MMD text redundant -->
                         <div class="equation">$$ G(s)H(s)|_{s=re^{j\theta}} = \frac{0.05K}{re^{j\theta}} = \frac{0.05K}{r} e^{-j\theta} $$</div>
                         <p>As $r \to 0$, $|G(s)H(s)| \to \infty$.</p>
                         <p>The value of the transfer function at the specific value of theta will be:</p> <!-- Angle refers to phase of G(s)H(s) -->
                         <p>At $\theta = +\pi/2$, Angle = $-\theta = -\pi/2 = -90^\circ$</p>
                         <p>At $\theta = -\pi/2$, Angle = $-\theta = -(-\pi/2) = +\pi/2 = +90^\circ$</p>
                         <p>We can say that the section C4 is mapped in the s-plane as a circular arc of infinite radius (in G(s)H(s) plane). The locus is shown below:</p>

                         <p><strong>Step 6: Stability analysis</strong></p>
                         <p>We will find the value of K when the contour passes through the point (-1 + j0).</p>
                         <p>From Step 2, the crossing point on the real axis is $-0.00417K$.</p>
                         <p>Set this equal to -1:</p>
                         <p>$-0.00417K = -1$</p>
                         <p>The limiting value of K will be:</p>
                         <p>$K = 1/0.00417$</p>
                         <p>$K \approx 239.8 \approx 240$</p>

                         <p><strong>Step 7: Complete Nyquist plot</strong></p>
                         <p>The complete Nyquist plot after combining all the above four sections are shown below:</p>
                         <!-- Using corrected filename -->
                         <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_05_fe94132467efe45f3516g-098-1.jpg" alt="Complete Nyquist plot for the example system, combining mappings of C1, C2, C3, C4. Shows encirclement of -1+j0 for K>240." class="content-image">

                         <p>We will find the stability at the two values of K.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">K< 240</h4>
                         <p>When the value of K is less than 240, the contour does not cross the real axis to the left of -1, and the point -1 + j0 is <strong>not encircled</strong>. There are no open-loop poles on the right half of the s-plane (P=0). According to the Nyquist criterion (N = P - Z), the number of encirclements N must be 0 for stability (since P=0), which means Z=0 (no closed-loop poles in RHP). Hence, the system at this value of K is <strong>stable</strong>.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">K>240</h4>
                         <p>When the value of K is greater than 240, the contour crosses the real axis to the left of -1, and the point -1 + j0 is <strong>encircled two times</strong> in the <strong>clockwise</strong> direction (N=-2). There are no open-loop poles on the right half of the s-plane (P=0). According to the Nyquist criterion (N = P - Z), we have -2 = 0 - Z, which implies Z=2. This means there are two closed-loop poles in the right-half s-plane. Hence, the system at this value of K is <strong>unstable</strong>.</p>
                         <p>Thus, for the stability of the given transfer function, the value of K is $0 < K < 240$.</p>
