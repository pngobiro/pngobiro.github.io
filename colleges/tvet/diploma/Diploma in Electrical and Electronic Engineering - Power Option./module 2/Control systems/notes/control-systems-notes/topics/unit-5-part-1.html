                        <p>It comprises of two parts, transient part and the steady state part.</p>
                        <p>After applying an input to the control system, the output takes some time to reach the steady condition. The response during this stage is known as transient response and constitutes the transient part of the graph, as shown above. The graph when achieves the steady start after the transient part is known a steady part.</p>
                        <p>To describe a system, we need to develop the relationship between the inputs and output of the system that are the functions of time. The most common model used to describe such behavior is known as the differential equation. The analysis of the system can be done with the help of a differential equation by applying different inputs to it.</p>
                        <p>The common input signal is shown below:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Transient Response</h3>
                        <p>It is a part of the time response that reaches 0 (zero) when the time becomes very large. In the graph analysis containing poles and zeroes, the poles lying on the left half of the s-plane gives the transient response. We can also say that it is a part of the response where output continuously increases or decreases. The transient response is also known as the temporary part of the response.</p>
                        <p>Or</p>
                        <p>Transient response is defined as the change in the response of the system from the equilibrium state.</p>
                        <p>For example,</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The switching time of a bipolar transistor</h4>
                        <p>The characteristics BJT or Bipolar Junction transistor depicts the transient nature.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Steady-state response</h3>
                        <p>The response that comes after the transient response is called the steady-state response. In the graph analysis containing poles and zeroes, the poles on the imaginary axis give the steady-state response. We can also say that it is a part of the response where output remains constant. The output can also vary periodically with constant amplitude and frequency. The steady-state response is also known as the steady-state part of the response. It is a function of the input signal and hence also known as the forced response of the system.</p>
                        <p>Let's discuss some examples where we will find the transient and steady-state terms of the given equation.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Examples</h4>
                        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> $5 + 2e^{-t}$</p> <!-- Corrected caret notation -->
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                        <p>Here, the transient part of the equation is $2e^{-t}$ because as t approaches to infinity, the term becomes 0. Hence, $2e^{-t}$ is the transient term. In the case of the first term 5, it will remain same when t approaches infinity. Hence, 5 is the steady-state term of the equation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> $10 + 5e^{t}$</p> <!-- Corrected caret notation -->
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                        <p>Here, the first term, 10, is the steady-state term of the equation because it will remain the same when t approaches infinity. In the case of the second term, $5e^{t}$, the result is infinity when t approaches infinity. Hence, it is not a transient term. It is because something to the power infinity is always infinity.</p>
                         <p>So, there is only a steady-state term in the equation.</p>

                         <p>So, we can say that the transient response is the part of the response which goes to zero as time increases and the steady-state response is the part of the total response after transient has died. If the steady-state response is the part of the output does not match with the input then the system has a steady state error.</p>
