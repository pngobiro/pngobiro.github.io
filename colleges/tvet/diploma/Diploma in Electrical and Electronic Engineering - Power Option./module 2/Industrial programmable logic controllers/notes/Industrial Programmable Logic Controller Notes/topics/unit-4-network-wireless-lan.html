                         <p>UTP cable is a medium that is composed of pairs of wires and used in variety of networks.</p>
                         <p>Each of the eight individual copper wires in UTP cable is covered by an insulating material. In addition the wires in each pair are twisted around each other.</p>
                         <p>UTP cable must follow precise specification governing how many twists or braids permitted per meter of cable</p>
                         <p>It is often installed using a registered Jack 45 (RJ 45) connector. The RJ-45 is an eight wire connector used commonly to connect computers into a LAN especially Ethernets.</p>
                         <p>When used as a networks, UTP cable has four pairs of either 22 - or 24 American wire gauge (AWG) copper wire.</p>
                         <p>UTP used as a networking medium has an impedance of 1000 ohms whereas for telephone is 6000.</p>
                         <p>Commonly used type of UTP cabling are as follows:-</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">ii) Shielded twisted pair cable (STP)</h3>
                         <p>This cable combines the technique of shielding cancellation and wire twisting.</p>
                         <p>Each pain of wire is wrapped in a metal foil. The foil pairs of wires are then wrapped in an overall metallic braid or foil usually 150R cable.</p>
                         <p>As specified for use in Ethernet network installation, STP reduces electrical noise both within the cable (pair to pair coupling or cross talk) and from outside the cable (EMI or RFI).</p>
                         <p>STP usually is installed wire STP data connector which is created especially for the STP cable</p>
                         <p>However, STP cabling can also use the same RJ connector that UTP cable uses.</p>
                         <p>Although STP prevents interference better than UTP, it is more expensive and difficult to install.</p>
                         <p>In addition, the metallic shielding must be grounded at both ends. If it's improperly grounded, the shield acts like an antennae and picks up unwanted signals.</p>
                         <p>Because of its cost and difficulty with termination, STP is rarely used in Ethernet network.</p>
                         <p>The feature of STP cable are:-</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Coaxial cable (coax)</h3>
                         <p>It consists of a hollow other cylindrical conductor that surround a single inner wire made of two conducting elements.</p>
                         <p>One of these elements, located in the centre of the cable is a copper conductor surrounding the copper is a layer of flexible insulation.</p>
                         <p>Over this insulating material is a woven copper braid or metallic foil that acts both as the second wire in the circuit and as shield for the inner conductor.</p>
                         <p>This second layer or shield can help reduce the amount of outside interference.</p>

                         <p>The cable supports 10 to 100 mbps and relatively cheap. It can be cabled over longer distances than the twisted-pair cable.</p>
                         <p>It lowers with variety of sizes; the largest diameter (1cm) is specified for use as Ethernet backbone cable because it has greater transmission length and noise rejection characteristics. Mostly referred as thicknet coaxial cable with outside diameter of 0.3 cm is thin net.</p>
                         <p>The most common connectors used with thinnet are British Naval Connector (BNC) or (Bayonet Neill Concelman)</p>
                         <p>The basic BNC is a made type mounted at each end of a cable.</p>
                         <p>This connector has T centre Pin connected to the centre cable conductor and a metal tube connected to the outside cable shield.</p>
                         <p>A rotating ring outside the tube locks the cable to any female connectors.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Optical fibre</h3>
                         <p>It's a glass or plastic fibre designed to guide light along its length. The optic fiber therefore acts as a conduit (or wave-guide) for pulses of light generated by a light source.</p>
                         <p>The light source is typically either an injection laser diode (ILD) or LED operating at wavelengths of $0.85, 1.2$ or $1.5 \mu m$ (micrometers).</p>
                         <p>The optic fiber is coated with a protective colored sheath to provide stability and allow easy identification.</p>
                         <p>Fibre optics is widely used in fibre optic communication, which permits transmission over longer distance and at higher data rates.</p>
                         <p>Light is kept in the core of the optical fibre by total interval reflection. This causes the fibre to act as a wave guide.</p>
                         <p>A transverse mode of a beam of electromagnetic radiation in a particular intensity pattern of radiation measure in a plane perpendicular (i.e transverse) to the propagation direction of the beam.</p>
                         <p>Transverse modes occur because of boundary condition imposed on the wave by the wave guide.</p>
                         <p>Fiber optic cables offer the following advantages over other types of transmission media:</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">

                              <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Optical fiber cables do not conduct electricity and so eliminate problems of ground loops, lightning damage and electrical shock</span></li>

                         <p>An optical fibre whose core has a refractive index that decreases with increasing radial distance from the fibre axis which causes light rays to follow sinusoidal path down the fibre.</p>
                         <p>The resulting curved paths reduce multipath dispersion because high angle rays pass more through the lower index periphery of the core, rather than the high - index centre.</p>

                         <p>A bridge is a device that connects two or more local area network or two or more segments of the same network.</p>
                         <p>Bridge connects two networks (e.g 10 BASET Ethernet and Local Tank Connection) so that they can share information with each other.</p>
                         <p>In addition to connecting networks, they filter information so that network traffic intended for one portion of the network does not congest the rest of network.</p>
                         <p>Bridges may consist either standalone hardware devices or of software running on a client or server.</p>
                         <p>Like switches, bridges learn the MAC addresses of all connected clients, servers and peripherals and associate each address with a bridge port (network connection).</p>
                         <p>When a bridge (or switch) receives an incoming frame, it opens and reads its destination MAC address.</p>
                         <p>If the port that will receive the frame is different from the port connected to the sender, the bridge drops the frame.</p>
                         <p>If the bridge cannot determine which port is associated with a destination address, it passes the frame along to all ports.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">iii) Hubs</h3>
                         <p>This is a small box that gathers the signal from each individual device optionally amplifies each signal and then sends the signal out to all other connected devices.</p>
                         <p>Amplification helps to ensure that devices on the network receive variable information. Hubs are also called concentrators or repeaters.</p>
                         <p>They come in various sizes, 12 port or 24 port etc. All the client, servers and peripherals connected to a hub (or to a set of interconnected hubs) share the bandwidth (data delivery capacity) of that network.</p>
                         <p>They form a single collision domain - on area of an Ethernet network in which data sent to or from a device may potentially collide with the data from other devices.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">iv) Switches</h3>
                         <p>Like a hub, an Ethernet switch is a device that gathers the signals from devices that are connected to it, and then regenerates a new copy of each signal.</p>
                         <p>Switches are more powerful than hubs and can substantially increase the network performance</p>
                         <p>Most common switches operate by learning the MAC addresses of all connected clients, servers and peripheral and associating each address with one of its ports.</p>
                         <p>When a switch receives an incoming signal it creates a temporary circuit between the sender and receiver.</p>
                         <p>The temporary circuit provides two important benefits.</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
                              <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">The circuit allows the sender and receiver momentarily to exchange information without intrusion from other devices on the network.</span></li>
                              <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">The circuit ensures the information travels directly between the communicating computers.</span></li>
                          </ul>
                         <p>The switch installed should be compatible with physical network and data link protocols.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">v) Routers</h3>
                         <p>Like bridges, routers are devices whose primary purpose is to connect two or more networks and to filter network signals so that only desired information travels between them.</p>
                         <p>Routers regulate network traffic more precisely and are aware of many possible paths across the network and can choose the best one for each data packet to travel.</p>
                         <p>They operate primarily by examining incoming data for its network routing and transport information.</p>
                         <p>This information includes the source and destination network routing addresses.</p>
                         <p>Routers can be programmed to prevent information from being sent to or received from certain networks or computers based on all or part of their network routing addresses.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">vi) Multiplexers</h3>
                         <p>Multiplexers (mux) acts as both concentrators and contention devices that enable multiple relatively low speed terminal devices to share a single high capacity circuit (physical path) between two points in a network.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">vii) Modems</h3>
                         <p>These are devices that allow digital data signals to be transmitted across an analogue link.</p>
                         <p>Modem stand for Modulator Demodulator, and it changes signal to an analogue frequency and send this tone across the analogue link.</p>
                         <p>At the other end, another modem receives the signal and converts it back to digital.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">viii) Wireless Access Point (WAP)</h3>
                         <p>WAP is a device that allows wireless communication devices to connect to a wireless network using WI-FI, blue tooth or related standard.</p>
                         <p>The WAP usually connects to a wired network, and can relay data between the wireless devices and wired devices or the network.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">ix) Amplifiers and repeaters</h3>
                         <p>Electromagnetic energy attenuates over a distance whether the energy passes through a conductor or air. In addition to attenuating, the signal accumulates noise as it transverse the network, the amplifier boosts the noise along with the signal. The resulting signal to noise ratio (SNR) can produce unacceptable results.</p>
                         <p>These boosting units receive a weakened incoming signal and transmit a stronger outgoing signal, which propagates across the network, weakening until it reaches other boosting unit, and so on.</p>
                         <p>Analog networks make use of devices known as amplifiers. Digital networks employ repeaters</p>
                         <p>Amplifiers are spaced every 6 km or so in a typical analog voice. The exact spacing is sensitive to: transmission medium and carrier frequency which affects bandwidth, transmission speed and attenuation level.</p>
                         <p>The repeater essentially generates the binary value (1 or 0) of the weak incoming signal based on its relative voltage level and regenerates a strong signal of the same value without noise. This process enhances the signal quality.</p>
                         <p>Repeaters are spaced at approximately the same intervals as amplifiers.</p>
                         <p>Because repeaters work with the actual physical signal, and do not attempt to interpret the data being transmitted, they operate on the physical layer, the first layer of the OSI model.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">x) Fire wall</h3>
                         <p>A firewall is part of a computer system or network that is designed to block unauthorized access while permitting actual communication.</p>
                         <p>It is also a device or set of devices configured to permit, deny, encrypt, decrypt or proxy all computer traffic between difficult security. Domain based upon a set of rules and other criteria.</p>
                         <p>It can be implemented in both hardware or software or a combination of both.</p>
                         <p>Firewalls can be an effective means of protecting a local system or network of systems from network based security threats while at the same time affording access to the outside world via wide area networks and the internet.</p>
                         <p>Firewall provides an additional layer of defense, insulating the internal systems from external networks.</p>
                         <p>Firewall has the following capabilities.</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">

                         </ul>
                         <p>However firewalls have their limitations including:-</p>
                          <ul class="enhanced-list">
                              <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">It cannot protect against attacks that by passes the firewall</span></li>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Types of firewalls</h4>
                         <h5>1. Packet filtering firewalls</h5>
                         <p>It applies a set of rules to each incoming and outgoing IP packet and then forwards or discards the packet. It is typically configured to filter packets going in both direction (from and to the internal network)</p>
                         <p>It generally falls into two subcategories; stateful and stateless.</p>
                         <p><strong>Stateful firewalls</strong> maintain context about active section, and use that state information to speed packet processing. If a packet does not watch on existing connection, it will be evaluated according to the ruleset for new connections.</p>
                         <p><strong>Stateless firewalls</strong> require less memory and can be faster for simple filters that require less time to filter them to look up a session.</p>
                         <p>The major advantage of packet filtering firewalls is its simplicity. Also, packet filters typically are transparent to user end are very fast..</p>
                         <p>However packet filtering firewall has the following weaknesses:-</p>
                          <ul class="enhanced-list">
                               <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Most do not support advanced user authentication schemes</span></li>
                               <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">It is vulnerable to attacks and exploits that take advantage of problems within the TCP/IP specification and protocol stack such as network layer address spoofing.</span></li>
                               <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">It is susceptible to security breaches caused by improper configuration.</span></li>
                               <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">It does not examine upper layer data, hence it cannot prevent attacks that employ application</span></li>
                            </ul>
                         <h5>2) Application - level firewall</h5>
                         <p>Also called application proxy, acts as a relay of application - level traffic.</p>
                         <p>The user contacts the gateway using TCP/IP application and the gateway asks the user for the name of the remote hot to be accessed.</p>
                         <p>It works on the application level of the TCP/IP stack and may intercept all packets traveling to or from an application.</p>
                         <p>They block other packets (usually dropping them without acknowledgement to the sender)</p>
                         <p>It functions by determining whether a process should accept any given connection. It accomplishes their function by hooking into socket cause to filter the connection between the application layer and the lower layer of the OSI model.</p>
                         <p>It work much as like a packet filter but application filters apply filtering rules (allow/block) on a per process basis instead of filtering connections on a per port basis.</p>
                         <p>The major advantages of these fire walls are:</p>
                           <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">It is more secure than packet filters</span></li>
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">It is easy to log and audit all incoming traffic at the application level.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                         <p>However the disadvantage is:</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">The additional processing overhead on each connection.</span></li>
                         </ul>
                         <h5>3) Proxies</h5>
                         <p>A proxy server may act as firewall by responding to put packets (connection requests) in the manner of an application, while blocking other packets.</p>
                         <p>It is a gateway from one network to another for a specific network application in the sense that it functions as a proxy on behalf of the network user.</p>
                         <p>Proxies make tampering with an internal system from the external network more difficult and misuse of one internal system would not necessarily cause a security breach exploitable from outside the firewall.</p>
