                        <p>In modern manufacturing and industrial processes, mining industries, public and private utilities, leisure and security industries telemetry is often needed to connect equipment and systems separated by large distances.</p>
                        <p>Control system architecture can range from simple local control to highly redundant distributed control. The SCADA system applies to facilities that are large enough that a central control system is necessary.</p>
                        <p><dfn>SCADA</dfn> refers to the combination of telemetry and data acquisition. It encompasses the collecting of the information, transferring it back to the central site, carrying out any necessary analysis and control, and then displaying that information on a number of operator screens or displays. The required control actions are then conveyed back to the process.</p>
                        <p>SCADA is a widely distributed computerized system primarily used to remotely control and monitor the conditions of field based assets from a centralized location.</p>
                        <p>The PLC is still one of the most widely used control systems in industry. As need to monitor and control more devices in the plant grew, the PLCs were distributed and the systems became more intelligent and smaller in size. PLCs and DCS (distributed control systems) are used</p>

                         <p>Data acquisition within SCADA system is accomplished first by the RTU scanning the field data interface devices connected to the RTU.</p>

                         <p>It describes a system architecture in which sensors, controllers and controlled equipments are within close proximity and the scope of each controller is limited to a specific system or sub-system.</p>

                         <p>Describes a system in which all sensors, actuators and other equipment within the facility are connected to a single controller or a group of controllers located in a common control room.</p>

                         <p>In a DCS, controllers are provided locally to systems or group of equipment but networked to one or more operator stations in a central location through a digital communication circuit.</p>
                         <p>Control action for each system or subsystem takes place in a local controller but the central operator station has complete visibility of the status of all systems and the input and output data in each controller, as well as the ability to intervene in the control logic of the local controller if necessary.</p>
                         <p>In a DSC, data acquisition and control functions are performed by a number of distributed micro-processor-based units, situated near to the devices being controlled or the instrument from which data is being gathered.</p>
                         <p>Input and output wiring runs are short and less vulnerable to physical description or electro-magnetic interference.</p>
                         <p>The data highway is normally capable of high speed</p>

                         <p>UCOS is a control system that employs object-oriented techniques at every level of its system architecture. It includes a number of subsystems which segment the functionality of UCOS. This includes an Engineering Workstation Subsystem, an Operator Workstation Subsystem, and a Field Control Unit (FCU) Controller Subsystem. The subsystems communicate via a Control Network.</p>

                         <p><dfn>Access control</dfn> is the selective restriction to access to a plant/place or other resources. Hence the security access control is the act of ensuring that an authenticated user accesses only what they are authorized to and no more.</p>
                         <p>SCADA systems are used to control and monitor physical processes, however the security of these system is important because compromise or destruction of these system may impact multiple areas of society or industries.</p>

                         <p>Where a single protection measure has been deployed to protect a system, there is a risk that if a weakness in that measure is identified and exploited there is effectively no protection provided.</p>
                         <p>No single security measure itself is foolproof as vulnerabilities and weaknesses could be identified at any point in time. In order to reduce these risks, implementing multiple protection measures in series avoids single points of failure.</p>
                         <p>In order to safeguard the process control system from electronic attacks (e.g. hackers, worms and viruses), it may be insufficient to rely on a single firewall, designed to protect the corporate IT network.</p>
                         <p>A much more effective security model is to build on the benefits of the corporate firewall with an additional dedicated process control firewall and deploy other protection measures such as anti-virus software and intrusion detection</p>
