                        <p>In industrial process control, the <dfn>Process Variable (PV)</dfn> is measured by an instrument in the field and acts as an input to an automatic controller which takes action based on the value of it.</p>
                        <p>The PV is the parameter that is to be controlled. To be controlled, the PV must be capable of being measured and that measurement converted into a signal that can be acted on by the controller.</p>
                        <p>Devices that measure PV are <dfn>transducers</dfn> or <dfn>sensors</dfn>. In many cases, the PV sensor consists of a direct measurement device called an <dfn>element</dfn> and a separate signal processor called a <dfn>transmitter</dfn>.</p>
                        <p>The <dfn>set-point</dfn> is the desired value of the PV, normally preset into the control system by an operator, or derived as an output of another control calculation.</p>
                        <p>The <dfn>error signal</dfn> is the difference between the PV and the set-point, and is the basis for control action.</p>
                        <p>The <dfn>controller</dfn> is the device that processes the error signal, determines the required control action and provides a control output <dfn>Manipulated Variable (MV)</dfn> to the process. The device that converts the control output into control action is the <dfn>actuator</dfn>.</p>

                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In control, there are control systems which can be discrete or analog, manual or automated, periodic or continuous.</p>
                        <p>There are five basic forms of control available in Process Control:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text"><strong>On-Off control:</strong> The oldest strategy for control is to use a switch giving simple on-off control. This is a discontinuous form of control action, and is also referred to as two-position control. A perfect on-off controller is 'on' when the measurement is below the set-point (SP) and the manipulated variable (MV) is at its maximum value. Above the SP, the controller is 'off' and the MV is at a minimum.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Modulating control:</strong> If the output of a controller can move through a range of values, this is modulating control. Modulation Control takes place within a defined operating range only. That is, it must have upper and lower limits. Modulating control is a smoother form of control than step control. It can be used in both open loop and closed loop control systems.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Open loop control:</strong> Open loop control is thus called because the control action (Controller Output Signal) is not a function of the PV (Process Variable) or load changes. The open loop control does not self-correct, when these PV's drift.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">4.</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Feed forward control:</strong> Feed forward control is a form of control based on anticipating the correct manipulated variables required to deliver the required output variable. It is seen as a form of open loop control as the PV is not used directly in the control action.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">5.</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Closed loop or feedback control:</strong> If the PV, the objective of control, is used to determine the control action it is called closed loop control system.</span></li>

                         <p><dfn>Industrial Automation</dfn> is a discipline that includes knowledge and expertise from various branches of engineering including electrical, electronics, chemical, mechanical, communications and more recently computer and software engineering.</p>
                         <p><dfn id="ics">Industrial Control System (ICS)</dfn> is a term that encompasses several types of control systems used in industrial production.</p>
                         <p>These include: <dfn id="scada">Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)</dfn> systems, <dfn id="dcs">Distributed Control Systems (DCS)</dfn> and other smaller control systems configuration such as <dfn id="plc">Programmable Logic controllers (PLC)</dfn>.</p>
                         <p>The application for industrial process control systems are diverse ranging from simple traffic control to complex electrical grid, from environmental control system to oil refinery process control.</p>
                         <p>The intelligence of these automated systems lies in their measurement and control units.</p>
                         <p><strong>SCADA</strong> is a combination of telemetry and data acquisition. It encompasses the collecting of the information, transferring it back to the central site, carrying out any necessary analysis and control and then displaying that information on a number of operator screens or displays. The SCADA is a centralized system and is composed of various subsystems like <dfn id="rtu">Remote Telemetry Units</dfn>, <dfn id="hmi">Human Machine Interface</dfn>, Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and Communications networks.</p>
                         <p><strong>DCS</strong> is a process-oriented system and it treats the control of the process as its main task, and it presents data to operators as part of its job.</p>
                         <p><strong>PLC</strong> is an industrial computer control system that continuously monitors the state of input devices and makes decision based upon a custom program, to control the state of devices connected as output. They are based on the Boolean logic operations whereas some models use timers and some have continuous control. These devices are computer based and are used to control various process and equipments within a facility. PLCs control the components in the DCS and SCADA systems but they are primary/main components in smaller control configurations.</p>
                         <p><strong>Embedded Control:</strong> In this control system, small components are attached to the industrial computer system with the help of a network and control is exercised.</p>
                         <p><strong>User Configuration Open System (UCOS)</strong> is a control system that employs object-oriented technique at every level of its system architecture, and includes a number of subsystems which segment the functionality of UCOS. The subsystems include: an Engineering Workstation Subsystem, an Operator Workstation Subsystem, and a Field Control Unit (FCU) Controller Subsystem. The subsystems communicate via a Control Network.</p>
