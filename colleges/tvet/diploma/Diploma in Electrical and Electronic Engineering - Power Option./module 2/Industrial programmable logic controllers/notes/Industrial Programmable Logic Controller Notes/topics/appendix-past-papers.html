                        <p><strong>i) Remote Terminal unit (RTU)</strong><br>
                        <strong>ii) Human Machine Interface (HMI)</strong></p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>A SCADA system usually consists of the following components:</p>
                            <p>(i) <strong>Remote Terminal Unit (RTU):</strong>- RTU is a device installed at a remote location that collects data, codes the data into a format that is transmittable and transmits the data back to a central station, or master (supervisory system). An RTU also collects information from the master device and implements processes that are directed by the master</p>
                            <p>(ii) <strong>A human-machine interface or HMI</strong> is the apparatus or device which presents processed data to a human operator, and through this, the human operator monitors and controls the process. The HMI of a SCADA system is where data is processed and presented to be viewed and monitored by a human operator. This interface usually includes control where the individual can interface with the SCADA system</p>
                            <p>(iii)<strong>A supervisory (computer) system/ Master Terminal Unit (MTU):</strong>- gathering (acquiring) data on the process and sending commands (control) to the process. This is the servers and software responsible for communicating with the field equipment (RTUs, PLCs, etc), and then to the HMI software running on workstations in the control room, or elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>(iv)<strong>Programmable logic controller (PLCs)</strong> used as field devices because they are more economical, versatile, flexible, and configurable than special-purpose RTUs.</p>
                            <p>(v) <strong>Communication Network:</strong> Communication infrastructure connecting the supervisory system to the remote terminal units. The communication equipment needed to transfer the data to and from different sites to the central station. The medium used can either be cable or telephone. Remotes are usually not Accessible by telephone lines. The use of radio offers an economical solution. Modems are used to connect the remote sites to the host.</p>
                            <p>(vi)<strong>Field Instrumentation:</strong> refers to the devices that are connected to the equipment or machines being controlled and monitored by the SCADA system .These are sensors for monitoring certain parameters; and actuators for controlling certain modules of the system.</p>
                         </blockquote>

                         <p><strong>i) Border router Firewalls</strong><br>
                         <strong>ii) Proxy server</strong></p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>(i) <strong>Border router</strong> is a router that is usually deployed in front of the organization's main firewalls and performs some basic checks on network activity, such as ingress and egress filtering that may be helpful in stopping some Internet-based worms from reaching the organization's firewall. Although the firewall should also block such worms, having the Internet border routers do so can take some load off the firewall. During a major worm incident, organizations might need to reconfigure some of their Internet border routers to block incoming worm activity so that the firewalls do not become overloaded.</p>
                            <p>(ii) <strong>Proxy server</strong> is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource available from a different server and the proxy server evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control its complexity. A proxy server is associated with or part of a gateway server that separates the enterprise network from the outside network and a firewall server that protects the enterprise network from outside intrusion. Proxy servers have two main purposes:</p>

                            <p>(i) <strong>Master Slave Mode:</strong> This means that during normal operation, each slave (field device) communication is initiated by a master communication device. Two masters can connect to each HART loop. The primary master is generally a distributed control system (DCS), programmable logic controller (PLC), or a personal computer (PC). The secondary master can be a handheld terminal or another PC. Slave devices include transmitters, actuators, and controllers that respond to commands from the primary or secondary master.</p>
                            <p>(ii) <strong>Burst Mode:</strong> It enables faster communication (3-4 data updates per second). In burst mode, the master instructs the slave device to continuously broadcast a standard HART reply message (e.g., the value of the process variable). The master receives the message at the higher rate until it instructs the slave to stop bursting. Use of burst mode enables more than one passive HART device to listen to communications on the HART loop.</p>

                              <p>In a mesh network, devices are connected with many redundant interconnections between network nodes. In a true mesh topology every node has a connection to every other node in the network. There are two types of mesh topologies:</p>
                              <p>(i) <strong>Full mesh topology</strong> occurs when every node has a circuit connecting it to every other node in a network. Full mesh is very expensive to implement but yields the greatest amount of redundancy, so in the event that one of those nodes fails, network traffic can be directed to any of the other nodes. Full mesh is usually reserved for backbone networks.</p>
                              <p>(ii) <strong>Partial mesh topology</strong> is less expensive to implement and yields less redundancy than full mesh topology. With partial mesh, some nodes are organized in a full mesh scheme but others are only connected to one or two in the network. Partial mesh topology is commonly found in peripheral networks connected to a full meshed backbone.</p>

                         <p><strong>i) Unitary</strong><br>

                         <strong>iii) Rack Mounting</strong></p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>(i) <strong>Unitary:</strong> The Unitary PLC is typically the smallest and least expensive. It would be used in a small machine or fixed application such as overhead door controls or a stand-alone parts inspection system. They are not expandable so the application is limited to onboard I/O. There are, however, some very powerful units available with built in GSM, color screens, and web servers. Most have 1 or 2 analog I/O channels as well as a high speed input and pulse train output for simple motion control.</p>
                            <p>(ii) <strong>Modular:</strong> The Modular PLCs start with a processor with a few or no on-board I/O. They typically mount to a DIN rail and sometimes require a separate power supply. Additional I/O as well as specialty modules also snap onto the DIN rail and plug into the processor or adjacent module. Modular PLCs are used in applications where a higher I/O count is needed or when using specialty modules such as quadrature encoders, thermocouple inputs, etc. They are also useful in small applications that have options or ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù available to the end user. Systems can be expanded (within certain limits) without adding additional rack space.</p>
                            <p>(iii)<strong>Rack Mounting PLCs</strong> are usually more expensive, expandable, and powerful than unitary or modular PLCs. The rack provides a power and communication backplane that greatly increases the communication rate between the processor and the modules as well as allowing some specialty modules to communicate with each other without the processor. In some brands, multiple processors can be in the same rack and share the inputs. Racks also allow for redundant processors for critical systems such as waste water pumps or fire control systems. The types of modules available for rack systems are far more extensive than modular systems. The number of available I/O points is also much higher in the rack systems. Around 1000 for some modular PLCs versus over 100,000 for the same brand of rack system</p>

                            <p><strong>Program scan:</strong> Following the input scan, the CPU enters its user program execution, or program scan. The execution involves starting at the program's first instruction, then moving on to the second instruction and carrying out its execution sequence. This continues to the last program instruction. Throughout the user-program execution, the CPU continually keeps its output image (memory) table up-to-date.</p>
                            <p><strong>Output scan:</strong> During program scan, the output modules themselves are not kept continually up to date. Instead, the entire output image table is transferred to the output modules during the output scan which comes after the program execution. Thus the output devices are activated accordingly during the output scan.</p>

                            <p>(i) <strong>Ethernet</strong> works on the principle of media access controlled by a collision detection mechanism. Each station is identified by a unique key, or MAC address, to ensure that every computer on an Ethernet network has a different address. This technology known as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) ensures that only one station can transmit a message on the medium at a time. Successive Ethernet upgrades have given rise to the IEEE 802.3 standard which only defines the characteristics of the physical layers; the way the data accesses the network and the data frame must be defined by further layers.</p>
                            <p>(ii) <strong>DeviceNet</strong> is a network system used in the automation industry to interconnect control devices for data exchange. It uses Controller Area Network as the backbone technology and defines an application layer to cover a range of device profiles.

The number of devices attached to a PA segment is limited by this feature. PA has a data transmission rate of 31.25 kbps .</span></li>

                         <p><strong>a) Define the term 'Computer networking'</strong></p>
                         <blockquote><p>Computer networking is the interconnection, as over communication lines, of computer systems. This involves connecting computers and peripherals using pieces of equipment; switches and routers etc to enable the devices that are connected to your network to communicate with each other, as well as with other networks.</p></blockquote>

                         <p><strong>i) LAN</strong><br>

                             <p>(i) <strong>Local Area Network LAN</strong> - These types of computer networks connect network devices over a relatively short distance. Quite often, a networked office building, home or school contains a single LAN although it is normal to come across a building that contains a few small LANs. On a few occasions, a LAN may also span over a group of nearby buildings. Such computer networks are usually owned by one organization.</p>
                             <p>(ii) <strong>Wide Area Network WAN</strong> - As the name suggests, a WAN spans over a large physical distance. It may be regarded as a collection of LANs dispersed over a geographical area. The internet is a very good example of a WAN. LANs are connected to a WAN through a device referred to as a router. In IP networking, both the LAN and WAN addresses are maintained by the router. Most WANs exist under distributed or collective ownership and management and unlike the LANs, are not necessarily owned by one organization.</p>
                             <p>(iii) <strong>Wireless Local Area Network WLAN</strong> - These types of computer networks refer to LANs that are based on Wi-Fi wireless network technology.</p>
                             <p>(iv) <strong>Metropolitan Area Network MAN</strong> - This is a network that spans over a physical area like a city that is smaller than a WAN but larger than a LAN. Quite often, such computer networks are owned and operated by single entities such as government bodies or large corporations</p>

                             <p>A star topology is designed with each node (file server, workstations, and peripherals) connected directly to a central network hub, switch, or concentrator. Data on a star network passes through the hub, switch, or concentrator before continuing to its destination. The hub, switch, or concentrator manages and controls all functions of the network. It also acts as a repeater for the data flow. This configuration is common with twisted pair cable; however, it can also be used with coaxial cable or fiber optic cable.</p>

                               <p>A local-area network (LAN) whose topology is a ring. That is, all of the nodes are connected in a closed loop. Messages travel around the ring, with each node reading those messages addressed to it. One of the advantages of ring networks is that they can span larger distances than other types of networks, such as bus networks, because each node regenerates messages as they pass through it.</p>
                               <h4>Mesh network Topology</h4>
                               <p>The mesh network topology employs either of two schemes, called full mesh and partial mesh. In the full mesh topology, each workstation is connected directly to each of the others. In the partial mesh topology, some workstations are connected to all the others, and some are connected only to those other nodes with which they exchange the most data.</p>
                               <h4>Tree Network Topology</h4>
                               <p>The tree network topology uses two or more star networks connected together. The central computers of the star networks are connected to a main bus. Thus, a tree network is a bus network of star networks.</p>

                         <blockquote>
                            <p>With any PLC controlled plant, by far the greater percentage of the faults are likely to be with sensors, actuators and wiring rather than within the PLC itself.</p>
                            <p>Of the faults within the PLC, most are likely to be in the input/output channels or power supply rather than in the CPU.</p>
                            <p>The actual fault finding starts once the actual status has been established and compared with the required status. This comparison frequently leads to the discovery of the error source, if the fault is visible (e.g. mechanical damage to a signal generator), audible (e.g. leakage on a valve), detectable by smell (e.g. cable burnt out). If this is not the case, the fault can only be found and eliminated by means of a systematic procedure.</p>
                            <p>Many PLCs provide built-in fault analysis procedures which carry out self-testing and display fault codes, with possibly a brief message, which can be translated by looking up the code in a list to give the source of the fault and possible methods of recovery. For example, the fault code may indicate that the source of the fault is in a particular module with the method of recovery given as replace that module or perhaps switch the power off and then on.</p>

                         <p><strong>b) Describe the following fault detection techniques in reference to PLCs:</strong></p>
                         <p><strong>i) time checks ii) Replication Fault Detection Techniques</strong></p>
                          <blockquote>
                              <p>(i) <strong>Timing checks:</strong> The term watchdog is used for a timing check that is carried out by the PLC to check that some function has been carried out within the normal time. If the function is not carried out within the normal time then a fault is assumed to have occurred and the watchdog timer trips, setting off an alarm and perhaps closing down the PLC. As part of the internal diagnostics of PLCs, watchdog timers are used to detect for faults. The watchdog timer is preset to a time slightly longer than the scan time would normally be. They are then set at the beginning of each program scan and if the cycle time is as normal they do not time out and are reset at the end of a cycle ready for the next cycle. However, if the cycle time is longer than it would normally be, the watchdog timer times out and indicate that the system has a fault. Time checks can also be built into the ladder logic program. This is where additional ladder rungs might be includes so that when a function starts a timer is started. If the function does not complete when the timer finishes a fault is signaled.</p>
                              <p>(ii) <strong>Last output set:</strong> This technique involves the use of status lamps to indicate the last output that has been set during a process which has come to a halt. Such lamps are built into the program so that as each output occurs a lamp comes on. The lamps on thus indicate which outputs are occurring. The program has to be designed to turn off previous status lamps and turn on a new status lamp as each new output is turned on.</p>
                              <p>(iii)<strong>Replication:</strong> Where there is concern regarding safety in the case of a fault developing, checks may be constantly used to detect faults. One technique is replication checks which involves duplicating, i.e. replicating, the PLC system. This could mean that the system repeats every operation twice and if it gets the same result it is assumed there is no fault. This procedure can detect transient faults. A more expensive alternative is to have duplicate PLC systems and compare the results given by the two systems. In the absence of a fault the two results should be the same, a fault showing up as a difference.</p>
                              <p>(iv) <strong>Expected value checks:</strong> Software errors can be detected by checking whether an expected value is obtained when a specific input occurs. If the expected value is not obtained then a fault is assumed to be occurring.</p>

                          <p><strong>c) i) Define the term calibration with reference to PLCs.</strong></p>
                          <blockquote><p>Calibration is the process of checking PLC/field devices and making sure that values used in measurements remain at standard points. It is the process of verifying the PLC and I/O devices work and performance within a set of specifications.

                              <p>Networking cables are used to connect one network device to other network devices or to connect two or more computers to share resources. Different types of network cables like Coaxial cable, Optical fiber cable, Twisted Pair cables are used depending on the network's topology, protocol and size. The devices can be separated by a few meters (e.g. via Ethernet) or nearly unlimited distances (e.g. via the interconnections of the Internet).</p>
                              <p><strong>Twisted pair</strong> cabling is a form of wiring in which pairs of wires (the forward and return conductors of a single circuit) are twisted together for the purposes of canceling out electromagnetic interference (EMI) from other wire pairs and from external sources. This type of cable is used for home and corporate Ethernet networks. There are two types of twisted pair cables: shielded, unshielded. STP is commonly used in Token Ring networks and UTP in Ethernet networks where it is referred to as "10baseT and above." Transmission rates vary between 10-1000 Mbps.</p>
                              <p><strong>Fiber-optic cable</strong> consists of a thin cylinder of glass surrounded by glass cladding, encased in protective outer sheath. Fiber-optic cable is very fast ( 100 -1000 Mbps ). It can transmit over long distances ( 2 km+ ) but is expensive.</p>
                              <p><strong>Coaxial cable</strong> has a single copper conductor at its center. A plastic layer provides insulation between the center conductor and a braided metal shield. The metal shield helps to block any outside interference. Coaxial cable comes in two versions: Thinnet and Thicknet. Thinnet is about 1/4 inch in diameter and is very flexible and easy to work with.</p>
                              <p>In contrast, Thicknet is about 1/2 inch in diameter and not very flexible. Coax transmits at 10 Mbps .</p>

It has the advantage of being very flexible to run and repair. The end stations are linked together via an intermediate device (repeater, switch). Failure of a node does not prevent the network as a whole from working, though the intermediate device linking the nodes together is a point of weakness.</p>
                               <p><strong>Bus topology:</strong> This is one of the simplest layouts; all the elements are wired together along the same transmission line. The word bus refers to the physical line. This topology is easily implemented and the failure of a node or element does not prevent the other devices from working. Machine and sensor level networks, otherwise known as field buses, use this system. The bus topology is implemented by linking devices together in a chain or to the main cable via a connection box (TAP)</p>

                                <p>CAN (Controller Area Network) is a serial bus based on a publisher/subscriber model in which a publisher sends a message to subscribers. CAN was developed with broadcast architecture.</p>
                                <p>The sender (publisher) sends the message with an identifier. The recipients (subscribers) filter messages from the bus based on their send identifier.</p>

                                <p>read and process it. The recipient then becomes a sender.</p>
                                <p>The diagram shows the push (send) mode of the publisher/subscriber model. CAN also support its pull (receive) mode.</p>
                                <p>A client can send a message based on a remote transmission request (RTR), which is a CAN frame with RTR flags (status bits). When the producer receives such a request, it transmits the related answer.</p>
                                <p>In a broadcast architecture, the network nodes can transmit at the same time. CAN have 2 mechanisms to deal with this: first, a sender surveys the communication artery to check if another node is already transmitting.</p>
                                <p>If the artery is free, the node starts to transmit. Several nodes can start transmitting but never at the same time. This problem is overcome by a priority system.</p>
