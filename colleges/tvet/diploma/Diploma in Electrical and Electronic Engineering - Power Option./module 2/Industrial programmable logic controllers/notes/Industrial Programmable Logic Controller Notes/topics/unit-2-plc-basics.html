                        <p><strong>PLC</strong> is a unit of hardware used to control and automate industrial processes. It is a micro-computer based controller that uses stored instructions in programmable memory to implement logic, sequencing, timing, counting and arithmetic functions through digital or analog input/output modules, for controlling machines and processes.</p>
                        <p>The term <strong>logic</strong> is used because programming is primarily concerned with implementing logic and switching operation.</p>
                        <p>The PLC is designed as replacement for the hard-wired relay and timer logic to be found in traditional control panels, where PLC provides ease and flexibility of control based on programming and executing logic instructions.</p>
                        <p>A PLC has three main aspects: the inputs and outputs and the control program. In figure below, PLC has eight inputs and four outputs.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>input</strong> is anything that can sense the status of the environment and then convert that information in to a signal. Often the signal can simply be a voltage that is either on or off. For example, input devices can be proximity switches, photoelectric sensors, temperature sensors, push buttons, or pressure sensors.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The <strong>outputs</strong> are connected to the devices that need to be controlled like motors, indicator lights, fans, warning sirens or heating elements.</p>
                        <p>Control processes need devices to monitor events or measure needed values. These devices are generically called <strong>inputs</strong> to the PLC.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>program</strong> uses a set of logical instructions that drives the outputs based on the inputs.</p>

                    </h2>
                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Hardwired panels were very time consuming to wire, debug and change. The PLCs eliminates much of the hard wiring that was associated with conventional relay control circuits.</p>
                        <p>PLCs have the great advantage that the same basic controller can be used with a wide range of control systems.</p>
                        <p>PLCs require shorter installation and commissioning times than do hard-wired systems. To modify a control system and the rules that are to be used, all that is necessary is for an operator to key in a different set of instructions. There is no need to rewire.</p>
                        <p>The result is a flexible, cost effective, system which can be used with control systems which vary quite widely in their nature and complexity.</p>
                        <p>PLCs are similar to computers but whereas computers are optimized for calculation and display tasks, PLCs are optimized for control tasks and the industrial environment.</p>
                        <p>Thus PLCs have specific features suited for industrial control :-</p>

                         <p><strong>Input/output (I/O)</strong> is information representing the data that is received from senses elements / devices and the commands that are sent to actuating and indicating devices. The I/O system is collection of physical elements of the control system that either provide or use I/O data.</p>
                         <p>The term <dfn>sensor</dfn> is used for an input device that provides a usable output in response to a specified physical input. For example, a thermocouple is a sensor which converts a temperature difference into an electrical output.</p>
                         <p>The term <dfn>transducer</dfn> is generally used for a device that converts a signal from one form to a different physical form.

                         <p>The number of I/O devices used within a control system is called its <dfn>point count</dfn>. Thus the total number of digital and analog point is used to give an indication of the size of a control system.</p>
                         <p>PLC has input and output lines through which is connected to a system it directs. Any electrical signal processing always requires a voltage supply (an active part) and a load (passive part) or vice versa.</p>
                         <p>I/O modules connect "real world" field devices to the controller. They convert the electrical signals used in the field devices into electronic signals that can be used by the control system, and translate real world values to IO table values.</p>

                         <p>Analog input devices senses continuous parameters common analog inputs are pressure, temperature, speed transducers etc.</p>
                         <p>An analog input card converts a voltage by current (e.g. signal that can be anywhere from 0 to 20 mA ) into digitally equivalent number that can be understood by the CPU.</p>
                         <p>To input an analog voltage (into a PLC or any other computer) the continuous voltage value must be sampled and then converted to a numerical value by an A/D converter. The process of sampling the data is not instantaneous, so each sample has a start and stop time. The time required to acquire the sample is called the <strong>sampling time</strong>. A/D converters can only acquire a limited number of samples per second. The time between samples is called the <strong>sampling period T</strong>, and the inverse of the sampling period is the <strong>sampling frequency</strong> (also called sampling rate). The sampling time is often much smaller than the sampling period</p>
                         <p>Analog output devices respond to a range of output values from the controller common analog output signals include motor speed, valve position, air pressure etc. An analog output card will convert a digital number sent by the CPU to its real world voltage or current. Analog device data requires significantly more manipulation and processing then digital device data.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Digital input and output devices</h3>
                         <p>Inputs come from sensors that translate physical phenomena into digital signal. Thus digital input devices may be either on or off, they may not hold any other value.</p>
                         <p>Common digital field input devices include push buttons, unit switches and photo eyes.</p>
                         <p>Digital output devices are devices which give either on or off. Common types are relays, motor starter, solenoid valves etc.</p>
