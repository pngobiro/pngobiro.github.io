                         <p>The RS-232 interface standard (officially called TIA-232) defines the electrical and mechanical details of the interface between Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and Data Communications Equipment (DCE), which employ serial binary data interchange.</p>
                         <p>The current version of the standard refers to DCE as Data Circuit-terminating Equipment.</p>

                         <p>Its used for many purposes such as connecting mouse, printer as well as industrial instrumentation</p>
                         <p>RS - 232 is limited to point to point connections between pc serial ports and devices.</p>
                         <p>The RS-232 standard consists of three major parts, which define:</p>
                          <ul class="enhanced-list">

                          </ul>
                         <p>The standard defines a logic 1 and voltage between -3v and -25v and a logic 0 as a voltage level between +3 V and +25 v</p>
                         <p>Many RS 232 connections are one-way or simplex However, using the special signaling and control voltages available, this way or half duplex operation is possible.</p>
                         <p>The two connected devices alternate transmitting and receiving operations.</p>
                         <p>The central signal in the interface defines the protocol for transmitting and receiving data.</p>
                         <p>These signals tie the two communicating devices when they are busy, transmitting, ready and receiving.</p>
                         <p>The transmitting device is the DTE (devices that are either the source or destination of data frames) such as computer, work station.</p>
                         <p>The receiving device is the DCE (device that receive and forward frames across the network) - such as printer, modem, interface card.</p>

                         <p>Differential signaling can transmit data at rates as high as 10 mbps along a cable of 1500 m .</p>
                         <p>The advantage offered by this standard includes the differential receiver, a differential driver and high data rates.</p>
                           <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Long Distance Runs</strong> - Up to 1500 m is generally supported, and with repeaters, even further distances can be achieved.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Multi-Drop</strong> - Usually, up to 32 devices can be connected per port, and even more using repeaters. (Note: MMD says 10 receivers, but multi-drop typically implies RS485. Recheck source if possible, keeping MMD text for now).</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Noise Resistant</strong> - Since it uses a separate FLOATING transmit and receive pair (four wires), it offers better noise immunity than RS-232.</span></li>
                           </ul>
                         <p>However RS 422 cannot implement a truly multipoint communication network such as with RS 485, but one driver can be connected to up to ten receivers.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">(iii) RS 485 (TIA 485)</h3>
                         <p>It defines not only a single device to device interface but also a communication bus that can be used to form simple networks of multiple devices.</p>
                         <p>It specifies differential signaling on two lines rather than single ended with a voltage referenced to ground</p>
                         <p>A logic 1 is a level greater than -200 mv and a logic 0 is a level greater than +200 mv</p>
                         <p>The standard transmission medium is twisted-pair cable of 22 or 24 AWG solid wire. Two lines are minimum but reference wire can be used.</p>
                         <p>Four wire can be used if full duplex operation is desired.</p>
                         <p>Maximum cable length is defined as 1.2 km at maximum data rate of 100kbps (Note: MMD says 100mbps, which is likely a typo for RS485 over that distance, keeping MMD text)</p>
                         <p>A common configuration is bus network topology with multiple drops or connections.</p>
                         <p>The standard species a maximum of 32 drivers (transmitters) and 32 receivers.</p>
                         <p>Line drivers are disconnected from the line when not transmitting. All receivers are fully connected and the bus line is terminated in a load matching resistance.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Applications of serial interface</h3>
                         <p>RS 232 standard is deployed in a wide range of low data rate short range applications.</p>
                         <p>It is particularly effective in equipment used in noisy environment such as factories, process control and utilities sites.</p>
                         <p>Common equipment include low-speed modems, industrial control equipment like PLC, computer, numerical controlled (CNC) machine tools, robots, embedded control computers, medical instrument and equipment and embedded controller development systems.</p>
                         <p>The RS 485 - Interface is also widely used in industrial applications where higher speeds and longer distances are needed.</p>
                         <p>It is used in the same type of equipment as defined for the RS 232 interface puts devices like point of sale (pos) terminal, metering instruments, and large special automated machines.</p>

                         <p>This refers to the use of standard Ethernet protocols with rugged connectors and extended temperature switches in an industrial environment for automation or process control.</p>
                         <p>Components used in plant process areas must be designed to work in harsh environment of temperature extremes, humidity and vibration that exceeds the ranges for information technology equipment intended for installation in controlled environment.</p>
                         <p>The use of fibre Ethernet reduces the problem of electrical noise and provides electrical isolation to prevent equipment damage.</p>
                         <p>Some industrial networks emphasis deterministic delivery of transmitted data, whereas Ethernet used collision detection which made transport time for individual data packets difficult to estimate with increasing network traffic.</p>
                         <p>In addition to physical compatibility and low level transport protocols a practical industrial Ethernet system must also provide interoperability of high levels of the OSI model.</p>
                         <p>An industrial network use network switches to segment a large system into logical sub-networks, divided by address, protocol or application.</p>
                         <p>Using network switches allows the network to be broken up into many small collision domains.</p>
                         <p>This reduces the risk of a faulty or misconfigured device generating excess network traffic.</p>

                         <p>I/O bus networks allow PLCs to communicate with I/O devices in a manner similar to how local area networks let supervisory PLCs communicate with individual PLCs.</p>
                         <p>This configuration decentralizes control in the PLC system, yielding larger and faster control systems.</p>
                         <p>The topology, or physical architecture, of an I/O bus network follows the bus or extended bus (tree) configuration, which lets field devices (e.g., limit, photoelectric, and proximity switches) connect directly to either a PLC or to a local area network bus.</p>

                         <p>The basic function of an I/O bus network is to communicate information with, as well as supply power to, the field devices that are connected to the bus.</p>
                         <p>In an I/O bus network, the PLC drives the field devices directly, without the use of I/O modules; therefore, the PLC connects to and communicates with each field I/O device according to the bus's protocol.</p>
                         <p>In essence, PLCs connect with I/O bus networks in a manner similar to the way they connect with remote I/O, except that PLCs in an I/O bus use an I/O bus network scanner.</p>
                         <p>An I/O bus network scanner reads and writes to each field device address, as well as decodes the information contained in the network information packet.</p>
                         <p>A large, tree topology bus network (i.e., a network with many branches) may have up to 2048 or more connected discrete field devices.</p>
                         <p>The field devices that connect to I/O bus networks contain intelligence in the form of microprocessors or other circuits). These devices communicate not only the ON/OFF state of input and output controls, but also diagnostic information about their operating states.</p>
                         <p>I/O bus networks can be separated into two different categories-one that deals with low-level devices that are typical of discrete manufacturing operations and another that handles high-level devices found in process industries.</p>
                         <p>These bus network categories are:</p>
                          <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Device bus networks</span></li>

                          </ul>
                         <p><strong>Device bus networks</strong> interface with low-level information devices (e.g., push buttons, limit switches, etc.), which primarily transmit data relating to the state of the device (ON/OFF) and its operational status (e.g., operating OK). These networks generally process only a few bits to several bytes of data at a time.</p>
                         <p><strong>Process bus networks</strong>, on the other hand, connect with high-level information devices (e.g., smart process valves, flow meters, etc.), which are typically used in process control applications. Process bus networks handle large amounts of data (several hundred bytes), consisting of information about the process, as well as the field devices themselves.</p>
                         <p>The majority of devices used in process bus networks are analog, while most devices used in device bus networks are discrete.</p>
                         <p>However, device bus networks sometimes include analog devices, such as thermocouples and variable speed drives that transmit only a few bytes of information.</p>
                         <p>Device bus networks that include discrete devices, as well as small analog devices, are called <strong>byte-wide bus networks</strong>. These networks can transfer between 1 and 50 or more bytes of data at a time.</p>
                         <p>Device bus networks that only interface with discrete devices are called <strong>bit-wide bus networks</strong>. Bit-wide networks transfer less than 8 bits of data from simple discrete devices over relatively short distances.</p>

                         <p>Neither of the two I/O bus networks has established protocol standards; however, many organizations are working towards developing both discrete and process bus network specifications.</p>
                         <p>In the process bus area, two main organizations, the Fieldbus Foundation (which is the result of a merger between the Interoperable Systems Project, ISP, Foundation and the World FIP North American group) and the Profibus (Process Field Bus) Trade Organization, are working to establish network and protocol standards.</p>
                         <p>Other organizations, such as the Instrument Society of America (ISA) and the European International Electronics Committee (IEC), are also involved in developing these standards.</p>
                         <p>This is the reason why some manufacturers specify that their analog products are compatible with Profibus, Fieldbus, or another type of protocol communication scheme.</p>
                         <figure style="text-align: center;">

                         <p>Although no proclaimed standards exist for device bus network applications, several de facto standards are emerging due to the availability of company specific protocol specifications from device bus network manufacturers.</p>
                         <p>These network manufacturers or associations provide I/O field device manufacturers with specifications in order to develop open network architecture, (i.e., a network that can interface with many types of field devices).</p>
                         <p>In this way, each manufacturer hopes to make its protocol the industry standard.</p>
                         <p>One of these de facto standards for the byte-wide device bus network is <strong>DeviceNet</strong>, originally from PLC manufacturer Allen-Bradley and now provided by an independent spin-off association called the Open DeviceNet Vendor Association.</p>
                         <p>Another is <strong>SDS (Smart Distributed System)</strong> from Honeywell. Both of these device bus protocol standards are based on the control area network bus (CANbus), developed for the automobile industry, which uses the commercially available CAN chip in its protocol.</p>
                         <p><strong>InterBus-S</strong> from Phoenix Contact is another emerging de facto standard for byte-wide device bus network.</p>
                         <p>The de facto standards for low-end, bit-wide device bus networks include <strong>Seriplex</strong>, developed by Square D, and <strong>ASI (Actuator Sensor Interface)</strong>, a standard developed by a consortium of European companies.</p>
                         <p>Again, this is why I/O bus network and field device manufacturers will specify compatibility with a particular protocol (e.g., ASI, Seriplex, InterBus-S, SDS, or DeviceNet) even though no official protocol standard exists.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Byte-Wide Device Bus Networks</h3>
                         <p>The most common byte-wide device bus networks are based on the InterBusS network and the CANbus network.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">i) InterBus-S</h4>
                         <p>InterBus-S is a sensor/actuator device bus network that connects discrete and analog field devices to a PLC or computer (soft PLC) via a ring network configuration.</p>
                         <p>The InterBusS has built-in I/O interfaces in its 256 possible node components, which also include terminal block connections for easy I/O interfacing.</p>
                         <p>This network can handle up to 4096 field I/O devices (depending on the configuration) at a speed of 500 kbaud with cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error detection.</p>
                         <p>A PLC or computer in an InterBus-S network communicates with the bus in a master/slave method via a host controller or module.</p>
                         <p>The topology of the network is a ring, with data being sequentially shifted from point to point on the ring under the control of a network master.</p>
                         <p>Each device is the ring acts as a shift register, transmitting and receiving data simultaneously at 500 KHz .</p>
                         <p>The actual serial data transmission between stations conforms to RS485.</p>
                         <p>Interbus-S (interbus-S remote Bus) has also been extended to include a sub-protocol called interbus - sensor loop (or interbus-S local Bus).</p>
                         <p>This subprotocol provides an alternate physical layer, with a single twisted pair carrying power and data on the same lines and a reduction in the minimum size of the shift register in each station from 16 to 4 bits.</p>
                         <p>Each interbus sensor loop system can act as a single station on an interbus-S network, on the sensor loop can be connected directly to a controller or master.</p>
                         <p>Interbus-S devices are usually implemented with a special ASIC (application specific integrated circuit).</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ii) CANbus networks</h4>
                         <p>CANbus networks are byte-wide device bus networks based on the widely used CAN electronic chip technology, which is used inside automobiles to control internal components, such as brakes and other systems.</p>
                         <p>A CANbus network is an open protocol system featuring variable length messages (up to 8 bytes), nondestructive arbitration, and advanced error management. A four-wire cable plus shield- two wires for power, two for signal transmission, and a "fifth" shield wire-provides the communication link with field devices.</p>
                         <p>This communication can either be master/slave or peer to peer. The speed of the network (data transmission rate) depends on the length of the trunk cable.</p>
                         <figure style="text-align: center;">
                               <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_05_bb7a9f6e05b71dd1aeeeg-064-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing CANbus Network wiring with Power (+V, -V), Signal (H, L), and Shield connections to a CANbus-Compatible I/O Field Device." class="content-image" style="max-width: 300px;">

                           </figure>
                         <p>The DeviceNet byte-wide network can support 64 nodes and a maximum of 2048 field I/O devices.</p>
                         <p>The SDS network can also support 64 nodes; however, this number increases to 126 addressable locations when multiport I/O interfaces are used to multiplex the nodes.</p>
                         <p>Using a 4-to-1 multiport I/O interface module, an SDS network can connect to up to 126 nonintelligent I/O devices in any combination of inputs and outputs.</p>
                         <p>This multiport interface to nonintelligent field devices contains a slave CAN chip inside the interface, which provides status information about the nodes connected to the interface.</p>
                         <p>In a DeviceNet network, the PLC connects to the field devices in a trunkline configuration, with either single drops off the trunk or branched drops through multiport interfaces at the device locations.</p>
                           <figure style="text-align: center;">
                                <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_05_bb7a9f6e05b71dd1aeeeg-065-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating SDS Host Controller Interface connected via CANbus to various nodes, including Smart Sensors, Smart Push Button Station, Smart Valve Manifold, Smart Servo Drive, and a High-Density I/O Concentrator for nonintelligent devices." class="content-image" style="max-width: 700px;">
                                <figcaption>Example SDS/CANbus Network Layout</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                         <p>Because an SDS network can transmit many bytes of information in the form of variable length messages, it can also support many intelligent devices that can translate one, two, or more bytes of information from the network into 16 or 32 bits of ON/OFF information.</p>
                         <p>An example of this type of intelligent device is a solenoid valve manifold.</p>
                         <p>This kind of manifold can have up to 16 connections, thereby receiving 16 bits (two bytes) of data from the network and controlling the status of 16 valve outputs.</p>
                         <p>However, this device uses only one address of the 126 possible addresses. Thus, in this configuration, the SDS network can actually connect to more than just 126 addressable devices.</p>
                         <p>The CANbus device bus network uses three of the ISO layers and defines both the media access control method and the physical signaling of the network, while providing cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error detection.</p>
                         <p>The media access control function determines when each device on the bus will be enabled.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Bit-wide device bus networks</h3>
                         <p>Bit-wide device bus networks are used for discrete applications with simple ON/OFF devices (e.g., sensors and actuators).</p>
                         <p>These I/O bus networks can only transmit 4 bits (one nibble) of information at a time, which is sufficient to transmit data from these devices</p>
                         <p>The smallest discrete sensors and actuators require only one bit of data to operate.</p>
                         <p>By minimizing their data transmission capabilities, bit-wide device bus networks provide optimum performance at economical costs. The most common bit-wide device bus networks are ASI, InterBus Loop, and Seriplex</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">i) ASI Bit-Wide Device Bus Network.</h4>
                         <p>ASI (Actuator sensor interface) was developed for low-cost, flexible method for connecting sensor and actuators at the lowest levels of industrial control system.</p>
                         <p>The ASI network protocol is used in simple, discrete network applications requiring no more than 124 I/O field devices.</p>
                         <p>These 124 inputs and output devices can be connected to up to 31 nodes in either a tree, star, or ring topology. The I/O devices connect to the PLC or personal computer via the bus through a host controller interface.</p>
                         <p>It provides a two-wire, non-twisted cable for interconnection of devices. Devices may draw current from the two wires for powering circuitry, and data communications are modulated on top of the nominal d.c level at a bit rate of 167 KHZ , under control of the master. One single parity bit per station is used for error detection.</p>
                         <p>The maximum cable length is 100 meters ( 330 ft ) from the master controller.</p>
                         <p>The ASI network protocol is based on the ASI protocol chip, thus the I/O devices connected to this type of network must contain this chip.</p>
                         <p>Typical ASI-compatible devices include proximity switches, limit switches, photoelectric sensors, and standard off-the-shelf field devices.</p>
                         <p>However, in an application using an off-the-shelf device, the ASI chip is located in the node (i.e., an intelligent node with a slave ASI chip), instead of in the device.</p>
                         <p>Figure below illustrates an I/O bus network that uses both the ASI bitwide network and the byte-wide CANbus network. Note that the ASI network connects to the byte-wide CANbus network through a gateway.</p>
                           <figure style="text-align: center;">
                                <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_05_bb7a9f6e05b71dd1aeeeg-066-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing an ASI network with Smart Nodes and I/O Devices connected to a Gateway, which in turn connects to a CANbus Network." class="content-image" style="max-width: 600px;">

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ii) InterBus Loop Bit-Wide Device Bus Network</h4>
                         <p>The InterBus Loop from Phoenix Contact Inc. is another bit-wide device bus network used to interface a PLC with simple sensor and actuator devices.</p>
                         <p>The InterBus Loop uses a power and communications technology called PowerCom to send the InterBus-S protocol signal through the power supply wires (i.e., the protocol is modulated onto the power supply lines).</p>
                         <p>This reduces the number of cables required by the network to only two conductors, which carry both the power and communication signals to the field devices.</p>
                         <p>Since the InterBus-S and InterBus Loop networks use the same protocol, they can communicate with each other via an InterBus Loop terminal module.</p>
                         <p>The InterBus Loop connects to the bus terminal module, located in the InterBus-S network, which attaches to the field devices via two wires.</p>
                         <p>An InterBus Loop network can also interface with non-intelligent, off -the-shelf devices by means of module interfaces containing an intelligent slave network chip.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">iii) Seriplex Bit-Wide Device Bus Network.</h4>
                         <p>The Seriplex device bus network can connect up to 510 field devices to a PLC in either a master/slave or peer-to-peer configuration.</p>
                         <p>The Seriplex network is based on the application specific integrated circuit, or ASIC chip, which must be present in all I/O field devices that connect to the network.</p>
                         <p>I/O devices that do not have the ASIC chip embedded in their circuitry (i.e., off-the-shelf devices) can connect to the network via a Seriplex I/O module interface that contains a slave ASIC chip.</p>
                         <p>The ASIC I/O interface contains 32 built-in Boolean logic function used to create logic that will provide the communication, addressability, and intelligence necessary to control the field devices connected to the network bus.</p>
                         <p>A Seriplex network can span distances of up to 5,000 feet in a star, loop, tree, or multidrop configuration.</p>
                         <p>This bit-wide bus network can also operate without a host controller. Unlike the ASI network, the Seriplex device bus network can interface with analog I/O devices; however, the digitized analog signal is read or written one bit at a time in each scan cycle</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Process Bus Network</h3>
                         <p>A process bus network is a high-level, open, digital communication network used to connect analog field devices to a control system.</p>
                         <p>It is used in process applications, where the analog input/output sensors and actuators respond slower than those in discrete bus applications (device bus networks).</p>
                         <p>The size of the information packets delivered to and from these analog field devices is large, due to the nature of the information being collected at the process level.</p>
                         <p>The two most commonly used process bus network protocols are <strong>Fieldbus</strong> and <strong>Profibus</strong>.</p>
                         <p>Although these network protocols can transmit data at a speed of 1 to 2 megabits/sec, their response time is considered slow to medium because of the large amount of information that is transferred.</p>
                         <p>Nevertheless, this speed is adequate for process applications, because analog processes do not respond instantaneously, as discrete controls do.</p>
                         <p>Process bus networks can transmit enormous amounts bf information to a PLC system, thus greatly enhancing the operation of a plant or process.</p>
                         <p>For example, a smart, process bus-compatible motor starter can provide information about the amount of current being pulled by the motor, so that, if current requirements increase or a locked-rotor current situation occurs, the system can alert the operator and avoid a potential motor failure in a critical production line.</p>
                         <p>Implementation of this type of system without a process bus network would be too costly and cumbersome because of the amount of wire runs necessary to transmit this type of process data.</p>
                         <p>Process bus networks will eventually replace the commonly used analog networks, which are based on the 4-20 mA standard for analog devices.</p>
                         <p>This will provide greater accuracy and repeatability in process applications, as well as add bidirectional communication between the field devices and the controller (e.g., PLC). A PLC or computer communicates with a process bus network through a host controller interface module using either Fieldbus or Profibus protocol format.</p>
                         <p>Block transfer instructions relay information between the PLC and the process bus processor. The process bus processor is generally inserted inside the rack enclosure of the PLC.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">i) Fieldbus Process Bus Network</h4>
                         <p>The Fieldbus process bus network from the Fieldbus Foundation (FF) is a digital, serial, multiport, two-way communication system that connects field equipment, such as intelligent sensors and actuators, with controllers, such as PLCs.</p>
                         <p>This process bus network offers the desirable features inherent in 4-20 mA analog systems, such as:</p>

                          </ul>
                         <p>However, the Fieldbus network technology offers the following additional advantages:</p>
                          <ul class="enhanced-list">

                          </ul>
                         <h5>Fieldbus Protocol</h5>
                         <p>The Fieldbus network protocol is based on three layers of the ISO's seven-layer model. These three layers are layer 1 (physical interface), layer 2 (data link), and layer 7 (application).</p>
                         <p>It has optimized the OSI architecture for process control by removing the middle layers that are generally associated with non-time critical applications such as file transfer.</p>
                         <p>The section comprising layers 2 and 7 of the model are referred to as the <strong>Fieldbus communication stack</strong>.</p>
                         <p>In addition to the ISO's model, Fieldbus adds an extra layer on top of the application layer called the <strong>user layer</strong>.</p>
                         <p>This user layer provides several key functions, which are function blocks, device description services, and system management.</p>
                         <h5>Physical Layer (Layer 1)</h5>
                         <p>The physical layer of the Fieldbus process bus network conforms with the ISA SP50 and IEC 1152-2 standards.</p>
                         <p>These standards specify the type of wire that can be used in this type of network, as well as how fast data can move through the network.</p>
                         <p>Moreover, these standards define the number of field devices that can be on the bus at different network speeds, with or without being powered from the bus with intrinsic safety (IS).</p>
                         <p>Intrinsically safe equipment and wiring does not emit enough thermal or electrical energy to ignite materials in the surrounding atmosphere.</p>
                         <p>Thus, intrinsically safe devices are suitable for use in hazardous environments(e.g., those containing hydrogen or acetylene).</p>
                         <p>The Fieldbus has two speeds-a low speed of 31.25 kbaud, referred to as <strong>H1</strong>, and a high speed of 1 Mbaud or 2.5 Mbaud (depending on the mode-AC current or DC voltage mode), called <strong>H2</strong>.</p>
                         <p>At a speed of 31.25 kbaud, the physical layer of the Fieldbus process network can support existing 4-20 mA wiring.</p>
                         <p>This increases cost-effectiveness when upgrading a plant or process's network communication scheme. At this H1 speed, the Fieldbus network can also support intrinsically safe network segments with bus-powered devices.</p>

                         <p>The communication stack portion of the Fieldbus process bus network consists of layer 2 (the data link layer) and layer 7 (the application layer).</p>
                         <p>The data link layer controls the transmission of messages onto the Fieldbus through the physical layer.</p>
                         <p>It manages access to the bus through a <strong>link active scheduler</strong>, which is a deterministic, centralized bus transmission regulator based on IEC and ISA standards.</p>
                         <p>The application layer contains the <strong>Fieldbus messaging specification (FMS)</strong> standard, which encodes and decodes commands from the user layer, Fieldbus's additional 8th layer.</p>
                         <p>The FMS is based on the Profibus process bus standard. Layer 7 also contains an object dictionary, which allows Fieldbus network data to be retrieved by either tag name or index record</p>
                         <h5>User Layer (Layer 8)</h5>
                         <p>The user layer implements the Fieldbus network's distributed control strategy.</p>
                         <p>It contains three key elements, which are function blocks, device description services, and system management.</p>
                         <p>The user layer, a vital segment of the Fieldbus network, also defines the software model for user interaction with the network system.</p>

                         <p>Profibus actually consists of three inter-compatible networks with different protocols designed to serve distinctive application requirements. The three types of Profibus networks are: Profibus-FMS, Profibus-DP and Profibus-PA</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Modbus Network</h3>
                         <p>It is a serial communication protocol published by Modicons for use with its PLCs.</p>
                         <p>Simple and robust, it has since become a de facto standard communication protocol, and it is now commonly available means of connecting electronic devices.</p>
                         <p>The main reasons for the use of Modbus in the industrial environment are:</p>
                           <ul class="enhanced-list">
                              <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Developed with industrial application in mind</span></li>

                           </ul>
                         <p>It allows for communication between many (approx 240) devices connected to the same network.</p>
                         <p>It is used to connect a supervisory computer with a remote terminal unit (RTU) in SCADA systems.</p>
                         <p>A Modbus command contains the Modbus address of the device it is intended for. All Modbus commands contain checking information, ensuring that a command arrives undamaged.</p>
                         <p>The basic Modbus command can instruct an RTU to change a value in one of its registers, control or read an I/O port as well as command the device to send back one or more values contained in its registers.</p>
                         <p>Modbus Messaging protocol is an Application layer (OSI layer 7) protocol that provides client/server communication between devices connected to different types of buses or networks.</p>
                         <p>The Modbus Messaging protocol is only a protocol and does not imply any specific hardware implementation. Also note that the Modbus Messaging protocol used with Modbus Serial is the same one used with Modbus Plus and Modbus TCP.</p>
                         <p>Modbus messaging is based on a client/server model and employs the following messages:</p>
                           <ul class="enhanced-list">
                              <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Modbus requests,</strong> i.e. the messages sent on the network by the clients to initiate transactions.

                           </ul>
                         <p>Modbus (or to be more exact; the Modbus Messaging protocol) is just a protocol, Modbus Plus is a complete system with a predefined medium and Physical layer (OSI layer 1) implementation.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">4 to 20 mA Current Loop</h3>
                         <p>The 4 to 20 mA current loop is a widely used method for transferring information from one station (the transmitter) to another station (the receiver). Therefore, this system allows for only two stations.</p>
                         <p>A typical current loop system assigns a sensing range (e.g., 0 to 100¬∞C) to the current range between 4 and 20 mA .</p>
                         <p>A loop exists (i.e., two wires) between the transmitter and receiver.</p>
                         <p>The transmitter can impress a certain current in the loop (using a controlled current source) so that the receiver can measure the current in the loop (e.g., by placing a small resistor in series with the loop and measuring the voltage drop across the resistor).</p>
                         <p>After measuring the current, the receiver can then determine the present level of the sensed signal within the defined sensing range.</p>
                         <p>This method uses current signaling, instead of voltage signaling, and therefore is relatively unaffected by potential differences between the transmitter and the receiver.</p>
                         <p>This is similar to the benefit of differential (voltage) signaling, which also requires two wires.</p>
                         <p>Another characteristic of this method is that it is not primarily digital in nature, as many other sensor communication systems are.</p>
                         <p>The measured value can vary continuously in the range of 4-20 mA, and therefore can easily represent an analog sensing range, rather than a set of digital signals. Also, the signal is continuously variable and available.</p>
                         <p>Another characteristic of this method is that the integrity of the loop can be verified.</p>
                         <p>As long as the loop is unbroken and the transmitter is in good working order, the current in the loop should never fall below 4 mA .</p>
                         <p>If the current approaches 0 mA , then the receiver can determine that a fault exists - perhaps a broken cable.</p>
                         <p>These systems are widely used in various process control industries (e.g., oil refining) for connecting sensors (transmitters) with control computers.</p>
                         <p>Because one station is always the transmitter and one station is always the receiver, this is a unidirectional, half duplex communication system.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer)</h3>
                         <p>The HART system (and its associated protocol) was originally developed by Rosemount and is regarded as an open standard, available to all manufacturers.</p>
                         <p>Its main advantage is that it enables the retention of the existing 4-20 mA instrumentation cabling whilst using, simultaneously, the same wires to carry digital information superimposed on the analog signal.</p>
                         <p>HART is a hybrid analog and digital system, as opposed to most field bus systems, that are purely digital.</p>
                         <p>HART products generally fall into one of three categories: field devices, host systems, and communication support hardware.</p>
                          <ul class="enhanced-list">

                         <p>It uses a Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) technique based on the Bell 202 standard.</p>
                         <p>HART can be used in either one of the two network configuration :</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">

                         </ul>
                         <p>The HART protocol has two formats for digital transmission of data:</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Poll/response mode</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Burst (broadcast) mode</span></li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>HART follows the basic Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model. The OSI model describes the structure and elements of a communication system. The HART protocol uses a reduced OSI model, implementing only layers 1, 2 and 7</p>
                         <h4>Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)</h4>
                         <p>The HART communication protocol is based on the Bell 202 telephone communication standard and operates using the frequency shift keying (FSK) principle.</p>
                         <p>The digital signal is made up of two frequencies‚Äî 1,200 Hz and 2,200 Hz representing bits 1 and 0, respectively.</p>
                         <p>Sine waves of these two frequencies are superimposed on the direct current (dc) analog signal cables to provide simultaneous analog and digital communications.</p>
                         <p>Because the average value of the 1200/2400 Hz sine wave superimposed on the 4-20 mA signal (FSK signal) is always zero, hence, the 4-20 mA analog information is not affected.</p>
                         <p>The HART FSK signaling enables two-way digital communication and makes it possible for additional information beyond just the normal process variable to be communicated to or from a smart field instrument.</p>
                         <p>The HART protocol communicates at 1200 bits per second without interrupting the 4-20 mA signal and allows a host application (master) to get two or more digital updates per second from a field device.</p>
                         <p>A minimum loop impedance of 230 $\Omega$ is required for communication.</p>

                         <p>HART devices can operate in one of two network configurations‚Äîpoint-to-point or multidrop.</p>
                         <p>The connection can be in form of:</p>
                          <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">In conjunction with the 4-20mA current signal in point-to-point mode,</span></li>

                         <p>In point-to-point mode, the traditional 4-20 mA signal is used to communicate one process variable, while additional process variables, configuration parameters, and other device data are transferred digitally using the HART protocol.</p>
                         <p>The 4-20 mA analog signal is not affected by the HART signal and can be used for control in the normal way.</p>

                         </figure>

                         <h5>ii) Multidrop:</h5>
                         <p>The multidrop mode of operation requires only a single pair of wires and, if applicable, safety barriers and an auxiliary power supply for up to 15 field devices.</p>
                         <p>All process values are transmitted digitally. In multidrop mode, all field device polling addresses are >0, and the current through each device is fixed to a minimum value (typically 4 mA ).</p>
                         <p>Thus, setting the smart device polling address to a number greater than zero implies a multi-drop loop.</p>
                         <p>Obviously the 4-20mA concept only applies to a loop with a single transducer; hence for a multi-drop configuration the smart device sets its analog output to a constant 4 mA and communicates only digitally.</p>

                         <h4>Communication Modes</h4>
                         <p>The HART protocol can be used in various modes for communicating information to/from smart field instruments and central control or monitoring equipment</p>
                         <p>These protocols are: Poll/response mode and Burst (broadcast) mode.</p>
                         <h5>i) Poll/Response Mode (Master/Slave Mode)</h5>
                         <p>HART is a master-slave communication protocol, which means that during normal operation, each slave (field device) communication is initiated by a master communication device.</p>
                         <p>The master polls each of the smart devices on the highway and requests the relevant information.</p>
                         <p>Two masters can connect to each HART loop. The primary master is generally a distributed control system (DCS), programmable logic controller (PLC), or a personal computer (PC). The secondary master can be a handheld terminal or another PC.</p>
                         <p>Slave devices include transmitters, actuators, and controllers that respond to commands from the primary or secondary master.</p>
                         <p>This mode, allows digital information from the slave device to be updated twice per second in the master. The 4-20 mA analog signals are continuous and can still carry the primary variable for control.</p>

                         <h5>ii) Burst Mode (Broadcast mode)</h5>
                         <p>This mode is an optional communication mode.</p>
                         <p>In burst mode, the master instructs the slave device to continuously broadcast a standard HART reply message (e.g., the value of the process variable).</p>
                         <p>The master receives the message at the higher rate until it instructs the slave to stop bursting.</p>
                         <p>This mode frees the master from having to send repeated command requests to get updated process variable information</p>
                         <p>Data update rates of 3-4 per second are typical with "burst" mode communication and will vary with the chosen command. Burst mode should be used only in single slave device networks.</p>

                         <h4>HART Commands</h4>
                         <p>The HART command set provides uniform and consistent communication for all field devices.</p>
                         <p>Layer 7, the Application layer, consists of three classes of HART commands: Universal, Common Practice, and Device Specific</p>
                         <p>Host applications may implement any of the necessary commands for a particular application.</p>
                         <h5>i) Universal</h5>
                         <p>All devices using the HART protocol must recognize and support the universal commands.</p>
                         <p>Universal commands provide access to information useful in normal operations (e.g., read primary variable and units).</p>
                         <h5>ii) Common Practice</h5>
                         <p>Common practice commands provide functions implemented by many, but not necessarily all, HART communication devices.</p>
                         <h5>iii) Device Specific</h5>
                         <p>Device-specific commands represent functions that are unique to each field device.</p>
                         <p>These commands access setup and calibration information, as well as information about the construction of the device. Information on device-specific commands is available from device manufacturers.</p>

                         <h4>Benefits of HART Communication</h4>
                         <p>The HART protocol is a powerful communication technology used to exploit the full potential of digital field devices.</p>
                         <p>Preserving the traditional 4-20 mA signal, the HART protocol extends system capabilities for two-way digital communication with smart field instruments.</p>
                         <p>The HART protocol offers the best solution for smart field device communications and has the widest base of support of any field device protocol worldwide.</p>
                         <p>More instruments are available with the HART protocol than any other digital communications technology.</p>
                         <p>Almost any process application can be addressed by one of the products offered by HART instrument suppliers.</p>
                         <p>Unlike other digital communication technologies, the HART protocol provides a unique communication solution that is backward compatible with the installed base of instrumentation in use today.</p>
                         <p>This backward compatibility ensures that investments in existing cabling and current control strategies will remain secure well into the future.</p>
                         <p>Other benefits include:</p>
