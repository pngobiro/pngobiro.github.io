                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A <dfn>peripheral</dfn> is a device that is connected to a host PLC, but not part of it. It expands the host's capabilities but does not form part of the core PLC architecture.</p>
                        <p>Peripheral devices to the PLC and its I/O base(s) can be anything from a host computer and controls console to a motor drive unit or field unit switch.</p>
                        <p>Printers end industrial terminals used for programming are also peripheral devices.</p>
                        <p>These external operating devices, with their sometimes harsh and/or fast signal characteristics, must be able to interface with the PLC's sensitive microprocessor.</p>
                        <p>There are three different types of peripherals:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Input</strong>, used to interact with, or send data to the computer/ PLC (mouse, keyboard etc)</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Output</strong>, which provides output to the user from the PLC/computer (Monitors, printers, displays etc)</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Storage</strong>, which stores data processed by the computer (Hard drives, flash drives etc)</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1) Printers</h3>
                        <p>In computing, a printer is a peripheral which produces a representation of an electronic document on physical media such as paper. Many printers are local peripherals connected directly to a nearby personal computer. Individual printers are often designed to support both local and network connected users at the same time. Most Multifunction printers (MFPs) include printing, scanning, and copying among their many features.</p>
                        <p>Printers can be classified by the printer technology they employ, with many techniques being available as commercial products.</p>
                        <p>The choice of print technology has a great effect on the cost of the printer and cost of operation, speed, quality and permanence of documents and noise.</p>
                        <p>A second aspect of printer technology that is often forgotten is resistance to alteration: liquid ink, such as from an inkjet head or fabric ribbon, becomes absorbed by the paper fibers, so documents printed with liquid ink are more difficult to alter than documents printed with toner or solid inks, which do not penetrate below the paper surface.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2) Network interface controller (NIC)</h3>
                        <p>NIC also known as network interface card, network adaptor is a computer hardware component that connects a PLC to a computer network.</p>
                        <p>It is an expansion card that allows PLC/computers to communicate over a computer network</p>
                        <p>The network controller implements the electronic circuitry required to communicate using a specific physical layer end data link layer standard such as Ethernet, WI-FI or token ring.</p>
                        <p>This provides a base for a full network protocol stack, allowing communication among small groups of PLC/computers on the same LAN and large - scale network communication through routable protocols such as IP.</p>
                        <p>The NIC may use one or more of two techniques to indicate the availability of packets to transfer.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Polling</strong> is where the CPU examines the status of the peripheral under program control</span></li>

                        <p>and may use one or more of two techniques to transfer packet data:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Programmed input/output</strong> is where the CPU moves the data to or from the designated peripheral to memory.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Direct memory access</strong> is where an intelligent peripheral assumes control of the system bus to access memory directly. This removes load from the CPU but requires more logic on the card. In addition, a packet buffer on the NIC may not be required and latency can be reduced.</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3) Programmer interface</h3>
                        <p>The programmer interface in the industrial design field of human machine interaction, is the space where interaction between human and machine occurs.</p>
                        <p>The goal of this interaction is effective operation and control of the machine on the user's end, and feedback from the machine which aids the operator in making operational decisions.</p>
                        <p>Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls.</p>
                        <p>The user/programmer interface includes hardware (physical) and software (logical) components</p>
                        <p>It provides a means of</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Input</strong>, allowing the user to manipulate a system</span></li>
                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Output</strong>, allowing the system to indicate the effects of the user's manipulation.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Generally, the goal of human-machine interaction engineering is to produce a user interface which makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result. This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the human.</p>
                        <p>With the increased use of personal computers and the relative decline in societal awareness of heavy machinery, the term user interface is generally assumed to mean the graphical user interface, while industrial control panel and machinery control design discussions more commonly refer to human-machine interfaces.</p>

                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Safety must be a priority in the design of a PLC system. Thus emergency stop buttons and safety guard switches must be hard wired and not depend on the PLC software for implementation so that in the situation where there is a failure of the stop switch or PLC, the system is automatically safe. The system must be <strong>fail-safe</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fail-safe design</strong> is a method of designing control system such that if a critical component in the system fails, the system immediately becomes disabled.</p>
                        <p>Hence, fail-safe design is the procedure or programming to ensure safety of the operator and processes.</p>
                        <p>Fail-safe design rules of thumb for selecting No or NC devices are as follows:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>NO</strong> - when wiring switches or sensors that start actions, use normally open switches so there is a problem with the switch the process will not start.</span></li>

                         </ul>
                         <p>The following program, START will override STOP and RUN will switch on as long as START is pressed.</p>

                         <p>With a PLC system, a stop signal can be provided by a switch as above</p>
                         <p>This arrangement however is unsafe as an emergency stop because if there is fault and the switch cannot be operated, then no stop the system.</p>
                         <p>What is required is a system that will still stop if a failure occurs in the stop switch.</p>
                         <p>The program has the STOP switch as the open contacts. However, because the hardwired stop switch has normally closed contacts then the program has the signal to close the program contacts.</p>

                     <div class="content-card">
                        <p>With any PLC controlled plant, the major faults are likely to be with sensors, actuators and wiring rather than within the PLC itself.</p>
                        <p>Of the fault within the PLC, most likely to be in the I/O channels or power supply rather than in the CPU</p>
                        <p>For example, consider a single output device failing to turn on though the output LED is on. If testing of the PLC output voltage indicates that its normal then the fault might be a wiring fault or a device fault. If checking of the voltage at the device indicates the voltage there is normal then the fault is the device.</p>
                        <p>Many PLCs provide built-in fault analysis procedure which carries out self-testing and display fault codes, with possibly a brief message, which can be translated by looking up the code in a list to give the source of the fault and possible methods of recovery.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Fault detection technique</h3>
                         <p>The following are some of the common fault detection techniques used.</p>
                         <ol type="i" class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">i)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Timing checks</strong> - The term <strong>watchdog</strong> is used for a timing check that is carried out by the PLC to check that some function has been carried out within the normal time. If the function is not carried out within the normal time, then a fault is assumed to have occurred and the watch dog timer trips, setting off an alarm and perhaps closing down the PLC. As part of the internal diagnostic of PLC, watchdog timers are used to detect for faults.
                                  <figure style="text-align: center;">
                                       <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_05_bb7a9f6e05b71dd1aeeeg-027-1.jpg" alt="Ladder diagram example for a timing check (watchdog)." class="content-image" style="max-width: 300px;">

                                  <p>Time check can also be built into the ladder logic program. This is where additional ladder rungs might included so that when a function starts, a timer is started. If the function does not complete when the timer finishes a fault is signaled.</p>
                              </span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Last output set</strong> - This technique involves the use of status lamps to indicate the last output that has been set during a process which has come to a halt. Such lamps are built into the program so that as each output occurs a lamp comes on. The lamps on thus indicate which output are occurring. The program has to be designed to turn off previous status lamps and turn on a new status lamp as each new output is turned on.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iii)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Replication</strong> - replication check involves duplication i.e. replication, the PLC system. This could mean that the system repeats every operation twice and if it gets the same result it is assumed there is no fault. This procedure can detect transient fault. Alternatively, is to have duplicate PLC systems and compare the results given by the two systems. In the absence of the fault the two results should be the same, a fault showing up as a difference.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">iv)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Expected values checks</strong> - Software errors can be detected by checking whether an expected value is obtained when a specific input occurs.

                        <p>The design of programmable controllers includes a number of rugged features that allow PLCs to be installed in almost any industrial environment.</p>
                        <p><strong>System layout</strong> is the conscientious approach to placing and interconnecting components not only to satisfy the application, but also to ensure that the controller will operate trouble free in its environment.</p>
                        <p>In addition to programmable controller equipment, the system layout also encompasses the other components that form the total system. These components include isolation transformers, auxiliary power supplies, safety control relays, and incoming line noise suppressors.</p>
                        <p>Although programmable controllers are tough machines, a little foresight during their installation will ensure proper system operation.</p>
                        <p>In a carefully constructed layout, these components are easy to access and maintain. Nevertheless, careful installation planning can increase system productivity and decrease maintenance problems.</p>
                        <p>The best location for a programmable controller is near the machine or process that it will control, as long as temperature, humidity, and electrical noise are not problems.</p>
                        <p>Placing the controller near the equipment and using remote I/O where possible will minimize wire runs and simplify start-up and maintenance</p>
                        <p>Programmable controllers are designed to be easy to maintain, to ensure trouble-free operation. Still, several maintenance aspects should be considered once the system is in place and operational. Certain maintenance measures, if performed periodically, will minimize the chance of system malfunction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Preventive maintenance</strong> of programmable controller systems includes only a few basic procedures, which will greatly reduce the failure rate of system components.</p>
                        <p>Preventive maintenance for the PLC system should be scheduled with the regular machine or equipment maintenance, so that the equipment and controller are down for a minimum amount of time.</p>
                        <p>However, the schedule for PLC preventive maintenance depends on the controller's environment-the harsher the environment, the more frequent the maintenance.</p>
                        <p>The following are guidelines for preventive measures:</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
