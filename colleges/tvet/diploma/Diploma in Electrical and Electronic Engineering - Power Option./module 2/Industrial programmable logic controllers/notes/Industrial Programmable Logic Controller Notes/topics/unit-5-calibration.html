                        <p><dfn>Calibration</dfn> is the act or result of quantitative comparison between a known standard and the output of the measuring system.</p>
                        <p>If the output-input response of the system is linear, then a single-point calibration is sufficient.</p>
                        <p>However, if the system response is non-linear, then a set of known standard inputs to the measuring system are employed for calibrating the corresponding outputs of the system.</p>
                        <p>Calibration refers to the act of evaluating and adjusting the precision and accuracy of measurement equipment.</p>
                        <p>Instrument calibration is intended to eliminate or reduce bias in an instrument's readings over a range for all continuous values.</p>

                        <p>In general use, calibration is often regarded as including the process of adjusting the output or indication on a measurement instrument to agree with value of the applied standard, within a specified accuracy.</p>
                        <p>There are three main reasons for having instruments calibrated:</p>

                           <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">To ensure readings from an instrument are consistent with other measurements.</span></li>

                        <p>Calibration is carried out by agencies of the metrological service, using reference standards and base standards.</p>
                        <p>Governmental calibration is obligatory for measuring devices used in reporting material value, for government tests and expert examinations, and for recording national and international sports records, and also for calibration of the original base standards.</p>

                         <span class="heading-text">Calibration Standards</span>
                     </h2>
                     <div class="content-card">
                         <p>Calibration Standards of measurements can be classified according to their function and type of application as:</p>
                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">International standards</h3>
                         <p>International standards are devices designed and constructed to the specifications of an international forum.</p>
                         <p>They represent the units of measurements of various physical quantities to the highest possible accuracy that is attainable by the use of advanced techniques of production and measurement technology.</p>
                         <p>These standards are maintained by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Sevres, France. For example, the International Prototype kilogram, wavelength of Kr86 orange-red lamp and cesium clock are the international standards for mass, length and time, respectively.</p>
                         <p>However, these standards are not available to an ordinary user for purposes of day-to-day comparisons and calibrations.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Primary standards</h3>
                         <p>Primary standards are devices maintained by standards organizations / national laboratories in different parts of the world.</p>
                         <p>These devices represent the fundamental and derived quantities and are calibrated independently by absolute measurements.</p>
                         <p>These are the most precise and accurate physical standards, which are derived from international standards.</p>
                         <p>They specify the most stringent conditions and are used only at rare intervals for comparison with secondary standards.</p>
                         <p>One of the main functions of maintaining primary standards is to calibrate / check and certify secondary reference standards.</p>
                         <p>Like international standards, these standards also are not easily available to an ordinary user of instruments for verification / calibration of working standards. These standards are not portable.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Secondary standards</h3>
                         <p>Secondary standards are basic reference standards employed by industrial measurement laboratories.</p>
                         <p>These are derived from primary standards. They are portable and are often used as national standards.</p>
                         <p>They are less precise than primary standards but are still very precise.</p>
                         <p>They are used at rare intervals to calibrate tertiary and working standards. These are maintained by the concerned laboratory.</p>
                         <p>One of the important functions of an industrial laboratory is the maintenance and periodic calibration of secondary standards against primary standards of the national standards laboratory / organization.</p>
                         <p>In addition, secondary standards are freely available to the ordinary user of instruments for checking and calibration of working standards.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Working standards</h3>
                         <p>These are high-accuracy devices that are commercially available and are duly checked and certified against either the primary or secondary standards.</p>
                         <p>For example, a standard cell and a standard resistor are the working standards of voltage and resistance, respectively.</p>
                         <p>Working standards are very widely used for calibrating general laboratory instruments, for carrying out comparison measurements or for checking the quality (range of accuracy) of industrial products.</p>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Primary calibration</strong>, which is performed when a measuring device is put into circulation from production or returned from repair;</span></li>

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Special calibration</strong>, which results from the need for immediate verification of the good condition of a device; and</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Inspection calibration</strong>, which is performed during metrological inspections of enterprises, supply centers, warehouses, and commercial organizations.</span></li>
                         </ul>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Calibration Concepts</h3>
                         <p>There are two fundamental operations involved in calibrating any instrument:</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
                              <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Testing the instrument to determine its performance,</span></li>
                              <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Adjusting the instrument to perform within specification.</span></li>
                          </ul>
                         <p>Testing the instrument requires collecting sufficient data to calculate the instrument's operating errors.</p>
                         <p>This is typically accomplished by performing a multiple point test procedure that includes the following steps.</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
                              <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Using a process variable simulator that matches the input type of the instrument, set a known input to the instrument.</span></li>
                              <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Using an accurate calibrator, read the actual (or reference) value of this input.</span></li>
                              <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Read the instrument's interpretation of the value by using an accurate calibrator to measure the instrument output.</span></li>
                          </ul>
                         <p>By repeating this process for a series of different input values, you can collect sufficient data to determine the instrument's accuracy.</p>
                         <p>Depending upon the intended calibration goals and the error calculations desired, the test procedure may require from 5 to 21 input points.</p>
                         <p>The first test that is conducted on an instrument before any adjustments are made is called the <strong>As-Found</strong> test.</p>
                         <p>If the accuracy calculations from the As-Found data are not within the specifications for the instrument, then it must be adjusted.</p>
                         <p>Adjustment is the process of manipulating some part of the instrument so that its input to output relationship is within specification. For conventional instruments, this may be zero and span screws.</p>
                         <p>For HART instruments, this normally requires the use of a communicator (handheld or PC) to convey specific information to the instrument.</p>
                         <p>After adjusting the instrument, a second multiple point test is required to characterize the instrument and verify that it is within specification over the defined operating range. This is called the <strong>As-Left</strong> test.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Error Calculations</h3>
                         <p>Error calculations are the principal analysis performed on the As-Found and As-Left test data.</p>
                         <p>There are several different types of error calculations, most of which are defined in the publication "Process Instrumentation Terminology".</p>
                         <p>They are usually expressed in terms of the percent of ideal span which is defined as:</p>
                         <div class="equation">
                            $$ \% \text{span} = \frac{(\text{reading} - \text{low range})}{(\text{high range} - \text{low range})} \times 100 $$
                         </div>
                         <p>The first step in the data analysis is to convert the engineering unit values for input and output into percent of span. Then for each point, calculate the error, which is the deviation of the actual output from the expected output.</p>
                         <p>The <strong>Maximum error</strong> is the most common value used to evaluate an instrument's performance. If a computer program is not used to analyze the test data, it is often the only error considered and is taken to be the largest deviation from the ideal output.</p>
                         <p>By itself, the maximum error does not give a complete indication of an instrument's performance. With the availability of computer software to facilitate calculations, other error values are gaining popularity including zero error, span error, linearity error, and hysteresis error.</p>
                          <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Zero error</strong> is defined as the error of a device when the input is at the lower range value.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Span error</strong> is defined as the difference between the actual span and the ideal span, expressed as a percentage of the ideal span.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Linearity error</strong> is a measure of how close the error of the instrument over its operating range approaches a straight line. Unfortunately, there are three different methods used to calculate this, resulting in an independent linearity, a terminal based linearity, and a zero based linearity. In practice, it is best to choose one method and apply it consistently. Note that the calculation of linearity error is also greatly facilitated by a curve fit of the error data.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Hysteresis error</strong> is a measure of the dependence of the output at a given input value upon the prior history of the input. This is the most difficult error to measure since it requires great care in the collection of data, and it typically requires at least 9 data points to develop reasonable curves for the calculations. Thus a technician must collect at least five data point traversing in one direction, followed by at least four more in the opposite direction, so that each leg has five points, including the inflection point.</span></li>
                           </ul>
                         <p>If any of these errors is greater than or equal to the desired accuracy for a test, then the instrument has failed and must be adjusted.</p>

                     </h2>
                     <div class="content-card">
                         <p>Calibration is an important aspect of an instrument's life cycle. However, it can be difficult to choose the correct calibration method to suit your requirements and specification.</p>
                         <p>Handheld devices are typically used to calibrate parameters including flow, pressure, temperature and conductivity.</p>
                         <p>Taken as a whole, the benefits of these systems are numerous and obvious in terms of time, cost and convenience.</p>
                         <p>Handheld equipment allows electronic verification and calibration in situations where inline calibration is essential but mobile rigs may be impractical.</p>
                         <p>Internal procedures or official requirements and conformity reasons might also stipulate that certain instruments must be checked more frequently than others to verify that they are working correctly in the process.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Calibrating a Conventional Instrument</h3>
                         <p>For a conventional 4-20 mA instrument, a multiple point test that stimulates the input and measures the output is sufficient to characterize the overall accuracy of the transmitter.</p>
                         <p>The normal calibration adjustment involves setting only the zero value and the span value, since there is effectively only one adjustable operation between the input and output as illustrated below.</p>
                         <figure style="text-align: center;">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_05_bb7a9f6e05b71dd1aeeeg-078-1.jpg" alt="Block diagram showing conventional instrument calibration: Sensing Element -> Analog Electronics (with Zero and Span Adjustments) -> 4-20 mA Output." class="content-image" style="max-width: 500px;">

                         </figure>
                         <p>This procedure is often referred to as a <strong>Zero and Span Calibration</strong>. If the relationship between the input and output range of the instrument is not linear, then you must know the transfer function before you can calculate expected outputs for each input value.</p>
                         <p>Without knowing the expected output values, you cannot calculate the performance errors.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Calibrating a Hart Instrument</h3>
                         <p>It is important to note that in most cases, proper calibration of a HART instrument requires the use of a communicator (handheld or PC) that is capable of issuing device specific commands (in layer 7).</p>
                         <p>According to international standards, calibration is a comparison of the device under test against a traceable reference instrument (a calibrator) and documentation of this comparison.</p>
                         <p>In order to do a calibration of a HART device, a traceable metrological reference device is needed, which can be a handheld calibrator</p>
                         <p><strong>Configuration</strong> means using the digital communication protocol as a way to change settings inside the field device from the device or from a remote location.</p>
                         <p>Configuration can be done with a PC and configuration software or a handheld communicator.</p>
                         <p>It is important to remember that although a communicator can be used for configuration and checking diagnostic information, it cannot be used for metrological calibration to check the measurement (PV) accuracy of a field device.</p>
                         <p>Configuring parameters of a HART transmitter with a communicator is not metrological calibration and does not assure accuracy.</p>
                         <p>For a real metrological calibration, a traceable reference standard is always needed.</p>
                         <p>Calibration procedure for a HART instrument is significantly different than for a conventional instrument. The specific calibration requirements depend upon the application.</p>
                         <p>If the application uses the digital representation of the process variable for monitoring or control, then the sensor input section must be explicitly tested and adjusted.</p>
                         <p><strong>Note</strong> that this reading is completely independent of the milliamp output, and has nothing to do with the zero or span settings.</p>
                         <p>The PV as read via HART communication continues to be accurate even when it is outside the assigned output range.</p>
                         <p>If the current loop output is not used (that is the transmitter is used as a digital only device), then the input section calibration is all that is required.</p>
                         <p>If the application uses the milliamp output, then the output section must be explicitly tested and calibrated.</p>
                         <p><strong>Note</strong> that this calibration is independent of the input section, and again, has nothing to do with the zero and span settings.</p>
                         <p>If there is a desire to validate the overall performance of a HART transmitter, run a Zero and Span test just like a conventional instrument.</p>
                         <p>However, passing this test does not necessarily indicate that the transmitter is operating correctly.</p>
