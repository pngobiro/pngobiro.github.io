\section*{Single Stage Transistor Amplifiers}

Almost all electronic equipments must include means for amplifying electrical signals. For instance, radio receivers amplify very weak signals- sometimes a few millionth of a volt at antenna- until they are strong enough to fill a room with sound. The transducers used in the medical and scientific investigations generate signals in the microvolt $(\mu \mathrm{V})$ and millivolt ( mV ) range. These signals must be amplified thousands and millions times before they will be strong enough to operate indicating instruments. Therefore, electronic amplifiers are a constant and important ingredient of electronic systems.

Our purpose here will be to discuss single stage transistor amplifiers. By a stage we mean a single transistor with its bias and auxiliary equipment. It may be emphasised here that a practical amplifier is always a multistage amplifier i.e. it has a number of stages of amplification. However, it is profitable to consider the multistage amplifier in terms of single stages that are connected together. In this chapter, we shall
confine our attention to single stage transistor amplifiers.

Figure 1.1: Single stage transistor amplifier

Fig. 1.1 shows a single stage transistor amplifier. When a weak a.c. signal is given to the base of transistor, a small base current (which is a.c.) starts flowing. Due to transistor action, a much larger ( $\beta$ times the base current) a.c. current flows through the collector load RC . As the value of RC is quite high (usually $4-10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ ), therefore, a large voltage appears across RC . Thus, a weak signal applied in the base circuit appears in amplified form in the collector circuit. It is in this way that a transistor acts as amplifier.

The action of transistor amplifier can be beautifully explained by referring to Fig. 1.1. Suppose a change of 0.1 V in signal voltage produces a change of 2 mA in the collector current. Obviously, a signal of only 0.1 V applied to the base will give an output voltage $=2 m A \times 5 k \Omega=10 \mathrm{~V}$. Thus, the transistor has been able to raise the voltage level of the signal from 0.1 V to 10 V i.e. voltage amplification or stage gain is 100 .

\section*{Graphical Demonstration of Transistor Amplifier}

The function of a transistor as an amplifier can also be explained graph-
ically. Fig. 1.2 shows the output characteristics of a transistor in CE configuration. Suppose the zero signal base current is $10 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ i.e. this is the base current for which the transistor is biased by the biasing network. When an a.c. signal is applied to the base, it makes the base, say positive in the first half-cycle and negative in the second half- cycle. Therefore, the base and collector currents will increase in the first half-cycle when base-emitter junction is more forward-biased. However, they will decrease in the second half-cycle when the base-emitter junction is less forward biased.

Figure 1.2: Single stage transistor amplifier

\subsection*{1.1 Practical Circuit of Transistor Amplifier}

It is important to note that a transistor can accomplish faithful amplification only if proper associated circuitry is used with it. Fig. 1.3 shows a practical single stage transistor amplifier. The various circuit elements and their functions are described below :
(i) Biasing circuit.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-09.jpg?height=630&width=923&top_left_y=139&top_left_x=589)

Figure 1.3: Single stage transistor amplifier
The resistances R1, R2 and RE form the biasing and stabilisation circuit. The biasing circuit must establish a proper operating point otherwise a part of the negative half-cycle of the signal may be cut off in the output.
( ii ) Input capacitor Cin .
An electrolytic capacitor $\operatorname{Cin}(\approx 10 \mu F)$ is used to couple the signal to the base of the transistor. If it is not used, the signal source resistance will come across R2 and thus change the bias. The capacitor Cin allows only a.c. signal to flow but isolates the signal source from R2.
( iii ) Emitter bypass capacitor CE .
An emitter bypass capacitor $\mathrm{CE}(\approx 100 \mu F)$ is used in parallel with RE to provide a low reactance path to the amplified a.c. signal. If it is not used, then amplified a.c. signal flowing through RE will cause a voltage drop across it, thereby reducing the output voltage.
( iv ) Coupling capacitor CC .

The coupling capacitor $\mathrm{CC}(\approx 10 \mu F)$ couples one stage of amplification to the next stage. If it is not used, the bias conditions of the next stage will be drastically changed due to the shunting effect of RC . This is because RC will come in parallel with the upper resistance R1 of the biasing network of the next stage, thereby altering the biasing conditions of the latter. In short, the coupling capacitor CC isolates the d.c. of one stage from the next stage, but allows the passage of a.c. signal.

Various circuit currents.
(i) Base current.

When no signal is applied in the basecircuit, d.c. base current IB flows due to biasing circuit. When a.c. signal is applied, a.c. base current ib also flows. Therefore, with the application of signal, total base current iB is given by:
$i_{B}=I_{B}+i_{b}$
( ii ) Collector current.
When no signal is applied, a d.c. collector current IC flows due to biasing circuit. When a.c. signal is applied, a.c. collector current ic also flows. Therefore, the total collector current iC is given by: $i_{C}=I_{C}+i_{c}$
zero signal collector current: $I_{C}=\beta I_{B}$
collector current due to signal: $i_{c}=\beta i_{b}$
( iii ) Emitter current.
When no signal is applied, a d.c. emitter current IE flows. With the application of signal, total emitter current iE is given by :
$i_{E}=I_{E}+i_{e}$
$I_{E}=I_{C}+I_{B}$
$i_{e}=i_{c}+i_{b}$
Phase reversal.
In common emitter connection, when the input signal voltage increases in the positive sense, the output voltage increases in the negative direction and vice-versa . In other words, there is a phase difference of 180 degrees between the input and output voltage in CE connection. This is called phase reversal.

Output $=$ Voltage aeross RL $=V_{C C}-V_{R_{C}}$
As VCC is a direct voltage and cannot pass through capacitor CC, therefore, only varying voltage $V_{R_{C}}$ will appear across RL.

Output $=-V_{R_{C}}$
The minus sign simply indicates the phase reversal.

\subsection*{1.2 D.C. And A.C. Equivalent Circuits}

In a transistor amplifier, both d.c. and a.c. conditions prevail. The d.c. sources set up d.c. currents and voltages whereas the a.c. source (i.e . signal) produces fluctuations in the transistor currents and volt- ages. Therefore, a simple way to analyse the action of a transistor is to split the analysis into two parts viz. a d.c. analysis and an a.c. analysis. In the d.c. analysis, we consider all the d.c. sources at the same time and work out the d.c. currents and voltages in the circuit. On the other hand, for a.c. analysis, we consider all the a.c. sources at the same time and work out the a.c. currents and voltages. By adding the d.c. and a.c. currents and voltages, we get the total currents and voltages in the circuit. For example, consider the amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 1.4. This circuit can be easily analysed by splitting it into d.c. equivalent circuit and a.c equivalent circuit.

Figure 1.4: Single stage transistor amplifier

\subsection*{1.2.1 D. C. equivalent circuit.}

In the d.c. equivalent circuit of a transistor amplifier, only d.c. conditions are to be considered i.e. it is presumed that no signal is applied. As direct current cannot flow through a capacitor, therefore, all the capacitors look like open circuits in the d.c. equivalent circuit. It follows, therefore, that in order to draw the equivalent d.c. circuit, the following two steps are applied to the transistor circuit :
( a ) Reduce all a.c. sources to zero.
( b ) Open all the capacitors.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-13.jpg?height=464&width=335&top_left_y=1264&top_left_x=866)

Figure 1.5: D. C. equivalent circuit.

We can easily calculate the d.c. currents and voltages from the d.c. equivalent circuit.

\subsection*{1.2.2 A.C. equivalent circuit.}

In the a.c. equivalent circuit of a transistor amplifier, only a.c. conditions are to be considered. Obviously, the d.c. voltage is not important for such a circuit and may be considered zero. The capacitors are gener-
ally used to couple or bypass the a.c. signal. The designer intentionally selects capacitors that are large enough to appear as short circuits to the a.c. signal. It follows, therefore, that in order to draw the a.c. equivalent circuit, the following two steps are applied to the transistor circuit:
( a ) Reduce all d.c. sources to zero (i.e. $\mathrm{VCC}=0$ ).
( b ) Short all the capacitors.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-14.jpg?height=550&width=1155&top_left_y=970&top_left_x=462)

Figure 1.6: A. C. equivalent circuit.

We can easily calculate the a.c. currents and voltages from the a.c. equivalent circuit.

\subsection*{1.3 Voltage Gain}

The basic function of an amplifier is to raise the strength of an a.c. input signal. The voltage gain of the amplifier is the ratio of a.c. output voltage to the a.c. input signal voltage. Therefore, in order to find the voltage gain, we should consider only the a.c. currents and voltages in the circuit. For this purnose we should look at the a.c.
equivalent circuit of transistor amplifier. For facility of reference,the a.c. equivalent circuit of transistor amplifier is redrawn in Fig. 1.7.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-15.jpg?height=460&width=1260&top_left_y=421&top_left_x=378)

Figure 1.7: A. C. equivalent circuit.

It is clear that as far as a.c. signal is concerned, load $R_{C}$ appears in parallel with $R_{L}$. Therefore, effective load for a.c. is given by :
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { a.c. load, } R_{A C} & =R_{C} \| R_{L}=\frac{R_{C} \times R_{L}}{R_{C}+R_{L}} \\
\text { Output voltage, } V_{\text {out }} & =i_{c} R_{A C} \\
\text { Input voltage, } V_{\text {in }} & =i_{b} R_{\text {in }} \\
\therefore \quad \text { Voltage gain, } A_{v} & =V_{\text {out }} / V_{\text {in }} \\
& =\frac{i_{c} R_{A C}}{i_{b} R_{\text {in }}}=\beta \times \frac{R_{A C}}{R_{\text {in }}} \quad\left(Q \frac{i_{c}}{i_{b}}=\beta\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Incidentally, power gain is given by;
$$A_{p}=\frac{i_{c}^{2} R_{A C}}{i_{b}^{2} R_{i n}}=\beta^{2} \times \frac{R_{A C}}{R_{i n}}$$

In the circuit shown in Fig. below, find the voltage gain. Given that $\beta=60$ and input resistance Rin $=1 k \Omega$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-15.jpg?height=621&width=1194&top_left_y=2134&top_left_x=468)

Solution:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Solution. So far as voltage gain of the circuit is concerned, we need only } R_{A C}, \beta \text { and } R_{\text {in }} . \\
& \text { Effective load, } \begin{aligned}
R_{A C} & =R_{C} \| R_{L} \\
& =\frac{R_{C} \times R_{L}}{R_{C}+R_{L}}=\frac{2 \times 0.5}{2+0.5}=0.4 \mathrm{k} \Omega
\end{aligned} \\
& \therefore \quad \text { Voltage gain }
\end{aligned}=\beta \times \frac{R_{A C}}{R_{i n}}=\frac{60 \times 0.4 \mathrm{k} \Omega}{1 \mathrm{k} \Omega}=24 .$$

\subsection*{1.4 Amplifier Equivalent Circuit}

An amplifier can be replaced by an equivalent circuit for the purpose of analysis. Fig. 1.8 ( i ) shows the amplifier circuit while Fig. 1.8 (ii ) shows its equivalent circuit.

Figure 1.8: Amplifier equivalent circuit.
$\mathrm{V} 1=$ input signal voltage to the amplifier
I1 $=$ input signal current
Rin $=$ input resistance of the amplifier
$\mathrm{A} 0=$ voltage gain of the amplifier when no load is connected
$\mathrm{I} 2=$ output current
$\mathrm{V} 2=$ output voltage across load RL
Rout $=$ output resistance of the amplifier
$\mathrm{RL}=$ load resistance
$A v=$ voltage gain when load RL is connected
Note that capability of the amplifier to produce voltage gain is represented by the voltage generator A0V1. The voltage gain of the loaded amplifier is Av. Clearly, Av will be less than A0 due to voltage drop in Rout.

\section*{Equivalent Circuit with Signal Source}

If the signal source of voltage ES and resistance RS is considered, the amplifier equivalent circuit will be as shown in Fig. 1.9. Referring to Fig. 1.9, we have,

Figure 1.9: Amplifier equivalent circuit.
$$\begin{aligned}

\section*{Note.}

The use of such an equivalent circuit is restricted to the signal quanti-

ties only. Further, in drawing the equivalent circuit, it is assumed that exact linear relationship exists between input and output signals i.e. the amplifier produces no waveform distortion.

& I_{1}=\frac{I_{2}}{4 \times 10^{5}}=\frac{0.5}{4 \times 10^{5}}=1.25 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~A}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{1.5 Gain and Transistor Configurations}

We know that the process of raising the strength of an a.c. signal is called amplification and the circuit used to preform this function is called an amplifier. There are three types of gain : current gain, voltage gain and power gain .
( i ) The common emitter (CE) amplifier exhibits all the types gain .
From input to output, current will increase, voltage will increase and power will increase.
( ii ) The common base (CB) amplifier has voltage gain and power gain but no current gain. Note that the current gain of a CB circuit is less than 1.
( iii ) The common collector (CC) amplifier has current gain and power gain but no voltage gain.

It is important to note that the type of gain an amplifier has depends upon the transistor configuration. Consequently, the choice of an amplifier for a given application often depends on the type of gain that is desired CE arrangement is widely used (in about 90 percent applica-

\section*{Chapter 2}

\section*{Amplifiers with Negative Feedback}

A practical amplifier has a gain of nearly one million i.e. its output is one million times the input. Consequently, even a casual disturbance at the input will appear in the amplified form in the output. There is a strong tendency in amplifiers to introduce hum due to sudden temperature changes or stray electric and magnetic fields. Therefore, every high gain amplifier tends to give noise along with signal in its output. The noise in the output of an amplifier is undesirable and must be kept to as small a level as possible. The noise level in amplifiers can be reduced considerably by the use of negative feedback i.e . by injecting a fraction of output in phase opposition to the input signal.

The object of this chapter is to consider the effects and methods of providing negative feedback in transistor amplifiers.

\subsection*{2.1 Feedback}

The process of injecting a fraction of output energy of some device back to the input is known as feedback. The principle of feedback is probably as old as the invention of first machine but it is only some 50 years ago that feedback has come into use in connection with electronic circuits. It has been found very useful in reducing noise in amplifiers and making amplifier operation stable. Depending upon whether the feedback energy aids or opposes the input signal, there are two basic types of feedback in amplifiers viz positive feedback and negative feedback.

\subsection*{2.1.1 Positive feedback.}

When the feedback energy (voltage or current) is in phase with the input signal and thus aids it, it is called positive feedback. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.1. Both amplifier and feedback network introduce a phase shift of 180 degrees. The result is a 360 degrees phase shift around the loop, causing the feedback voltage Vf to be in phase with the input signal Vin.

The positive feedback increases the gain of the amplifier. However, it has the disadvantages of increased distortion and instability. Therefore, positive feedback is seldom employed in amplifiers. One important use
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-22.jpg?height=449&width=1124&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=466)

Figure 2.1: Positive feedback.
of positive feedback is in oscillators. As we shall see in the next chapter, if positive feedback is sufficiently large, it leads to oscillations. As a matter of fact, an oscillator is a device that converts d.c. power into a.c. power of any desired frequency.

\subsection*{2.1.2 Negative feedback.}

When the feedback energy (voltage or current) is out of phase with the input signal and thus opposes it, it is called negative feedback. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.2. As you can see, the amplifier introduces a phase shift of 180 degrees into the circuit while the feedback network is so designed that it introduces no phase shift (i.e ., 0 degrees phase shift). The result is that the feedback voltage Vf is 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal Vin .

Negative feedback reduces the gain of the amplifier. However, the advantages of negative feedback are: reduction in distortion, stability in gain, increased bandwidth and improved input and output impedances. It is due to these advantages that negative feedback is frequently em-

Figure 2.3: Impact of negative feedback.

\subsection*{2.2 Gain of Negative Voltage Feedback Amplifier}

Consider the negative voltage feedback amplifier shown in Fig. ??. The gain of the amplifier without feedback is Av. Negative feedback is then applied by feeding a fraction mv of the output voltage e0 back to amplifier input. Therefore, the actual input to the amplifier is the signal voltage eg minus feedback voltage $m_{v} e_{0}$ i.e.,

It may be noted that negative voltage feedback does not affect the

Actual input to amplifier $=e_{g}-m_{v} e_{0}$
The output $e_{0}$ must be equal to the input voltage $e_{g}-m_{v} e_{0}$ multiplied by gain $A_{v}$ of the amplifier i.e.,
or
$$\left(e_{g}-m_{v} e_{0}\right) A_{v}=e_{0}$$
or
$$\begin{aligned}
A_{v} e_{g}-A_{v} m_{v} e_{0} & =e_{0} \\
e_{0}\left(1+A_{v} m_{v}\right) & =A_{v} e_{g}
\end{aligned}$$
or
$$\frac{e_{0}}{e_{g}}=\frac{A_{v}}{1+A_{v} m_{v}}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-24.jpg?height=655&width=1021&top_left_y=512&top_left_x=523)

But $e_{0} / e_{g}$ is the voltage gain of the amplifier with feedback.
$\therefore \quad$ Voltage gain with negative feedback is
$$A_{v f}=\frac{A_{v}}{1+A_{v} m_{v}}$$
current gain of the circuit.

\section*{Example:}

The overall gain of a multistage amplifier is 140 . When negative voltage feed- back is applied, the gain is reduced to 17.5. Find the fraction of the output that is fedback to the input.

Solution.
$$A_{v}=140, \quad A_{v f}=17.5$$

Let $m_{v}$ be the feedback fraction. Voltage gain with negative feedback is
or
$$A_{v f}=\frac{A_{v}}{1+A_{v} m_{v}}$$
or
$$17.5=\frac{140}{1+140 m_{v}}$$
$$\therefore \quad m_{v}=\frac{140-17.5}{2450}=\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{2 0}}$$

\subsection*{2.3 Advantages of Negative Voltage Feedback}

The following are the advantages of negative voltage feedback in amplifiers :

\section*{Gain stability.}

An important advantage of negative voltage feedback is that the resultant gain of the amplifier can be made independent of transistor parameters or the supply voltage variations.

For negative voltage feedback in an amplifier to be effective, the de-
signer deliberately makes the product $A_{v} m_{v}$ much greater than unity;
consequently, $A_{v f}=\frac{1}{m_{v}}$.
It may be seen that the gain now depends only upon feedback fraction mv i.e. , on the characteristics of feedback circuit. As feedback circuit is
usually a voltage divider (a resistive network), therefore, it is unaffected by changes in temperature, variations in transistor parameters and frequency. Hence, the gain of the amplifier is extremely stable,

\section*{Reduces non-linear distortion.}

A large signal stage has non-linear distortion because its voltage gain changes at various points in the cycle. The negative voltage feedback reduces the non- linear distortion in large signal amplifiers.

\section*{Improves frequency response.}

As feedback is usually obtained through a resistive net- work, therefore,
voltage gain of the amplifier is *independent of signal frequency. The result is that voltage gain of the amplifier will be substantially constant over a wide range of signal frequency. The negative voltage feedback, therefore, improves the frequency response of the amplifier.

\section*{Increases circuit stability.}

The output of an ordinary amplifier is easily changed due to variations in ambient temperature, frequency and signal amplitude. This changes the gain of the amplifier, resulting in distortion. However, by applying negative voltage feedback, voltage gain of the amplifier is stabilised or accurately fixed in value. This can be easily explained. Suppose the output of a negative voltage feedback amplifier has increased because of temperature change or due to some other reason. This means more negative feedback since feedback is being given from the output. This tends to oppose the increase in amplification and maintains it stable. The same is true should the output voltage decrease. Consequently, the circuit stability is considerably increased.

\section*{Increases input impedance and decreases output impedance.}

The negative voltage feedback increases the input impedance and decreases the output impedance of amplifier. Such a change is profitable in practice as the amplifier can then serve the purpose of impedance matching.

\section*{Sinusoidal Oscillators}

Many electronic devices require a source of energy at a specific frequency which may range from a few Hz to several MHz . This is achieved by an electronic device called an oscillator . Oscillators are extensively used in electronic equipment. For example, in radio and television receivers, oscillators are used to generate high frequency wave (called carrier wave ) in the tuning stages. Audio frequency and radiofrequency signals are required for the repair of radio, television and other electronic equipment. Oscillators are also widely used in radar, electronic computers and other electronic devices.

Oscillators can produce sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal ( e.g . square wave) waves. In this chapter, we shall confine our attention to sinusoidal oscillators i.e . those which produce sine-wave signals.

Although we speak of an oscillator as "generating" a frequency, it should be noted that it does not create energy, but merely acts as an energy converter. It receives d.c. energy and changes it into a.c. energy
of desired frequency. The frequency of oscillations depends upon the constants of the device. It may be mentioned here that although an alternator produces sinusoidal oscillations of 50 Hz , it cannot be called an oscillator. Firstly, an alternator is a mechanical device having ro-
tating parts whereas an oscillator is a non-rotating electronic device.
Secondly, an alternator converts mechanical energy into a.c. energy
while an oscillator converts d.c. energy into a.c. energy. Thirdly,
an alternator cannot produce high frequency oscillations whereas an
oscillator can produce oscillations ranging from a few Hz to several

\section*{MHz .}

\section*{Advantages}

Although oscillations can be produced by mechanical devices ( e.g . alternators), but electronic oscillators have the following advantages :
( i ) An oscillator is a non-rotating device. Consequently, there is little wear and tear and hence longer life.
( ii ) Due to the absence of moving parts, the operation of an oscillator is quite silent.
( iii ) An oscillator can produce waves from small ( 20 Hz ) to extremely high frequencies ( $>100 \mathrm{MHz}$ ).
( iv ) The frequency of oscillations can be easily changed when desired. ( v ) It has good frequency stability i.e . frequency once set remains
constant for a considerable period of time.
( vi ) It has very high efficiency.

\subsection*{3.1 Oscillatory Circuit}

A circuit which produces electrical oscillations of any desired frequency is known as an oscillatory circuit or tank circuit.

A simple oscillatory circuit consists of a capacitor ( C ) and inductance coil (L) in parallel as shown in Fig. 3.1. This electrical system can produce electrical oscillations of frequency determined by the values of L and C. To understand how this comes about, suppose the capacitor is charged from a d.c. source with a polarity as shown in Fig. 3.1 (i).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-29.jpg?height=404&width=1354&top_left_y=1511&top_left_x=354)

Figure 3.1: Oscillatory Circuit.
( i ) In the position shown in Fig. 3.1 (i), the upper plate of capacitor has deficit of electrons and the lower plate has excess of electrons. Therefore, there is a voltage across the capacitor and the capacitor has electrostatic energy.
( ii ) When switch S is closed as shown in Fig. 3.1 (ii ), the capacitor will discharge through inductance and the electron flow will be in the
direction indicated by the arrow. This current flow sets up magnetic field around the coil. Due to the inductive effect, the current builds up slowly towards a maximum value. The circuit current will be maximum when the capacitor is fully discharged. At this instant, electrostatic energy is zero but because electron motion is greatest (i.e. maximum current), the magnetic field energy around the coil is maximum. This is shown in Fig. 3.1 ( ii ). Obviously, the electrostatic energy across the capacitor is completely converted into magnetic field energy around the coil.
( iii ) Once the capacitor is discharged, the magnetic field will begin to collapse and produce a counter e.m.f. According to Lenz's law, the counter e.m.f. will keep the current flowing in the same direction. The result is that the capacitor is now charged with opposite polarity, making upper plate of capacitor negative and lower plate positive as shown in Fig. 3.1 ( iii ).
( iv ) After the collapsing field has recharged the capacitor, the capacitor now begins to discharge; current now flowing in the opposite direction. Fig. 3.1 ( iv ) shows capacitor fully discharged and maximum current flowing.

The sequence of charge and discharge results in alternating motion of electrons or an oscillating current. The energy is alternately stored in
the electric field of the capacitor ( C ) and the magnetic field of the inductance coil ( L ). This interchange of energy between L and C is repeated over and again resulting in the production of oscillations.

\section*{Waveform.}

If there were no losses in the tank circuit to consume the energy, the interchange of energy between L and C would continue indefinitely. In a practical tank circuit, there are resistive and radiation losses in the coil and dielectric losses in the capacitor. During each cycle, a small part of the originally imparted energy is used up to overcome these losses. The result is that the amplitude of oscillating current decreases gradually and eventually it bécomes zero when all the energy is consumed as losses. Therefore, the tank circuit by itself will produce damped oscillations as shown in Fig. 3.2.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-31.jpg?height=492&width=498&top_left_y=1741&top_left_x=776)

Figure 3.2: Output waveform.

\section*{Frequency of oscillations.}

The frequency of oscillations in the tank circuit is determined by the constants of the circuit viz L and C . The actual frequency of oscil-
lations is the resonant frequency (or natural frequency) of the tank circuit given by :
$$f_{r}=\frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{L C}}$$

It is clear that frequency of oscillations in the tank circuit is inversely proportional to L and C . This can be easily explained. If a large value of capacitor is used, it will take longer for the capacitor to charge fully and also longer to discharge. This will lengthen the period of oscillations in the tank circuit, or equivalently lower its frequency. With a large value of inductance, the opposition to change in current flow is greater and hence the time required to complete each cycle will be longer. Therefore, the greater the value of inductance, the longer is the period or the lower is the frequency of oscillations in the tank circuit.

\subsection*{3.1.1 Undamped Oscillations from Tank Circuit}

As discussed before, a tank circuit produces damped oscillations. However, in practice, we need continuous undamped oscillations for the successful operation of electronics equipment. In order to make the oscillations in the tank circuit undamped, it is necessary to supply correct amount of energy to the tank circuit at the proper time intervals to meet the losses. Thus, any energy which would be applied to the
circuit must have a polarity conforming to the existing polarity at the instant of application of energy. If the applied energy is of opposite polarity, it would oppose the energy in the tank circuit, causing stoppage of oscillations. Therefore, in order to make the oscillations in the tank circuit undamped, the following conditions must be fulfilled :
(i) The amount of energy supplied should be such so as to meet the losses in the tank circuit and the a.c. energy removed from the circuit by the load. For instance, if losses in LC circuit amount to 5 mW and a.c. output being taken is 100 mW , then power of 105 mW should be continuously supplied to the circuit.
( ii ) The applied energy should have the same frequency as that of the oscillations in the tank circuit.
( iii ) The applied energy should be in phase with the oscillations set up in the tank circuiti.e . it should aid the tank circuit oscillations.

Figure 3.3: Undamped oscillations.

\subsection*{3.2 Positive Feedback Amplifier Oscillator}

A transistor amplifier with proper positive feedback can act as an oscillator i.e ., it can generate oscillations without any external signal source. Fig. 3.4 shows a transistor amplifier with positive feedback.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-34.jpg?height=392&width=1049&top_left_y=672&top_left_x=515)

Figure 3.4: Positive Feedback.
( i ) We note that the circuit shown in Fig, 3.4 is producing oscillations in the output. However, this circuit has an input signal. This is inconsistent with our definition of an oscillator i.e ., an oscillator is a circuit that produces oscillations without any external signal source. ( ii ) When we open the switch S of Fig. 3.4, the input signal (Vin ) is removed. However, Vf (which is in phase with the original signal) is still applied to the input signal. The amplifier will respond to this signal in the same way that it did to Vin i.e ., Vf will be amplified and sent to the output. The feedback network sends a portion of the output back to the input. Therefore, the amplifier receives another input cycle and another output cycle is produced. This process will continue so long as the amplifier is turned on. Therefore, the amplifier
will produce sinusoidal output with no external signal source. The following points may be noted carefully :
( a ) A transistor amplifier with proper positive feedback will work as an oscillator.
( b ) The circuit needs only a quick trigger signal to start the oscillations. Once the oscillations have started, no external signal source is needed.
( c ) In order to get continuous undamped output from the circuit, the following condition must be met : $m_{v} A_{v}=1$. This relation is called Barkhausen criterion.
$A_{v}=$ voltage gain of amplifier without feedback
$m_{v}=$ feedback fraction
Note: The relation $m_{v} A_{v} \hat{\sigma} 1$ holds good for true ideal circuits. However, practical circuits need an $m_{v} A_{v}$ product that is slightly greater than 1. This is to compensate for power loss (e.g ., in resistors) in the circuit.

\subsection*{3.3 Essentials of Transistor Oscillator}

Fig. 3.5 shows the block diagram of an oscillator. Its essential components are:
(i) Tank circuit.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-36.jpg?height=530&width=757&top_left_y=149&top_left_x=641)

Figure 3.5: Transistor Oscillator.
It consists of inductance coil ( L ) connected in parallel with capacitor ( C ). The frequency of oscillations in the circuit depends upon the values of inductance of the coil and capacitance of the capacitor.
( ii ) Transistor amplifier .
The transistor amplifier receives d.c. power from the battery and changes it into a.c. power for supplying to the tank circuit. The oscillations occurring in the tank circuit are applied to the input of the transistor amplifier. Because of the amplifying properties of the transistor, we get increased output of these oscillations.

This amplified output of oscillations is due to the d.c. power supplied by the battery. The output of the transistor can be supplied to the tank circuit to meet the losses.
( iii ) Feedback circuit.
The feedback circuit supplies a part of collector energy to the tank circuit in correct phase to aid the oscillations i.e . it provides positive feedback.

\subsection*{3.4 Tuned Collector Oscillator}

Fig. 3.6 shows the circuit of tuned collector oscillator. It contains tuned circuit L1-C1 in the collector and hence the name. The frequency of oscillations depends upon the values of L 1 and C 1 and is given by :
$$f=\frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{L_{1} C_{1}}}$$

The feedback coil L2 in the base circuit is magnetically coupled to the tank circuit coil L1 . In practice, L1 and L2 form the primary and secondary of the transformer respectively. The biasing is provided by potential divider arrangement. The capacitor C connected in the base circuit provides low reactance path to the oscillations.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-37.jpg?height=678&width=1043&top_left_y=1600&top_left_x=515)

Figure 3.6: Tuned Collector Oscillator.

\section*{Circuit operation.}

When switch S is closed, collector current starts increasing and charges the capacitor C1. When this capacitor is fully charged, it discharges
through coil L1, setting up oscillations. These oscillations induce some voltage in coil L2 by mutual induction. The frequency of voltage in coil L2 is the same as that of tank circuit but its magnitude depends upon the number of turns of L2 and coupling between L1 and L2. The voltage across L2 is applied between base and emitter and appears in the amplified form in the collector circuit, thus overcoming the losses occurring in the tank circuit. The number of turns of L2 and coupling between L1 and L2 are so adjusted that oscillations across L2 are amplified to a level just sufficient to supply losses to the tank circuit. It may be noted that the phase of feedback is correct i.e . energy supplied to the tank circuit is in phase with the generated oscillations. A phase shift of 180 degrees is created between the voltages of L1 and L2 due to transformer action. A further phase shift of 180 degrees takes place between base-emitter and collector circuit due to transistor properties. As a result, the energy fedback to the tank circuit is in phase with the generated oscillations.

\subsection*{3.5 Colpitts Oscillator}

Fig. 3.7 shows a Colpitt's oscillator. It uses two capacitors and placed across a common inductor L and the centre of the two capacitors is tapped. The tank circuit is made up of C1, C2 and L . The frequency
of oscillations is determined by the values of $\mathrm{C} 1, \mathrm{C} 2$ and L and is given by ;
$$f=\frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{L C_{T}}}$$
$$C_{T}=\frac{C_{1} C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}$$

Figure 3.7: Colpitts Oscillator.

\section*{Circuit operation.}

When the circuit is turned on, the capacitors C1 and C2 are charged. The capacitors discharge through L , setting up oscillations. The output voltage of the amplifier appears across C 1 and feedback voltage is developed across C2. The voltage across it is 180 degrees out of phase with the voltage developed across C1 ( Vout ). It is easy to see that voltage fedback (voltage across C2 ) to the transistor provides positive feedback. A phase shift of 180 degrees is produced by the transistor and a further phase shift of 180 degrees is produced by $\mathrm{C} 1-\mathrm{C} 2$ voltage
divider. In this way, feedback is properly phased to produce continuous undamped oscillation.

\subsection*{3.6 Hartley Oscillator}

The Hartley oscillator is similar to Colpitts oscillator with minor modifications. Instead of using tapped capacitors, two inductors L1 and L 2 are placed across a common capacitor C and the centre of the inductors is tapped as shown in Fig. 3.8. The tank circuit is made up of L1, L2 and C. The frequency of oscillations is determined by the values of L1, L2 and C and is given by :
$$f=\frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{C L_{T}}}$$
$$L_{T}=L_{1}+L_{2}+2 M$$
$\mathrm{M}=$ mutual inductance between L1 and L2.

When the circuit is turned on, the capacitor is charged. When this capacitor is fully charged, it discharges through coils L1 and L2 setting up oscillations. The output voltage of the amplifier appears across L1 and feedback voltage across L2 . The voltage across L2 is 180 degrees out of phase with the voltage developed across L1 ( Vout ). It is easy to see that voltage fedback (i.e ,, voltage across L2 ) to the transistor provides positive feedback. A phase shift of 180 degrees is produced by the transistor and afurther phase shift of 180 degrees is produced by L1 - L2 voltage divider. In this way, feedback is properly phased to produce continuous undamped oscillations.

\section*{Chapter 4}

\section*{Hybrid Parameters}
n order to predict the behaviour of a small-signal transistor amplifier, it is important to know its operating characteristics e.g ., input impedance, output impedance, voltage gain etc . In the text so far,
these characteristics were determined by using $\beta$ and circuit resistance
values. This method of analysis has two principal advantages. Firstly,
the values of circuit components are readily available and secondly the
procedure followed is easily understood. However, the major draw-
back of this method is that accurate results cannot be obtained. It
is because the input and output circuits of a transistor amplifier are
not completely independent. For example, output current is affected
by the value of load resistance rather than being constant at the value
$\beta I_{b}$ Similarly, output voltage has an effect on the input circuit so that changes in the output cause changes in the input.

One of the methods that takes into account all the effects in a transistor amplifier is the hybrid parameter approach. In this method, four
parameters (one measured in ohm, one in mho, two dimensionless) of a transistor are measured experimentally. These are called hybrid or h parameters of the transistor. Once these parameters for a transistor are known, formulas can be developed for input impedance, voltage gain etc in terms of h parameters. There are two main reasons for using
h parameter method in describing the characteristics of a transistor.
Firstly, it yields exact results because the inter-effects of input and
output circuits are taken into account. Secondly, these parameters can
be measured very easily. To begin with, we shall apply h parameter approach to general circuits and then extend it to transistor amplifiers.

\subsection*{4.1 Hybrid Parameters}

Every linear circuit having input and output terminals can be analysed by four parameters (one measured in ohm, one in mho and two dimensionless) called hybrid or h Parameters. Hybrid means "mixed". Since these parameters have mixed dimensions, they are called hybrid parameters. Consider a linear circuit shown in Fig. 4.1.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-43.jpg?height=235&width=754&top_left_y=2270&top_left_x=651)

Figure 4.1: Linear circuit.

This circuit has input voltage and current labelled v1 and i1. This
circuit also has output voltage and current labelled v2 and i2 . Note that both input and output cur- rents (i1 and i2 ) are assumed to flow into the box ; input and output voltages ( v1 and v2 ) are assumed positive from the upper to the lower terminals. These are standard conventions and do not necessarily correspond to the actual directions and polarities. When we analyse circuits in which the voltages are of opposite polarity or where the currents flow out of the box, we simply treat these voltages and currents as negative quantities. It can be proved by advanced circuit theory that voltages and currents in Fig. 4.1 can be related by the following sets of equations :
$$\begin{aligned}
v_{1} & =h_{11} i_{1}+h_{12} v_{2} \\
i_{2} & =h_{21} i_{1}+h_{22} v_{2}
\end{aligned}$$

In these equations, the h's are fixed constants for a given circuit and are called h parameters, Once these parameters are known, we can use equations (i) and (ii ) to find the voltages and currents in the circuit. If we look at eq.(i), it is clear that h11 has the dimension of ohm and h12 is dimensionless. Similarly, from eq . (ii ), h21 is dimensionless and h22 has the dimension of mho.

Since h11 is a ratio of voltage and current (i.e . v1 / i1 ), it is an impedance and is called "input impedance with output shorted". Similarly, h21 is the ratio of output and input current (i.e ., i2 / i1 ), it is dimensionless and is called "current gain with output shorted".
$$\begin{aligned}
& h_{11}=\frac{v_{1}}{i_{1}} \quad \text { for } v_{2}=0 \text { i.e. output shorted } \\
& h_{21}=\frac{i_{2}}{i_{1}} \quad \text { for } v_{2}=0 \text { i.e. output shorted } \\
& h_{12}=\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}} \quad \text { for } i_{1}=0 \text { i.e. input open } \\
& h_{22}=\frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}} \quad \text { for } i_{1}=0 \text { i.e. input open }
\end{aligned}$$

Since h12 is a ratio of input and output voltages (i.e . v1 / v2 ), it is dimensionless and is called "voltage feedback ratio with input terminals open". Similarly, h22 is a ratio of output current and output voltage ( i.e . i2 / v2 ), it will be admittance and is called "output admittance with input terminals open".

Example:
Find the h parameters of the circuit below:

Solution:
$$\begin{aligned}
& h_{11}=10 \Omega ; h_{21}=-1 \\
& h_{12}=1 ; h_{22}=0.2 \mho
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{4.2 h Parameter Equivalent Circuit}

Fig. 4.2 ( i ) shows a linear circuit. It is required to draw the h parameter equivalent circuit of Fig. 4.2 (i).

Fig. 4.2 ( ii ) shows h parameter equivalent circuit of Fig. 4.2 (i) and is derived from equations (i) and (ii ). The input circuit appears as
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-46.jpg?height=326&width=1266&top_left_y=114&top_left_x=392)

Figure 4.2: h Parameter Equivalent Circuit.
a resistance h11 in series with a voltage generator h12v2. The output circuit involves two components; a current generator h21i1 and shunt resistance h22.

The different hybrid parameters are distinguished by different number subscripts. The notation shown in Fig. 4.2 (iǐ) is used in general circuit analysis. The first number designates the circuit in which the effect takes place and the second number designates the circuit from which the effect comes. For instance, h21 is the short-circuit forward current gain or the ratio of the current in the output ( circuit 2) to the current in the input (circuit 1).

The equivalent circuit of Fig. 4.2 ( ii ) is extremely useful for two main reasons. First, it isolates the input and output circuits, their interaction being accounted for by the two controlled sources. Thus,
the effect of output upon input is represented by the equivalent voltage generator h12v2 and its value depends upon output voltage. Similarly,
the effect of input upon output is represented by current generator h21il and its value depends upon input current. Secondly, the two parts of the circuit are in a form which makes it simple to take into

\subsection*{4.3 Performance of a Linear Circuit in h Parameters}

We have already seen that any linear circuit with input and output has a set of h parameters. We shall now develop formulas for input impedance, current gain, voltage gain etc.of a linear circuit in terms of $h$ parameters.

\subsection*{4.3.1 Input impedance.}

Consider a linear circuit with a load resistance rL across its terminals as shown in Fig. 4.3.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-47.jpg?height=335&width=877&top_left_y=1489&top_left_x=595)

Figure 4.3: Linear circuit.

The input impedance Zin of this circuit is the ratio of input voltage to input current i.e.
$$Z_{i n}=\frac{v_{1}}{i_{1}}$$

Now $v_{1}=h_{11} i_{1}+h_{12} v_{2}$ in terms of $h$ parameters. Substituting the value of $v_{1}$ in the above expression, we get,
$$\begin{gathered}
Z_{i n}=\frac{h_{11} i_{1}+h_{12} v_{2}}{i_{1}}=h_{11}+\frac{h_{12} v_{2}}{i_{1}} \\
i_{2}=h_{21} i_{1}+h_{22} v_{2}
\end{gathered}$$
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & \frac{-v_{2}}{r_{L}}=h_{21} i_{1}+h_{22} v_{2} \quad\left[\because i_{2}=\frac{-v_{2}}{r_{L}}\right] \\
\text { or } & -h_{21} i_{1}=h_{22} v_{2}+\frac{v_{2}}{r_{L}}=v_{2}\left(h_{22}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}\right) \\
\therefore & \frac{v_{2}}{i_{1}}=\frac{-h_{21}}{h_{22}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}}
\end{array}$$

Substituting the value of $v_{2} / i_{1}$ from exp. (ii) into exp. (i), we get,
$$\mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{in}}=h_{11}-\frac{h_{12} h_{21}}{h_{22}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}}$$

This is the expression for input impedance of a linear circuit in terms of $h$ parameters and load connected to the output terminals. If either $h_{12}$ or $r_{L}$ is very small, the second term in exp. (iii) can be neglected and input impedance becomes :
$$\mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{in}} \simeq h_{11}$$

\subsection*{4.3.2 Current gain.}
$$\begin{array}{lrl} 
& A_{i} & =\frac{i_{2}}{i_{1}} \\
\text { Now } & i_{2} & =h_{21} i_{1}+h_{22} v_{2} \\
\text { and } & v_{2} & =-i_{2} r_{L} \\
\therefore & i_{2} & =h_{21} i_{1}-h_{22} i_{2} r_{L} \\
\text { or } & i_{2}\left(1+h_{22} r_{L}\right) & =h_{21} i_{1} \\
\text { or } & \frac{i_{2}}{i_{1}} & =\frac{h_{21}}{1+h_{22} r_{L}}
\end{array}$$

But $i_{2} / i_{1}=A_{i}$, the current gain of the circuit.
$$\therefore \quad \mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{i}}=\frac{h_{21}}{1+h_{22} r_{L}}$$

If $h_{22} r_{L} \ll 1$, then $A_{i} \simeq h_{21}$.
The expression $A_{i} \simeq h_{21}$ is often useful. To say that $h_{22} r_{L} \ll 1$ is the same as saying that $r_{L} \ll 1 / h_{22}$. This occurs when $r_{L}$ is much smaller than the output resistance ( $1 / h_{22}$ ), shunting $h_{21} i_{l}$ generator. Under such condition, most of the generator current bypasses the circuit output resistance in favour of $r_{L}$. This means that $i_{2} \simeq h_{21} i_{1}$ or $i_{2} / i_{1} \simeq h_{21}$.

\subsection*{4.3.3 Voltage gain.}
$$\begin{aligned}
A_{v} & =\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}} \\
& =\frac{v_{2}}{i_{1} Z_{i n}} \quad\left(\because v_{1}=i_{1} Z_{i n}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

While developing expression for input impedance, we found that :
$$\frac{v_{2}}{i_{1}}=\frac{-h_{21}}{h_{22}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}}$$

Substituting the value of $v_{2} / i_{1}$ in $\exp$. (iv), we get,
$$\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{v}}=\frac{-h_{21}}{Z_{\text {in }}\left(h_{22}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}\right)}$$

With $v_{1}=0$ and applying Kirchhoff's voltage law to the input circuit, we have,
$$\begin{array}{ll} 
& 0=i_{1} h_{11}+h_{12} v_{2} \\
\therefore & i_{1}=-\frac{h_{12} v_{2}}{h_{11}} \\
\text { Now } & i_{2}=h_{21} i_{1}+h_{22} v_{2}
\end{array}$$

Putting the value of $i_{1}\left(=-h_{12} v_{2} / h_{11}\right)$ in this equation, we get,
or
$$\begin{aligned}
& i_{2}=h_{21}\left(-\frac{h_{12} v_{2}}{h_{11}}\right)+h_{22} v_{2} \\
& i_{2}=-\frac{h_{21} h_{12} v_{2}}{h_{11}}+h_{22} v_{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Dividing throughout by $v_{2}$, we have,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{i_{2}}{v_{2}} & =\frac{-h_{21} h_{12}}{h_{11}}+h_{22} \\
\therefore & Z_{\text {out }} & =\frac{v_{2}}{i_{2}}=\frac{1}{h_{22}-\frac{h_{21} h_{12}}{h_{11}}}
\end{aligned}$$

Solution:
$$\begin{array}{lll}
h_{11}=10 ; & & h_{21}=-1 \\
h_{12} & =1 \text { and } & h_{22}=0.2

(i) Input impedance is given by:

& =10+2.5=\mathbf{1 2 . 5} \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

By inspection, we can see that input impedance is equal to $10 \Omega$ plus two $5 \Omega$ resistances in parallel i.e.

$$\begin{aligned}

& =10+\frac{5 \times 5}{5+5}=12.5 \Omega \\
\text { Voltage gain, } \quad A_{v} & =\frac{-h_{21}}{Z_{\text {in }}\left(h_{22}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}\right)}=\frac{1}{12.5\left(0.2+\frac{1}{5}\right)}=\frac{1}{5}

\subsection*{4.4 The h Parameters of a Transistor}

It has been seen in the previous sections that every linear circuit is associated with h parameters. When this linear circuit is terminated by load rL, we can find input impedance, current gain, voltage gain, etc. in terms of h parameters. Fortunately, for small a.c. signals, the transistor behaves as a limear device because the output a.c. signal is directly proportional to the input a.c. signal. Under such circumstances, the a.c. operation of the transistor can be described in terms of $h$ parameters. The expressions derived for input impedance, voltage gain etc . in the previous section shall hold good for transistor amplifier except that here rL is the a.c. load seen by the transistor.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-50.jpg?height=324&width=955&top_left_y=2351&top_left_x=559)

Figure 4.4: Transistor amplifier circuit.

The following points are worth noting while considering the behaviour of transistor in terms of $h$ parameters :
( i ) For small a.c. signals, a transistor behaves as a linear circuit. Therefore, its a.c. operation can be described in terms of $h$ parameters. ( ii ) The value of $h$ parameters of a transistor will depend upon the transistor connection (i.e. CB, CE or CC ) used. For instance, a transistor used in CB arrangement may have h11 $=20 \Omega$. If we use the same transistor in CE arrangement, h11 will have a different value. Same is the case with other $h$ parameters.
( iii ) The expressions for input impedance, voltage gain etc. derived earlier are also applicable to transistor amplifier except that rL is the a.c. load seen by the transistor i.e . $r_{L}=R_{C} \| R_{L}$ ( iv ) The values of $h$ parameters depend upon the operating point. If the operating point is changed, parameter values are also changed. ( v ) The notations v1, i1, v2 and i2 are used for general circuit analysis. In a transistor amplifier, we use the notation depending upon the configuration in which transistor is used. Thus for CE arrangement, $\mathrm{v} 1=\mathrm{Vbe} ; \mathrm{i} 1=\mathrm{Ib} ; \mathrm{v} 2=\mathrm{Vce} ; \mathrm{i} 2=\mathrm{Ic}$

Here Vbe, Ib, Vce and Ic are the R.M.S. values.

\subsection*{4.5 Nomenclature for Transistor h Parameters}

The numerical subscript notation for h parameters ( viz . h11, h21 , h12 and h22 ) is used in general circuit analysis. However, this nomenclature has been modified for a transistor to indicate the nature of parameter and the transistor configuration used. The h parameters of a transistor are represented by the following notation :
(i) The numerical subscripts are replaced by letter subscripts.
( ii ) The first letter in the double subscript notation indicates the nature of parameter.
( iii ) The second letter in the double subscript notation indicates the circuit arrangement (i.e. $\mathrm{CB}, \mathrm{CE}$ or CC ) used.

Table below shows the h parameter nomenclature of a transistor :
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline S.No. & $h$ parameter & Notation in CB & Notation in CE & Notation in CC \\
\hline 1. & $h_{11}$ & $h_{i b}$ & $h_{i e}$ & $h_{i c}$ \\
\hline 2. & $h_{12}$ & $h_{r b}$ & $h_{r e}$ & $h_{r c}$ \\
\hline 3. & $h_{21}$ & $h_{f b}$ & $h_{f e}$ & $h_{f c}$ \\
\hline 4. & $h_{22}$ & $h_{o b}$ & $h_{o e}$ & $h_{o c}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Note that first letter i, r, f or o indicates the nature of parameter. Thus h11 indicates input impedance and this parameter is designated by the subscript i . Similarly, letters r, f and o respectively indicate reverse voltage feedback ratio, forward current transfer ratio and output admittance. The second letters b , e and c respectively indicate CB , CE and CC arrangement.

\subsection*{4.6 Transistor Circuit Performance in h Parameters}

The expressions for input impedance, voltage gain etc. in terms of h parameters derived earlier for general circuit analysis apply equally for transistor analysis. However, it is profitable to rewrite them in standard transistor h parameter nomenclature.

\subsection*{4.6.1 Input impedance}

The general expression for input impedance is:
$$Z_{\text {in }}=h_{11}-\frac{h_{12} h_{21}}{h_{22}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}}$$

Using standard $h$ parameter nomenclature for transistor, its value for $C E$ arrangement will be :
$$Z_{i n}=h_{i e}-\frac{h_{r e} h_{f e}}{h_{o e}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}}$$

Similarly, expressions for input impedance in CB and CC arrangements can be written. It may be noted that rL is the a.c. load seen by the transistor.

\subsection*{4.6.2 Current gain.}

The general expression for current gain is:
$$A_{i}=\frac{h_{21}}{1+h_{22} r_{L}}$$

Using standard transistor h parameter nomenclature, its value for CE arrangement is:
$$A_{i}=\frac{h_{f e}}{1+h_{o e} r_{L}}$$

\subsection*{4.6.3 Voltage gain.}

The general expression for voltage gain is:
$$A_{v}=\frac{-h_{21}}{Z_{i n}\left(h_{22}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}\right)}$$

Using standard transistor h parameter nomenclature, its value for CE arrangement is:
$$A_{v}=\frac{-h_{f e}}{Z_{i n}\left(h_{o e}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}\right)}$$

\subsection*{4.6.4 Output impedance.}

The general expression for output impedance is:
$$Z_{\text {out }}=\frac{1}{h_{22}-\frac{h_{21} h_{12}}{h_{11}}}$$

Using standard transistor h parameter nomenclature, its value for CE arrangement is:
$$Z_{o u t}=\frac{1}{h_{o e}-\frac{h_{f e} h_{r e}}{h_{i e}}}$$

Example:
A transistor used in CE arrangement has the following set of h parameters when the d.c. operating point is $\mathrm{VCE}=10$ volts and $\mathrm{IC}=1 \mathrm{~mA}$
hie $=2000 \Omega$; hoe $=10^{-4}$ mho; hre $=10^{-3} ;$ hfe $=50$
Determine (i) input impedance (ii) current gain and (iii) voltage gain.
The a.c. load seen by the transistor is $\mathrm{rL}=600 \Omega$. What will be approximate values using reasonable approximations?

Solution:
$$\begin{aligned}
Z_{i n} & =h_{i e}-\frac{h_{r e} h_{f e}}{h_{o e}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}}=2000-\frac{10^{-3} \times 50}{10^{-4}+\frac{1}{600}} \\
& =2000-28=1972 \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

The second term in eq. $(i)$ is quite small as compared to the first.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad Z_{i n} \simeq h_{i e}=\mathbf{2 0 0 0 \Omega} \\
& \text { (ii) } \quad \text { Current gain, } A_{i}=\frac{h_{f e}}{1+h_{o e} \times r_{L}}=\frac{50}{1+\left(600 \times 10^{-4}\right)}=47 \\
& \text { If } h_{o e} r_{L} \ll 1 \text {, then } A_{i} \simeq h_{f e}=\mathbf{5 0} \\
& \text { (iii) } \\
& \text { Voltage gain, } A_{v}=\frac{-h_{f e}}{Z_{i n}\left(h_{o e}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}\right)}=\frac{-50}{1972\left(10^{-4}+\frac{1}{600}\right)}=-14.4
\end{aligned}$$

The negative sign indicates that there is 180 degrees phase shift between input and output.

\subsection*{4.7 Approximate Hybrid Formulas for Transistor Amplifier}

The h-parameter formulas ( CE configuration) covered in the previous section can be approximated to a form that is easier to handle. While these approximate formulas will not give results that are as accurate as the original formulas, they can be used for many applications.
(i) Inputimpedance
$$\text { Input impedance, } Z_{i n}=h_{i e}-\frac{h_{r e} h_{f e}}{h_{o e}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}}$$

In actual practice, the second term in this expression is very small as compared to the first term.
$\therefore$
$$Z_{i n}=h_{i e}$$
... approximate formula
(ii) Current gain
$$\text { Current gain, } A_{i}=\frac{h_{f e}}{1+h_{o e} r_{L}}$$

In actual practice, $h_{o e} r_{L}$ is very small as compared to 1 .
$\therefore$
$$A_{i}=h_{f e}$$
... approximate formula
(iii) Voltage gain
$$\text { Voltage gain, } \begin{aligned}
A_{v} & =\frac{-h_{f e}}{Z_{i n}\left(h_{o e}+\frac{1}{r_{L}}\right)} \\
& =\frac{-h_{f e} r_{L}}{Z_{i n}\left(h_{o e} r_{L}+1\right)}
\end{aligned}$$

Now approximate formula for $Z_{i n}$ is $h_{i e^{*}}$. Also $h_{o e} r_{L}$ is very small as compared to 1 .
$\therefore \quad A_{v}=-\frac{h_{f e} r_{L}}{h_{i e}} \quad \ldots$ approximate formula
(iv) Output impedance

Output impedance of transistor, $\quad Z_{o u t}=\frac{1}{h_{o e}-\frac{h_{f e} h_{r e}}{h_{i e}}}$
The second term in the denominator is very small as compared to $h_{o e}$.
$$\therefore \quad Z_{\text {out }}=\frac{1}{h_{o e}} \quad \ldots \text { approximate formula }$$

The output impedance of transistor amplifier
$$=Z_{\text {out }} \| r_{L} \quad \text { where } * r_{L}=R_{C} \| R_{L}$$

\section*{Operational Amplifiers}

Historically, an operational amplifier ( OP - Amp) was designed to perform such mathematical operations as addition, subtraction, integration and differentiation. Hence, the name operational amplifier. An operational amplifier is a multistage amplifier and consists of a differential amplifier stage, a high-gain CE amplifier stage and class B push-pull emitter follower. An operational amplifier ( OP -Amp) is an integrated circuit and is widely used in computers, as video and audio amplifiers in communication electronics. Because of their multipurpose use, OP -Amps are used in all branches of electronics, both digital and linear circuits. In this chapter, we shall discuss the various aspects of operational amplifiers.

\subsection*{5.1 Operational Amplifier}

An operational amplifier ( OP-Amp ) is a circuit that can perform such mathematical operations as addition, subtraction, integration and
differentiation. Fig. 5.1 shows the block diagram of an operational amplifier. Note that OP -Amp is a multistage amplifier. The three stages are : differential amplifier input stage followed by a high-gain CE amplifier and finally the output stage. The key electronic circuit in an OP-Amp is the differential amplifier. A differential amplifier ( DA ) can accept two input signals and amplifies the difference between these two input signals.

Figure 5.1: Operational Amplifier.

The following points may be noted about operational amplifiers ( OP -Amps) :
(i) The input stage of an OP -Amp is a differential amplifier (DA ) and the output stage is typically a class B push-pull emitter follower. ( ii ) The internal stages of an OP -Amp are direct-coupled i.e ., no coupling capacitors are used. The direct coupling allows the OP -Amp to amplify d.c. as well as a.c. signals.
( iii ) An OP-Amp has very high input impedance (ideally infinite) and very low output impedance (ideally zero). The effect of high input impedance is that the $\underset{\text { This documentis saviabbe on }}{\text { amplill }}$ duad very small current (ideally
zero) from the signal source. The effect of very low output impedance is that the amplifier will provide a constant output voltage independent of current drawn from the source.
( iv ) An OP-Amp has very high open-loop voltage gain (ideally infinite); typically more than 200,000 .
( v ) The OP-Amps are almost always operated with negative feedback. It is because the open- loop voltage gain of these amplifiers is very high and we can sacrifice the gain to achieve the advantages of negative feedback including large bandwidth ( BW ) and gain stability.

\subsection*{5.1.1 Differential Amplifier (DA)}

A differential amplifier is a circuit that can accept two input signals and amplify the difference between these two input signals.

Figure 5.4: Differential Amplifier.

A differential amplifier has an open-circuit voltage gain of 100. The input signals are 3.25 V and 3.15 V . Determine the output voltage. When only one output terminal is available, the phase of the output of single-ended input DA depends on which input receives the input signal.

Figure 5.6: Operational Amplifier symbol.

Note that the input terminals are marked + and. These are not polarity signs. The sign indicates the inverting input while the + sign indicates the noninverting input. A signal applied to plus terminal
will appear in the same phase at the output as at the input. A signal applied to the minus terminal will be shifted in phase 180 degrees at the output.

The voltages v1, v2 and vout are node voltages. This means that they are always measured w.r.t. ground. The differential input vin is the difference of two node voltages v1 and v2. We normally do not show the ground in the symbol.

For the sake of simplicity, +V and V terminals are often omitted from the symbol as shown in Fig. 5.6( ii ). The two input leads are always shown on the symbol regardless of whether they are both used.

In most cases, if only one input is required for an OP -amp circuit, the input not in use will be shown connected to ground. A single-input OP -amp is generally classified as either inverting or non-inverting. The OP -amp is produced as an integrated circuit ( IC ). Because of the complexity of the internal circuitry of an OP -amp, the OP -amp symbol is used exclusively in circuit diagrams.

\subsection*{5.2 Output Voltage From OP-Amp}

The maximum possible voltage gain from a given OP-amp is called open-loop voltage gain and is denoted by the symbol $A_{O L}$. The value of AOL for an OP -amp is generally greater than 10,000 . The term
open-loop indicates a circuit condition where there is no feedback path from the output to the input of OP-amp. The OP -amps are almost always operated with negative feedback i.e ., a part of the output signal is fed back in phase opposition to the input.

When a feedback path is present such as Rf connection in Fig. 5.7, the resulting circuit gain is referred to as closed-loop voltage gain $\left(A_{C L}\right)$.

\subsection*{5.5 Summing Amplifiers}

A summing amplifier is an inverted OP -amp that can accept two or more inputs. The output voltage of a summing amplifier is proportional to the negative of the algebraic sum of its input voltages. Hence the name summing amplifier.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-65.jpg?height=375&width=732&top_left_y=792&top_left_x=665)

Figure 5.9: Summing Amplifier.

Using the concepts of infinite impedance and virtual ground, you can see that inverting input of the OP -amp is at virtual ground (0V ) and there is no current to the input. This means that the three input currents I1, I2 and I3 combine at the summing point A and form the total current ( If ) which goes through Rf.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { When all the three inputs are applied, the output voltage is } \\
& \text { Output voltage, } \begin{aligned}
& V_{\text {out }}=-I_{f} R_{f}=-R_{f}\left(I_{1}+I_{2}+I_{3}\right) \\
&=-R_{f}\left(\frac{V_{1}}{R_{1}}+\frac{V_{2}}{R_{2}}+\frac{V_{3}}{R_{3}}\right) \\
& \therefore \\
& \therefore \\
& \text { If } R_{1}=R_{2}=R_{3}=R \text {, then, we have, }=-R_{f}\left(\frac{V_{1}}{R_{1}}+\frac{V_{2}}{R_{2}}+\frac{V_{3}}{R_{3}}\right) \\
& \qquad V_{\text {out }}=-\frac{R_{f}}{R}\left(V_{1}+V_{2}+V_{3}\right)
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$

Example:
Determine the output voltage for the summing amplifier shown in Fig.
below.

\subsection*{5.5.1 Applications of Summing Amplifiers}

By proper modifications, a summing amplifier can be made to perform many useful functions. There are a number of applications of summing amplifiers. However, we shall discuss the following two applications by way of illustration:
1. As averaging amplifier
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-66.jpg?height=387&width=709&top_left_y=1571&top_left_x=659)

Figure 5.10: Averaging Amplifier.

By using the proper input and feedback resistor values, a summing amplifier can be designed to provide an output voltage that is equal to the average of input voltages. A summing amplifier will act as an averaging amplifier when both of the following conditions are met:
(i) All input resistors ( $\mathrm{R} 1, \mathrm{R} 2$ and so on) are equal in value.
( ii ) The ratio of any input resistor to the feedback resistor is equal to the number of input circuits.
2. As subtractor
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-67.jpg?height=563&width=1066&top_left_y=481&top_left_x=481)

Figure 5.11: Subtracting Amplifier.
$$V_{\text {out }}=-\left(V_{A}+V_{B}\right)=-\left(-V_{1}+V_{2}\right)=V_{1}-V_{2}$$

\subsection*{5.6 OP-Amp Integrators and Differentiators}

A circuit that performs the mathematical integration of input signal is called an integrator. The output of an integrator is proportional to the area of the input waveform over a period of time. A circuit that performs the mathematical differentiation of input signal is called a differentiator. The output of a differentiator is proportional to the rate of change of its input signal. Note that the two operations are opposite.

\subsection*{5.6.1 OP -Amp Integrator}

As discussed above, an integrator is a circuit that performs integration of the input signal. The most popular application of an integrator is to produce a ramp output voltage ( i.e. a linearly increasing or decreasing voltage). Fig. 5.12 shows the circuit of an OP -amp integrator. It consists of an OP -amp, input resistor R and feedback capacitor C. Note that the feedback component is a capacitor instead of a resistor. As we shall see, when a signal is applied to the input of this circuit, the output-signal waveform will be the integration of input-signal waveform.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-68.jpg?height=364&width=1243&top_left_y=1400&top_left_x=392)

Figure 5.12: OP -Amp Integrator.

Now
$$i=\frac{v_{i}-0}{R}=\frac{v_{i}}{R}$$

Also voltage across capacitor is $v_{c}=0-v_{o}=-v_{o}$
$$\therefore \quad i_{c}=\frac{C d v_{c}}{d t}=-C \frac{d v_{o}}{d t}$$

From eqs. (i) and (ii), $\quad \frac{v_{i}}{R}=-C \frac{d v_{o}}{d t}$
or
$$\frac{d v_{o}}{d t}=-\frac{1}{R C} v_{i}$$

To find the output voltage, we integrate both sides of eq. (iii) to get,
$$v_{o}=-\frac{1}{R C} \int_{0}^{t} v_{i} d t$$

\subsection*{5.6.2 OP -Amp differentiator}

A differentiator is a circuit that performs differentiation of the input signal. In other words, a differentiator produces an output voltage that is proportional to the rate of change of the input voltage. Its important application is to produce a rectangular output from a ramp input. Fig. 5.13 shows the circuit of OP-amp differentiator. It consists of an OP-amp, an input capacitor C and feedback resistor R . Note how the placement of the capacitor and resistor differs from the integrator. The capacitor is now the input element.

\section*{Silicon Controlled Rectifiers}

The silicon controlled rectifier (abbreviated as SCR) is a three-terminal semiconductor switching device which is probably the most important circuit element after the diode and the trańsistor. Invented in 1957, an SCR can be used as a controlled switch to perform various functions such as rectification, inversion and regulation of power flow. The SCR has assumed paramount importance in electronics because it can be produced in versions to fandle currents upto several thousand amperes and voltages upto more than 1 kV . The SCR has appeared in the market under different names such as thyristor, thyrode transistor. It is a unidirectional power switch and is being extensively used in switching d.c. and a.c., rectifying a.c. to give controlled d.c. output, converting d.c. into a.c. etc.

\subsection*{6.1 Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) construction}

A silicon controlled rectifier is a semiconductor device that acts as a true electronic switch. It can change alternating current into direct current and at the same time can control the amount of power fed to the load. Thus SCR combines the features of a rectifier and a transistor.

Figure 6.1: Silicon Controlled Rectifier.

When a pn junction is added to a junction transistor, the resulting three pn junction device is called a silicon controlled rectifier. Fig. 6.1 (i) shows its construction. It is clear that it is essentially an ordinary rectifier ( pn ) and a junction transistor ( npn ) combined in one unit to form pnpn device. Three terminals are taken; one from the outer p - type material called anode A, second from the outer n-type material called cathode K and the third from the base of transistor section and is called gate G . In the normal operating conditions of SCR , anode is held at high positive potential w.r.t. cathode and gate at small positive potential w.r.t. cathode. Fig. 6.1 ( ii ) shows the symbol of SCR .

The silicon controlled rectifier is a solid state equivalent of thyratron. The gate, anode and cathode of SCR correspond to the grid, plate and cathode of thyratron. For this reason, SCR is sometimes called thyristor .

\subsection*{6.2 Working of SCR}

In a silicon controlled rectifier, load is connected in series with anode. The anode is always kept at positive potential w.r.t. cathode. The working of SCR can be studied under the following two heads:
(i) When gate is open.

Fig. 6.2 shows the SCR circuit with gate open i.e . no voltage applied to the gate.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-72.jpg?height=509&width=1220&top_left_y=1633&top_left_x=441)

Figure 6.2: Silicon Controlled Rectifier.

Under this condition, junction J2 is reverse biased while junctions J1 and J3 are forward biased. Hence, the situation in the junctions J1 and J3 is just as in a npn transistor with base open. Consequently, no current flows through the load RL and the SCR is cut off . However, if
the applied voltage is gradually increased, a stage is reached when reverse biased junction J2 breaks down. The SCR now conducts heavily and is said to be in the ON state. The applied voltage at which SCR conducts heavily without gate voltage is called Breakover voltage. ( ii ) When gate is positive w.r.t. cathode.

The SCR can be made to conduct heavily at smaller applied voltage by applying a small positive potential to the gate as shown in Fig. 6.3.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-73.jpg?height=510&width=1377&top_left_y=987&top_left_x=345)

Figure 6.3: Silicon Controlled Rectifier.

Now junction J3 is forward biased and junction J2 is reverse biased. The electrons from n-type material start mov- ing across junction J3 towards left whereas holes from p -type towards the right. Consequently, the electrons from junction J3 are attracted across junction J2 and gate current starts flowing. As soon as the gate current flows, anode current increases. The increased anode current in turn makes more electrons available at junction J2 . This process continues and in an extremely small time, junction J2 breaks down and the SCR starts conducting heavily. Once SCR starts conducting, the gate (the
reason for this name is obvious) loses all control. Even if gate voltage is removed, the anode current does not decrease at all. The only way to stop conduction (i.e . bring SCR in off condition) is to reduce the applied voltage to zero.

\section*{Conclusion.}

The following conclusions are drawn from the working of SCR :
(i) An SCR has two states i.e. either it does not conduct or it conducts heavily. There is no state in-between. Therefore, SCR behaves like a switch.
( ii ) There are two ways to turn on the SCR. The first method is to keep the gate open and make the supply voltage equal to the breakover voltage. The second method is to operate SCR with supply voltage less than breakover voltage and then turn it on by means of a small voltage ( typically $1.5 \mathrm{~V}, 30 \mathrm{~mA}$ ) applied to the gate.
( iii ) Applying small positive voltage to the gate is the normal way to close an SCR because the breakover voltage is usually much greater than supply voltage.
( iv ) To open the SCR (i.e . to make it non-conducting ), reduce the supply voltage to zero.

\subsection*{6.3 Applications}

\subsection*{6.3.1 SCR as a Switch}

The SCR has only two states, namely; ON state and OFF state and no state inbetween. When appropriate gate current is passed, the SCR starts conducting heavily and remains in this position indefinitely even if gate voltage is removed. This corresponds to the ON condition. However, when the anode current is reduced to the holding current, the SCR is turned OFF. It is clear that behaviour of SCR is similar to a mechanical switch. As SCR is an electronic device, therefore, it is more appropriate to call it an electronic switch . Advantages of SCR as a switch. An SCR has the following advantages over a mechanical or electromechanical switch (relay) :
(i) It has no moving parts. Consequently, it gives noiseless operation at high efficiency.
( ii ) The switching speed is very high upto 10 operations per second. ( iii ) It permits control over large current (30100 A) in the load by means of a small gate current (a few mA).
( iv ) It has a small size and gives trouble free service.

\subsection*{6.3.2 SCR Half-Wave Rectifier}

One important application of an SCR is the controlled half-wave rectification. Fig. 6.4 ( i ) shows the circuit of an SCR half-wave rectifier. The a.c. supply to be rectified is supplied through the transformer. The load resistance RL is connected in series with the anode. A variable resistance $r$ is inserted in the gate circuit to control the gate current.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-76.jpg?height=489&width=1420&top_left_y=898&top_left_x=324)

Figure 6.4: SCR Half-Wave Rectifier.

\section*{Operation.}

The a.c. supply to be converted into d.c. supply is applied to the primary of the transformer. Suppose the peak reverse voltage appearing across secondary is less than the reverse breakdown voltage of the SCR . This condition ensures that SCR will not break down during negative half-cycles of a.c. supply. The circuit action is as follows :
( i ) During the negative half-cycles of a.c. voltage appearing across secondary, the SCR does not conduct regardless of the gate voltage. It is because in this condition, anode is negative w.r.t . cathode and also PRV is less than the reverse breakdown voltage.
( ii ) The SCR will conduct during the positive half-cycles provided proper gate current is made to flow. The greater the gate current, the lesser the supply voltage at which SCR is turned ON . The gate current can be changed by the variable resistance r as shown in Fig. 6.4 ( i ). ( iii ) Suppose that gate current is adjusted to such a value that SCR closes at a positive voltage V1 which is less than the peak voltage Vm . Referring to Fig. 6.4 ( ii ), it is clear that SCR will start conducting when secondary a.c. voltage becomes V1 in the positive half-cycle. Beyond this, the SCR will continue to conduct till voltage becomes zero at which point it is turned OFF. Again at the start of the next positive half-cycle, SCR will start conducting when secondary voltage becomes V1.
( iv ) Referring to Fig. 6.4 (ii ), it is clear that firing angle is $\alpha$ i.e. at this angle in the positive half-cycle, SCR starts conduction. The conduction angle is $\left(\phi=180^{\circ}-\alpha\right)$.

It is worthwhile to distinguish between an ordinary half-wave rectifier and SCR half-wave rectifier. Whereas an ordinary half-wave rectifier will conduct full positive half-cycle, an SCR half-wave rectifier can be made to conduct full or part of a positive half-cycle by proper adjustment of gate current. Therefore, an SCR can control power fed to the load and hence the name controlled rectifier.

\subsection*{6.3.3 SCR Full-Wave Rectifier}

Fig. 6.5 ( i ) shows the circuit of SCR full-wave rectifier. It is exactly like an ordinary centre-tap circuit except that the two diodes have been replaced by two SCRs. The gates of both SCRs get their supply from two gate controls.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-78.jpg?height=664&width=1377&top_left_y=759&top_left_x=328)

Figure 6.5: SCR Full-Wave Rectifier.

One SCR conducts during the positive half-cycle and the other during the negative half-cycle. Consequently, full-wave rectified output is obtained across the load. Operation. The angle of conduction can be changed by adjusting the gate currents. Suppose the gate currents are so adjusted that SCRs conduct as the secondary voltage (across half winding) becomes V1 . During the positive half-cycle of a.c. across secondary, the upper end of secondary is positive and the lower end negative. This will cause SCR1 to conduct. However, the conduction will start only when the voltage across the upper half of secondary becomes V1 as shown $\operatorname{in}_{\text {This socument is avaiabe on }}^{6.5}$ ( ii this way only shaded portion
of positive half-cycle will pass through the load. During the negative half-cycle of a.c. input, the upper end of secondary becomes negative and the lower end positive. This will cause SCR2 to conduct when the voltage across the lower half of secondary becomes V1. It may be seen that current through the load is in the same direction (d.c.) on both half-cycles of input a.c. The obvious advantage of this circuit over ordinary full-wave rectifier circuit is that by adjusting the gate currents, we can change the conduction angle and hence the output voltage.
