                        <p>The silicon controlled rectifier (abbreviated as SCR) is a three-terminal semiconductor switching device which is probably the most important circuit element after the diode and the tra≈Ñsistor. Invented in 1957, an SCR can be used as a controlled switch to perform various functions such as rectification, inversion and regulation of power flow. The SCR has assumed paramount importance in electronics because it can be produced in versions to fandle currents upto several thousand amperes and voltages upto more than 1 kV . The SCR has appeared in the market under different names such as thyristor, thyrode transistor. It is a unidirectional power switch and is being extensively used in switching d.c. and a.c., rectifying a.c. to give controlled d.c. output, converting d.c. into a.c. etc.</p>

                         <p>A silicon controlled rectifier is a semiconductor device that acts as a true electronic switch. It can change alternating current into direct current and at the same time can control the amount of power fed to the load. Thus SCR combines the features of a rectifier and a transistor.</p>

                         <p>When a pn junction is added to a junction transistor, the resulting three pn junction device is called a silicon controlled rectifier. Fig. 6.1 (i) shows its construction. It is clear that it is essentially an ordinary rectifier ( pn ) and a junction transistor ( npn ) combined in one unit to form pnpn device. Three terminals are taken; one from the outer p - type material called anode A, second from the outer n-type material called cathode K and the third from the base of transistor section and is called gate G . In the normal operating conditions of SCR , anode is held at high positive potential w.r.t. cathode and gate at small positive potential w.r.t. cathode. Fig. 6.1 ( ii ) shows the symbol of SCR .</p>
                         <p>The silicon controlled rectifier is a solid state equivalent of thyratron. The gate, anode and cathode of SCR correspond to the grid, plate and cathode of thyratron. For this reason, SCR is sometimes called thyristor .</p>

                         <p>In a silicon controlled rectifier, load is connected in series with anode. The anode is always kept at positive potential w.r.t. cathode. The working of SCR can be studied under the following two heads:</p>
                         <p>(i) When gate is open.</p>
                         <p>Fig. 6.2 shows the SCR circuit with gate open i.e . no voltage applied to the gate.</p>
                         <figure>

                         </figure>
                         <p>Under this condition, junction J2 is reverse biased while junctions J1 and J3 are forward biased. Hence, the situation in the junctions J1 and J3 is just as in a npn transistor with base open. Consequently, no current flows through the load RL and the SCR is cut off . However, if the applied voltage is gradually increased, a stage is reached when reverse biased junction J2 breaks down. The SCR now conducts heavily and is said to be in the ON state. The applied voltage at which SCR conducts heavily without gate voltage is called Breakover voltage.</p>
                         <p>( ii ) When gate is positive w.r.t. cathode.</p>
                         <p>The SCR can be made to conduct heavily at smaller applied voltage by applying a small positive potential to the gate as shown in Fig. 6.3.</p>
                         <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-73-1.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3: SCR circuit with positive gate voltage applied via gate resistor RG and voltage source Vg.

                         </figure>
                         <p>Now junction J3 is forward biased and junction J2 is reverse biased. The electrons from n-type material start mov- ing across junction J3 towards left whereas holes from p -type towards the right. Consequently, the electrons from junction J3 are attracted across junction J2 and gate current starts flowing. As soon as the gate current flows, anode current increases. The increased anode current in turn makes more electrons available at junction J2 . This process continues and in an extremely small time, junction J2 breaks down and the SCR starts conducting heavily. Once SCR starts conducting, the gate (the reason for this name is obvious) loses all control. Even if gate voltage is removed, the anode current does not decrease at all. The only way to stop conduction (i.e . bring SCR in off condition) is to reduce the applied voltage to zero.</p>

                         <p>The SCR has only two states, namely; ON state and OFF state and no state inbetween. When appropriate gate current is passed, the SCR starts conducting heavily and remains in this position indefinitely even if gate voltage is removed. This corresponds to the ON condition. However, when the anode current is reduced to the holding current, the SCR is turned OFF. It is clear that behaviour of SCR is similar to a mechanical switch. As SCR is an electronic device, therefore, it is more appropriate to call it an electronic switch .</p>

                         <p>One important application of an SCR is the controlled half-wave rectification. Fig. 6.4 ( i ) shows the circuit of an SCR half-wave rectifier. The a.c. supply to be rectified is supplied through the transformer. The load resistance RL is connected in series with the anode. A variable resistance r is inserted in the gate circuit to control the gate current.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Operation.</h4>
                         <p>The a.c. supply to be converted into d.c. supply is applied to the primary of the transformer. Suppose the peak reverse voltage appearing across secondary is less than the reverse breakdown voltage of the SCR . This condition ensures that SCR will not break down during negative half-cycles of a.c. supply. The circuit action is as follows :</p>
                          <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(i)</span><span class="item-text">During the negative half-cycles of a.c. voltage appearing across secondary, the SCR does not conduct regardless of the gate voltage.

The greater the gate current, the lesser the supply voltage at which SCR is turned ON . The gate current can be changed by the variable resistance r as shown in Fig. 6.4 ( i ).</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(iii)</span><span class="item-text">Suppose that gate current is adjusted to such a value that SCR closes at a positive voltage V1 which is less than the peak voltage Vm . Referring to Fig. 6.4 ( ii ), it is clear that SCR will start conducting when secondary a.c. voltage becomes V1 in the positive half-cycle. Beyond this, the SCR will continue to conduct till voltage becomes zero at which point it is turned OFF. Again at the start of the next positive half-cycle, SCR will start conducting when secondary voltage becomes V1.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(iv)</span><span class="item-text">Referring to Fig. 6.4 (ii ), it is clear that firing angle is <span class="math-inline">$\alpha$</span> i.e. at this angle in the positive half-cycle, SCR starts conduction. The conduction angle is <span class="math-inline">$(\phi=180^{\circ}-\alpha)$</span>.</span></li>
                          </ul>
                         <p>It is worthwhile to distinguish between an ordinary half-wave rectifier and SCR half-wave rectifier. Whereas an ordinary half-wave rectifier will conduct full positive half-cycle, an SCR half-wave rectifier can be made to conduct full or part of a positive half-cycle by proper adjustment of gate current. Therefore, an SCR can control power fed to the load and hence the name controlled rectifier.</p>

                         <h3 id="heading-unit-6-app-fullwave" class="subsection-heading">6.3.3 SCR Full-Wave Rectifier</h3>
                         <p>Fig. 6.5 ( i ) shows the circuit of SCR full-wave rectifier. It is exactly like an ordinary centre-tap circuit except that the two diodes have been replaced by two SCRs. The gates of both SCRs get their supply from two gate controls.</p>
                         <figure>
                              <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-78-1.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5: (i) SCR full-wave center-tapped rectifier circuit using two SCRs (SCR1, SCR2), load RL, and separate gate control circuits (variable resistor r and gate current Ig for each SCR).

                         <p>One SCR conducts during the positive half-cycle and the other during the negative half-cycle. Consequently, full-wave rectified output is obtained across the load.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Operation.</h4>
                         <p>The angle of conduction can be changed by adjusting the gate currents. Suppose the gate currents are so adjusted that SCRs conduct as the secondary voltage (across half winding) becomes V1 . During the positive half-cycle of a.c. across secondary, the upper end of secondary is positive and the lower end negative. This will cause SCR1 to conduct. However, the conduction will start only when the voltage across the upper half of secondary becomes V1 as shown in 6.5 ( ii ) <!-- MMD source uses inline reference --> In this way only shaded portion of positive half-cycle will pass through the load. During the negative half-cycle of a.c. input, the upper end of secondary becomes negative and the lower end positive. This will cause SCR2 to conduct when the voltage across the lower half of secondary becomes V1. It may be seen that current through the load is in the same direction (d.c.) on both half-cycles of input a.c. The obvious advantage of this circuit over ordinary full-wave rectifier circuit is that by adjusting the gate currents, we can change the conduction angle and hence the output voltage.</p>
