                        <p>Almost all electronic equipments must include means for amplifying electrical signals. For instance, radio receivers amplify very weak signals- sometimes a few millionth of a volt at antenna- until they are strong enough to fill a room with sound. The transducers used in the medical and scientific investigations generate signals in the microvolt (<span class="math-inline">$\mu \mathrm{V}$</span>) and millivolt ( mV ) range. These signals must be amplified thousands and millions times before they will be strong enough to operate indicating instruments. Therefore, electronic amplifiers are a constant and important ingredient of electronic systems.</p>
                        <p>Our purpose here will be to discuss single stage transistor amplifiers. By a stage we mean a single transistor with its bias and auxiliary equipment. It may be emphasised here that a practical amplifier is always a multistage amplifier i.e. it has a number of stages of amplification. However, it is profitable to consider the multistage amplifier in terms of single stages that are connected together. In this chapter, we shall confine our attention to single stage transistor amplifiers.</p>

                        <p>Fig. 1.1 shows a single stage transistor amplifier. When a weak a.c. signal is given to the base of transistor, a small base current (which is a.c.) starts flowing. Due to transistor action, a much larger ( <span class="math-inline">$\beta$</span> times the base current) a.c. current flows through the collector load RC . As the value of RC is quite high (usually <span class="math-inline">$4-10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$</span> ), therefore, a large voltage appears across RC . Thus, a weak signal applied in the base circuit appears in amplified form in the collector circuit. It is in this way that a transistor acts as amplifier.</p>
                        <p>The action of transistor amplifier can be beautifully explained by referring to Fig. 1.1. Suppose a change of 0.1 V in signal voltage produces a change of 2 mA in the collector current. Obviously, a signal of only 0.1 V applied to the base will give an output voltage <span class="math-inline">$=2 m A \times 5 k \Omega=10 \mathrm{~V}$</span>. Thus, the transistor has been able to raise the voltage level of the signal from 0.1 V to 10 V i.e. voltage amplification or stage gain is 100 .</p>

                        <p>The function of a transistor as an amplifier can also be explained graphically. Fig. 1.2 shows the output characteristics of a transistor in CE configuration. Suppose the zero signal base current is <span class="math-inline">$10 \mu \mathrm{~A}$</span> i.e. this is the base current for which the transistor is biased by the biasing network. When an a.c. signal is applied to the base, it makes the base, say positive in the first half-cycle and negative in the second half- cycle. Therefore, the base and collector currents will increase in the first half-cycle when base-emitter junction is more forward-biased. However, they will decrease in the second half-cycle when the base-emitter junction is less forward biased.</p>

                        <p>It is important to note that a transistor can accomplish faithful amplification only if proper associated circuitry is used with it. Fig. 1.3 shows a practical single stage transistor amplifier. The various circuit elements and their functions are described below :</p>

                        <p>(i) Biasing circuit. The resistances R1, R2 and RE form the biasing and stabilisation circuit. The biasing circuit must establish a proper operating point otherwise a part of the negative half-cycle of the signal may be cut off in the output.</p>
                        <p>( ii ) Input capacitor Cin . An electrolytic capacitor <span class="math-inline">$\operatorname{Cin}(\approx 10 \mu F)$</span> is used to couple the signal to the base of the transistor. If it is not used, the signal source resistance will come across R2 and thus change the bias. The capacitor Cin allows only a.c. signal to flow but isolates the signal source from R2.</p>
                        <p>( iii ) Emitter bypass capacitor CE . An emitter bypass capacitor <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{CE}(\approx 100 \mu F)$</span> is used in parallel with RE to provide a low reactance path to the amplified a.c. signal. If it is not used, then amplified a.c. signal flowing through RE will cause a voltage drop across it, thereby reducing the output voltage.</p>
                        <p>( iv ) Coupling capacitor CC . The coupling capacitor <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{CC}(\approx 10 \mu F)$</span> couples one stage of amplification to the next stage. If it is not used, the bias conditions of the next stage will be drastically changed due to the shunting effect of RC . This is because RC will come in parallel with the upper resistance R1 of the biasing network of the next stage, thereby altering the biasing conditions of the latter. In short, the coupling capacitor CC isolates the d.c. of one stage from the next stage, but allows the passage of a.c. signal.</p>

                        <p>(i) Base current. When no signal is applied in the basecircuit, d.c. base current IB flows due to biasing circuit. When a.c. signal is applied, a.c. base current ib also flows. Therefore, with the application of signal, total base current iB is given by:

                        <div class="equation">$i_{E}=I_{E}+i_{e}$</div>

                        <p>In common emitter connection, when the input signal voltage increases in the positive sense, the output voltage increases in the negative direction and vice-versa .

                        <p>In a transistor amplifier, both d.c. and a.c. conditions prevail. The d.c. sources set up d.c. currents and voltages whereas the a.c. source (i.e . signal) produces fluctuations in the transistor currents and volt- ages. Therefore, a simple way to analyse the action of a transistor is to split the analysis into two parts viz. a d.c. analysis and an a.c. analysis. In the d.c. analysis, we consider all the d.c. sources at the same time and work out the d.c. currents and voltages in the circuit. On the other hand, for a.c. analysis, we consider all the a.c. sources at the same time and work out the a.c. currents and voltages. By adding the d.c. and a.c. currents and voltages, we get the total currents and voltages in the circuit. For example, consider the amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 1.4. This circuit can be easily analysed by splitting it into d.c. equivalent circuit and a.c equivalent circuit.</p>

                         <p>We know that the process of raising the strength of an a.c. signal is called amplification and the circuit used to preform this function is called an amplifier. There are three types of gain : current gain, voltage gain and power gain .</p>
                         <p>( i ) The common emitter (CE) amplifier exhibits all the types gain . From input to output, current will increase, voltage will increase and power will increase.</p>
                         <p>( ii ) The common base (CB) amplifier has voltage gain and power gain but no current gain. Note that the current gain of a CB circuit is less than 1.</p>
                         <p>( iii ) The common collector (CC) amplifier has current gain and power gain but no voltage gain.</p>
                         <p>It is important to note that the type of gain an amplifier has depends upon the transistor configuration.
