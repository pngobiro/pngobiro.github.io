                        <p>Many electronic devices require a source of energy at a specific frequency which may range from a few Hz to several MHz . This is achieved by an electronic device called an oscillator . Oscillators are extensively used in electronic equipment. For example, in radio and television receivers, oscillators are used to generate high frequency wave (called carrier wave ) in the tuning stages. Audio frequency and radiofrequency signals are required for the repair of radio, television and other electronic equipment. Oscillators are also widely used in radar, electronic computers and other electronic devices.</p>
                        <p>Oscillators can produce sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal ( e.g . square wave) waves. In this chapter, we shall confine our attention to sinusoidal oscillators i.e . those which produce sine-wave signals.</p>
                        <p>Although we speak of an oscillator as "generating" a frequency, it should be noted that it does not create energy, but merely acts as an energy converter. It receives d.c. energy and changes it into a.c. energy of desired frequency. The frequency of oscillations depends upon the constants of the device. It may be mentioned here that although an alternator produces sinusoidal oscillations of 50 Hz , it cannot be called an oscillator. Firstly, an alternator is a mechanical device having rotating parts whereas an oscillator is a non-rotating electronic device. Secondly, an alternator converts mechanical energy into a.c. energy while an oscillator converts d.c. energy into a.c. energy. Thirdly, an alternator cannot produce high frequency oscillations whereas an oscillator can produce oscillations ranging from a few Hz to several MHz .</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A circuit which produces electrical oscillations of any desired frequency is known as an oscillatory circuit or tank circuit.</p>
                        <p>A simple oscillatory circuit consists of a capacitor ( C ) and inductance coil (L) in parallel as shown in Fig. 3.1. This electrical system can produce electrical oscillations of frequency determined by the values of L and C. To understand how this comes about, suppose the capacitor is charged from a d.c. source with a polarity as shown in Fig. 3.1 (i).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-29-1.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1: Oscillatory Circuit operation stages. (i) Charged capacitor stores electrostatic energy. (ii) Switch closed, capacitor discharges through inductor, energy becomes magnetic. (iii) Magnetic field collapses, recharging capacitor with opposite polarity. (iv) Capacitor discharges again, current flows opposite direction." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 3.1: Oscillatory Circuit.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>( i ) In the position shown in Fig. 3.1 (i), the upper plate of capacitor has deficit of electrons and the lower plate has excess of electrons. Therefore, there is a voltage across the capacitor and the capacitor has electrostatic energy.</p>
                        <p>( ii ) When switch S is closed as shown in Fig. 3.1 (ii ), the capacitor will discharge through inductance and the electron flow will be in the direction indicated by the arrow. This current flow sets up magnetic field around the coil. Due to the inductive effect, the current builds up slowly towards a maximum value. The circuit current will be maximum when the capacitor is fully discharged. At this instant, electrostatic energy is zero but because electron motion is greatest (i.e. maximum current), the magnetic field energy around the coil is maximum. This is shown in Fig. 3.1 ( ii ). Obviously, the electrostatic energy across the capacitor is completely converted into magnetic field energy around the coil.</p>
                        <p>( iii ) Once the capacitor is discharged, the magnetic field will begin to collapse and produce a counter e.m.f. According to Lenz's law, the counter e.m.f. will keep the current flowing in the same direction. The result is that the capacitor is now charged with opposite polarity, making upper plate of capacitor negative and lower plate positive as shown in Fig. 3.1 ( iii ).</p>
                        <p>( iv ) After the collapsing field has recharged the capacitor, the capacitor now begins to discharge; current now flowing in the opposite direction. Fig. 3.1 ( iv ) shows capacitor fully discharged and maximum current flowing.</p>
                        <p>The sequence of charge and discharge results in alternating motion of electrons or an oscillating current. The energy is alternately stored in the electric field of the capacitor ( C ) and the magnetic field of the inductance coil ( L ). This interchange of energy between L and C is repeated over and again resulting in the production of oscillations.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Waveform.</h3>
                        <p>If there were no losses in the tank circuit to consume the energy, the interchange of energy between L and C would continue indefinitely. In a practical tank circuit, there are resistive and radiation losses in the coil and dielectric losses in the capacitor. During each cycle, a small part of the originally imparted energy is used up to overcome these losses. The result is that the amplitude of oscillating current decreases gradually and eventually it b√©comes zero when all the energy is consumed as losses. Therefore, the tank circuit by itself will produce damped oscillations as shown in Fig. 3.2.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-31-1.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2: Waveform showing damped oscillations. The amplitude of the sinusoidal current decreases over time due to energy losses." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Frequency of oscillations.</h3>
                        <p>The frequency of oscillations in the tank circuit is determined by the constants of the circuit viz L and C . The actual frequency of oscillations is the resonant frequency (or natural frequency) of the tank circuit given by :</p>
                        <div class="equation">f_{r}=\frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{L C}}</div>
                        <p>It is clear that frequency of oscillations in the tank circuit is inversely proportional to L and C . This can be easily explained. If a large value of capacitor is used, it will take longer for the capacitor to charge fully and also longer to discharge. This will lengthen the period of oscillations in the tank circuit, or equivalently lower its frequency. With a large value of inductance, the opposition to change in current flow is greater and hence the time required to complete each cycle will be longer. Therefore, the greater the value of inductance, the longer is the period or the lower is the frequency of oscillations in the tank circuit.</p>

                        <h3 id="heading-unit-3-undamped" class="subsection-heading">3.1.1 Undamped Oscillations from Tank Circuit</h3>
                        <p>As discussed before, a tank circuit produces damped oscillations. However, in practice, we need continuous undamped oscillations for the successful operation of electronics equipment. In order to make the oscillations in the tank circuit undamped, it is necessary to supply correct amount of energy to the tank circuit at the proper time intervals to meet the losses. Thus, any energy which would be applied to the circuit must have a polarity conforming to the existing polarity at the instant of application of energy. If the applied energy is of opposite polarity, it would oppose the energy in the tank circuit, causing stoppage of oscillations. Therefore, in order to make the oscillations in the tank circuit undamped, the following conditions must be fulfilled :</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(i)</span><span class="item-text">The amount of energy supplied should be such so as to meet the losses in the tank circuit and the a.c. energy removed from the circuit by the load.

                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">(ii)</span><span class="item-text">The applied energy should have the same frequency as that of the oscillations in the tank circuit.</span></li>

                        <p>A transistor amplifier with proper positive feedback can act as an oscillator i.e ., it can generate oscillations without any external signal source. Fig. 3.4 shows a transistor amplifier with positive feedback.</p>

                        <p>( i ) We note that the circuit shown in Fig, 3.4 is producing oscillations in the output. However, this circuit has an input signal. This is inconsistent with our definition of an oscillator i.e ., an oscillator is a circuit that produces oscillations without any external signal source.</p>
                        <p>( ii ) When we open the switch S of Fig. 3.4, the input signal (Vin ) is removed. However, Vf (which is in phase with the original signal) is still applied to the input signal. The amplifier will respond to this signal in the same way that it did to Vin i.e ., Vf will be amplified and sent to the output. The feedback network sends a portion of the output back to the input. Therefore, the amplifier receives another input cycle and another output cycle is produced. This process will continue so long as the amplifier is turned on. Therefore, the amplifier will produce sinusoidal output with no external signal source.</p>

                        <p>When switch S is closed, collector current starts increasing and charges the capacitor C1. When this capacitor is fully charged, it discharges through coil L1, setting up oscillations. These oscillations induce some voltage in coil L2 by mutual induction. The frequency of voltage in coil L2 is the same as that of tank circuit but its magnitude depends upon the number of turns of L2 and coupling between L1 and L2. The voltage across L2 is applied between base and emitter and appears in the amplified form in the collector circuit, thus overcoming the losses occurring in the tank circuit. The number of turns of L2 and coupling between L1 and L2 are so adjusted that oscillations across L2 are amplified to a level just sufficient to supply losses to the tank circuit. It may be noted that the phase of feedback is correct i.e . energy supplied to the tank circuit is in phase with the generated oscillations. A phase shift of 180 degrees is created between the voltages of L1 and L2 due to transformer action. A further phase shift of 180 degrees takes place between base-emitter and collector circuit due to transistor properties. As a result, the energy fedback to the tank circuit is in phase with the generated oscillations.</p>

                        <p>When the circuit is turned on, the capacitors C1 and C2 are charged. The capacitors discharge through L , setting up oscillations. The output voltage of the amplifier appears across C 1 and feedback voltage is developed across C2. The voltage across it is 180 degrees out of phase with the voltage developed across C1 ( Vout ). It is easy to see that voltage fedback (voltage across C2 ) to the transistor provides positive feedback.
