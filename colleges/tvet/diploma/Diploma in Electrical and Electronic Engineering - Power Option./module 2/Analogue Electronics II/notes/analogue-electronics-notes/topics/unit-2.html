                         <p>A practical amplifier has a gain of nearly one million i.e. its output is one million times the input. Consequently, even a casual disturbance at the input will appear in the amplified form in the output. There is a strong tendency in amplifiers to introduce hum due to sudden temperature changes or stray electric and magnetic fields. Therefore, every high gain amplifier tends to give noise along with signal in its output. The noise in the output of an amplifier is undesirable and must be kept to as small a level as possible. The noise level in amplifiers can be reduced considerably by the use of negative feedback i.e . by injecting a fraction of output in phase opposition to the input signal.</p>
                         <p>The object of this chapter is to consider the effects and methods of providing negative feedback in transistor amplifiers.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>The process of injecting a fraction of output energy of some device back to the input is known as feedback. The principle of feedback is probably as old as the invention of first machine but it is only some 50 years ago that feedback has come into use in connection with electronic circuits. It has been found very useful in reducing noise in amplifiers and making amplifier operation stable. Depending upon whether the feedback energy aids or opposes the input signal, there are two basic types of feedback in amplifiers viz positive feedback and negative feedback.</p>

                         <h3 id="heading-unit-2-pos-feedback" class="subsection-heading">2.1.1 Positive feedback.</h3>
                         <p>When the feedback energy (voltage or current) is in phase with the input signal and thus aids it, it is called positive feedback. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.1. Both amplifier and feedback network introduce a phase shift of 180 degrees. The result is a 360 degrees phase shift around the loop, causing the feedback voltage Vf to be in phase with the input signal Vin.</p>
                         <figure>
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-22-1.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1: Block diagram illustrating positive feedback. Input Vin goes to an amplifier (180 deg shift). Output Vout goes to a feedback network (180 deg shift). Feedback voltage Vf is added to Vin, showing Vf in phase with Vin." class="content-image">

                         </figure>
                         <p>The positive feedback increases the gain of the amplifier. However, it has the disadvantages of increased distortion and instability. Therefore, positive feedback is seldom employed in amplifiers. One important use of positive feedback is in oscillators. As we shall see in the next chapter, if positive feedback is sufficiently large, it leads to oscillations. As a matter of fact, an oscillator is a device that converts d.c. power into a.c. power of any desired frequency.</p>

                         <h3 id="heading-unit-2-neg-feedback" class="subsection-heading">2.1.2 Negative feedback.</h3>
                         <p>When the feedback energy (voltage or current) is out of phase with the input signal and thus opposes it, it is called negative feedback. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.2. As you can see, the amplifier introduces a phase shift of 180 degrees into the circuit while the feedback network is so designed that it introduces no phase shift (i.e ., 0 degrees phase shift). The result is that the feedback voltage Vf is 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal Vin .</p>
                         <figure>
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_06_5efae30b5978304d80a5g-23-1.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2: Block diagram illustrating negative feedback. Input Vin goes to an amplifier (180 deg shift). Output Vout goes to a feedback network (0 deg shift). Feedback voltage Vf is subtracted from Vin, showing Vf 180 degrees out of phase with Vin." class="content-image">

                         <p>Negative feedback reduces the gain of the amplifier. However, the advantages of negative feedback are: reduction in distortion, stability in gain, increased bandwidth and improved input and output impedances. It is due to these advantages that negative feedback is frequently employed in amplifiers.</p>

                     </h2>
                     <div class="content-card">
                         <p>The following are the advantages of negative voltage feedback in amplifiers :</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Gain stability.</h3>
                         <p>An important advantage of negative voltage feedback is that the resultant gain of the amplifier can be made independent of transistor parameters or the supply voltage variations.</p>
                         <p>For negative voltage feedback in an amplifier to be effective, the designer deliberately makes the product <span class="math-inline">$A_{v} m_{v}$</span> much greater than unity; consequently, <span class="math-inline">$A_{v f}=\frac{1}{m_{v}}$</span>.</p>
                         <p>It may be seen that the gain now depends only upon feedback fraction mv i.e. , on the characteristics of feedback circuit. As feedback circuit is usually a voltage divider (a resistive network), therefore, it is unaffected by changes in temperature, variations in transistor parameters and frequency. Hence, the gain of the amplifier is extremely stable,</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reduces non-linear distortion.</h3>
                         <p>A large signal stage has non-linear distortion because its voltage gain changes at various points in the cycle. The negative voltage feedback reduces the non- linear distortion in large signal amplifiers.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Improves frequency response.</h3>
                         <p>As feedback is usually obtained through a resistive net- work, therefore, voltage gain of the amplifier is <em>independent of signal frequency. The result is that voltage gain of the amplifier will be substantially constant over a wide range of signal frequency. The negative voltage feedback, therefore, improves the frequency response of the amplifier.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Increases circuit stability.</h3>
                         <p>The output of an ordinary amplifier is easily changed due to variations in ambient temperature, frequency and signal amplitude. This changes the gain of the amplifier, resulting in distortion. However, by applying negative voltage feedback, voltage gain of the amplifier is stabilised or accurately fixed in value. This can be easily explained. Suppose the output of a negative voltage feedback amplifier has increased because of temperature change or due to some other reason. This means more negative feedback since feedback is being given from the output. This tends to oppose the increase in amplification and maintains it stable. The same is true should the output voltage decrease. Consequently, the circuit stability is considerably increased.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Increases input impedance and decreases output impedance.</h3>
                         <p>The negative voltage feedback increases the input impedance and decreases the output impedance of amplifier. Such a change is profitable in practice as the amplifier can then serve the purpose of impedance matching.</p>
