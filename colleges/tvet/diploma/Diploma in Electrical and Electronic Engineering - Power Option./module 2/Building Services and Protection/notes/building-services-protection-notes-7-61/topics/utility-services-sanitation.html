More broadly sanitation also included the safe management of solid waste and animal waste. Inadequate sanitation is a major cause of infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid and dysentery world-wide.</p>

                         <p>Sanitary sewer systems should be sized and laid out to permit use of the smallest diameter pipes capable of rapidly carrying away the wastewater from fixtures without clogging the pipes, without creating annoying noises, and without producing excessive pressure fluctuations at points where fixture drains connect to soil or waste stacks. Such pressure changes may siphon off the liquid seals in traps and force sewer gases back through the fixtures into the building. Positive or negative air pressure at the trap seal of a fixture should never be permitted to exceed 1 in of water.</p>
