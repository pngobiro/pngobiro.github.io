                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">BZ Classification:</h3>
                        <p>British Zonal Classification of 1-10 for the downward light emitted from a luminaire. The BZ class number relates to the flux that is directly incident upon the working plane in relation to the total flux emitted. BZ1 classification is for a downward directional luminaire. A BZ10 describes a luminaire that directs all its illumination upwards so that the room is illuminated by reflection from the ceiling.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Daylight Factor:</h3>
                        <p>Daylight Factor: the ratio of the natural illumination on a horizontal plane within the building to that present simultaneously from an unobstructed sky, discounting direct sunlight. A standard figure of 5000 lx is adopted for the external illuminance in the United Kingdom.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Efficacy:</h3>
                        <p>Efficacy: the luminous efficacy is the lamp light output in lumens per watt of electrical power consumption.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Glare:</h3>
                        <p>Glare: the discomfort or impairment of vision due to excessive brightness.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Illuminance:</h3>
                        <p>Illuminance: the luminous flux density at a surface in lumens per square metre, <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{l} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$</span>, lux. The surface is normally the working plane. SI unit of illuminance; <span class="math-inline">$1 \mathrm{~lx}=1 \mathrm{~lm} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$</span>.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Luminaire:</h3>
                        <p>Luminaire: the complete apparatus that contains the lamp, the light emitter and the electrical controls.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Light loss factor, LLF:</h3>
                        <p>Light loss factor, LLF: the overall loss of light from the dirtiness of the lamp (0.8), luminaire (0.95) and the room surfaces (0.95). Clean conditions LLF may be 0.7 but 0.5 when equipment and room become soiled. Preferred to maintenance factor.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Maintenance factor, MF:</h3>
                        <p>Maintenance factor, MF: The maintenance factor (M) is a ratio which takes into account the light lost due to an average expectation of dirtiness of light fittings and surfaces. It is an allowance for reduced light emission due to the build-up of dust on a lamp or within a luminaire. Normally 0.8 but 0.9 if the lamps are cleaned regularly or if a ventilated luminaire is used. Light loss factor is preferred.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">UTILIZATION FACTOR, UF</h3>
                         <p>Utilization factor, UF: the ratio of the luminous flux received at the working plane to the installed flux. Alternatively, utilisation factor ( <span class="math-inline">$U$</span> ) is the ratio of the lumens received on the working plane to the total flux output of lamps in the lighting scheme.</p>
                        <p>The utilization factor is provided by the manufacturer and takes into account the pattern of light-distribution from the whole fitting, its light- distributing efficiency, the shape and size of the room for which it is being designed and the reflectivity of the ceiling and walls.</p>
                        <p>Values vary from 0.03, where purely indirect distribution is employed, the room has poorly reflecting surfaces and all the light is upwards onto the ceiling or walls, to 0.75 for the most energy-efficient designs. Spot lighting can have a utilization factor of nearly unity.</p>
                        <p>The configuration of the room is found from the room index: room index <span class="math-inline">$=\frac{l W}{H(l+W)}$</span></p>
                        <p>Where <span class="math-inline">$l$</span> is the room length ( <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{m}$</span> ), <span class="math-inline">$W$</span> is the room width ( <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{m}$</span> ) and H is the height of the light fitting above the working plane (m).</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Glare and reflections</h3>
                         <p>Disability glare is when a bright light source prevents the subject from seeing the necessary detail of the task. To maximize contrast on the working plane, luminaires should be placed in rows parallel to the direction of view. The rows should be widely spaced to form work areas between them.</p>
                        <p>Enclosing the fitting with a plastic diffuser to improve its appearance usually lowers the utilization factor.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">LUMEN DESIGN METHOD</h3>
                         <p>The number of light fittings to be installed is found from the total lumens needed at the working plane and the illumination provided by each fitting using the formula:</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                             $$\text { number of fittings }=\frac{\text { lux } \times \text { working plane area } \mathrm{m}^{2}}{\text { LDL } \times \text { UF } \times \mathrm{MF}}$$

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Spacing-height ratio</h3>
                         <p>Spacing-to-height ratio (SHR) is the centre-to-centre (S) distance between adjacent luminaires to their mounting vertical height (<span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{H}$</span>) above the working plane. Manufacturers' catalogues can be consulted to determine maximum SHRs, e.g. a luminaire with trough reflector is about 1.65 and an enclosed diffuser about 1.4.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">EXAMPLE:</h3>
                         <p>A drawing office <span class="math-inline">$16 \mathrm{~m} \times 11 \mathrm{~m}$</span> and 3 m high has a white ceiling and light-coloured walls. The working plane is 0.85 m above the floor. 5100 lm double-lamp luminaires are to be used and their normal spacing-to- height ratio SHR is 1.75. The illuminance required is <span class="math-inline">$600 \mathrm{~lm} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$</span>. Calculate the number of luminaires needed and draw their layout arrangement. Find the electrical power consumption of the lighting system.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">SOLUTION:</h3>
                         <p>A high standard of maintenance will be assumed, giving a maintenance factor of 0.9. The lighting design lumens is taken as 5100 lm for the whole light fitting.</p>
                        <p>The height <span class="math-inline">$H$</span> of fittings above the working plane is:</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                             $$\begin{aligned} \mathrm{H} & =(3-0.85) \mathrm{m} \\ & =2.15 \mathrm{~m} \\ \text { room index } & =\frac{\mathrm{IW}}{\mathrm{H}(\mathrm{I}+\mathrm{W})}=\frac{16 \times 11}{2.15 \times(16+11)}=3.03 \end{aligned}$$

                        <p>If it is assumed that windows are along one long side of the office and that rows of luminaires will be parallel to the windows, this will produce areas between rows where drawing boards and desks can be sited to gain maximum benefit from side day lighting without glare and reflection.

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">ARC LAMPS</h3>
                         <p>The principle of an arc lamp is that when two electrodes carrying current are separated through a small distance, an arc is struck between them. The arc lamps were used in the past for street lighting purposes but now a day these are used when extreme brightness is required. Most commonly use arc lamp is the Carbon Arc Lamp</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Carbon Arc Lamp</h4>
                         <p>This is the oldest type of lamp and is still being employed in cinema projectors and search lights. It consists of two hard carbon rods (Electrodes). The diameter of +ve electrode is double to that of -ve electrode. The -ve electrode is generally fixed and +ve electrode is placed in adjustable holder and the process is manually or automatic. The arc consists of carbon vapors surrounded by orange red zone of burning carbon and pale green flames.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_12_1a09490c3fbfdc04feb2g-26-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the construction of a carbon arc lamp" class="content-image">
                        <p>When the lamp is OFF, the two electrodes are touching each other due to spring pressure on + ve electrode. When the supply is ON a large current is flow through electrodes. The temperature of carbon electrode is increased and thus the +ve electrode is pulled away against its spring pressure through a small distance by coil and thus an arc is struck between electrodes. This arc is maintained by transfer of carbon particles from one electrode to other electrode. These particles travel from + ve electrode to - ve electrode, thus after sometime of operation +ve electrode become hollow and -ve become pointed. That's why +ve electrode is made double than -ve electrode.</p>
                        <p>In carbon arc lamp 85% of light is given by +ve electrode which produces high intensity light and only 10 % by -ve electrode and 5 % by air. The temperature of +ve electrode is <span class="math-inline">4000 \text { oC }</span> and that of ve electrode is about <span class="math-inline">2500 \text { oC }</span>. The luminous efficiency of such lamps is about 9 lumen/watt.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">FILAMENT OR INCANDESCENT LAMP</h3>
                         <p>When an electric current is passed through a fine metallic wire, it raises the temperature of wire. At low temperature only heat is produced but at higher temperature light radiations goes on increasing. As filament lamp consists of fine wire of high resistive material placed in an evacuated glass bulb.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">SODIUM VAPOR LAMP</h3>
                         <p>This lamp consists of discharge tube made from special heat resistance glass, containing a small amount of metallic sodium, neon gas and two electrodes. Neon gas is added to start the discharge and to develop enough heat to vaporised sodium. A long tube is required to get more light. To reduce overall dimensions of the lamp, the tube is generally bent into U-shape.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Working Principle:</h4>
                         <p>An electric discharge lamps require a high voltage at staring and low voltage during operation. So at starting a voltage of 450 V is applied across the lamp to start the discharge.</p>
                        <p>After 10 to 15 minutes, the voltage falls to 150 V because of low power factor. To improve the power factor a capacitor is connected across the supply. The color of light produce is yellowish.</p>

It consists of a glass tube 25 mm in diameter and <span class="math-inline">$0.6 \mathrm{~m}, 1.2 \mathrm{~m}$</span> and 1.5 m in length. The tube contains argon gas at low pressure about 2.5 mm of mercury. At the two ends, two electrodes coated with some electron emissive material are placed.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Working :</h4>
                         <p>A choke is connected in series with the tube which act as a blast and provide a high voltage at starting glow in the tube. During running condition the same choke absorbs some supply voltage and remain a voltage of 110 V across the tube. A capacitor is connected to improve the power factor. The high voltage produce electrons which hit mercury atoms on their path through the discharge tube. Upon collision, the mercury atoms are shortly excited. The absorbed shock energy is immediately released in the form of invisible UV radiation. The UV radiations produced fall on the fluorescent phosphor-coated inner walls of the tube</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">NEON LAMP</h3>
                         <p>These lamps are operated at a very low temperature of about <span class="math-inline">200 \text { oC }</span> that's why these are called cold cathode discharge lamps.</p>
                        <p>Two electrodes are housed at the two ends of the tube which contain neon gas. The electrodes are made of iron or nickel cylinder without any coating and practically they do not emit electrons. It gives red light whereas with mixture of mercury and argon it gives bluish green color. Voltage require for starting and operation is 10000 V . This high voltage is obtained from transformer.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Working :</h4>
                         <p>When the supply is switched ON at primary side of transformer, a voltage of 10000 V develops across secondary side which come across two electrodes. At this voltage a discharge occurs in neon gas. Different colors can be obtained by changing the constituents of gases and mercury filled in the tubes.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Applications the Neon Lamp:</h4>
                         <p>Neon lamps are generally used for advertising. Most of letters having two ends at which electrodes are placed. In letter having more than two ends, the tube path is repeated for some portion.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">HALOGEN LAMP</h3>
                         <p>Halogen lamp is a special type of tungsten filament lamp which was developed in 1959, in this lams, a small amount of halogen vapor is added to the inert gas of the bulb. Its glass bulb is small in size and mechanically strong. It operates at high temperature of <span class="math-inline">$3000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</span>. When the supply is given to the lamp, a filament glows and produce light. The halogen in addition to inert gas causes the evaporated tungsten to resettle back on the filament during cooling, that's why lamp can be operated at high temperature. It provides high intensity light.</p>
