                        <p>The function of the foundation is, therefore, to spread the load from a building to the ground so that any movement that will occur do not cause damage to any part of the building.</p>

Around us are sources from which noise enters the building making the occupants uncomfortable with its effect. The external wall acts as a barrier in the sense that when sound waves strike the surface of the wall, some of the sound is reflected, some absorbed and some set the wall vibrating, thus setting up sound waves on the opposite face. The greater the mass of the walling material, the more it will absorb the sound and provide greater sound insulation. Any opening in the wall allows sound to pass through. For effective sound insulation, wall material must be thick and air tight. Sound insulation of walls is improved by rendering, lining with independent steel stud acoustic quilt.</span></li>

Walls, must, therefore, be constructed with materials that would reduce fire spread both from the inside and outside of the house. This means that walling materials must retain sufficient strength to stand up long enough for the people inside to leave the building. When walls have to constructed with different materials, it is necessary to consider how the materials react to fire in order to know how to combine them so that they can provide the necessary fire resistance. In choosing materials for walls, it is not only important to go for non combustible materials, but also to consider whether the material will not lose its strength very quickly.</span></li>
