                         <p>Luminous intensity' (I) is the rate of flow of light energy per solid angle. The unit is <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{lm} /$ solid- angle</span> or 1 candela (cd).

                         <p>In the human eye, the opening of pupil is controlled by its iris which depends upon the intensity of light received by the eye. If the eye is exposed to a very bright source of light, the pupil of the eye contracts automatically in order to reduce the amount of light admitted and prevent damage to the retina. This effect is called glare.</p>
                        <p>Glare is defined as the brightness within the field of vision of such a character so as to cause discomfort and interference in vision.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lamp efficiency</h3>
                         <p>It is defined as the visible radiations emitted by a lamp in lumens per watt.</p>
                        <p>Usually, the light sources do not radiate energy only in the visible spectrum. The radiant energy is also accompanied with infrared and ultra violet radiations.</p>
                        <p>Sun light produces majority of radiations in the visible spectrum. The tungsten lamp produces small radiations so its efficiency is very poor.</p>
                        <p>The efficiency of fluorescent lamp is more than that of a tungsten lamp.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reduction Factor</h3>
                         <p>Reduction factor of a source of light is the ratio of its mean spherical candle power to its mean horizontal candle power.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reduction factor = MSCP / MHCP</strong></p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mean Horizontal Candle-Power</h3>

                         <p>Mean Spherical Candle Power, a unit of measure that represents the average output of a light source measured in all directions (<span class="math-inline">$360^{\circ}$</span>)</p>

                         <p>Whole of the light incident on a reflecting surface is not reflected. Some portion of it is absorbed by the surface.</p>
                        <p>The ratio of the reflected light to the incident light is called reflection factor.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Spectral Response</h3>
                        <p>2. Even within the narrow spectrum of visible light, the human eye is more sensitive to some wavelengths than to others.</p>
