                         <p>Certain types of installation demand special consideration when designing and installing the electrical equipment. Part 7 of BS 7671 of the 17th edition of the IEE Wiring Regulations sets out the specific needs of some types of special installation and the IEE Regulations contained therein supplement or modify the other parts of the IEE Regulations. The term 'special' therefore means application of particular requirements in addition to the general rules of BS 7671 within Parts 1 to 6. In general, such 'Special Installations or Locations' listed in BS 7671 involve increased risks of danger and/or harsher conditions compared with those catered for by the general parts (Parts 1-6).

                     <div class="content-card">
                         <p>BS 7671, part 705 covers electrical installations inside and outside agricultural and horticultural buildings, including locations where animals are kept. These locations are characterized by arduous conditions, and people usually working in a wet or damp environment, both indoors and outdoors.</p>
                        <p>An increased risk of damage to the electrical installation and an increased risk of personal danger can come from a number of factors, including:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span> <span class="item-text">The use, possibly widespread, of chemical cleaners and fertilizers;</span></li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>It should be noted that danger, including the risk from electric shock, particularly applies to livestock. In places where livestock is kept, there is a greater risk of electric shock to them due to their lower body resistance and more intimate contact with the general mass of earth. It can often be seen in milking parlours that cows will not pass from one place to another where they sense a small potential difference between their front and rear legs. All electrical equipment should have physical protection to withstand wash down and the use of chemical cleaning agents, and will require special considerations against corrosion. High impact plastic materials may be better than metals, but these cannot be considered to be a Class II installation.</p>
                        <p>Generally, the best physical protection will be provided by careful placement of outlets and controls in areas where they are not likely to be subject to damage or impact.</p>
