                        <p>(a) Scalar quantities have a size (or magnitude) only and need no other information to specify them. Thus, 10 centimetres, 50 seconds, 7 litres and 3 kilograms are all examples of scalar quantities.</p>
                        <p>(b) Vector quantities have both a size or magnitude and a direction, called the line of action of the quantity. Thus, a velocity of 50 kilometres per hour due east, an acceleration of 9.81 metres per second squared vertically downwards and a force of 15 Newtons at an angle of 30 degrees are all examples of vector quantities.</p>

                         <p>The centre of gravity of an object is a point where the resultant gravitational force acting on the body may be taken to act. For objects of uniform thickness lying in a horizontal plane, the centre of gravity is vertically in line with the point of balance of the object. For a thin uniform rod the point of balance and hence the centre of gravity is halfway along the rod as shown in Figure 3.1(a).</p>

                         <p>A thin flat sheet of a material of uniform thickness is called a lamina and the centre of gravity of a rectangular lamina lies at the point of intersection of its diagonals, as shown in Figure 3.1(b). The centre of gravity of a circular lamina is at the centre of the circle, as shown in Figure 3.1(c).</p>
                         <p>An object is in equilibrium when the forces acting on the object are such that there is no tendency for the object to move. The state of equilibrium of an object can be divided into three groups.</p>
                         <p>(i) If an object is in stable equilibrium and it is slightly disturbed by pushing or pulling (i.e. a disturbing force is applied), the centre of gravity is raised and when the disturbing force is removed, the object returns to its original position. Thus a ball bearing in a hemispherical cup is in stable equilibrium, as shown in Figure 3.2(a).</p>

                         <p>(ii) An object is in unstable equilibrium if, when a disturbing force is applied, the centre of gravity is lowered and the object moves away from its original position. Thus, a ball bearing balanced on top of a hemispherical cup is in unstable equilibrium, as shown in Figure 3.2(b).</p>
                         <p>(iii) When an object in neutral equilibrium has a disturbing force applied, the centre of gravity remains at the same height and the object does not move when the disturbing force is removed. Thus, a ball bearing on a flat horizontal surface is in neutral equilibrium, as shown in Figure 3.2(c).</p>

                         <p>For two forces acting at a point, there are three possibilities.</p>
                         <p>(a) For forces acting in the same direction and having the same line of action, the single force having the same effect as both of the forces, called the resultant force or just the resultant, is the arithmetic sum of the separate forces. Forces of $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ acting at point $P$, as shown in Figure 3.5(a), have exactly the same effect on point $P$ as force $F$ shown in Figure 3.5(b), where $F=F_{1}+F_{2}$ and acts in the same direction as $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$. Thus $F$ is the resultant of $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$</p>

                         <p>Figure 3.5</p>
                         <p>(b) For forces acting in opposite directions along the same line of action, the resultant force is the arithmetic difference between the two forces. Forces of $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ acting at point $P$ as shown in Figure 3.6(a) have exactly the same effect on point $P$ as force $F$ shown in Figure 3.6(b), where $F=F_{2}-F_{1}$ and acts in the direction of $F_{2}$, since $F_{2}$ is greater than $F_{1}$. Thus $F$ is the resultant of $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$</p>

                         <p>(c) When two forces do not have the same line of action, the magnitude and direction of the resultant force may be found by a procedure called vector addition of forces. There are two graphical methods of performing vector addition, known as the triangle of forces method (see Section 3.5) and the parallelogram of forces method (see Section 3.6)</p>

                         <p>The space diagram is shown in Figure 3.14. The vector diagram shown in Figure 3.15, is produced as follows:</p>
                         <p>(i) oa represents the 12 N force in magnitude and direction</p>
                         <p>(ii) From the nose of $\boldsymbol{o} \boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$ is drawn inclined at $60^{\circ}$ to $\boldsymbol{o} \boldsymbol{a}$ and 7 units long</p>
                         <p>(iii) From the nose of $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{c}$ is drawn 15 units long inclined at $150^{\circ}$ to oa (i.e. $150^{\circ}$ to the horizontal)</p>
                         <p>(iv) oc represents the resultant; by measurement, the resultant is 13.8 N inclined at $\boldsymbol{\phi}=80^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.</p>
                         <p>Thus the resultant of the three forces, $F_{A}, F_{B}$ and $F_{C}$ is a force of 13.8 N at $80^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.</p>
                         <p><b>Problem 7.</b> The following coplanar forces are acting at a point, the given angles being measured from the horizontal: 100 N at $30^{\circ}$, 200 N at $80^{\circ}, 40 \mathrm{~N}$ at $-150^{\circ}, 120 \mathrm{~N}$ at $-100^{\circ}$ and 70 N at $-60^{\circ}$. Determine graphically the magnitude and direction of the resultant of the five forces.</p>
                         <p>The five forces are shown in the space diagram of Figure 3.16. Since the 200 N and 120 N forces have the same line of action but are in opposite sense, they can be represented by a single force of $200-120$, i.e. 80 N acting at $80^{\circ}$ to the horizontal. Similarly, the 100 N and 40 N forces can be represented by a force of $100-40$, i.e. 60 N acting at $30^{\circ}$ to the horizontal. Hence the space diagram of Figure 3.16 may be represented by the space diagram of Figure 3.17. Such a simplification of the vectors is not essential but it is easier to construct the vector diagram from a space diagram having three forces, than one with five.</p>

The resultant, $\boldsymbol{o c}$, is found by measurement to represent a force of 112 N and angle $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ is $25^{\circ}$.</p>
                         <p>Thus, the five forces shown in Figure 3.16 may be represented by a single force of 112 N at $25^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.</p>

                         <p>The space diagram is shown in Figure 3.19. Since the system is in equilibrium, the vector diagram must close. The vector diagram, shown in Figure 3.20, is drawn as follows:</p>
                         <p>(i) The load of 200 N is drawn vertically as shown by oa</p>

                         <p>(ii) The direction only of force $F_{1}$ is known, so from point $a, \boldsymbol{a d}$ is drawn at $40^{\circ}$ to the vertical</p>
                         <p>(iii) The direction only of force $F_{2}$ is known, so from point $o, \boldsymbol{o c}$ is drawn at $35^{\circ}$ to the vertical</p>
                         <p>(iv) Lines ad and oc cross at point $b$; hence the vector diagram is given by triangle $o a b$. By measurement, $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$ is 119 N and $\boldsymbol{o} \boldsymbol{b}$ is 133 N .</p>
                         <p>Thus the tensions in the ropes are $F_{1}=119 \mathrm{~N}$ and $F_{2}=133 \mathrm{~N}$.</p>
                         <p><b>Problem 9.</b> Five coplanar forces are acting on a body and the body is in equilibrium. The forces are: 12 kN acting horizontally to the right, 18 kN acting at an angle of $75^{\circ}, 7 \mathrm{kN}$ acting at an angle of $165^{\circ}$, 16 kN acting from the nose of the 7 kN force, and 15 kN acting from the nose of the 16 kN force. Determine the directions of the 16 kN and 15 kN forces relative to the 12 kN force.</p>
                         <p>With reference to Figure 3.21, oa is drawn 12 units long horizontally to the right. From point $\boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$ is drawn 18 units long at an angle of $75^{\circ}$. From $b, \boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{c}$ is drawn 7 units long at an angle of $165^{\circ}$.</p>
                         <p>The direction of the 16 kN force is not known, thus arc $p q$ is drawn with a compass, with centre at $c$, radius 16 units. Since the forces are at equilibrium, the polygon of forces must close. Using a compass with centre at 0 , arc $r s$ is drawn having a radius 15 units. The point where the arcs intersect is at $d$.</p>
                         <p>By measurement, angle $\quad \boldsymbol{\phi}=198^{\circ}$ and $\alpha=291^{\circ}$</p>

                         <p>Thus the 16 kN force acts at an angle of $198^{\circ}$ (or $-162^{\circ}$ ) to the 12 kN force, and the 15 kN force acts at an angle of $291^{\circ}$ (or $-69^{\circ}$ ) to the 12 kN force.</p>
