                         <p>A machine is a device that can change the magnitude or line of action, or both magnitude and line of action of a force. A simple machine usually amplifies an input force, called the effort, to give a larger output force, called the load.

                         <p>The force ratio or mechanical advantage is defined as the ratio of load to effort, i.e.</p>

                         <p>Since both load and effort are measured in newtons, force ratio is a ratio of the same units and thus is a dimension-less quantity.</p>
                         <p>The movement ratio or velocity ratio is defined as the ratio of the distance moved by the effort to the distance moved by the load, i.e.</p>

                         <p>Since the numerator and denominator are both measured in metres, movement ratio is a ratio of the same units and thus is a dimension-less quantity.</p>

                         <p>Since the numerator and denominator are both dimension-less quantities, efficiency is a dimensionless quantity. It is usually expressed as a percentage, thus:</p>

                         <p>Due to the effects of friction and inertia associated with the movement of any object, some of the input energy to a machine is converted into heat and losses occur. Since losses occur, the energy output of a machine is less than the energy input, thus the mechanical efficiency of any machine cannot reach $100\%$</p>
                         <p>For simple machines, the relationship between effort and load is of the form: $F_{e}=aF_{l}+b$, where $F_{e}$ is the effort, $F_{l}$ is the load and $a$ and $b$ are constants. From equation (18.1), $$ \text {force ratio}=\frac{\text {load}}{\text {effort}}=\frac{F_{l}}{F_{e}}=\frac{F_{l}}{aF_{l}+b} $$ Dividing both numerator and denominator by $F_{l}$ gives: $$ \frac{F_{l}}{aF_{l}+b}=\frac{1}{a+\frac{b}{F_{l}}} $$</p>
                         <p>When the load is large, $F_{l}$ is large and $\frac{b}{F_{l}}$ is small compared with $a$. The force ratio then becomes approximately equal to $\frac{1}{a}$ and is called the limiting force ratio, i.e</p>

                         <p>The limiting efficiency of a simple machine is defined as the ratio of the limiting force ratio to the movement ratio, i.e.</p>

                         <p>where $a$ is the constant for the law of the machine: $$ F_{e}=aF_{l}+b $$ Due to friction and inertia, the limiting efficiency of simple machines is usually well below $100\%$.</p>
                         <p><b>Problem 1.</b> A simple machine raises a load of 160 kg through a distance of 1.6 m . The effort applied to the machine is 200 N and moves through a distance of 16 m . Taking $g$ as $9.8\mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}^{2}$, determine the force ratio, movement ratio and efficiency of the machine.</p>
                         <p>From equation (18.1), $$ \begin{aligned} \text {force ratio} &=\frac{\text {load}}{\text {effort}}=\frac{160\mathrm{~kg}}{200\mathrm{~N}} \\ &=\frac{160 \times 9.8\mathrm{~N}}{200\mathrm{~N}}=\mathbf{7.84}\end{aligned} $$ From equation (18.2), $$ \begin{aligned} \text {movement ratio} &=\frac{\text {distance moved by the effort}}{\text {distance moved by the load}} \\ &=\frac{16\mathrm{~m}}{1.6\mathrm{~m}}=\mathbf{10}\end{aligned} $$ From equation (18.3), $$ \begin{aligned} \text {efficiency} &=\frac{\text {force ratio}}{\text {movement ratio}} \times 100\% \\ &=\frac{7.84}{10} \times 100=\mathbf{78.4\%}\end{aligned} $$</p>
                         <p><b>Problem 2.</b> For the simple machine of Problem 1, determine: (a) the distance moved by the effort to move the load through a distance of 0.9 m , (b) the effort which would be required to raise a load of 200 kg , assuming the same efficiency, (c) the efficiency if, due to lubrication, the effort to raise the 160 kg load is reduced to 180 N .</p>
                         <p>(a) Since the movement ratio is 10 , then from equation (18.2), distance moved by the effort $$ \begin{aligned} &=10 \times \text {distance moved by the load} \\ &=10 \times 0.9=\mathbf{9}\mathbf{~ m}\end{aligned} $$</p>
                         <p>(b) Since the force ratio is 7.84 , then from equation (18.1), $$ \text {effort}=\frac{\text {load}}{7.84}=\frac{200 \times 9.8}{7.84}=\mathbf{250}\mathbf{~ N} $$</p>
                         <p>(c) The new force ratio is given by $$ \frac{\text {load}}{\text {effort}}=\frac{160 \times 9.8}{180}=8.711 $$ Hence the new efficiency after lubrication $$ =\frac{8.711}{10} \times 100=\mathbf{87.11\%} $$</p>
                         <p><b>Problem 3.</b> In a test on a simple machine, the effort/load graph was a straight line of the form $F_{e}=aF_{l}+b$. Two values lying on the graph were at $F_{e}=10\mathrm{~N}, F_{l}=30\mathrm{~N}$, and at $F_{e}=74\mathrm{~N}, F_{l}=350\mathrm{~N}$. The movement ratio of the machine was 17. Determine: (a) the limiting force ratio, (b) the limiting efficiency of the machine.</p>
                         <p>(a) The equation $F_{e}=aF_{l}+b$ is of the form $y=mx+c$, where $m$ is the gradient of the graph. The slope of the line passing through points $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ of the graph $y=mx+c$ is given by: $$ m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} $$ Thus for $F_{e}=aF_{l}+b$, the slope $a$ is given by: $$ a=\frac{74-10}{350-30}=\frac{64}{320}=0.2 $$ The limiting force ratio is $\frac{1}{a}$, that is $\frac{1}{0.2}=\mathbf{5}$</p>
                         <p>(b) The limiting efficiency $$ \begin{aligned} &=\frac{1}{a \times \text {movement ratio}} \times 100 \\ &=\frac{1}{0.2 \times 17} \times 100=\mathbf{29.4\%}\end{aligned} $$</p>

                         <p>Theoretically, each of the ropes marked (i) and (ii) share the load equally, thus the theoretical effort is only half of the load, i.e. the theoretical force ratio is 2 . In practice the actual force ratio is less than 2 due to losses. A three-pulley system is shown in Figure 18.1(c). Each of the ropes marked (i), (ii) and (iii) carry one-third of the load, thus the theoretical force ratio is 3 . In general, for a multiple pulley system having a total of $n$ pulleys, the theoretical force ratio is $n$. Since the theoretical efficiency of a pulley system (neglecting losses) is 100</p>

                         <p>A simple gear train is used to transmit rotary motion and can change both the magnitude and the line of action of a force, hence is a simple machine. The gear train shown in Figure 18.4 consists of spur gears and has an effort applied to one gear, called the driver, and a load applied to the other gear, called the follower.</p>

                         <p>In such a system, the teeth on the wheels are so spaced that they exactly fill the circumference with a whole number of identical teeth, and the teeth on the driver and follower mesh without interference. Under these conditions, the number of teeth on the driver and follower are in direct proportion to the circumference of these wheels, i.e.</p>
                         <div class="equation">

                         <p>If there are, say, 40 teeth on the driver and 20 teeth on the follower then the follower makes two revolutions for each revolution of the driver. In general:</p>

                         <p>Figure 18.7</p>
                         <p>A lever of the first order has the fulcrum placed between the effort and the load, as shown in Figure 18.7(a).</p>
                         <p>A lever of the second order has the load placed between the effort and the fulcrum, as shown in Figure 18.7(b).</p>
                         <p>A lever of the third order has the effort applied between the load and the fulcrum, as shown in Figure 18.7(c).</p>
                         <p>Problems on levers can largely be solved by applying the principle of moments (see Chapter 5). Thus for the lever shown in Figure 18.7(a), when the lever is in equilibrium, $$ \text {anticlockwise moment}=\text {clockwise moment} $$ i.e. $$ a \times F_{l}=b \times F_{e} $$ Thus, force ratio $$ =\frac{F_{l}}{F_{e}}=\frac{b}{a}=\frac{\text {distance of effort from fulcrum}}{\text {distance of load from fulcrum}} $$</p>
                         <p><b>Problem 9.</b> The load on a first-order lever, similar to that shown in Figure 18.7(a), is 1.2 kN . Determine the effort, the force ratio and the movement ratio when the distance between the fulcrum and the load is 0.5 m and the distance between the fulcrum and effort is 1.5 m . Assume the lever is $100\%$ efficient.</p>
                         <p>Applying the principle of moments, for equilibrium: i.e. $$ \text {anticlockwise moment}=\text {clockwise moment} $$ Hence, $$ 1200\mathrm{~N} \times 0.5\mathrm{~m}=\text {effort} \times 1.5\mathrm{~m} $$ $$ \begin{aligned} \text {effort} &= \frac{1200 \times 0.5}{1.5} \\ &=\mathbf{400}\mathbf{~ N}\end{aligned} $$ $$ \text {force ratio}=\frac{F_{l}}{F_{e}}=\frac{1200}{400}=\mathbf{3} $$ Alternatively, $\quad$ force ratio $=\frac{b}{a}=\frac{1.5}{0.5}=\mathbf{3}$ This result shows that to lift a load of, say, 300 N , an effort of 100 N is required.</p>
                         <p>Since, from equation (3), $$ \text {efficiency}=\frac{\text {force ratio}}{\text {movement ratio}} \times 100\% $$ then, $$ \begin{aligned} \text {movement ratio} &= \frac{\text {force ratio}}{\text {efficiency}} \times 100 \\ &=\frac{3}{100} \times 100=\mathbf{3}\end{aligned} $$ This result shows that to raise the load by, say, 100 mm , the effort has to move 300 mm .</p>
                         <p><b>Problem 10.</b> A second-order lever, $AB$, is in a horizontal position. The fulcrum is at point $C$. An effort of 60 N applied at $B$ just moves a load at point $D$, when $BD$ is 0.5 m and $BC$ is 1.25 m . Calculate the load and the force ratio of the lever.</p>
                         <p>A second-order lever system is shown in Figure 18.7(b). Taking moments about the fulcrum as the load is just moving, gives: $$ \text {anticlockwise moment}=\text {clockwise moment} $$ i.e. $$ 60\mathrm{~N} \times 1.25\mathrm{~m}=\text {load} \times 0.75\mathrm{~m} $$ Thus, $$ \begin{aligned} \text {load} &= \frac{60 \times 1.25}{0.75} \\ &=\mathbf{100}\mathbf{~ N}\end{aligned} $$ From equation (1), $$ \text {force ratio}=\frac{\text {load}}{\text {effort}}=\frac{100}{60}=\mathbf{1.67} $$ Alternatively, $$ \begin{aligned} \text {force ratio} &=\frac{\text {distance of effort from fulcrum}}{\text {distance of load from fulcrum}} \\ &=\frac{1.25}{0.75}=\mathbf{1.67}\end{aligned} $$</p>
