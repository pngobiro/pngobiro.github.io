                         <p>When an object, such as a block of wood, is placed on a floor and sufficient force is applied to the block, the force being parallel to the floor, the block slides across the floor. When the force is removed, motion of the block stops; thus there is a force which resists sliding. This force is called dynamic or sliding friction. A force may be applied to the block, which is insufficient to move it. In this case, the force resisting motion is called the static friction or stiction. Thus there are two categories into which a frictional force may be split:</p>

A low value of coefficient of friction indicates that the force required for sliding to occur is less than the force required when the coefficient of friction is high.

                         <p>The coefficient of friction ( $\mu$ ) for dynamic friction is, in general, a little less than that for static friction. However, for dynamic friction, $\mu$ increases with speed; additionally, it is dependent on the area of the surface in contact.</p>
                         <p><b>Problem 1.</b> A block of steel requires a force of 10.4 N applied parallel to a steel plate to keep it moving with constant velocity across the plate. If the normal force between the block and the plate is 40 N , determine the dynamic coefficient of friction.</p>
                         <p>As the block is moving at constant velocity, the force applied must be that required to overcome frictional forces, i.e. frictional force, $F=10.4\mathrm{~N}$; the normal force is 40 N , and since $F=\mu N$, $$ \mu=\frac{F}{N}=\frac{10.4}{40}=0.26 $$ i.e. the dynamic coefficient of friction is $\mathbf{0.26}$</p>
                         <p><b>Problem 2.</b> The surface between the steel block and plate of Problem 1 is now lubricated and the dynamic coefficient of friction falls to 0.12 . Find the new value of force required to push the block at a constant speed.</p>
                         <p>The normal force depends on the weight of the block and remains unaltered at 40 N . The new value of the dynamic coefficient of friction is 0.12 and since the frictional force $F=\mu N, F=0.12 \times 40=4.8\mathrm{~N}$. The block is sliding at constant speed, thus the force required to overcome the frictional force is also 4.8 N , i.e. the required applied force is 4.8 N .</p>
                         <p><b>Problem 3.</b> The material of a brake is being tested and it is found that the dynamic coefficient of friction between the material and steel is 0.91. Calculate the normal force when the frictional force is 0.728 kN .</p>
                         <p>The dynamic coefficient of friction, $\mu=0.91$ and the frictional force, $F=0.728\mathrm{~kN}=728\mathrm{~N}$ Since $F=\mu N$, then normal force, $$ N=\frac{F}{\mu}=\frac{728}{0.91}=800\mathrm{~N} $$ i.e. the normal force is 800 N .</p>

                         <p><b>Problem 5.</b> Discuss briefly two design implications that arise due to frictional forces and how lubrication may or may not help.</p>
                         <p>(i) Bearings are made of an alloy called white metal, which has a relatively low melting point. When the rotating shaft rubs on the white metal bearing, heat is generated by friction, often in one spot and the white metal may melt in this area, rendering the bearing useless. Adequate lubrication (oil or grease) separates the shaft from the white metal, keeps the coefficient of friction small and prevents damage to the bearing. For very large bearings, oil is pumped under pressure into the bearing and the oil is used to remove the heat generated, often passing through oil coolers before being re-circulated. Designers should ensure that the heat generated by friction can be dissipated.</p>
                         <p>(ii) Wheels driving belts, to transmit force from one place to another, are used in many workshops. The coefficient of friction between the wheel and the belt must be high, and it may be increased by dressing the belt with a tar-like substance. Since frictional force is proportional to the normal force, a slipping belt is made more efficient by tightening it, thus increasing the normal and hence the frictional force. Designers should incorporate some belt tension mechanism into the design of such a system.</p>
                         <p><b>Problem 6.</b> Explain what is meant by the terms (a) the limiting or static coefficient of friction, and (b) the sliding or dynamic coefficient of friction.</p>
                         <p>(a) When an object is placed on a surface and a force is applied to it in a direction parallel to the surface, if no movement takes place, then the applied force is balanced exactly by the frictional force. As the size of the applied force is increased, a value is reached such that the object is just on the point of moving. The limiting or static coefficient of friction is given by the ratio of this applied force to the normal force, where the normal force is the force acting at right angles to the surfaces in contact.</p>
                         <p>(b) Once the applied force is sufficient to overcome the stiction its value can be reduced slightly and the object moves across the surface. A particular value of the applied force is then sufficient to keep the object moving at a constant velocity. The sliding or dynamic coefficient of friction is the ratio of the applied force, to maintain constant velocity, to the normal force.</p>

                         <p>Consider a mass $m$ lying on an inclined plane, as shown in Figure 15.3. If the direction of motion of this mass is down the plane, then the frictional force $F$ will act up the plane, as shown in Figure 15.3, where $F=\mu mg$.</p>

                         <p>Now the weight of the mass is mg and this will cause two other forces to act on the mass, namely $N$, and the component of the weight down the plane, namely $mg \sin \theta$, as shown by the vector diagram of Figure 15.4.</p>

                         <p>It should be noted that N acts normal to the surface. Resolving forces parallel to the plane gives:</p>
                         <p>Forces up the plane $=$ forces down the plane i.e. $\quad F=mg \sin \theta$</p>

                         <p>But $\frac{F}{N}=\mu$, hence, $\tan \theta=\mu$ where $\mu=$ the coefficient of friction, and $\theta=$ the angle of repose.</p>
                         <p>If $\theta$ is gradually increased until the body starts motion down the plane, then this value of $\theta$ is called the limiting angle of repose. A laboratory experiment based on the theory is a useful method of obtaining the maximum value of $\mu$ for static friction.</p>

                         <p>Screw jacks (see Section 18.4, page 202) are often used to lift weights; one of their most common uses are to raise cars, so that their wheels can be changed. The theory described in Section 15.7 can be used to analyse screw jacks.</p>
                         <p>Consider the thread of the square-threaded screw jack shown in Figure 15.15.</p>
                         <p>Let $p$ be the pitch of the thread, i.e. the axial distance that the weight $W$ is lifted or lowered when the screw is turned through one complete revolution. From Figure 15.15, the motion of the screw in lifting the weight can be regarded as pulling the weight by a horizontal force $P$, up an incline $\theta$, where $$ \tan \theta=\frac{p}{\pi d} $$</p>

                         <p>Substituting equation (15.26) into equation (15.25) gives: $$ P \cos \theta=\mu N+W \sin \theta $$ Substituting equation (15.24) into equation (15.27) gives: $$ P \cos \theta=\mu(W \cos \theta+P \sin \theta)+W \sin \theta $$ Dividing each term by $\cos \theta$ and remembering that $\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}=\tan \theta$ gives: $$ P=\mu(W+P \tan \theta)+W \tan \theta $$ Rearranging gives: $$ P(1-\mu \tan \theta)=W(\mu+\tan \theta) $$ from which, $$ \begin{aligned} P &= \frac{W(\mu+\tan \theta)}{(1-\mu \tan \theta)} \\ &= \frac{W(\tan \lambda+\tan \theta)}{(1-\tan \lambda \tan \theta)}\end{aligned} $$ since $\mu=\tan \lambda$ However, from compound angle formulae, $$ \tan (\lambda+\theta)=\frac{(\tan \lambda+\tan \theta)}{(1-\tan \lambda \tan \theta)} $$ Hence, $$ P=W \tan (\theta+\lambda) $$</p>
                         <p>However, from Figure 15.15, $$ \begin{aligned} \tan \theta &=\frac{p}{\pi d} \\ \text {hence} \quad P &=\frac{W\left(\mu+\frac{p}{\pi d}\right)}{\left(1-\frac{\mu p}{\pi d}\right)}\end{aligned} $$ Multiplying top and bottom of equation (15.29) by $\pi d$ gives: $$ P=\frac{W(\mu \pi d+p)}{(\pi d-\mu p)} $$ The useful work done in lifting the weight $W$ a distance of $p$ $$ =W p $$ From Figure 15.15, the actual work done $$ \begin{aligned} &=P \times \pi d \\ &= \frac{W(\mu \pi d+p)}{(\pi d-\mu p)} \times \pi d\end{aligned} $$ Efficiency $\eta=\frac{\text {useful work done}}{\text {actual work done}}$ which is usually expressed as a percentage i.e. $$ \begin{aligned} \eta &= \frac{W p}{\frac{W(\mu \pi d+p) \times \pi d}{(\pi d-\mu p)}} \\ &= \frac{p(\pi d-\mu p)}{(\mu \pi d+p) \times \pi d}\end{aligned} $$ Dividing throughout by $\pi d$ gives: $$ \begin{aligned} \eta &= \frac{p\left(1-\frac{\mu p}{\pi d}\right)}{(\mu \pi d+p)} \\ &= \frac{p(1-\tan \lambda \tan \theta)}{\pi d\left(\mu+\frac{p}{\pi d}\right)} \\ &= \frac{p(1-\tan \lambda \tan \theta)}{\pi d(\tan \lambda+\tan \theta)}\end{aligned} $$ However, $$ \tan (\lambda+\theta)=\frac{\tan \lambda+\tan \theta}{(1-\tan \lambda \tan \theta)} $$ from compound angle formulae Hence, $$ \eta=\frac{p}{\pi d} \frac{1}{\tan (\lambda+\theta)} $$ but $$ \frac{p}{\pi d}=\tan \theta $$ hence, efficiency, $$ \eta=\frac{\tan \theta}{\tan (\lambda+\theta)} $$ From equations (15.31) and (15.32), the work lost in friction $$ =\frac{W(\mu \pi d+p)}{(\pi d-\mu p)} \times \pi d-Wp $$</p>
