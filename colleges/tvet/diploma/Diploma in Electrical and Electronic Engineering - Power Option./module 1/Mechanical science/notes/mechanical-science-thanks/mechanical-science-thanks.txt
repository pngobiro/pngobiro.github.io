\section*{Forces acting at a point}

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
- distinguish between scalar and vector quantities
- define 'centre of gravity' of an object
- define 'equilibrium' of an object
- understand the terms 'coplanar' and 'concurrent'
- determine the resultant of two coplanar forces using
(a) the triangle of forces method
(b) the parallelogram of forces method
- calculate the resultant of two coplanar forces using
(a) the cosine and sine rules
(b) resolution of forces
- determine the resultant of more than two coplanar forces using
(a) the polygon of forces method
(b) calculation by resolution of forces
- determine unknown forces when three or more coplanar forces are in equilibrium

\subsection*{3.1 Scalar and vector quantities}

Quantities used in engineering and science can be divided into two groups:
(a) Scalar quantities have a size (or magnitude) only and need no other information to specify them. Thus, 10 centimetres, 50 seconds, 7 litres and 3 kilograms are all examples of scalar quantities.
(b) Vector quantities have both a size or magnitude and a direction, called the line of
action of the quantity. Thus, a velocity of 50 kilometres per hour due east, an acceleration of 9.81 metres per second squared vertically downwards and a force of 15 Newtons at an angle of 30 degrees are all examples of vector quantities.

\subsection*{3.2 Centre of gravity and equilibrium}

The centre of gravity of an object is a point where the resultant gravitational force acting on the body may be taken to act. For objects of uniform thickness lying in a horizontal plane, the centre of gravity is vertically in line with the point of balance of the object. For a thin uniform rod the point of balance and hence the centre of gravity is halfway along the rod as shown in Figure 3.1(a).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-002.jpg?height=265&width=736&top_left_y=1251&top_left_x=893)

Figure 3.1

A thin flat sheet of a material of uniform thickness is called a lamina and the centre of gravity of a rectangular lamina lies at the point of intersection of its diagonals, as shown in Figure 3.1(b). The centre of gravity of a circular lamina is at the centre of the circle, as shown in Figure 3.1(c).

An object is in equilibrium when the forces acting on the object are such that there is no tendency for the object to move. The state of equilibrium of an object can be divided into three groups.
(i) If an object is in stable equilibrium and it is slightly disturbed by pushing or pulling (i.e. a disturbing force is applied), the centre of gravity is raised and when the disturbing force is removed, the object returns to its
original position. Thus a ball bearing in a hemispherical cup is in stable equilibrium, as shown in Figure 3.2(a).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-003.jpg?height=114&width=190&top_left_y=330&top_left_x=227)

Neutral equilibrium

Figure 3.2
(ii) An object is in unstable equilibrium if, when a disturbing force is applied, the centre of gravity is lowered and the object moves away from its original position. Thus, a ball bearing balanced on top of a hemispherical cup is in unstable equilibrium, as shown in Figure 3.2(b).
(iii) When an object in neutral equilibrium has a disturbing force applied, the centre of gravity remains at the same height and the object does not move when the disturbing force is removed. Thus, a ball bearing on a flat horizontal surface is in neutral equilibrium, as shown in Figure 3.2(c).

\subsection*{3.3 Forces}

When forces are all acting in the same plane, they are called coplanar. When forces act at the same time and at the same point, they are called concurrent forces.

Force is a vector quantity and thus has both a magnitude and a direction. A vector can be represented graphically by a line drawn to scale in the direction of the line of action of the force.

To distinguish between vector and scalar quantities, various ways are used.

These include:
(i) bold print,
(ii) two capital letters with an arrow above them to denote the sense of direction, e.g. $\overrightarrow{A B}$, where $A$ is the starting point and $B$ the end point of the vector,
(iii) a line over the top of letters, e.g. $\overline{A B}$ or $\bar{a}$
(iv) letters with an arrow above, e.g. $\vec{a}, \vec{A}$
(v) underlined letters, e.g. $\underline{a}$
(vi) $\quad x i+y j$, where $i$ and $j$ are axes at right-angles to each other; for example, $3 i+4 j$ means 3 units in the $i$ direction and 4 units in the $j$ direction, as shown in Figure 3.3
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-003.jpg?height=423&width=376&top_left_y=836&top_left_x=994)

Figure 3.3
(vii) a column matrix $\binom{a}{b}$; for example, the vector $\boldsymbol{O A}$ shown in Figure 3.3 could be represented by $\binom{3}{4}$
Thus, in Figure 3.3, $\boldsymbol{O A} \equiv \overrightarrow{O A} \equiv \overline{O A}$
$$\equiv 3 i+4 j \equiv\binom{3}{4}$$

The method adopted in this text is to denote vector quantities in bold print. Thus, $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$ in Figure 3.4 represents a force of 5 Newton's acting in a direction due east.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-003.jpg?height=210&width=441&top_left_y=1966&top_left_x=894)

\subsection*{3.4 The resultant of two coplanar forces}

For two forces acting at a point, there are three possibilities.
(a) For forces acting in the same direction and having the same line of action, the single force having the same effect as both of the forces, called the resultant force or just the resultant, is the arithmetic sum of the separate forces. Forces of $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ acting at point $P$, as shown in Figure 3.5(a), have exactly the same effect on point $P$ as force $F$ shown in Figure 3.5(b), where $F=F_{1}+F_{2}$ and acts in the same direction as $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$. Thus $F$ is the resultant of $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-004.jpg?height=294&width=441&top_left_y=893&top_left_x=159)

\section*{Figure 3.5}
(b) For forces acting in opposite directions along the same line of action, the resultant force is the arithmetic difference between the two forces. Forces of $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ acting at point $P$ as shown in Figure 3.6(a) have exactly the same effect on point $P$ as force $F$ shown in Figure 3.6(b), where $F=F_{2}-F_{1}$ and acts in the direction of $F_{2}$, since $F_{2}$ is greater than $F_{1}$.
Thus $F$ is the resultant of $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-004.jpg?height=332&width=496&top_left_y=1720&top_left_x=163)

\section*{Figure 3.6}
(c) When two forces do not have the same line of action, the magnitude and direction of the
resultant force may be found by a procedure called vector addition of forces. There are two graphical methods of performing vector addition, known as the triangle of forces method (see Section 3.5) and the parallelogram of forces method (see Section 3.6)

Problem 1. Determine the resultant force of two forces of 5 kN and 8 kN ,
(a) acting in the same direction and having the same line of action,
(b) acting in opposite directions but having the same line of action.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-004.jpg?height=462&width=546&top_left_y=855&top_left_x=964)

Figure 3.7
(a) The vector diagram of the two forces acting in the same direction is shown in Figure 3.7(a), which assumes that the line of action is horizontal, although since it is not specified, could be in any direction. From above, the resultant force $F$ is given by:
$$\begin{aligned}
\quad F & =F_{1}+F_{2}, \\
\text { i.e. } \quad \boldsymbol{F} & =(5+8) \mathrm{kN}=\mathbf{1 3} \mathbf{~ k N}
\end{aligned}$$
in the direction of the original forces.
(b) The vector diagram of the two forces acting in opposite directions is shown in Figure 3.7(b), again assuming that the line of action is in a horizontal direction. From above, the resultant force $F$ is given by:
$$\begin{aligned}
F & =F_{2}-F_{1}, \text { i.e. } \boldsymbol{F}=(8-5) \mathrm{kN} \\
& =\mathbf{3} \mathbf{~ k N}
\end{aligned}$$
in the direction of the 8 kN force.

\subsection*{3.5 Triangle of forces method}

A simple procedure for the triangle of forces method of vector addition is as follows:
(i) Draw a vector representing one of the forces, using an appropriate scale and in the direction of its line of action.
(ii) From the nose of this vector and using the same scale, draw a vector representing the second force in the direction of its line of action.
(iii) The resultant vector is represented in both magnitude and direction by the vector drawn from the tail of the first vector to the nose of the second vector.

Problem 2. Determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant of a force of 15 N acting horizontally to the right and a force of 20 N , inclined at an angle of $60^{\circ}$ to the 15 N force. Use the triangle of forces method.

Using the procedure given above and with reference to Figure 3.8:
(i) $\boldsymbol{a b}$ is drawn 15 units long horizontally
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-005.jpg?height=467&width=462&top_left_y=1328&top_left_x=182)

Figure 3.8
(ii) From $b, \boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{c}$ is drawn 20 units long, inclined at an angle of $60^{\circ}$ to $a b$. (Note, in angular measure, an angle of $60^{\circ}$ from $a b$ means $60^{\circ}$ in an anticlockwise direction)
(iii) By measurement, the resultant $\boldsymbol{a c}$ is 30.5 units long inclined at an angle of $35^{\circ}$ to $a b$. That is, the resultant force is $\mathbf{3 0 . 5 ~ N}$, inclined at an angle of $\mathbf{3 5}^{\circ}$ to the 15 N force.

Problem 3. Find the magnitude and direction of the two forces given, using the triangle of forces method.

First force: 1.5 kN acting at an angle of $30^{\circ}$
Second force: 3.7 kN acting at an angle of $-45^{\circ}$

Scale

Figure 3.9
From the above procedure and with reference to Figure 3.9:
(i) $\boldsymbol{a b}$ is drawn at an angle of $30^{\circ}$ and 1.5 units in length.
(ii) From $b, \boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{c}$ is drawn at an angle of $-45^{\circ}$ and 3.7 units in length. (Note, an angle of $-45^{\circ}$ means a clockwise rotation of $45^{\circ}$ from a line drawn horizontally to the right)
(iii) By measurement, the resultant ac is 4.3 units long at an angle of $-25^{\circ}$. That is, the resultant force is $\mathbf{4 . 3} \mathbf{~ k N}$ at an angle of $\mathbf{- 2 5}^{\circ}$

Now try the following exercise
Exercise 12 Further problems on the triangle of forces method

[36.8 N at $20^{\circ}$ ]
4. 5 N at $60^{\circ}$ and 8 N at $90^{\circ}$
[12.6 N at $79^{\circ}$ ]
5. $\quad 1.3 \mathrm{kN}$ at $45^{\circ}$ and 2.8 kN at $-30^{\circ}$
[ 3.4 kN at $-8^{\circ}$ ]

\subsection*{3.6 The parallelogram of forces method}

A simple procedure for the parallelogram of forces method of vector addition is as follows:
(i) Draw a vector representing one of the forces, using an appropriate scale and in the direction of its line of action.
(ii) From the tail of this vector and using the same scale draw a vector representing the second force in the direction of its line of action.
(iii) Complete the parallelogram using the two vectors drawn in (i) and (ii) as two sides of the parallelogram.
(iv) The resultant force is represented in both magnitude and direction by the vector corresponding to the diagonal of the parallelogram drawn from the tail of the vectors in (i) and (ii).

Problem 4. Use the parallelogram of forces method to find the magnitude and direction of the resultant of a force of 250 N acting at an angle of $135^{\circ}$ and a force of 400 N acting at an angle of $-120^{\circ}$.

From the procedure given above and with reference to Figure 3.10:
(i) $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$ is drawn at an angle of $135^{\circ}$ and 250 units in length
(ii) $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{c}$ is drawn at an angle of $-120^{\circ}$ and 400 units in length
(iii) bd and cd are drawn to complete the parallelogram
(iv) ad is drawn. By measurement, ad is 413 units long at an angle of $-156^{\circ}$.

That is, the resultant force is $\mathbf{4 1 3 ~ N}$ at an angle of $-156^{\circ}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-006.jpg?height=585&width=547&top_left_y=159&top_left_x=894)

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

\section*{Exercise 13 Further problems on the parallelogram of forces method}

[ 0.86 kN at $-101^{\circ}$ ]
5. 47 N at $79^{\circ}$ and 58 N at $247^{\circ}$
[15.5 N at $-152^{\circ}$ ]

\subsection*{3.7 Resultant of coplanar forces by calculation}

An alternative to the graphical methods of determining the resultant of two coplanar forces is by calculation. This can be achieved by trigonometry using the cosine rule and the sine rule, as shown in Problem 5 following, or by resolution of forces (see Section 3.10).

Problem 5. Use the cosine and sine rules to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant of a force of 8 kN acting at an angle of $50^{\circ}$ to the horizontal and a force of 5 kN acting at an angle of $-30^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-007.jpg?height=410&width=724&top_left_y=463&top_left_x=90)

Figure 3.11
The space diagram is shown in Figure 3.11(a). A sketch is made of the vector diagram, oa representing the 8 kN force in magnitude and direction and $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$ representing the 5 kN force in magnitude and direction. The resultant is given by length ob. By the cosine rule,

Hence
$$\begin{aligned}
& o b^{2}=o a^{2}+a b^{2}-2(o a)(a b) \cos \angle o a b \\
&=8^{2}+5^{2}-2(8)(5) \cos 100^{\circ} \\
&\left(\text { since } \angle o a b=180^{\circ}-50^{\circ}-30^{\circ}=100^{\circ}\right) \\
&=64+25-(-13.892)=102.892
\end{aligned}$$

By the sine rule, $\frac{5}{\sin \angle a o b}=\frac{10.14}{\sin 100^{\circ}}$
from which, $\quad \sin \angle a o b=\frac{5 \sin 100^{\circ}}{10.14}=0.4856$
Hence $\angle$ aob $=\sin ^{-1}(0.4856)=29.05^{\circ}$. Thus angle $\phi$ in Figure 3.11(b) is $50^{\circ}-29.05^{\circ}=20.95^{\circ}$
Hence the resultant of the two forces is 10.14 kN acting at an angle of $20.95^{\circ}$ to the horizontal

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

\section*{Exercise 14 Further problems on the resultant of coplanar forces by calculation}
1. Forces of 7.6 kN at $32^{\circ}$ and 11.8 kN at $143^{\circ}$ act at a point. Use the cosine and
sine rules to calculate the magnitude and direction of their resultant.
[11.52 kN at $105^{\circ}$ ]
In questions 2 to 5, calculate the resultant of the given forces by using the cosine and sine rules
2. 13 N at $0^{\circ}$ and 25 N at $30^{\circ}$
[ 36.8 N at $20^{\circ}$ ]
3. 1.3 kN at $45^{\circ}$ and 2.8 kN at $-30^{\circ}$
[ 3.4 kN at $-8^{\circ}$ ]
4. 9 N at $126^{\circ}$ and 14 N at $223^{\circ}$
[15.7 N at $-172^{\circ}$ ]
5. $\quad 0.7 \mathrm{kN}$ at $147^{\circ}$ and 1.3 kN at $-71^{\circ}$
[ 0.86 kN at $-101^{\circ}$ ]

\subsection*{3.8 Resultant of more than two coplanar forces}

For the three coplanar forces $F_{1}, F_{2}$ and $F_{3}$ acting at a point as shown in Figure 3.12, the vector diagram is drawn using the nose-to-tail method of Section 3.5. The procedure is:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-007.jpg?height=270&width=407&top_left_y=1294&top_left_x=897)

Figure 3.12
(i) Draw oa to scale to represent force $F_{1}$ in both magnitude and direction (see Figure 3.13)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-007.jpg?height=261&width=411&top_left_y=1820&top_left_x=986)

Figure 3.13
(ii) From the nose of oa, draw $\boldsymbol{a b}$ to represent force $F_{2}$
(iii) From the nose of $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$, draw $\boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{c}$ to represent force $F_{3}$
(iv) The resultant vector is given by length oc in Figure 3.13. The direction of resultant oc is from where we started, i.e. point $o$, to where we finished, i.e. point $c$. When acting by itself, the resultant force, given by oc, has the same effect on the point as forces $F_{1}, F_{2}$ and $F_{3}$ have when acting together. The resulting vector diagram of Figure 3.13 is called the polygon of forces.

Problem 6. Determine graphically the magnitude and direction of the resultant of these three coplanar forces, which may be considered as acting at a point:
Force $A, 12 \mathrm{~N}$ acting horizontally to the right; force $B, 7 \mathrm{~N}$ inclined at $60^{\circ}$ to force $A$; force $C, 15 \mathrm{~N}$ inclined at $150^{\circ}$ to force $A$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-008.jpg?height=251&width=576&top_left_y=1078&top_left_x=94)

Figure 3.15

The space diagram is shown in Figure 3.14. The vector diagram shown in Figure 3.15, is produced as follows:
(i) oa represents the 12 N force in magnitude and direction
(ii) From the nose of $\boldsymbol{o} \boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$ is drawn inclined at $60^{\circ}$ to $\boldsymbol{o} \boldsymbol{a}$ and 7 units long
(iii) From the nose of $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{c}$ is drawn 15 units long inclined at $150^{\circ}$ to oa (i.e. $150^{\circ}$ to the horizontal)
(iv) oc represents the resultant; by measurement, the resultant is 13.8 N inclined at $\boldsymbol{\phi}=80^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.

Thus the resultant of the three forces, $F_{A}, F_{B}$ and $F_{C}$ is a force of 13.8 N at $80^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.

Problem 7. The following coplanar forces are acting at a point, the given angles being measured from the horizontal: 100 N at $30^{\circ}$, 200 N at $80^{\circ}, 40 \mathrm{~N}$ at $-150^{\circ}, 120 \mathrm{~N}$ at $-100^{\circ}$ and 70 N at $-60^{\circ}$. Determine graphically the magnitude and direction of the resultant of the five forces.

The five forces are shown in the space diagram of Figure 3.16. Since the 200 N and 120 N forces have the same line of action but are in opposite sense, they can be represented by a single force of $200-120$, i.e. 80 N acting at $80^{\circ}$ to the horizontal. Similarly, the 100 N and 40 N forces can be represented by a force of $100-40$, i.e. 60 N acting at $30^{\circ}$ to the horizontal. Hence the space diagram of Figure 3.16 may be represented by the space diagram of Figure 3.17. Such a simplification of the vectors is not essential but it is easier to construct the vector diagram from a space diagram having three forces, than one with five.

Figure 3.18

The vector diagram is shown in Figure 3.18, oa representing the 60 N force, $\boldsymbol{a b}$ representing the 80 N force and $\boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{c}$ the 70 N force. The resultant, $\boldsymbol{o c}$, is found by measurement to represent a force of 112 N and angle $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ is $25^{\circ}$.

Thus, the five forces shown in Figure 3.16 may be represented by a single force of 112 N at $25^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.

Now try the following exercise

Exercise 15 Further problems on the resultant of more than two coplanar forces

In questions 1 to 3 , determine graphically the magnitude and direction of the resultant of the coplanar forces given which are acting at a point.

\subsection*{3.9 Coplanar forces in equilibrium}

When three or more coplanar forces are acting at a point and the vector diagram closes, there is no resultant. The forces acting at the point are in equilibrium.

Problem 8. A load of 200 N is lifted by two ropes connected to the same point on the load, making angles of $40^{\circ}$ and $35^{\circ}$ with the vertical. Determine graphically the tensions in each rope when the system is in equilibrium.

Figure 3.19

The space diagram is shown in Figure 3.19. Since the system is in equilibrium, the vector diagram must close. The vector diagram, shown in Figure 3.20, is drawn as follows:
(i) The load of 200 N is drawn vertically as shown by oa
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-010.jpg?height=522&width=561&top_left_y=493&top_left_x=181)

Figure 3.20
(ii) The direction only of force $F_{1}$ is known, so from point $a, \boldsymbol{a d}$ is drawn at $40^{\circ}$ to the vertical
(iii) The direction only of force $F_{2}$ is known, so from point $o, \boldsymbol{o c}$ is drawn at $35^{\circ}$ to the vertical
(iv) Lines ad and oc cross at point $b$; hence the vector diagram is given by triangle $o a b$. By measurement, $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$ is 119 N and $\boldsymbol{o} \boldsymbol{b}$ is 133 N .

Thus the tensions in the ropes are $F_{1}=119 \mathrm{~N}$ and $F_{2}=133 \mathrm{~N}$.

Problem 9. Five coplanar forces are acting on a body and the body is in equilibrium. The forces are: 12 kN acting horizontally to the right, 18 kN acting at an angle of $75^{\circ}, 7 \mathrm{kN}$ acting at an angle of $165^{\circ}$, 16 kN acting from the nose of the 7 kN force, and 15 kN acting from the nose of the 16 kN force. Determine the directions of the 16 kN and 15 kN forces relative to the 12 kN force.

With reference to Figure 3.21, oa is drawn 12 units long horizontally to the right. From point $\boldsymbol{a}, \boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$ is drawn 18 units long at an angle of $75^{\circ}$. From $b, \boldsymbol{b} \boldsymbol{c}$ is drawn 7 units long at an angle of $165^{\circ}$.

The direction of the 16 kN force is not known, thus arc $p q$ is drawn with a compass, with centre at $c$, radius 16 units. Since the forces are at equilibrium, the polygon of forces must close. Using a compass with centre at 0 , arc $r s$ is drawn having a radius 15 units. The point where the arcs intersect is at $d$.

By measurement, angle $\quad \boldsymbol{\phi}=198^{\circ}$ and $\alpha=291^{\circ}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-010.jpg?height=637&width=796&top_left_y=604&top_left_x=890)

Figure 3.21

Thus the 16 kN force acts at an angle of $198^{\circ}$ (or $-162^{\circ}$ ) to the 12 kN force, and the 15 kN force acts at an angle of $291^{\circ}$ (or $-69^{\circ}$ ) to the 12 kN force.

Determine the direction of the 100 N and 90 N forces relative to the 60 N force.
[ 100 N force at $263^{\circ}$ to the 60 N force, 90 N force at $132^{\circ}$ to the 60 N force]

\subsection*{3.10 Resolution of forces}

A vector quantity may be expressed in terms of its horizontal and vertical components. For example, a vector representing a force of 10 N at an angle of $60^{\circ}$ to the horizontal is shown in Figure 3.23. If the horizontal line $\boldsymbol{o} \boldsymbol{a}$ and the vertical line $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$ are constructed as shown, then $\boldsymbol{o} \boldsymbol{a}$ is called the horizontal component of the 10 N force, and $\boldsymbol{a} \boldsymbol{b}$ the vertical component of the 10 N force.
By trigonometry,
$$\cos 60^{\circ}=\frac{o a}{o b},$$
hence the horizontal component,
$$o a=10 \cos 60^{\circ}$$

Also, $\quad \sin 60^{\circ}=\frac{a b}{o b}$,
hence the vertical component, $a b=10 \sin 60^{\circ}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-011.jpg?height=347&width=308&top_left_y=163&top_left_x=898)

Figure 3.23

This process is called finding the horizontal and vertical components of a vector or the resolution of a vector, and can be used as an alternative to graphical methods for calculating the resultant of two or more coplanar forces acting at a point.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-011.jpg?height=633&width=657&top_left_y=933&top_left_x=897)

Figure 3.24

For example, to calculate the resultant of a 10 N force acting at $60^{\circ}$ to the horizontal and a 20 N force acting at $-30^{\circ}$ to the horizontal (see Figure 3.24) the procedure is as follows:
(i) Determine the horizontal and vertical components of the 10 N force, i.e.
$$\text { horizontal component, } \begin{aligned}
o a & =10 \cos 60^{\circ} \\
& =5.0 \mathrm{~N}, \text { and } \\
\text { vertical component, } a b & =10 \sin 60^{\circ} \\
& =8.66 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}$$
(ii) Determine the horizontal and vertical components of the 20 N force, i.e.
$$\text { horizontal component, } \begin{aligned}
o d & =20 \cos \left(-30^{\circ}\right) \\
& =17.32 \mathrm{~N}, \text { and } \\
\text { vertical component, } c d & =20 \sin \left(-30^{\circ}\right) \\
& =-10.0 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}$$
(iii) Determine the total horizontal component, i.e.
$$o a+o d=5.0+17.32=22.32 \mathrm{~N}$$
(iv) Determine the total vertical component, i.e.
$$a b+c d=8.66+(-10.0)=-1.34 \mathrm{~N}$$
$0 \xrightarrow[\text { Resultant }]{\text { Total horizontal component }=22.32} \xrightarrow{\text { ta }}$ Total vertical

\section*{Figure 3.25}
(v) Sketch the total horizontal and vertical components as shown in Figure 3.25. The resultant of the two components is given by length or and, by Pythagoras' theorem,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { or } & =\sqrt{22.32^{2}+1.34^{2}} \\
& =22.36 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}$$
and using trigonometry, angle
$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{\phi} & =\tan ^{-1} \frac{1.34}{22.32} \\
& =3.44^{\circ}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence the resultant of the 10 N and 20 N forces shown in Figure 3.24 is $\mathbf{2 2 . 3 6 ~ N}$ at an angle of $\mathbf{- 3 . 4 4}{ }^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.

Problem 10. Forces of 5.0 N at $25^{\circ}$ and 8.0 N at $112^{\circ}$ act at a point. By resolving these forces into horizontal and vertical components, determine their resultant.

The space diagram is shown in Figure 3.26.
(i) The horizontal component of the 5.0 N force,
$$o a=5.0 \cos 25^{\circ}=4.532$$
and the vertical component of the 5.0 N force,
$$a b=5.0 \sin 25^{\circ}=2.113$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-012.jpg?height=503&width=688&top_left_y=162&top_left_x=893)

\section*{Figure 3.26}
(ii) The horizontal component of the 8.0 N force,
$$o c=8.0 \cos 112^{\circ}=-2.997$$

The vertical component of the 8.0 N force,
$$c d=8.0 \sin 112^{\circ}=7.417$$
(iii) Total horizontal component
$$\begin{aligned}
& =o a+o c=4.532+(-2.997) \\
& =+1.535
\end{aligned}$$
(iv) Total vertical component
$$\begin{aligned}
& =a b+c d=2.113+7.417 \\
& =+9.530
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-012.jpg?height=491&width=181&top_left_y=1542&top_left_x=981)

Figure 3.27
(v) The components are shown sketched in Figure 3.27.

By Pythagoras' theorem,
$$\begin{aligned}
r & =\sqrt{1.535^{2}+9.530^{2}} \\
& =9.653
\end{aligned}$$
and by trigonometry, angle
$$\phi=\tan ^{-1} \frac{9.530}{1.535}=80.85^{\circ}$$

Hence the resultant of the two forces shown in Figure 3.26 is a force of 9.653 N acting at $80.85^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.

Problems 9 and 10 demonstrate the use of resolution of forces for calculating the resultant of two coplanar forces acting at a point. However the method may be used for more than two forces acting at a point, as shown in Problem 11.

Problem 11. Determine by resolution of forces the resultant of the following three coplanar forces acting at a point: 200 N acting at $20^{\circ}$ to the horizontal; 400 N acting at $165^{\circ}$ to the horizontal; 500 N acting at $250^{\circ}$ to the horizontal.

A tabular approach using a calculator may be made as shown below:

\section*{Horizontal component}
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Force 1 $\quad 200 \cos 20^{\circ}$ & $=187.94$ \\
Force 2 $\quad 400 \cos 165^{\circ}$ & $=-386.37$ \\
Force 3 $\quad 500 \cos 250^{\circ}$ & $=-171.01$ \\
& $=-369.44$ \\
Total horizontal component & $=-$
\end{tabular}

Vertical component
\begin{tabular}{lrlr} 
Force 1 $\quad 200 \sin 20^{\circ}$ & $=$ & 68.40 \\
Force 2 $\quad 400 \sin 165^{\circ}$ & $=$ & 103.53 \\
Force 3 $\quad 500 \sin 250^{\circ}$ & $=$ & -469.85 \\
& Total vertical component & $=-297.92$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The total horizontal and vertical components are shown in Figure 3.28.

Resultant
$$\begin{aligned}
r & =\sqrt{369.44^{2}+297.92^{2}} \\
& =474.60
\end{aligned}$$
and angle
$$\phi=\tan ^{-1} \frac{297.92}{369.44}=38.88^{\circ},$$
from which, $\quad \alpha=180^{\circ}-38.88^{\circ}=141.12^{\circ}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-013.jpg?height=385&width=628&top_left_y=158&top_left_x=887)

Figure 3.28
Thus the resultant of the three forces given is 474.6 N acting at an angle of $-141.12^{\circ}$ (or $+218.88^{\circ}$ ) to the horizontal.

\subsection*{9.1 Couple and torque}

When two equal forces act on a body as shown in Figure 9.1, they cause the body to rotate, and the system of forces is called a couple.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-017.jpg?height=210&width=388&top_left_y=1971&top_left_x=97)

Figure 9.1

The turning moment of a couple is called a torque, $T$. In Figure 9.1, torque $=$ magnitude of either force $\times$ perpendicular distance between the forces
i.e. $\quad \boldsymbol{T}=\boldsymbol{F} \boldsymbol{d}$

The unit of torque is the newton metre, $\mathbf{N ~ m}$ When a force $F$ newtons is applied at a radius $r$ metres from the axis of, say, a nut to be turned by a spanner, as shown in Figure 9.2, the torque $T$ applied to the nut is given by: $\boldsymbol{T}=\boldsymbol{F} \boldsymbol{r} \mathbf{N} \mathbf{~ m}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-017.jpg?height=258&width=445&top_left_y=1039&top_left_x=897)

Figure 9.2

Problem 1. Determine the torque when a pulley wheel of diameter 300 mm has a force of 80 N applied at the rim.

Torque $T=F r$, where force $F=80 \mathrm{~N}$ and radius $r=\frac{300}{2}=150 \mathrm{~mm}=0.15 \mathrm{~m}$.
Hence, torque, $\boldsymbol{T}=(80)(0.15)=\mathbf{1 2} \mathbf{~ N ~ m}$

Problem 2. Determine the force applied tangentially to a bar of a screw jack at a radius of 800 mm , if the torque required is 600 N m
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Torque, } \begin{aligned}
T & =\text { force } \times \text { radius, from which } \\
\text { force } & =\frac{\text { torque }}{\text { radius }}=\frac{600 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}}{800 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}} \\
& =\mathbf{7 5 0} \mathbf{N}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 3. The circular hand-wheel of a valve of diameter 500 mm has a couple applied to it composed of two forces, each of 250 N. Calculate the torque produced by the couple.

Torque produced by couple, $T=F d$, where force $F=250 \mathrm{~N}$ and distance between the forces, $d=500 \mathrm{~mm}=0.5 \mathrm{~m}$.
Hence, torque, $\boldsymbol{T}=(250)(0.5)=\mathbf{1 2 5} \mathbf{~ N ~ m}$

\subsection*{9.2 Work done and power transmitted by a constant torque}

Figure 9.3(a) shows a pulley wheel of radius $r$ metres attached to a shaft and a force $F$ Newton's applied to the rim at point $P$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-018.jpg?height=411&width=704&top_left_y=1637&top_left_x=90)

Figure 9.3

Figure 9.3(b) shows the pulley wheel having turned through an angle $\theta$ radians as a result of the force $F$
being applied. The force moves through a distance $s$, where arc length $s=r \theta$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Work done } & =\text { force } \times \text { distance moved by the force } \\
& =F \times r \theta=F r \theta \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}=F r \theta J
\end{aligned}$$

However, $F r$ is the torque $T$, hence,
$$\text { work done }=T \theta \text { joules }$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Average power }= & \frac{\text { work done }}{\text { time taken }}=\frac{T \theta}{\text { for a constant torque } T}
\end{aligned}$$

However, (angle $\theta) /($ time taken $)=$ angular velocity, $\omega \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$

Hence, power, $\boldsymbol{P}=\boldsymbol{T} \omega$ watts
Angular velocity, $\omega=2 \pi n \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$ where $n$ is the speed in rev/s

Hence, power, $P=2 \pi n T$ watts
Sometimes power is in units of horsepower (hp), where
$$1 \text { horsepower }=745.7 \text { watts }$$
i.e.
$$1 \mathrm{hp}=745.7 \text { watts }$$

Problem 4. A constant force of 150 N is applied tangentially to a wheel of diameter 140 mm . Determine the work done, in joules, in 12 revolutions of the wheel.

Torque $\quad T=F r$, where $F=150 \mathrm{~N}$ and radius
$$r=\frac{140}{2}=70 \mathrm{~mm}=0.070 \mathrm{~m} .$$

Hence, torque $T=(150)(0.070)=10.5 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}$.
Work done $=T \theta$ joules, where torque,
$T=10.5 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}$ and angular displacement, $\theta=12$ revolutions $=12 \times 2 \pi \mathrm{rad}=24 \pi \mathrm{rad}$. Hence, work done $=(10.5)(24 \pi)=792 \mathrm{~J}$

Problem 5. Calculate the torque developed by a motor whose spindle is rotating at 1000 $\mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$ and developing a power of 2.50 kW .

Power $\quad P=2 \pi n T$ (from above), from which, torque, $\quad T=\frac{P}{2 \pi n} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}$
where power, $P=2.50 \mathrm{~kW}=2500 \mathrm{~W}$ and speed, $n=1000 / 60 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{s}$ Thus,
$$\text { torque, } \quad \begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{T} & =\frac{P}{2 \pi n}=\frac{2500}{2 \pi\left(\frac{1000}{60}\right)} \\
& =\frac{2500 \times 60}{2 \pi \times 1000}=\mathbf{2 3 . 8 7} \mathbf{~ N ~ m}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 6. An electric motor develops a power of 5 hp and a torque of 12.5 N m . Determine the speed of rotation of the motor in rev/min.

Power,
$$P=2 \pi n T, \text { from which, }$$
speed
$$n=\frac{P}{2 \pi T} \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{s}$$
where power,
$$\begin{aligned}
P & =5 \mathrm{hp}=5 \times 745.7 \\
& =3728.5 \mathrm{~W}
\end{aligned}$$
and
$$\text { torque } T=12.5 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m} \text {. }$$

Hence, speed $n=\frac{3728.5}{2 \pi(12.5)}=47.47 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{s}$
The speed of rotation of the motor
$$=47.47 \times 60=\mathbf{2 8 4 8} \mathbf{~ r e v} / \mathbf{m i n}$$

Problem 7. In a turning-tool test, the tangential cutting force is 50 N . If the mean diameter of the work-piece is 40 mm , calculate (a) the work done per revolution of the spindle, (b) the power required when the spindle speed is $300 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$.
(a) Work done $=T \theta$, where $T=F r$

Force $F=50 \mathrm{~N}$, radius $r=\frac{40}{2}=20 \mathrm{~mm}=$ 0.02 m and angular displacement, $\theta=1 \mathrm{rev}=$ $2 \pi \mathrm{rad}$.

Hence, work done per revolution of spindle $=\operatorname{Fr} \theta=(50)(0.02)(2 \pi)=6.28 \mathrm{~J}$
(b) Power, $P=2 \pi n T$, where torque, $T=F r=$ $(50)(0.02)=1 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}$ and speed, $n=\frac{300}{60}=$ $5 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{s}$.

Hence, power required, $\boldsymbol{P}=2 \pi(5)(1)$
$$=31.42 \mathrm{~W}$$

Problem 8. A pulley is 600 mm in diameter and the difference in tensions on the two sides of the driving belt is 1.5 kN . If the speed of the pulley is $500 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$, determine (a) the torque developed, and (b) the work done in 3 minutes.
(a) Torque $T=F r$, where force $F=1.5 \mathrm{kN}=$ 1500 N , and
radius $r=\frac{600}{2}=300 \mathrm{~mm}=0.3 \mathrm{~m}$.
Hence, torque developed $=(1500)(0.3)$
$$=450 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}$$
(b) Work done $=T \theta$, where torque $T=450 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}$ and angular displacement in 3 minutes
$=(3 \times 500) \mathrm{rev}=(3 \times 500 \times 2 \pi) \mathrm{rad}$.
Hence, work done $=(450)(3 \times 500 \times 2 \pi)=$ $4.24 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~J}=4.24 \mathrm{MJ}$

Problem 9. A motor connected to a shaft develops a torque of 5 kN m . Determine the number of revolutions made by the shaft if the work done is 9 MJ .

Work done $=T \theta$, from which, angular displacement,
$$\theta=\frac{\text { work done }}{\text { torque }}$$
and
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Work done } & =9 \mathrm{MJ}=9 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~J} \\
\text { torque } & =5 \mathrm{kN} \mathrm{~m}=5000 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m} .
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, angular displacement,
$$\theta=\frac{9 \times 10^{6}}{5000}=1800 \mathrm{rad}$$
$2 \pi \mathrm{rad}=1 \mathrm{rev}$, hence,
the number of revolutions made by the shaft
$$=\frac{1800}{2 \pi}=286.5 \mathrm{revs}$$

\subsection*{9.3 Kinetic energy and moment of inertia}

The tangential velocity $v$ of a particle of mass $m$ moving at an angular velocity $\omega \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$ at a radius $r$ metres (see Figure 9.4) is given by:
$$v=\omega r \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-020.jpg?height=287&width=347&top_left_y=601&top_left_x=896)

Figure 9.4

The kinetic energy of a particle of mass $m$ is given by:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Kinetic energy } & =\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} \text { (from Chapter 14) } \\
& =\frac{1}{2} m(\omega r)^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{m} \omega^{2} \boldsymbol{r}^{2} \text { joules }
\end{aligned}$$

The total kinetic energy of a system of masses rotating at different radii about a fixed axis but with the same angular velocity, as shown in Figure 9.5, is given by:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Total kinetic energy }= & \frac{1}{2} m_{1} \omega^{2} r_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} \omega^{2} r_{2}^{2} \\
& +\frac{1}{2} m_{3} \omega^{2} r_{3}^{2} \\
= & \left(m_{1} r_{1}^{2}+m_{2} r_{2}^{2}+m_{3} r_{3}^{2}\right) \frac{\omega^{2}}{2}
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-020.jpg?height=326&width=479&top_left_y=1855&top_left_x=899)

Figure 9.5

In general, this may be written as:
$$\text { Total kinetic energy }=\left(\sum m r^{2}\right) \frac{\omega^{2}}{2}=\mathbf{I} \frac{\boldsymbol{\omega}^{2}}{\mathbf{2}}$$
where $I\left(=\Sigma m r^{2}\right)$ is called the moment of inertia of the system about the axis of rotation and has units of $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{2}$.
The moment of inertia of a system is a measure of the amount of work done to give the system an angular velocity of $\omega \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$, or the amount of work that can be done by a system turning at $\omega \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$.
From Section 9.2, work done $=T \theta$, and if this work is available to increase the kinetic energy of a rotating body of moment of inertia $I$, then:
$$T \theta=I\left(\frac{\omega_{2}^{2}-\omega_{1}^{2}}{2}\right)$$
where $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ are the initial and final angular velocities, i.e.
$$T \theta=I\left(\frac{\omega_{2}+\omega_{1}}{2}\right)\left(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1}\right)$$

However,
$$\left(\frac{\omega_{2}+\omega_{1}}{2}\right)$$
is the mean angular velocity, i.e. $\frac{\theta}{t}$, where $t$ is the time, and $\left(\omega_{2}-\omega_{1}\right)$ is the change in angular velocity, i.e. $\alpha t$, where $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration. Hence,
$$T \theta=I\left(\frac{\theta}{t}\right)(\alpha t)$$
from which, torque $\boldsymbol{T}=\boldsymbol{I} \boldsymbol{\alpha}$
where $I$ is the moment of inertia in $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{2}, \alpha$ is the angular acceleration in $\mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ and $T$ is the torque in N m .

Problem 10. A shaft system has a moment of inertia of $37.5 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Determine the torque required to give it an angular acceleration of $5.0 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

Torque, $T=I \alpha$, where moment of inertia $I=$ $37.5 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and angular acceleration, $\alpha=5.0 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. Hence, torque, $\boldsymbol{T}=(37.5)(5.0)=\mathbf{1 8 7 . 5} \mathbf{~ N ~ m}$

Problem 11. A shaft has a moment of inertia of $31.4 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. What angular acceleration of the shaft would be produced by an accelerating torque of 495 N m ?

Torque, $T=I \alpha$, from which, angular acceleration, $\alpha=\frac{T}{I}$, where torque, $T=495 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}$ and moment of inertia $I=31.4 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.
Hence, angular acceleration,
$$\alpha=\frac{495}{31.4}=15.76 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$$

Problem 12. A body of mass 100 g is fastened to a wheel and rotates in a circular path of 500 mm in diameter. Determine the increase in kinetic energy of the body when the speed of the wheel increases from 450 $\mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$ to $750 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$.

From above, kinetic energy $=I \frac{\omega^{2}}{2}$ Thus, increase in kinetic energy $=I\left(\frac{\omega_{2}^{2}-\omega_{1}^{2}}{2}\right)$ where moment of inertia, $I=m r^{2}$, mass, $m=100 \mathrm{~g}=0.1 \mathrm{~kg}$ and radius,
$$r=\frac{500}{2}=250 \mathrm{~mm}=0.25 \mathrm{~m}$$

Initial angular velocity,
$$\begin{aligned}
\omega_{1} & =450 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}=\frac{450 \times 2 \pi}{60} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =47.12 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$
and final angular velocity,
$$\begin{aligned}
\omega_{2} & =750 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}=\frac{750 \times 2 \pi}{60} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =78.54 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, increase in kinetic energy
$$\begin{aligned}
& =I\left(\frac{\omega_{2}^{2}-\omega_{1}^{2}}{2}\right)=\left(m r^{2}\right)\left(\frac{\omega_{2}^{2}-\omega_{1}^{2}}{2}\right) \\
& =(0.1)\left(0.25^{2}\right)\left(\frac{78.54^{2}-47.12^{2}}{2}\right)=\mathbf{1 2 . 3 4} \mathbf{~ J}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 13. A system consists of three small masses rotating at the same speed about the same fixed axis. The masses and their radii of rotation are: 15 g at 250 mm , 20 g at 180 mm and 30 g at 200 mm . Determine (a) the moment of inertia of the system about the given axis, and (b) the kinetic energy in the system if the speed of rotation is $1200 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$.
(a) Moment of inertia of the system, $I=\Sigma m r^{2}$
$$\text { i.e. } \quad \begin{aligned}
I= & {\left[\left(15 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg}\right)(0.25 \mathrm{~m})^{2}\right] } \\
& +\left[\left(20 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg}\right)(0.18 \mathrm{~m})^{2}\right] \\
& +\left[\left(30 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg}\right)(0.20 \mathrm{~m})^{2}\right] \\
= & \left(9.375 \times 10^{-4}\right)+\left(6.48 \times 10^{-4}\right) \\
& +\left(12 \times 10^{-4}\right) \\
= & 27.855 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
= & \mathbf{2} .7855 \times \mathbf{1 0}^{-3} \mathbf{k g ~ m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) Kinetic energy $=I \frac{\omega^{2}}{2}$, where moment of inertia, $I=2.7855 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and angular velocity,
$$\omega=2 \pi n=2 \pi\left(\frac{1200}{60}\right) \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}=40 \pi \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$$

Hence, kinetic energy in the system
$$=\left(2.7855 \times 10^{-3}\right) \frac{(40 \pi)^{2}}{2}=\mathbf{2 1 . 9 9} \mathbf{~ J}$$

Problem 14. A shaft with its rotating parts has a moment of inertia of $20 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. It is accelerated from rest by an accelerating torque of 45 N m . Determine the speed of the shaft in rev/min (a) after 15 s , and (b) after the first 5 revolutions.
(a) Since torque $T=I \alpha$, then angular acceleration, $\alpha=\frac{T}{I}=\frac{45}{20}=2.25 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

The angular velocity of the shaft is initially zero, i.e. $\omega_{1}=0$.

From chapter 11, page 129, the angular velocity after 15 s ,
$$\begin{aligned}
\omega_{2} & =\omega_{1}+\alpha t=0+(2.25)(15) \\
& =33.75 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s},
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. speed of shaft after 15 s
$$=(33.75)\left(\frac{60}{2 \pi}\right) \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}=322.3 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$$
(b) Work done $=T \theta$, where torque $T=45 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}$ and angular displacement $\theta=5$ revolutions $=$ $5 \times 2 \pi=10 \pi \mathrm{rad}$.
Hence work done $=(45)(10 \pi)=1414 \mathrm{~J}$.
This work done results in an increase in kinetic energy, given by $I \frac{\omega^{2}}{2}$, where moment of inertia $I=20 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and $\omega=$ angular velocity.

Hence, $1414=(20)\left(\frac{\omega^{2}}{2}\right)$ from which,
$\omega=\sqrt{\left(\frac{1414 \times 2}{20}\right)}=11.89 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$
i.e. speed of shaft after the first $\mathbf{5}$ revolutions
$$\begin{aligned}
& =11.89 \times \frac{60}{2 \pi} \\
& =\mathbf{1 1 3 . 5 ~ r e v} / \mathbf{m i n}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 15. The accelerating torque on a turbine rotor is 250 N m .
(a) Determine the gain in kinetic energy of the rotor while it turns through 100 revolutions (neglecting any frictional and other resisting torques).
(b) If the moment of inertia of the rotor is $25 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and the speed at the beginning of the 100 revolutions is $450 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$, determine its speed at the end.
(a) The kinetic energy gained is equal to the work done by the accelerating torque of 250 N m over 100 revolutions,
i.e. gain in kinetic energy $=$ work done $=$ $T \theta=(250)(100 \times 2 \pi)=\mathbf{1 5 7 . 0 8} \mathbf{~ k J}$
(b) Initial kinetic energy is given by:
$$I \frac{\omega_{1}^{2}}{2}=\frac{(25)\left(\frac{450 \times 2 \pi}{60}\right)^{2}}{2}=27.76 \mathrm{~kJ}$$

The final kinetic energy is the sum of the initial kinetic energy and the kinetic energy gained,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { i.e. } \\
& \text { Hence, } \quad \begin{aligned}
I \frac{\omega_{2}^{2}}{2} & =27.76 \mathrm{~kJ}+157.08 \mathrm{~kJ} \\
& =184.84 \mathrm{~kJ} . \\
\frac{(25) \omega_{2}^{2}}{2} & =184840 \\
\text { from which, } \quad & \omega_{2} \\
& =\sqrt{\left(\frac{184840 \times 2}{25}\right)} \\
& =121.6 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s} .
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, speed at end of $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ revolutions
$$=\frac{121.6 \times 60}{2 \pi} \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}=1161 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$$

Problem 16. A shaft with its associated rotating parts has a moment of inertia of $55.4 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Determine the uniform torque required to accelerate the shaft from rest to a speed of $1650 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$ while it turns through 12 revolutions.

From above, $T \theta=I\left(\frac{\omega_{2}^{2}-\omega_{1}^{2}}{2}\right)$
where angular displacement $\theta=12 \mathrm{rev}=12 \times$ $2 \pi=24 \pi \mathrm{rad}$, final speed, $\omega_{2}=1650 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}=$ $\frac{1650}{60} \times 2 \pi=172.79 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$, initial speed, $\omega_{1}=0$, and moment of inertia, $I=55.4 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.

Hence, torque required,
$$\begin{aligned}
T & =\left(\frac{I}{\theta}\right)\left(\frac{\omega_{2}^{2}-\omega_{1}^{2}}{2}\right)=\left(\frac{55.4}{24 \pi}\right)\left(\frac{172.79^{2}-0^{2}}{2}\right) \\
& =10.97 \mathrm{kN} \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{9.4 Power transmission and efficiency}

A common and simple method of transmitting power from one shaft to another is by means of a belt passing over pulley wheels which are keyed to the shafts, as shown in Figure 9.6. Typical applications include an electric motor driving a lathe or a drill, and an engine driving a pump or generator.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-024.jpg?height=335&width=735&top_left_y=1269&top_left_x=96)

Figure 9.6
For a belt to transmit power between two pulleys there must be a difference in tensions in the belt on either side of the driving and driven pulleys. For the direction of rotation shown in Figure 9.6, $F_{2}>F_{1}$

The torque $T$ available at the driving wheel to do work is given by:
$$T=\left(F_{2}-F_{1}\right) r_{x} \times \mathrm{m}$$
and the available power $P$ is given by:
$$P=T \omega=\left(F_{2}-F_{1}\right) r_{x} \omega_{x} \text { watts }$$

From Section 9.3, the linear velocity of a point on the driver wheel, $v_{\mathrm{x}}=r_{\mathrm{x}} \omega_{x}$
Similarly, the linear velocity of a point on the driven wheel, $v_{y}=r_{y} \omega_{y}$.
Assuming no slipping, $v_{x}=v_{y}$ i.e. $r_{x} \omega_{x}=r_{y} \omega_{y}$ Hence
$$r_{x}\left(2 \pi n_{x}\right)=r_{y}\left(2 \pi n_{y}\right)$$
$$\begin{gathered}
\text { from which, } \\
\text { Percentage efficiency }=\frac{\frac{r_{x}}{r_{y}}=\frac{n_{y}}{n_{x}}}{\text { energy output }} \times 100 \\
\text { or } \quad \text { efficiency }=\frac{\text { power output }}{\text { power input }} \times \mathbf{1 0 0 \%}
\end{gathered}$$

Problem 17. An electric motor has an efficiency of $75 \%$ when running at 1450 $\mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$. Determine the output torque when the power input is 3.0 kW .
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Efficiency } & =\frac{\text { power output }}{\text { power input }} \times 100 \% \text { hence } \\
75 & =\frac{\text { power output }}{3000} \times 100
\end{aligned}$$
from which, power output $=\frac{75}{100} \times 3000$ $=2250 \mathrm{~W}$.
From Section 9.2, power output, $P=2 \pi n T$, from which torque,
where
$$\begin{aligned}
T & =\frac{P}{2 \pi n} \\
n & =(1450 / 60) \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, output torque $=\frac{2250}{2 \pi\left(\frac{1450}{60}\right)}$
$$=14.82 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}$$

Problem 18. A 15 kW motor is driving a shaft at $1150 \mathrm{rev} / \mathrm{min}$ by means of pulley wheels and a belt. The tensions in the belt on each side of the driver pulley wheel are 400 N and 50 N . The diameters of the driver and driven pulley wheels are 500 mm and 750 mm respectively. Determine (a) the
efficiency of the motor, (b) the speed of the driven pulley wheel.
(a) From above, power output from motor
$=\left(F_{2}-F_{1}\right) r_{x} \omega_{x}$
Force $F_{2}=400 \mathrm{~N}$ and $F_{1}=50 \mathrm{~N}$, hence $\left(F_{2}-F_{1}\right)=350 \mathrm{~N}$,
$$\text { radius } r_{x}=\frac{500}{2}=250 \mathrm{~mm}=0.25 \mathrm{~m}$$
and angular velocity,
$$\omega_{x}=\frac{1150 \times 2 \pi}{60} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$$

Hence power output from motor $=\left(F_{2}-F_{1}\right) r_{x} \omega_{x}$
$$=(350)(0.25)\left(\frac{1150 \times 2 \pi}{60}\right)=10.54 \mathrm{~kW}$$

Power input $=15 \mathrm{~kW}$
Hence, efficiency of the motor
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{\text { power output }}{\text { power input }} \\
& =\frac{10.54}{15} \times 100=\mathbf{7 0 . 2 7 \%}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) From above, $\frac{r_{x}}{r_{y}}=\frac{n_{y}}{n_{x}}$ from which, speed of driven pulley wheels,
$$\boldsymbol{n}_{y}=\frac{n_{x} r_{x}}{r_{y}}=\frac{1150 \times 0.25}{\frac{0.750}{2}}=\mathbf{7 6 7} \mathbf{r e v} / \mathbf{m i n}$$

Problem 19. A crane lifts a load of mass 5 tonne to a height of 25 m . If the overall efficiency of the crane is $65 \%$ and the input power to the hauling motor is 100 kW , determine how long the lifting operation takes.

The increase in potential energy is the work done and is given by mgh (see Chapter 14), where mass, $m=5 t=5000 \mathrm{~kg}, g=9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ and height $h=25 \mathrm{~m}$.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Hence, work done }=m g h & =(5000)(9.81)(25) \\
& =1.226 \mathrm{MJ}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Input power } & =100 \mathrm{~kW}=100000 \mathrm{~W} \\
\text { Efficiency } & =\frac{\text { output power }}{\text { input power }} \times 100 \\
65 & =\frac{\text { output power }}{100000} \times 100
\end{aligned}$$
from which, output power $=\frac{65}{100} \times 100000=65000 \mathrm{~W}=\frac{\text { work done }}{\text { time taken }}$
Thus, time taken for lifting operation
$$=\frac{\text { work done }}{\text { output power }}=\frac{1.226 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~J}}{65000 \mathrm{~W}}=\mathbf{1 8 . 8 6 ~ s}$$

Problem 20. The tool of a shaping machine has a mean cutting speed of $250 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{s}$ and the average cutting force on the tool in a certain shaping operation is 1.2 kN . If the power input to the motor driving the machine is 0.75 kW , determine the overall efficiency of the machine.

Velocity, $v=250 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{s}=0.25 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and force $F=1.2 \mathrm{kN}=1200 \mathrm{~N}$
From Chapter 14, power output required at the cutting tool (i.e. power output),
$P=$ force $\times$ velocity $=1200 \mathrm{~N} \times 0.25 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
$$=300 \mathrm{~W}$$

Power input $=0.75 \mathrm{~kW}=750 \mathrm{~W}$
Hence, efficiency of the machine
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{\text { output power }}{\text { input power }} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{300}{750} \times 100=\mathbf{4 0 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 21. Calculate the input power of the motor driving a train at a constant speed of $72 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ on a level track, if the efficiency of the motor is $80 \%$ and the resistance due to friction is 20 kN .

Force resisting motion $=20 \mathrm{kN}=20000 \mathrm{~N}$ and velocity $=72 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}=\frac{72}{3.6}=20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$

Output power from motor
$=$ resistive force $\times$ velocity of train
(from Chapter 14)
$=20000 \times 20=400 \mathrm{~kW}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Efficiency }=\frac{\text { power output }}{\text { power input }} \times 100 \\
& \text { hence } 80=\frac{400}{\text { power input }} \times 100
\end{aligned}$$
from which, power input $=400 \times \frac{100}{80}$
$=500 \mathrm{~kW}$

\subsection*{15.1 Introduction to friction}

When an object, such as a block of wood, is placed on a floor and sufficient force is applied to the block, the force being parallel to the floor, the block slides across the floor. When the force is removed, motion of the block stops; thus there is a force which resists sliding. This force is called dynamic or sliding friction. A force may be applied to the block, which is insufficient to move it. In this case, the force resisting motion is called the static friction or stiction. Thus there are two categories into which a frictional force may be split:
(i) dynamic or sliding friction force which occurs when motion is taking place, and
(ii) static friction force which occurs before motion takes place.

There are three factors that affect the size and direction of frictional forces.
(i) The size of the frictional force depends on the type of surface (a block of wood slides more easily on a polished metal surface than on a rough concrete surface).
(ii) The size of the frictional force depends on the size of the force acting at right angles to the surfaces in contact, called the normal force; thus, if the weight of a block of wood is doubled, the frictional force is doubled when it is sliding on the same surface
(iii) The direction of the frictional force is always opposite to the direction of motion. Thus the frictional force opposes motion, as shown in Figure 15.1.

Figure 15.1

\subsection*{15.2 Coefficient of friction}

The coefficient of friction, $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, is a measure of the amount of friction existing between two surfaces. A low value of coefficient of friction indicates that the force required for sliding to occur is less than the force required when the coefficient of friction is high. The value of the coefficient of friction is given by:
$$\mu=\frac{\text { frictional force }(F)}{\text { normal force }(N)}$$

Transposing gives:
frictional force $=\mu \times$ normal force,
i.e. $\quad F=\mu N$

The direction of the forces given in this equation is as shown in Figure 15.2.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-029.jpg?height=347&width=630&top_left_y=547&top_left_x=96)

Figure 15.2

The coefficient of friction is the ratio of a force to a force, and hence has no units. Typical values for the coefficient of friction when sliding is occurring, i.e. the dynamic coefficient of friction, are:

For polished oiled metal surfaces less than 0.1
For glass on glass 0.4

For rubber on tarmac
close to 1.0
The coefficient of friction ( $\mu$ ) for dynamic friction is, in general, a little less than that for static friction. However, for dynamic friction, $\mu$ increases with speed; additionally, it is dependent on the area of the surface in contact.

Problem 1. A block of steel requires a force of 10.4 N applied parallel to a steel plate to keep it moving with constant velocity across the plate. If the normal force between the block and the plate is 40 N , determine the dynamic coefficient of friction.

As the block is moving at constant velocity, the force applied must be that required to overcome frictional forces, i.e. frictional force, $F=10.4 \mathrm{~N}$; the normal force is 40 N , and since $F=\mu N$,
$$\mu=\frac{F}{N}=\frac{10.4}{40}=0.26$$
i.e. the dynamic coefficient of friction is $\mathbf{0 . 2 6}$

Problem 2. The surface between the steel block and plate of Problem 1 is now lubricated and the dynamic coefficient of friction falls to 0.12 . Find the new value of force required to push the block at a constant speed.

The normal force depends on the weight of the block and remains unaltered at 40 N . The new value of the dynamic coefficient of friction is 0.12 and since the frictional force $F=\mu N, F=0.12 \times 40=4.8 \mathrm{~N}$.

The block is sliding at constant speed, thus the force required to overcome the frictional force is also 4.8 N , i.e. the required applied force is 4.8 N .

Problem 3. The material of a brake is being tested and it is found that the dynamic coefficient of friction between the material and steel is 0.91. Calculate the normal force when the frictional force is 0.728 kN .

The dynamic coefficient of friction, $\mu=0.91$ and the frictional force, $F=0.728 \mathrm{kN}=728 \mathrm{~N}$ Since $F=\mu N$, then normal force,
$$N=\frac{F}{\mu}=\frac{728}{0.91}=800 \mathrm{~N}$$
i.e. the normal force is 800 N .

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

[(a) 675 N
(b) 652.5 N ]

\subsection*{15.3 Applications of friction}

In some applications, a low coefficient of friction is desirable, for example, in bearings, pistons moving within cylinders, on ski runs, and so on. However, for such applications as force being transmitted by belt drives and braking systems, a high value of coefficient is necessary.

Problem 4. State three advantages, and three disadvantages of frictional forces.

Instances where frictional forces are an advantage include:
(i) Almost all fastening devices rely on frictional forces to keep them in place once secured, examples being screws, nails, nuts, clips and clamps.
(ii) Satisfactory operation of brakes and clutches rely on frictional forces being present.
(iii) In the absence of frictional forces, most accelerations along a horizontal surface are impossible; for example, a person's shoes just slip when walking is attempted and the tyres of a car just rotate with no forward motion of the car being experienced.

Disadvantages of frictional forces include:
(i) Energy is wasted in the bearings associated with shafts, axles and gears due to heat being generated.
(ii) Wear is caused by friction, for example, in shoes, brake lining materials and bearings.
(iii) Energy is wasted when motion through air occurs (it is much easier to cycle with the wind rather than against it).

Problem 5. Discuss briefly two design implications that arise due to frictional forces and how lubrication may or may not help.
(i) Bearings are made of an alloy called white metal, which has a relatively low melting point. When the rotating shaft rubs on the white metal bearing, heat is generated by friction, often in one spot and the white metal may melt in this area, rendering the bearing useless. Adequate lubrication (oil or grease) separates the shaft from the white metal, keeps the coefficient of friction small and prevents damage to the bearing. For very large bearings, oil is pumped under pressure into the bearing and the oil is used to remove the heat generated, often passing through oil coolers before being re-circulated. Designers should ensure that the heat generated by friction can be dissipated.
(ii) Wheels driving belts, to transmit force from one place to another, are used in many workshops. The coefficient of friction between the wheel and the belt must be high, and it may be increased by dressing the belt with a tar-like substance. Since frictional force is proportional to the normal force, a slipping belt is made more efficient by tightening it, thus increasing the normal and hence the frictional force. Designers should incorporate some belt tension mechanism into the design of such a system.

Problem 6. Explain what is meant by the terms (a) the limiting or static coefficient of friction, and (b) the sliding or dynamic coefficient of friction.
(a) When an object is placed on a surface and a force is applied to it in a direction parallel to the surface, if no movement takes place, then the applied force is balanced exactly by the frictional force. As the size of the applied force is increased, a value is reached such that the object is just on the point of moving. The limiting or static coefficient of friction is given by the ratio of this applied force to the normal force, where the normal force is the force acting at right angles to the surfaces in contact.
(b) Once the applied force is sufficient to overcome the stiction its value can be reduced slightly and the object moves across the surface. A particular value of the applied force is then sufficient to keep the object moving at a constant velocity. The sliding or dynamic coefficient of friction is the ratio of the applied force, to maintain constant velocity, to the normal force.

\subsection*{15.4 Friction on an inclined plane}

\section*{Angle of repose}

Consider a mass $m$ lying on an inclined plane, as shown in Figure 15.3. If the direction of motion of this mass is down the plane, then the frictional force $F$ will act up the plane, as shown in Figure 15.3, where $F=\mu m g$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-031.jpg?height=402&width=564&top_left_y=640&top_left_x=88)

Figure 15.3

Now the weight of the mass is mg and this will cause two other forces to act on the mass, namely $N$, and the component of the weight down the plane, namely $m g \sin \theta$, as shown by the vector diagram of Figure 15.4.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-031.jpg?height=428&width=592&top_left_y=1451&top_left_x=96)

Figure 15.4 Components of mg

It should be noted that N acts normal to the surface. Resolving forces parallel to the plane gives:

Forces up the plane $=$ forces down the plane
i.e. $\quad F=m g \sin \theta$

Resolving force perpendicular to the plane gives:
Forces 'up' = forces 'down'
i.e. $\quad N=m g \cos \theta$

Dividing equation (15.1) by (15.2) gives:
$$\frac{F}{N}=\frac{m g \sin \theta}{m g \cos \theta}=\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}=\tan \theta$$

But $\frac{F}{N}=\mu$, hence, $\tan \theta=\mu$
where $\mu=$ the coefficient of friction, and $\theta=$ the angle of repose.

If $\theta$ is gradually increased until the body starts motion down the plane, then this value of $\theta$ is called the limiting angle of repose. A laboratory experiment based on the theory is a useful method of obtaining the maximum value of $\mu$ for static friction.

\subsection*{15.5 Motion up a plane with the pulling force $P$ parallel to the plane}

In this case the frictional force $F$ acts down the plane, opposite to the direction of motion of the body, as shown in Figure 15.5.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-031.jpg?height=376&width=563&top_left_y=1405&top_left_x=893)

Figure 15.5

The components of the weight mg will be the same as that shown in Figure 15.4.
Resolving forces parallel to the plane gives:
$$P=m g \sin \theta+F$$

Resolving forces perpendicular to the plane gives:
$$N=m g \cos \theta$$

For limiting friction,
$$F=\mu N$$

From equations (15.3) to (15.5), solutions of problems in this category that involve limiting friction can be solved.

Problem 7. Determine the value of the force $P$, which will just move the body of mass of 25 kg up the plane shown in Figure 15.6. It may be assumed that the coefficient of limiting friction, $\mu=0.3$ and $g=9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-032.jpg?height=224&width=544&top_left_y=772&top_left_x=144)

Figure 15.6

From equation (15.4),
$$\begin{aligned}
N & =25 \times 9.81 \times \cos 15^{\circ} \\
& =245.3 \times 0.966=\mathbf{2 3 6 . 9} \mathbf{~ N}
\end{aligned}$$

From equation (15.5),
$$F=0.3 \times 236.9=71.1 \mathrm{~N}$$

From equation (15.3),
$$\begin{aligned}
P & =25 \times 9.81 \times \sin 15^{\circ}+71.1 \\
& =63.48+71.1
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. force, $\boldsymbol{P}=\mathbf{1 3 4 . 6} \mathbf{~ N}$

\subsection*{15.6 Motion down a plane with the pulling force $\boldsymbol{P}$ parallel to the plane}

In this case, the frictional force $F$ acts up the plane, opposite to the direction of motion of the plane, as shown in Figure 15.7.
The components of the weight mg are shown in Figure 15.4, where it can be seen that the normal reaction, $N=m g \cos \theta$, and the component of weight parallel to and down the plane $=m g \sin \theta$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-032.jpg?height=373&width=625&top_left_y=169&top_left_x=896)

Figure 15.7

Resolving forces perpendicular to the plane gives:
$$N=m g \cos \theta$$

Resolving forces parallel to the plane gives:
$$P+m g \sin \theta=F$$

When the friction is limiting,
$$F=\mu N$$

From equations (15.7) to (15.9), problems arising in this category can be solved.

Problem 8. If the mass of Problem 7 were subjected to the force $P$, which acts parallel to and down the plane, as shown in Figure 15.7, determine the value of $P$ to just move the body.

From equation (15.7),
$$N=25 \times 9.81 \cos 15^{\circ}=236.9 \mathbf{N}$$

From equation (15.9),
$$\boldsymbol{F}=0.3 \times 236.9=\mathbf{7 1 . 1 ~ N}$$

From equation (15.8),
$$P+25 \times 9.81 \sin 15^{\circ}=71.1$$
i.e.
$$P+63.5=71.1$$
from which,
$$\text { force, } \boldsymbol{P}=71.1-63.5=\mathbf{7 . 6} \mathbf{~ N}$$

From equations (15.6) and (15.10), it can be seen that the force required to move a body down the
plane is so much smaller than to move the body up the plane.

\subsection*{15.7 Motion up a plane due to a horizontal force $P$}

This motion, together with the primary forces, is shown in Figure 15.8.
In this, the components of mg are as shown in Figure 15.4, and the components of the horizontal force $P$ are shown by the vector diagram of Figure 15.9.

Figure 15.9

Resolving perpendicular to the plane gives:
Forces 'up' = forces 'down'
i.e.
$$N=m g \cos \theta+P \sin \theta$$

Resolving parallel to the plane gives:
$$P \cos \theta=F+m g \sin \theta$$
and
$$F=\mu N$$

From equations (15.11) to (15.13), problems arising in this category can be solved.

Problem 9. If the mass of Problem 7 were subjected to a horizontal force $P$, as shown
in Figure 15.8, determine the value of $P$ that will just cause motion up the plane.

Substituting equation (15.13) into equation (12) gives:
or
$$P \cos \theta=\mu N+m g \sin \theta$$
i.e. $\quad N=\frac{P \cos \theta}{\mu}-\frac{m g \sin \theta}{\mu}$

Equating equation (15.11) and equation (15.14) gives:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \qquad m g \cos \theta+P \sin \theta=\frac{P \cos \theta}{\mu}-\frac{m g \sin \theta}{\mu} \\
& \text { i.e. } \quad \begin{aligned}

&=\frac{P \cos 15^{\circ}}{0.3}-\frac{25 \times 9.81 \sin 15^{\circ}}{0.3} \\
& 245.3 \times 0.966+P \times 0.259 \\
&=\frac{P \times 0.966}{0.3}-\frac{245.3 \times 0.259}{0.3} \\
& \text { from which, } \\
& \text { and } \qquad \begin{aligned}
237+0.259 P & =3.22 P-211.8

Figure 15.11

The components for $m g$ are shown by the phasor diagram of Figure 15.4, and the components for $P$ are shown by the vector diagram of Figure 15.11. Resolving forces down the plane gives:
$$P \cos \theta+m g \sin \theta=F$$

Resolving forces perpendicular to the plane gives:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Forces up } & =\text { forces do } \\
N+P \sin \theta & =m g \cos \theta \\
F & =\mu N
\end{aligned}$$
and

Substituting equation (15.17) into equation (15.15) gives:
$$P \cos \theta+m g \sin \theta=\mu N$$
from which, $\quad N=\frac{P \cos \theta}{\mu}+\frac{m g \sin \theta}{\mu}$

From equation (15.16),
$$N=m g \cos \theta-P \sin \theta$$

Equating equations (15.18) and (15.19) gives
$$\frac{P \cos \theta}{\mu}+\frac{m g \sin \theta}{\mu}=m g \cos \theta-P \sin \theta$$
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{P \cos 15^{\circ}}{0.3} & +\frac{25 \times 9.81 \sin 15^{\circ}}{0.3} \\
& =25 \times 9.81 \cos 15^{\circ}-P \sin 15^{\circ}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
3.22 P+211.6 & =236.9-0.259 P \\
P(3.22+0.259) & =236.9-211.6 \\
3.479 P & =25.3
\end{aligned}$$
from which,
$$\text { force } P=\frac{25.3}{3.479}=7.27 \mathrm{~N}$$

Problem 11. If in Problem 9, the contact surfaces were greased, so that the value of $\mu$ decreased and $P=50 \mathrm{~N}$, determine the value of $\mu$ which will just cause motion down the plane.

The primary forces for this problem are shown in Figure 15.12, where it can be seen that $F$ is opposite to the direction of motion.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-034.jpg?height=316&width=537&top_left_y=596&top_left_x=904)

Figure 15.12

Resolving forces perpendicular to the plane gives:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Forces 'up' } & =\text { forces 'down' } \\
N & =m g \cos \theta+P \sin \theta
\end{aligned}$$

Resolving forces parallel to the plane gives:
$$m g \sin \theta=F+P \cos \theta$$
and
$$F=\mu N$$

Substituting equation (15.22) into equation (15.21) gives:
$$m g \sin \theta=\mu N+P \cos \theta$$

Substituting equation (15.20) into equation (15.23) gives:
$$m g \sin \theta=\mu(m g \cos \theta+P \sin \theta)+P \cos \theta$$
i.e. $\quad 25 \times 9.81 \sin 15^{\circ}=\mu\left(25 \times 9.81 \cos 15^{\circ}\right.$
$$\left.+50 \sin 15^{\circ}\right)+50 \cos 15^{\circ}$$

Hence
$$63.48=\mu(236.89+12.94)+48.3$$
$$63.48-48.3=\mu \times 249.83$$
from which, $\quad \boldsymbol{\mu}=\frac{15.18}{249.83}=\mathbf{0 . 0 6 1}$

\subsection*{15.8 The efficiency of a screw jack}

Screw jacks (see Section 18.4, page 202) are often used to lift weights; one of their most common uses are to raise cars, so that their wheels can be changed. The theory described in Section 15.7 can be used to analyse screw jacks.

Consider the thread of the square-threaded screw jack shown in Figure 15.15.

Let $p$ be the pitch of the thread, i.e. the axial distance that the weight $W$ is lifted or lowered when the screw is turned through one complete revolution. From Figure 15.15, the motion of the screw in lifting the weight can be regarded as pulling the weight by a horizontal force $P$, up an incline $\theta$, where
$$\tan \theta=\frac{p}{\pi d}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-036.jpg?height=561&width=724&top_left_y=157&top_left_x=94)

Figure 15.15
as shown in Figure 15.15, and
$$d=\frac{\left(D_{1}+D_{2}\right)}{2}$$

If $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction up the slope, then let $\tan \lambda=\mu$.
Referring now to Figure 15.16, the screw jack can be analysed.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-036.jpg?height=304&width=491&top_left_y=1263&top_left_x=100)

Figure 15.16

Resolving normal to the plane gives:
$$N=W \cos \theta+P \sin \theta$$

Resolving parallel to the plane gives:
$$P \cos \theta=F+W \sin \theta$$
and
$$F=\mu N$$

Substituting equation (15.26) into equation (15.25) gives:
$$P \cos \theta=\mu N+W \sin \theta$$

Substituting equation (15.24) into equation (15.27) gives:
$$P \cos \theta=\mu(W \cos \theta+P \sin \theta)+W \sin \theta$$

Dividing each term by $\cos \theta$ and remembering that $\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}=\tan \theta$ gives:
$$P=\mu(W+P \tan \theta)+W \tan \theta$$

Rearranging gives:
$$P(1-\mu \tan \theta)=W(\mu+\tan \theta)$$
from which,
$$\begin{aligned}
P & =\frac{W(\mu+\tan \theta)}{(1-\mu \tan \theta)} \\
& =\frac{W(\tan \lambda+\tan \theta)}{(1-\tan \lambda \tan \theta)}
\end{aligned}$$
since $\mu=\tan \lambda$
However, from compound angle formulae,

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
\tan (\lambda+\theta) & =\frac{(\tan \lambda+\tan \theta)}{(1-\tan \lambda \tan \theta)} \\
P & =W \tan (\theta+\lambda)
\end{aligned}$$

However, from Figure 15.15,
$$\begin{aligned}
\tan \theta & =\frac{p}{\pi d} \\
\text { hence } \quad P & =\frac{W\left(\mu+\frac{p}{\pi d}\right)}{\left(1-\frac{\mu p}{\pi d}\right)}
\end{aligned}$$

Multiplying top and bottom of equation (15.29) by $\pi d$ gives:
$$P=\frac{W(\mu \pi d+p)}{(\pi d-\mu p)}$$

The useful work done in lifting the weight $W$ a distance of $p$
$$=W p$$

From Figure 15.15, the actual work done
$$\begin{aligned}
& =P \times \pi d \\
& =\frac{W(\mu \pi d+p)}{(\pi d-\mu p)} \times \pi d
\end{aligned}$$

Efficiency $\eta=\frac{\text { useful work done }}{\text { actual work done }}$
which is usually expressed as a percentage
$$\text { i.e. } \begin{aligned}
\eta & =\frac{W p}{\frac{W(\mu \pi d+p) \times \pi d}{(\pi d-\mu p)}} \\
& =\frac{p(\pi d-\mu p)}{(\mu \pi d+p) \times \pi d}
\end{aligned}$$

Dividing throughout by $\pi d$ gives:
$$\begin{aligned}
\eta & =\frac{p\left(1-\frac{\mu p}{\pi d}\right)}{(\mu \pi d+p)} \\
& =\frac{p(1-\tan \lambda \tan \theta)}{\pi d\left(\mu+\frac{p}{\pi d}\right)} \\
& =\frac{p(1-\tan \lambda \tan \theta)}{\pi d(\tan \lambda+\tan \theta)}
\end{aligned}$$

However,
$$\tan (\lambda+\theta)=\frac{\tan \lambda+\tan \theta}{(1-\tan \lambda \tan \theta)}$$
from compound angle formulae
Hence,
$$\eta=\frac{p}{\pi d} \frac{1}{\tan (\lambda+\theta)}$$
but
$$\frac{p}{\pi d}=\tan \theta$$
hence, efficiency,
$$\eta=\frac{\tan \theta}{\tan (\lambda+\theta)}$$

From equations (15.31) and (15.32),
the work lost in friction
$$=\frac{W(\mu \pi d+p)}{(\pi d-\mu p)} \times \pi d-W p$$

Problem 12. The coefficient of friction on the sliding surface of a screw jack is 0.2 . If the pitch equals 1 cm , and $D_{1}=4 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $D_{2}=5 \mathrm{~cm}$, calculate the efficiency of the screw jack.

Working in millimetres,
$$\begin{aligned}
& d=\frac{\left(D_{1}+D_{2}\right)}{2}=\frac{(40+50)}{2}=45 \mathrm{~mm} \\
& p=1 \mathrm{~cm}=10 \mathrm{~mm} \\
& \quad \tan \theta=\frac{p}{\pi d}=\frac{10}{\pi \times 45}=0.0707
\end{aligned}$$
from which, $\quad \theta=\tan ^{-1}(0.0707)=4.05^{\circ}$, and
$$\tan \lambda=\mu=0.2$$
from which, $\quad \lambda=\tan ^{-1}(0.2)=11.31^{\circ}$
From equation (15.33),
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { efficiency } \boldsymbol{\eta} & =\frac{\tan \theta}{\tan (\lambda+\theta)} \\
& =\frac{0.0707}{\tan (11.31+4.05)^{\circ}} \\
& =\frac{0.0707}{0.2747}=0.257 \\
\text { i.e. } \quad \boldsymbol{\eta} & =\mathbf{2 5 . 7 \%}

\section*{Motion in a circle}

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
- understand centripetal force
- understand D'Alembert's principle
- understand centrifugal force
- solve problems involving locomotives and cars travelling around bends
- solve problems involving a conical pendulum
- solve problems involving the motion in a vertical circle
- understand the centrifugal clutch

\subsection*{16.1 Introduction}

In this chapter we will restrict ourselves to the uniform circular motion of particles. We will assume that objects such as railway trains and motorcars behave as particles, i.e. rigid body motion is neglected. When a railway train goes round a bend, its wheels will have to produce a centripetal acceleration towards the centre of the turning circle. This in turn will cause the railway tracks to experience a centrifugal thrust, which will tend to cause the track to move outwards. To avoid this unwanted outward thrust on the outer rail, it will be necessary to incline the railway tracks in the manner shown in Figure 16.1.
From Section 13.3, it can be seen that when a particle moves in a circular path at a constant speed $v$, its centripetal acceleration,
$$a=2 v \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \times \frac{1}{t}$$

When $\theta$ is small, $\theta \approx \sin \theta$,
hence $\quad a=2 v \frac{\theta}{2} \times \frac{1}{t}=v \frac{\theta}{t}$
However, $\omega=$ uniform angular velocity $=\frac{\theta}{t}$
Therefore $a=v \omega$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-040.jpg?height=310&width=724&top_left_y=484&top_left_x=897)

Figure 16.1
If $r=$ the radius of the turning circle, then
$$v=\omega r$$
and
$$a=\omega^{2} r=\frac{v^{2}}{r}$$

Now $\quad$ force $=$ mass $\times$ acceleration
Hence,
$$\text { centripetal force }=m \omega^{2} r=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}$$

\section*{D'Alembert's principle}

Although problems involving the motion in a circle are dynamic ones, they can be reduced to static problems through D'Alembert's principle. In this principle, the centripetal force is replaced by an imaginary centrifugal force which acts equal and opposite to the centripetal force. By using this principle, the dynamic problem is reduced to a static one.

If a motorcar travels around a bend, its tyres will have to exert centripetal forces to achieve this. This is achieved by the transverse frictional forces acting on the tyres, as shown in Figure 16.2.

In Figure 16.2, the following notation is used: $C G=$ centre of gravity of the car,
$C F=$ centrifugal force $=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}$,
$m=$ mass of car,
$g=$ acceleration due to gravity,
$R_{1}=$ vertical reaction of 'inner' wheel,
$R_{2}=$ vertical reaction of 'outer' wheel,
$F_{1}=$ frictional force on 'inner' wheel,
$F_{2}=$ frictional force on 'outer' wheel,
$h=$ vertical distance of the centre of gravity of the car from the ground,
$L=$ distance between the centre of the tyres,
$r=$ radius of the turning circle, and
$\mu=$ coefficient of friction.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-041.jpg?height=506&width=768&top_left_y=410&top_left_x=87)

Figure 16.2

Problem 1. Determine expressions for the frictional forces $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ of Figure 16.2. Hence determine the thrust on each tyre.

Resolving forces horizontally gives:
$$F_{1}+F_{2}=C F=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}$$

Resolving forces vertically gives:
$$R_{1}+R_{2}=m g$$

Taking moments about the 'outer' wheel gives:
$$C F \times h+R_{1} \times L=m g \frac{L}{2}$$
i.e. $\quad \frac{m v^{2}}{r} h+R_{1} L=m g \frac{L}{2}$
or
$$R_{1} L=m g \frac{L}{2}-\frac{m v^{2}}{r} h$$

Hence,
$$R_{1} L=m\left(\frac{g L}{2}-\frac{v^{2} h}{r}\right)$$
from which,
$$R_{1}=\frac{m}{L}\left(\frac{g L}{2}-\frac{v^{2} h}{r}\right)$$

Also, $\quad F_{1}=\mu R_{1}$ and $F_{2}=\mu R_{2}$
Substituting equation (16.4) into equation (16.3) gives:
$$\frac{m}{L}\left(\frac{g L}{2}-\frac{v^{2} h}{r}\right)+R_{2}=m g$$

Therefore,
$$\begin{aligned}
R_{2} & =m g-\frac{m}{L}\left(\frac{g L}{2}-\frac{v^{2} h}{r}\right) \\
& =m g-\frac{m g}{2}+\frac{m}{L} \frac{v^{2} h}{r}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. $\quad R_{2}=\frac{m}{L}\left(\frac{g L}{2}+\frac{v^{2} h}{r}\right)$

From equations (16.4) to (16.6):
$$F_{1}=\mu \frac{m}{L}\left(\frac{g L}{2}-\frac{v^{2} h}{r}\right)$$
and $\quad F_{2}=\mu \frac{m}{L}\left(\frac{g L}{2}+\frac{v^{2} h}{r}\right)$

To calculate the thrust on each tyre:
From Pythagoras' theorem,
$$T_{1}=\sqrt{F_{1}^{2}+R_{1}^{2}}=\sqrt{\mu^{2} R_{1}^{2}+R_{1}^{2}}$$
i.e. $\quad \boldsymbol{T}_{\mathbf{1}}=\boldsymbol{R}_{\mathbf{1}} \times \sqrt{\mathbf{1}+\boldsymbol{\mu}^{\mathbf{2}}}$ (see Figure 16.3(a))

Let $\alpha_{1}=$ angle of thrust,
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}

\subsection*{16.2 Motion on a curved banked track}

Problem 2. A railway train is required to travel around a bend of radius $r$ at a uniform speed of $v$. Determine the amount that the 'outer' rail is to be elevated to avoid an outward centrifugal thrust in these rails, as shown in Figure 16.4.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-042.jpg?height=541&width=676&top_left_y=1296&top_left_x=138)

Figure 16.4

To balance the centrifugal force:
from which,
$$\begin{array}{r}
\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right) \sin \theta=C F=\frac{m v^{2}}{r} \\
\sin \theta=\frac{m v^{2}}{r\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)}
\end{array}$$

Let $R=R_{1}+R_{2}$
Then $\quad \sin \theta=\frac{m v^{2}}{r R}$
Resolving forces vertically gives:
from which,
$$\begin{aligned}
R \cos \theta & =m g \\
R & =\frac{m g}{\cos \theta}
\end{aligned}$$

Substituting equation (16.10) into equation (16.9) gives:

Hence $\tan \theta=\frac{v^{2}}{r g}\left(\operatorname{since} \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}=\tan \theta\right)$
Thus, the amount that the outer rail has to be elevated to avoid an outward centrifugal thrust on these rails,
$$\theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{v^{2}}{r g}\right)$$

Problem 3. A locomotive travels around a curve of 700 m radius. If the horizontal thrust on the outer rail is $1 / 40^{\text {th }}$ of the locomotive's weight, determine the speed of the locomotive (in km/h). The surface that the rails are on may be assumed to be horizontal and the horizontal force on the inner rail may be assumed to be zero. Take $g$ as $9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

Centrifugal force on outer rail
$$=\frac{m g}{40}$$

Hence,
$$\frac{m v^{2}}{r}=\frac{m g}{40}$$
from which,
$$\begin{aligned}
v^{2} & =\frac{g r}{40}=\frac{9.81 \times 700}{40} \\
& =171.675 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}^{2} \\
v & =\sqrt{171.675}=13.10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =(13.10 \times 3.6) \mathrm{km} / \mathrm{h}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. the speed of the locomotive, $\boldsymbol{v}=47.17 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$

Problem 4. What angle of banking of the rails is required for Problem 3 above, for the outer rail to have a zero value of thrust? Assume the speed of the locomotive is $40 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$.

From Problem 2, angle of banking,

Hence, $\quad \theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{11.11^{2} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}{700 \mathrm{~m} \times 9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}\right)$ $=\tan ^{-1}(0.01798)$
i.e. angle of banking, $\theta=1.03^{\circ}$

\section*{Exercise 80 Further problems on motion in a circle}

Where needed, take $g=9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$
1. A locomotive travels around a curve of 500 m radius. If the horizontal thrust on the outer rail is $\frac{1}{50}$ of the locomotive weight, determine the speed of the locomotive.

[ $35.64 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ ]

\subsection*{16.3 Conical pendulum}

If a mass $m$ were rotated at a constant angular velocity $\omega$, in a horizontal circle of radius $r$, by
a mass-less taut string of length $L$, its motion will be in the form of a cone, as shown in Figure 16.5.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-043.jpg?height=734&width=722&top_left_y=291&top_left_x=888)

Figure 16.5 Conical pendulum

Let $r=$ radius of horizontal turning circle,
$L=$ length of string,
$h=O C$,
$\omega=$ constant angular velocity about $C$,
$m=$ mass of particle $P$,
$T=$ tension in string, and
$\theta=$ cone angle

Problem 5. Determine an expression for the cone angle $\theta$ and the tension in the string $T$, for the conical pendulum of Figure 16.5.
Determine also an expression for $\omega$.

Resolving forces horizontally gives:
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
C F & =T \sin \theta \\
m \omega^{2} r & =T \sin \theta
\end{aligned}$$
from which, $\quad T=\frac{m \omega^{2} r}{\sin \theta}$
Resolving forces vertically gives:
from which, $\quad T=\frac{m g}{\cos \theta}$

Equating equations (16.12) and (16.13) gives:
$$\frac{m \omega^{2} r}{\sin \theta}=\frac{m g}{\cos \theta}$$

Rearranging gives: $\frac{m \omega^{2} r}{m g}=\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$
i.e.
$$\tan \theta=\frac{\omega^{2} r}{g}$$

Hence, the cone angle,
$$\theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega^{2} r}{g}\right)$$

From Figure 16.5,
$$\sin \theta=\frac{r}{L}$$

Hence, from equation (16.12),
$$T=\frac{m \omega^{2} r}{\frac{r}{L}}$$
i.e. the tension in the string,
$$T=m \omega^{2} L$$

From equation (16.14), $\quad \frac{\omega^{2} r}{g}=\tan \theta$
But, from Figure 16.5, $\quad \tan \theta=\frac{r}{h}$
Hence,
$$\frac{\omega^{2} r}{g}=\frac{r}{h}$$
and
$$\omega^{2}=\frac{g}{h}$$

Thus, angular velocity about $C$,
$$\omega=\sqrt{\frac{g}{h}}$$

Problem 6. A conical pendulum rotates about a horizontal circle at 90 rpm . If the speed of rotation of the mass increases by $10 \%$, how much does the mass of the pendulum rise (in mm )? Take $g$ as $9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

Angular velocity,
$$\omega=\frac{2 \pi n}{60}=\frac{2 \pi \times 90}{60}=9.425 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$$

From equation (16.17),
$$\omega=\sqrt{\frac{g}{h}} \quad \text { or } \quad \omega^{2}=\frac{g}{h}$$
from which, height,
$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{h} & =\frac{g}{\omega^{2}}=\frac{9.81}{9.425^{2}} \\
& =\mathbf{0} . \mathbf{1 1 0 4 4} \mathbf{~ m}(\text { see Figure } 16.5)
\end{aligned}$$

When the speed of rotation rises by $10 \%$, $n_{2}=90 \times 1.1=99 \mathrm{rpm}$. Hence,
$$\omega_{2}=\frac{2 \pi n_{2}}{60}=\frac{2 \pi \times 99}{60}=10.367 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$$

From equation (16.17),
$$\omega_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{g}{h_{2}}} \quad \text { or } \quad \omega_{2}^{2}=\frac{g}{h_{2}}$$

Hence,
$$h_{2}=\frac{g}{\omega_{2}^{2}}=\frac{9.81}{10.367^{2}}$$
i.e. the new value of height, $\boldsymbol{h}_{2}=\mathbf{0 . 0 9 1 2 7} \mathrm{m}$. Rise in height of the pendulum mass
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\text { 'old' } h-\text { 'new' } h \\
& =h-h_{2}=0.11044-0.09127 \\
& =0.01917 \mathrm{~m}=\mathbf{1 9 . 1 7 ~ m m}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 7. A conical pendulum rotates at a horizontal angular velocity of $5 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$. If the length of the string is 2 m and the pendulum mass is 0.3 kg , determine the tension in the string. Determine also the radius of the turning circle. Take $g$ as $9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

Angular velocity, $\omega=5 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$
From equation (16.16), tension in the string,
$$\begin{aligned}
T & =m \omega^{2} L \\
& =0.3 \mathrm{~kg} \times(5 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s})^{2} \times 2 \mathrm{~m} \\
\text { i.e. } \quad T & =15 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

However, $1 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}=1 \mathrm{~N}$, hence, tension in the string, $T=15 \mathrm{~N}$
From equation (16.13),
$$T=\frac{m g}{\cos \theta}$$
from which,
$$\cos \theta=\frac{m g}{T}=\frac{0.3 \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}{15 \mathrm{~N}}=0.1962$$

Hence, the cone angle, $\boldsymbol{\theta}=\cos ^{-1}(0.1962)$
$$=78.685^{\circ}$$

From equation (16.15),
$$\sin \theta=\frac{r}{L}$$
from which, radius of turning circle,
$$\boldsymbol{r}=L \sin \theta=2 \mathrm{~m} \times \sin 78.685^{\circ}=\mathbf{1 . 9 6 1 ~ m}$$

\subsection*{16.4 Motion in a vertical circle}

This Problem is best solved by energy considerations. Consider a particle $P$ rotating in a vertical circle of radius $r$ about a point $O$, as shown in Figure 16.6. Neglect losses due to friction.
Let $T=$ tension in a mass-less string,
$r=$ radius of turning circle,
$m=$ mass of particle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-045.jpg?height=760&width=717&top_left_y=151&top_left_x=891)

Figure 16.6 Motion in a vertical circle

Problem 8. Determine the minimum tangential velocity at $A$, namely, $v_{A}$, which will just keep the string taut at the point $B$ for the particle moving in the vertical circle of Figure 16.6.

At the point $B$ the
$$\text { potential energy }=m g \times 2 r$$
and the kinetic energy $=\frac{m v_{B}^{2}}{2}$
At the point $A$, the kinetic energy
$$\mathrm{KE}=\frac{m v_{A}^{2}}{2}$$
and the potential energy
$$\mathrm{PE}=0$$

As there are no energy losses,
KE at $A=(K E+P E)$ at $B$
Hence, from equations (16.18) to (16.20):
$$\frac{m v_{A}^{2}}{2}=m g \times 2 r+\frac{m v_{B}^{2}}{2}$$
or
$$\frac{v_{A}^{2}}{2}=\frac{v_{B}^{2}}{2}+2 g r$$
from which, $\quad v_{A}^{2}=v_{B}^{2}+4 g r$

At $B, T=0$
Thus, weight $=$ centrifugal force at $B$,
or
$$m g=\frac{m v_{B}^{2}}{r}$$
from which, $v_{B}^{2}=g r$
Substituting equation (16.22) into equation (16.21) gives:
$$v_{A}^{2}=g r+4 g r=5 g r$$

Hence, the minimum tangential velocity at $\boldsymbol{A}$,
$$v_{A}=\sqrt{5 g r}$$

\section*{Problem 9. A mass of 0.1 kg is being} rotated in a vertical circle of radius 0.6 m . If the mass is attached to a mass-less string and the motion is such that the string is just taut when the mass is at the top of the circle, what is the tension in the string when it is horizontal? Neglect losses and take $g$ as $9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

At the top of the circle,
potential energy $=P E=2 m g r$ and $\mathrm{KE}=\frac{m v_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}}{2}$, where $v_{\mathrm{T}}=$ velocity of mass at the top.
When the string is horizontal, $P E=m g r$ and kinetic energy,
$$K E=\frac{m v_{1}^{2}}{2},$$
where $v_{1}=$ velocity of mass at this point.
From the conservation of energy, $(P E+K E)$ at the top $=(P E+K E)$ when the string is horizontal
i.e. $\quad 2 m g r=m g r+\frac{m v_{1}^{2}}{2}-\frac{m v_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}}{2}$
but CF at top $=\frac{m v_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}}{r}=m g$ or $v_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}=g r$
or
$$\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{2}=2 g r-g r+\frac{g r}{2}=\frac{3 g r}{2}$$
i.e.
$$v_{1}^{2}=3 g r$$
and
$$\begin{aligned}
v_{1} & =\sqrt{3 g r}=\sqrt{3 \times 9.81 \times 0.6} \\
& =4.202 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$

Resolving forces horizontally,
$$\text { Centrifugal force }=T=\text { tension in the string }$$

Therefore,
$$T=\frac{m v_{1}^{2}}{r}=\frac{0.1 \mathrm{~kg} \times(4.202)^{2} \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}{0.6 \mathrm{~m}}$$
i.e. the tension in the string, $T=2.943 \mathrm{~N}$

Problem 10. What is the tension in the string for Problem 9 when the mass is at the bottom of the circle?

From equation (16.23), the velocity at the bottom of the circle $=v=\sqrt{5 g r}$ i.e. $v=\sqrt{5 \times 9.81 \times 0.6}=5.4249 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

Resolving forces vertically, $T=$ tension in the string $=$ centrifugal force + the weight of the mass
$$\text { i.e. } \quad \begin{aligned}
T & =\frac{m v^{2}}{r}+m g=m\left(\frac{v^{2}}{r}+g\right) \\
& =0.1 \times\left(\frac{5.4249^{2}}{0.6}+9.81\right) \\
& =0.1 \times(49.05+9.81)=0.1 \times 58.86 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. tension in the string, $T=5.886 \mathrm{~N}$

Problem 11. If the mass of Problem 9 were to rise, so that the string is at $45^{\circ}$ to the vertical axis and below the halfway mark, what would be the tension in the string?

At $45^{\circ}, \quad P E=\frac{m g r}{2}$ and $K E=\frac{m v_{2}^{2}}{2}$
where $v_{2}=$ velocity of the mass at this stage.
From the conservation of energy,
$P E+K E$ (at top) $=(P E+K E)$ at this stage

Therefore,
$$2 m g r=\frac{m g r}{2}+\frac{m v_{2}^{2}}{2}-\frac{m v_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}}{2}$$

From problem 9, $\quad v_{T}^{2}=g r$
hence
$$\frac{v_{2}^{2}}{2}=\left(2 r-\frac{r}{2}+\frac{r}{2}\right) g=2 g r$$
from which,
$$v_{2}^{2}=2 g r$$
and
$$\begin{aligned}
v_{2}=\sqrt{4 g r} & =\sqrt{4 \times 9.81 \times 0.6} \\
& =4.852 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$

Resolving forces in a direction along the string, $T=$ tension in the string $=$ centrifugal force + component of weight at $45^{\circ}$ to the vertical
$$\text { i.e. } \begin{aligned}
T & =\frac{m v_{2}^{2}}{r}+m g \cos 45^{\circ} \\
& =\frac{0.1 \times(4.852)^{2}}{0.6}+0.1 \times 9.81 \times 0.7071 \\
& =3.924 \mathrm{~N}+0.6937 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. the tension in the string, $T=4.618 \mathrm{~N}$

\subsection*{16.5 Centrifugal clutch}

A clutch is an engineering device used for transferring motion from an engine to a gearbox or other machinery. The main purpose of the clutch is to transfer the motion in a smooth and orderly manner, so that the gears and wheels (in the case of the motor car) will accelerate smoothly and not in a jerky manner.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-047.jpg?height=460&width=756&top_left_y=577&top_left_x=893)

Figure 16.7
The centrifugal clutch works on the principle that the rotating driving shaft will cause the centrifugal weights, shown in Figure 16.7, to move radially outwards with increasing speed of rotation of the driving shaft. These centrifugal weights will be restrained by the restraining springs shown, but when the speed of the driving shaft reaches the required value, the clutch material will engage with the driven shaft, through friction, and cause the driven shaft to rotate. The driven shaft will thus reach a high speed of rotation quite smoothly in the required time.

Centrifugal clutches are popular when it is required to exert a high starting torque quickly and smoothly.

A suitable clutch material is asbestos, but it is likely that asbestos will be replaced by more modern materials for health and safety reasons.

\section*{Work, energy and power}

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
- define work and state its unit
- perform simple calculations on work done
- appreciate that the area under a force/ distance graph gives work done
- perform calculations on a force/distance graph to determine work done
- define energy and state its unit

- define kinetic energy
- perform calculations involving kinetic energy $=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$
- distinguish between elastic and inelastic collisions
- perform calculations involving kinetic energy in rotation $=\frac{1}{2} I \omega^{2}$

\subsection*{14.1 Work}

If a body moves as a result of a force being applied to it, the force is said to do work on the body. The amount of work done is the product of the applied
force and the distance, i.e.
$$\begin{array}{r}
\text { work done }=\text { force } \times \text { distance moved in } \\
\text { the direction of the force }
\end{array}$$

The unit of work is the joule, $\mathbf{J}$, which is defined as the amount of work done when a force of 1 Newton acts for a distance of 1 m in the direction of the force. Thus,
$$1 \mathrm{~J}=1 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}$$

If a graph is plotted of experimental values of force (on the vertical axis) against distance moved (on the horizontal axis) a force/distance graph or work diagram is produced. The area under the graph represents the work done.

For example, a constant force of 20 N used to raise a load a height of 8 m may be represented on a force/distance graph as shown in Figure 14.1. The area under the graph shown shaded represents the work done. Hence
$$\text { work done }=20 \mathrm{~N} \times 8 \mathrm{~m}=\mathbf{1 6 0 ~ J}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-049.jpg?height=378&width=439&top_left_y=1493&top_left_x=900)

Figure 14.1

Similarly, a spring extended by 20 mm by a force of 500 N may be represented by the work diagram shown in Figure 14.2, where
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { work done } & =\text { shaded area } \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \times \text { base } \times \text { height }
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-050.jpg?height=299&width=371&top_left_y=158&top_left_x=105)

Figure 14.2
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{2} \times\left(20 \times 10^{-3}\right) \mathrm{m} \times 500 \mathrm{~N} \\
& =\mathbf{5} \mathbf{J}
\end{aligned}$$

It is shown in Chapter 13 that force $=$ mass $\times$ acceleration, and that if an object is dropped from a height it has a constant acceleration of around $9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. Thus if a mass of 8 kg is lifted vertically 4 m , the work done is given by:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { work done } & =\text { force } \times \text { distance } \\
& =(\text { mass } \times \text { acceleration }) \times \text { distance } \\
& =(8 \times 9.81) \times 4=313.92 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}$$

The work done by a variable force may be found by determining the area enclosed by the force/distance graph using an approximate method such as the midordinate rule.

To determine the area $A B C D$ of Figure 14.3 using the mid-ordinate rule:
(i) Divide base $A D$ into any number of equal intervals, each of width $d$ (the greater the number of intervals, the greater the accuracy)
(ii) Erect ordinates in the middle of each interval (shown by broken lines in Figure 14.3)
(iii) Accurately measure ordinates $y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}$, etc.
(iv) Area $A B C D=d\left(y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4}+y_{5}+y_{6}\right)$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-050.jpg?height=378&width=542&top_left_y=1800&top_left_x=99)

Figure 14.3

In general, the mid-ordinate rule states:
$$\text { Area }=\binom{\text { width of }}{\text { interval }}\binom{\text { sum of }}{\text { mid-ordinates }}$$

Problem 1. Calculate the work done when a force of 40 N pushes an object a distance of 500 m in the same direction as the force.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Work done } & =\text { force } \times \text { distance moved in the } \\
& \text { direction of the force } \\
& =40 \mathrm{~N} \times 500 \mathrm{~m} \\
& =20000 \mathrm{~J}(\text { since } 1 \mathrm{~J}=1 \mathrm{Nm})
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. work done $\boldsymbol{=} \mathbf{2 0} \mathbf{~ k J}$

Problem 2. Calculate the work done when a mass is lifted vertically by a crane to a height of 5 m , the force required to lift the mass being 98 N .

When work is done in lifting then:
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { work done }= & (\text { weight of the body }) \\
& \times(\text { vertical distance moved })
\end{aligned}$$

Weight is the downward force due to the mass of an object. Hence
$$\text { workdone }=98 \mathrm{~N} \times 5 \mathrm{~m}=490 \mathrm{~J}$$

Problem 3. A motor supplies a constant force of 1 kN which is used to move a load a distance of 5 m . The force is then changed to a constant 500 N and the load is moved a further 15 m . Draw the force/distance graph for the operation and from the graph determine the work done by the motor.

The force/distance graph or work diagram is shown in Figure 14.4. Between points $A$ and $B$ a constant force of 1000 N moves the load 5 m ; between

& \quad \quad+(500 \mathrm{~N} \times 15 \mathrm{~m}) \\
& =5000 \mathrm{~J}+7500 \mathrm{~J} \\
& =12500 \mathrm{~J}=\mathbf{1 2 . 5} \mathbf{k J}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 4. A spring, initially in a relaxed state, is extended by 100 mm . Determine the work done by using a work diagram if the spring requires a force of 0.6 N per mm of stretch.

Force required for a 100 mm extension $=100 \mathrm{~mm} \times 0.6 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{mm}=60 \mathrm{~N}$.
Figure 14.5 shows the force/extension graph or work diagram representing the increase in extension in proportion to the force, as the force is increased
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-051.jpg?height=378&width=474&top_left_y=1795&top_left_x=99)

Figure 14.5
from 0 to 60 N The work done is the area under the graph, hence
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { work done } & =\frac{1}{2} \times \text { base } \times \text { height } \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \times 100 \mathrm{~mm} \times 60 \mathrm{~N} \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \times 100 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} \times 60 \mathrm{~N} \\
& =\mathbf{3} \mathbf{J}
\end{aligned}$$
(Alternatively, average force during
$$\text { extension }=\frac{(60-0)}{2}=30 \mathrm{~N}$$
and total
$$\text { extension }=100 \mathrm{~mm}=0.1 \mathrm{~m}$$
hence
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { work done } & =\text { average force } \times \text { extension } \\
& =30 \mathrm{~N} \times 0.1 \mathrm{~m}=3 \mathrm{~J})
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 5. A spring requires a force of 10 N to cause an extension of 50 mm . Determine the work done in extending the spring (a) from zero to 30 mm , and (b) from 30 mm to 50 mm .

Figure 14.6 shows the force/extension graph for the spring.
(a) Work done in extending the spring from zero to 30 mm is given by area $A B O$ of Figure 14.6, i.e.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-051.jpg?height=482&width=486&top_left_y=1693&top_left_x=968)

Figure 14.6
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { work done } & =\frac{1}{2} \times \text { base } \times \text { height } \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \times 30 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} \times 6 \mathrm{~N} \\
& =90 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~J}=\mathbf{0 . 0 9} \mathbf{J}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) Work done in extending the spring from 30 mm to 50 mm is given by area $A B C E$ of Figure 14.6, i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { work done }= & \text { area } A B C D+\text { area } A D E \\
= & \left(20 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} \times 6 \mathrm{~N}\right) \\
& +\frac{1}{2}\left(20 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}\right)(4 \mathrm{~N}) \\
= & 0.12 \mathrm{~J}+0.04 \mathrm{~J}=\mathbf{0 . 1 6} \mathbf{~ J}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 6. Calculate the work done when a mass of 20 kg is lifted vertically through a distance of 5.0 m . Assume that the acceleration due to gravity is $9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

The force to be overcome when lifting a mass of 20 kg vertically upwards is mg ,
i.e. $20 \times 9.81=196.2 \mathrm{~N}$ (see Chapter 13).
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { work done } & =\text { force } \times \text { distance } \\
& =196.2 \times 5.0=\mathbf{9 8 1} \mathbf{~ J}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 7. Water is pumped vertically upwards through a distance of 50.0 m and the work done is 294.3 kJ . Determine the number of litres of water pumped. (1 litre of water has a mass of 1 kg ).

Work done $=$ force $\times$ distance,
i.e.
from which
$$\begin{aligned}
294300 & =\text { force } \times 50.0 \\
\text { force } & =\frac{294300}{50.0}=5886 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}$$

The force to be overcome when lifting a mass m kg vertically upwards is mg , i.e. $(\mathrm{m} \times 9.81) \mathrm{N}$ (see Chapter 13).
Thus $5886=\mathrm{m} \times 9.81$, from which mass,
$$\mathrm{m}=\frac{5886}{9.81}=600 \mathrm{~kg}$$

Since 1 litre of water has a mass of $1 \mathrm{~kg}, 600$ litres of water are pumped.

Problem 8. The force on a cutting tool of a shaping machine varies over the length of cut as follows:
\begin{tabular}{lrllllr} 
Distance (mm) & 0 & 20 & 40 & 60 & 80 & 100 \\
Force (kN) & 60 & 72 & 65 & 53 & 44 & 50
\end{tabular}

Determine the work done as the tool moves through a distance of 100 mm .

The force/distance graph for the given data is shown in Figure 14.7. The work done is given by the area under the graph; the area may be determined by an approximate method. Using the mid-ordinate rule, with each strip of width 20 mm , mid-ordinates $y_{1}$, $y_{2}, y_{3}, y_{4}$ and $y_{5}$ are erected as shown, and each is measured.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Area under curve } & =\binom{\text { width of }}{\text { interval }}\binom{\text { sum of }}{\text { mid-ordinate }} \\
& =(20)(69+69.5+59+48 \\
& =(20)(291)
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-052.jpg?height=986&width=765&top_left_y=1193&top_left_x=896)

Figure 14.7
$$\begin{aligned}
& =5820 \mathrm{kN} \mathrm{~mm}=5820 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m} \\
& =5820 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence the work done as the tool moves through 100 mm is $\mathbf{5 . 8 2} \mathbf{~ k J}$

\subsection*{14.2 Energy}

Energy is the capacity, or ability, to do work. The unit of energy is the joule, the same as for work. Energy is expended when work is done. There are several forms of energy and these include:
(i) Mechanical energy
(ii) Heat or thermal energy
(iii) Electrical energy
(iv) Chemical energy
(v) Nuclear energy
(vi) Light energy
(vii) Sound energy

Energy may be converted from one form to another. The principle of conservation of energy states that the total amount of energy remains the same in such conversions, i.e. energy cannot be created or destroyed.

Some examples of energy conversions include:
(i) Mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy by a generator
(ii) Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy by a motor
(iii) Heat energy is converted to mechanical energy by a steam engine
(iv) Mechanical energy is converted to heat energy by friction
(v) Heat energy is converted to electrical energy by a solar cell
(vi) Electrical energy is converted to heat energy by an electric fire
(vii) Heat energy is converted to chemical energy by living plants
(viii) Chemical energy is converted to heat energy by burning fuels
(ix) Heat energy is converted to electrical energy by a thermocouple
(x) Chemical energy is converted to electrical energy by batteries
(xi) Electrical energy is converted to light energy by a light bulb
(xii) Sound energy is converted to electrical energy by a microphone.
(xiii) Electrical energy is converted to chemical energy by electrolysis.

Efficiency is defined as the ratio of the useful output energy to the input energy. The symbol for efficiency is $\eta$ (Greek letter eta). Hence
$$\text { efficiency, } \eta=\frac{\text { useful output energy }}{\text { input energy }}$$

Efficiency has no units and is often stated as a percentage. A perfect machine would have an efficiency of $100 \%$. However, all machines have an efficiency lower than this due to friction and other losses. Thus, if the input energy to a motor is 1000 J and the output energy is 800 J then the efficiency is
$$\frac{800}{1000} \times 100 \%=\mathbf{8 0 \%}$$

Problem 9. A machine exerts a force of 200 N in lifting a mass through a height of 6 m . If 2 kJ of energy are supplied to it, what is the efficiency of the machine?

Work done in lifting mass
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\text { force } \times \text { distance moved } \\
& =\text { weight body } \times \text { distance moved } \\
& =200 \mathrm{~N} \times 6 \mathrm{~m}=1200 \mathrm{~J} \\
& =\text { useful energy output } \\
\text { Energy input } & =2 \mathrm{~kJ}=2000 \mathrm{~J} \\
\text { Efficiency, } \eta & =\frac{\text { useful output energy }}{\text { input energy }} \\
& =\frac{1200}{2000}=\mathbf{0 . 6} \text { or } \mathbf{6 0 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 10. Calculate the useful output energy of an electric motor which is $70 \%$ efficient if it uses 600 J of electrical energy.

Efficiency,
$$\eta=\frac{\text { useful output energy }}{\text { input energy }}$$
thus
$$\frac{70}{100}=\frac{\text { output energy }}{600 \mathrm{~J}}$$
from which, output energy $=\frac{70}{100} \times 600=420 \mathrm{~J}$

Problem 11. 4 kJ of energy are supplied to a machine used for lifting a mass. The force required is 800 N . If the machine has an efficiency of $50 \%$, to what height will it lift the mass?
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\text { Efficiency, } & \eta=\frac{\text { useful output energy }}{\text { input energy }} \\
\text { i.e. } & \begin{aligned}
\frac{50}{100} & =\frac{\text { output energy }}{4000 \mathrm{~J}} \\
\text { from which, output energy } & =\frac{50}{100} \times 4000 \\
& =2000 \mathrm{~J} \\
& =\text { force } \times \begin{array}{l}
\text { distance } \\
\text { moved, }
\end{array} \\
\text { Work done } & 2000 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}=800 \mathrm{~N} \times \text { height, } \\
\text { hence } & \text { height } \\
\text { from which, } & \frac{2000 \mathrm{~J}}{800 \mathrm{~N}}=\mathbf{2 . 5} \mathbf{~ m . ~}
\end{array}$$

Problem 12. A hoist exerts a force of 500 N in raising a load through a height of 20 m . The efficiency of the hoist gears is $75 \%$ and the efficiency of the motor is $80 \%$. Calculate the input energy to the hoist.

The hoist system is shown diagrammatically in Figure 14.8.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Output energy } & =\text { work done } \\
& =\text { force } \times \text { distance } \\
& =500 \mathrm{~N} \times 20 \mathrm{~m}=10000 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-054.jpg?height=136&width=671&top_left_y=2034&top_left_x=899)

Figure 14.8

For the gearing,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { efficiency }=\frac{\text { output energy }}{\text { input energy }} \\
& \text { i.e. } \frac{75}{100} \\
&=\frac{10000}{\text { input energy }}
\end{aligned}$$
from which, the input energy to the gears
$$=10000 \times \frac{100}{75}=13333 \mathrm{~J} .$$

The input energy to the gears is the same as the output energy of the motor. Thus, for the motor,
efficiency $\quad=\frac{\text { output energy }}{\text { input energy }}$
i.e. $\quad \frac{80}{100}=\frac{13333}{\text { input energy }}$

Hence input energy to the hoist
$$=13333 \times \frac{100}{80}=16667 \mathrm{~J}=\mathbf{1 6 . 6 7} \mathbf{~ k J}$$

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

\subsection*{14.3 Power}

Power is a measure of the rate at which work is done or at which energy is converted from one form
to another.
$$\text { Power } P=\frac{\text { energy used }}{\text { time taken }}$$
or
$$P=\frac{\text { work done }}{\text { time taken }}$$

The unit of power is the watt, $\mathbf{W}$, where 1 watt is equal to 1 joule per second. The watt is a small unit for many purposes and a larger unit called the kilowatt, kW , is used, where $1 \mathrm{~kW}=1000 \mathrm{~W}$.
The power output of a motor, which does 120 kJ of work in 30 s , is thus given by

Since
$$\text { work done }=\text { force } \times \text { distance },$$
then
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { power } & =\frac{\text { work done }}{\text { time taken }} \\
& =\frac{\text { force } \times \text { distance }}{\text { time taken }} \\
& =\text { force } \times \frac{\text { distance }}{\text { time taken }}
\end{aligned}$$

However, $\quad \frac{\text { distance }}{\text { time taken }}=$ velocity
Hence
$$\text { power }=\text { force } \times \text { velocity }$$

Problem 13. The output power of a motor is 8 kW . How much work does it do in 30 s ?
$$\text { Power }=\frac{\text { work done }}{\text { time taken }}$$
from which, work done $=$ power $\times$ time
$$\begin{aligned}
& =8000 \mathrm{~W} \times 30 \mathrm{~s} \\
& =240000 \mathbf{J}=\mathbf{2 4 0} \mathbf{~ k J}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 14. Calculate the power required to lift a mass through a height of 10 m in 20 s if the force required is 3924 N .
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Work done } & =\text { force } \times \text { distance moved } \\
& =3924 \mathrm{~N} \times 10 \mathrm{~m}=39240 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Power } & =\frac{\text { work done }}{\text { time taken }}=\frac{39240 \mathrm{~J}}{20 \mathrm{~s}} \\
& =1962 \mathrm{~W} \text { or } 1.962 \mathrm{~kW}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 15. 10 kJ of work is done by a force in moving a body uniformly through 125 m in 50 s . Determine (a) the value of the force, and (b) the power.
(a) Work done $=$ force $\times$ distance, hence
$$10000 \mathrm{~J}=\text { force } \times 125 \mathrm{~m},$$
from which,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { force } & =\frac{10000 \mathrm{~J}}{125 \mathrm{~m}} \\
& =\mathbf{8 0} \mathbf{N}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) Power $=\frac{\text { work done }}{\text { time taken }}=\frac{10000 \mathrm{~J}}{50 \mathrm{~s}}=\mathbf{2 0 0 ~ W}$

Problem 16. A car hauls a trailer at $90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ when exerting a steady pull of 600 N. Calculate (a) the work done in 30 minutes and (b) the power required.
(a) Work done $=$ force $\times$ distance moved. The distance moved in 30 min , i.e. $\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~h}$, at $90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}=45 \mathrm{~km}$.
Hence, work done $=600 \mathrm{~N} \times 45000 \mathrm{~m}=$ $\mathbf{2 7 0 0 0 ~ k J}$ or $\mathbf{2 7 ~ M J}$
(b) Power required
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{\text { work done }}{\text { time taken }}=\frac{27 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~J}}{30 \times 60 \mathrm{~s}} \\
& =\mathbf{1 5 0 0 0 ~ W} \text { or } \mathbf{1 5 ~ k W}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 17. To what height will a mass of weight 981 N be raised in 40 s by a machine using a power of 2 kW ?

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Work done }=\text { force } \times \text { distance } . \\
& \text { work done }=981 \mathrm{~N} \times \text { height. }
\end{aligned}$$
$$\text { Power }=\frac{\text { work done }}{\text { time taken }}$$
from which,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { work done } & =\text { power } \times \text { time taken } \\
& =2000 \mathrm{~W} \times 40 \mathrm{~s} \\
& =80000 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence
from which,
$$\begin{aligned}
& 80000=981 \mathrm{~N} \times \text { height } \\
& \text { height }=\frac{80000 \mathrm{~J}}{981 \mathrm{~N}}=\mathbf{8 1 . 5 5 ~ m}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 18. A planing machine has a cutting stroke of 2 m and the stroke takes 4 seconds. If the constant resistance to the cutting tool is 900 N , calculate for each cutting stroke (a) the power consumed at the tool point, and (b) the power input to the system if the efficiency of the system is $75 \%$.
(a) Work done in each cutting
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { stroke } & =\text { force } \times \text { distance } \\
& =900 \mathrm{~N} \times 2 \mathrm{~m}=1800 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}$$

Power consumed at tool point
$$=\frac{\text { work done }}{\text { time taken }}=\frac{1800 \mathrm{~J}}{4 \mathrm{~s}}=\mathbf{4 5 0} \mathbf{~ W}$$
(b) Efficiency $=\frac{\text { output energy }}{\text { input energy }}=\frac{\text { output power }}{\text { input power }}$

Hence
$$\frac{75}{100}=\frac{450}{\text { input power }}$$
from which, $\quad$ input power $=450 \times \frac{100}{75}$
$$=600 \mathrm{~W}$$

Problem 19. An electric motor provides power to a winding machine. The input power to the motor is 2.5 kW and the overall efficiency is $60 \%$. Calculate (a) the output power of the machine, (b) the rate at which it can raise a 300 kg load vertically upwards.
(a) Efficiency,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \qquad \eta=\frac{\text { power output }}{\text { power input }} \\
& \text { i.e. } \frac{60}{100}=\frac{\text { power output }}{2500} \\
& \text { from which, }
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { power output } & =\frac{60}{100} \times 2500 \\
& =\mathbf{1 5 0 0} \mathbf{W} \text { or } \mathbf{1 . 5} \mathbf{~ k W .}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) Power output $\quad=$ force $\times$ velocity, from which, $\quad$ velocity $=\frac{\text { power output }}{\text { force }}$.

Force acting on the 300 kg load due to
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { gravity } & =300 \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2} \\
& =2943 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { velocity } & =\frac{1500}{2943} \\
& =\mathbf{0 . 5 1 0 ~ m} / \mathrm{s} \quad \text { or } \quad \mathbf{5 1 0 ~ m m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 20. A lorry is travelling at a constant velocity of $72 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$. The force resisting motion is 800 N . Calculate the tractive power necessary to keep the lorry moving at this speed.
$$\text { Power }=\text { force } \times \text { velocity } \text {. }$$

The force necessary to keep the lorry moving at constant speed is equal and opposite to the force resisting motion, i.e. 800 N .

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Velocity } & =72 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}=\frac{72 \times 1000}{60 \times 60} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
\text { power } & =800 \mathrm{~N} \times 20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =16000 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}=16000 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =16000 \mathrm{~W} \text { or } 16 \mathrm{~kW}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus the tractive power needed to keep the lorry moving at a constant speed of $\mathbf{7 2 ~ k m / h}$ is $\mathbf{1 6 ~ k W}$.

Problem 21. The variation of tractive force with distance for a vehicle which is accelerating from rest is:
$\begin{array}{lllllll}\text { force }(\mathrm{kN}) & 8.0 & 7.4 & 5.8 & 4.5 & 3.7 & 3.0\end{array}$ distance (m) $0 \quad 10 \quad 20 \quad 30 \quad 40 \quad 50$

Determine the average power necessary if the time taken to travel the 50 m from rest is 25 s .

The force/distance diagram is shown in Figure 14.9. The work done is determined from the area under the curve. Using the mid-ordinate rule with five intervals gives:

&=(10)[26.8]=268 \mathrm{kN} \mathrm{~m}, \\
& \text { done }= 268 \mathrm{~kJ} \\
& \text { ower }= \frac{\text { work done }}{\text { time taken }}=\frac{268000 \mathrm{~J}}{25 \mathrm{~s}} \\
&= \mathbf{1 0 7 2 0 ~ W} \text { or } \mathbf{1 0 . 7 2 ~ k W} . \\

\subsection*{14.4 Potential and kinetic energy}

Mechanical engineering is concerned principally with two kinds of energy, potential energy and kinetic energy.

Potential energy is energy due to the position of the body. The force exerted on a mass of $m \mathrm{~kg}$ is $m g \mathrm{~N}$ (where $g=9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, the acceleration due to gravity). When the mass is lifted vertically through a height $h \mathrm{~m}$ above some datum level, the work done is given by: force $\times$ distance $=(m g(h) \mathrm{J}$. This work done is stored as potential energy in the mass. Hence,
$$\text { potential energy }=m g h \text { joules }$$
(the potential energy at the datum level being taken as zero).

Kinetic energy is the energy due to the motion of a body. Suppose a force $F$ acts on an object of mass $m$ originally at rest (i.e. $u=0$ ) and accelerates it to a velocity $v$ in a distance $s$ :
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { work done } & =\text { force } \times \text { distance }=F s \\
& =(m a)(s) \quad(\text { if no energy is lost })
\end{aligned}$$
where $a$ is the acceleration
Since $v^{2}=u^{2}+2 a s$ (see Chapter 11) and $u=0$, $v^{2}=2 a s$, from which
$$a=\frac{v^{2}}{2 s}$$
hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { work done } & =(m a)(s) \\
& =(m)\left(\frac{v^{2}}{2 s}\right)(s)=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

This energy is called the kinetic energy of the mass $m$, i.e.
$$\text { kinetic energy }=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} \text { joules }$$

As stated in Section 14.2, energy may be converted from one form to another. The principle of conservation of energy states that the total amount of energy remains the same in such conversions, i.e. energy cannot be created or destroyed.

In mechanics, the potential energy possessed by a body is frequently converted into kinetic energy, and vice versa. When a mass is falling freely, its potential energy decreases as it loses height, and its kinetic energy increases as its velocity increases. Ignoring air frictional losses, at all times:

Potential energy + kinetic energy $=\mathbf{a}$ constant

If friction is present, then work is done overcoming the resistance due to friction and this is dissipated as heat. Then,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Initial energy }= & \text { final energy } \\
& + \text { work done overcoming } \\
& \text { frictional resistance }
\end{aligned}$$

Kinetic energy is not always conserved in collisions. Collisions in which kinetic energy is conserved (i.e. stays the same) are called elastic collisions, and those in which it is not conserved are termed inelastic collisions.

Problem 22. A car of mass 800 kg is climbing an incline at $10^{\circ}$ to the horizontal. Determine the increase in potential energy of the car as it moves a distance of 50 m up the incline.

With reference to Figure 14.10,
$$\begin{aligned}
\sin 10^{\circ} & =\frac{\text { opposite }}{\text { hypotenuse }} \\
& =\frac{h}{50}
\end{aligned}$$
from which, $\quad h=50 \sin 10^{\circ}=8.682 \mathrm{~m}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-059.jpg?height=213&width=758&top_left_y=1359&top_left_x=97)

Figure 14.10

Hence, increase in
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { potential energy } & =m g h \\
& =800 \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2} \\
& \times 8.682 \mathrm{~m} \\
& =\mathbf{6 8 1 4 0 ~ J} \text { or } \mathbf{6 8 . 1 4 ~ k J}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 23. At the instant of striking, a hammer of mass 30 kg has a velocity of $15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Determine the kinetic energy in the hammer.

Kinetic energy $=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(30 \mathrm{~kg})(15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^{2}$ i.e.
kinetic energy in hammer $=3375 \mathbf{J}$ or $\mathbf{3 . 3 7 5} \mathbf{~ k J}$

Problem 24. A lorry having a mass of 1.5 t is travelling along a level road at $72 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$. When the brakes are applied, the speed decreases to $18 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$. Determine how much the kinetic energy of the lorry is reduced.

Initial velocity of lorry,
$$\begin{aligned}
v_{1} & =72 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h} \\
& =72 \frac{\mathrm{~km}}{\mathrm{~h}} \times 1000 \frac{\mathrm{~m}}{\mathrm{~km}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~h}}{3600 \mathrm{~s}} \\
& =\frac{72}{3.6}=20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$
final velocity of lorry,
$$\begin{aligned}
& v_{2}=\frac{18}{3.6}=5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \text { and mass of lorry, } \\
& m=1.5 t=1500 \mathrm{~kg}
\end{aligned}$$

Initial kinetic energy of the lorry
$$=\frac{1}{2} m v_{1}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(1500)(20)^{2}=300 \mathrm{~kJ}$$

Final kinetic energy of the lorry
$$=\frac{1}{2} m v_{2}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(1500)(5)^{2}=18.75 \mathrm{~kJ}$$

Hence, the change in
$$\text { kinetic energy }=300-18.75=\mathbf{2 8 1 . 2 5} \mathbf{~ k J}$$
(Part of this reduction in kinetic energy is converted into heat energy in the brakes of the lorry and is hence dissipated in overcoming frictional forces and air friction).

Problem 25. A canister containing a meteorology balloon of mass 4 kg is fired vertically upwards from a gun with an initial velocity of $400 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Neglecting the air resistance, calculate (a) its initial kinetic energy, (b) its velocity at a height of 1 km , (c) the maximum height reached.
(a) Initial kinetic energy $=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$
$$=\frac{1}{2}(4)(400)^{2}=320 \mathrm{~kJ}$$
(b) At a height of 1 km , potential energy $=$ $m g h=4 \times 9.81 \times 1000=39.24 \mathrm{~kJ}$. By the principle of conservation of energy: potential energy + kinetic energy at $1 \mathrm{~km}=$ initial kinetic energy.

Hence $39240+\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=320000$
from which, $\quad \frac{1}{2}(4) v^{2}=320000-39240$

Hence
$$\begin{aligned}
& =280760 \\
v & =\sqrt{\left(\frac{2 \times 280760}{4}\right)} \\
& =374.7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{i.e. the velocity of the canister at a height of 1 km is $374.7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$}
(c) At the maximum height, the velocity of the canister is zero and all the kinetic energy has been converted into potential energy. Hence, potential energy $=$ initial kinetic energy $=$ 320000 J (from part (a)) Then,
$$320000=m g h=(4)(9.81)(h),$$
from which, height $h=\frac{320000}{(4)(9.81)}=8155 \mathrm{~m}$
i.e. the maximum height reached is $\mathbf{8 1 5 5 ~ m}$.

Problem 26. A piledriver of mass 500 kg falls freely through a height of 1.5 m on to a pile of mass 200 kg . Determine the velocity with which the driver hits the pile. If, at impact, 3 kJ of energy are lost due to heat and sound, the remaining energy being possessed by the pile and driver as they are driven together into the ground a distance of 200 mm , determine (a) the common velocity immediately after impact, (b) the average resistance of the ground.

The potential energy of the piledriver is converted into kinetic energy.

Thus potential energy $=$ kinetic energy, i.e.
$$m g h=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2},$$
from which, velocity $v=\sqrt{2 g h}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\sqrt{(2)(9.81)(1.5)} \\
& =5.42 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, the piledriver hits the pile at a velocity of $5.42 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
(a) Before impact, kinetic energy of
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { pile driver } & =\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(500)(5.42)^{2} \\
& =7.34 \mathrm{~kJ}
\end{aligned}$$

Kinetic energy after impact $=7.34-3=$ 4.34 kJ . Thus the piledriver and pile together have a mass of $500+200=700 \mathrm{~kg}$ and possess kinetic energy of 4.34 kJ .

Hence
$$4.34 \times 10^{3}=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(700) v^{2}$$
from which, velocity $v=\sqrt{\left(\frac{2 \times 4.34 \times 10^{3}}{700}\right)}$
$$=3.52 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$$

Thus, the common velocity after impact is $3.52 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
(b) The kinetic energy after impact is absorbed in overcoming the resistance of the ground, in a distance of 200 mm .
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Kinetic energy } & =\text { work done } \\
& =\text { resistance } \times \text { distance } \\
4.34 \times 10^{3} & =\text { resistance } \times 0.200
\end{aligned}$$
i.e.
from which,
$$\text { resistance }=\frac{4.34 \times 10^{3}}{0.200}=21700 \mathrm{~N}$$

Hence, the average resistance of the ground is 21.7 kN .

Problem 27. A car of mass 600 kg reduces speed from $90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ to $54 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$ in 15 s .

Determine the braking power required to give this change of speed.

Change in kinetic energy of car
$$=\frac{1}{2} m v_{1}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{2}^{2}$$
where
$$\begin{aligned}
m & =\text { mass of car }=600 \mathrm{~kg} \\
v_{1} & =\text { initial velocity }=90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h} \\
& =\frac{90}{3.6} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}=25 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$
and
$$\begin{aligned}
v_{2} & =\text { final velocity }=54 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h} \\
& =\frac{54}{3.6} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}=15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, change in
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { kinetic energy } & =\frac{1}{2} m\left(v_{1}^{2}-v_{2}^{2}\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{2}(600)\left(25^{2}-15^{2}\right) \\
& =120000 \mathrm{~J} . \\
\text { Braking power } & =\frac{\text { change in energy }}{\text { time taken }} \\
& =\frac{120000 \mathrm{~J}}{15 \mathrm{~s}} \\
& =\mathbf{8 0 0 0} \mathbf{W} \text { or } \mathbf{8} \mathbf{~ k W}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{14.5 Kinetic energy of rotation}

When linear motion takes place,
$$\text { kinetic energy }=\sum \frac{\Delta m}{2} v^{2},$$
but when rotational motion takes place,
$$\text { kinetic energy }=\frac{1}{2} \sum \Delta m(\omega r)^{2}$$

Since $\omega$ is a constant,
$$\text { kinetic energy }=\omega^{2} \frac{1}{2} \sum \Delta m r^{2}$$

But
$$\sum \Delta m r^{2}=I$$

Therefore,
$$\text { kinetic energy (in rotation) }=\frac{1}{2} I \omega^{2}(J)$$
where $I=$ the mass moment of inertia about the point of rotation
and $\quad \omega=$ angular velocity.

Problem 28. Calculate the kinetic energy of a solid flat disc of diameter 0.5 m and of a uniform thickness of 0.1 m , rotating about its centre at 40 rpm . Take the density of the material as $7860 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$.

Angular velocity,
$$\begin{aligned}
\omega & =2 \pi \frac{\mathrm{rad}}{\mathrm{rev}} \times 40 \frac{\mathrm{rev}}{\mathrm{~min}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~min}}{60 \mathrm{~s}} \\
& =4.189 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$

From Table 13.1, page 150,
$$\begin{aligned}
& I=\rho \times \pi R^{2} \times t \times \frac{R^{2}}{2} \\
& \begin{aligned}
= & 7860 \frac{\mathrm{~kg}}{\mathrm{~m}^{3}} \times \pi \times 0.25^{2} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
& \times 0.1 \mathrm{~m} \times \frac{0.25^{2} \mathrm{~m}^{2}}{2}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. $\quad I=4.823 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$

Hence, kinetic energy
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{2} I \omega^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \times 4.823 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \times(4.189)^{2} \frac{1}{s^{2}} \\
& =\mathbf{4 2 . 3 2} \mathbf{~ J .}

\section*{Simple machines}

At the end of this chapter you should be able to:
- define a simple machine
- define force ratio, movement ratio, efficiency and limiting efficiency

- understand and perform calculations with gear trains
- understand and perform calculations with levers

\subsection*{18.1 Machines}

A machine is a device that can change the magnitude or line of action, or both magnitude and line of action of a force. A simple machine usually amplifies an input force, called the effort, to give a larger output force, called the load. Some typical examples of simple machines include pulley systems, screwjacks, gear systems and lever systems.

\subsection*{18.2 Force ratio, movement ratio and efficiency}

The force ratio or mechanical advantage is defined as the ratio of load to effort, i.e.
$$\text { Force ratio }=\frac{\text { load }}{\text { effort }}$$

Since both load and effort are measured in newtons, force ratio is a ratio of the same units and thus is a dimension-less quantity.

The movement ratio or velocity ratio is defined as the ratio of the distance moved by the effort to the distance moved by the load, i.e.
$$\text { Movement ratio }=\frac{\begin{array}{c}
\text { distance moved } \\
\text { by the effort }
\end{array}}{\begin{array}{c}
\text { distance moved } \\
\text { by the load }
\end{array}}$$

Since the numerator and denominator are both measured in metres, movement ratio is a ratio of the same units and thus is a dimension-less quantity.

The efficiency of a simple machine is defined as the ratio of the force ratio to the movement ratio, i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Efficiency } & =\frac{\text { force ratio }}{\text { movement ratio }} \\
& =\frac{\text { mechanical advantage }}{\text { velocity ratio }}
\end{aligned}$$

Since the numerator and denominator are both dimension-less quantities, efficiency is a dimensionless quantity. It is usually expressed as a percentage, thus:
$$\text { Efficiency }=\frac{\text { force ratio }}{\text { movement ratio }} \times 100 \%$$

Due to the effects of friction and inertia associated with the movement of any object, some of the input energy to a machine is converted into heat and losses occur. Since losses occur, the energy output of a machine is less than the energy input, thus the mechanical efficiency of any machine cannot reach 100\%

For simple machines, the relationship between effort and load is of the form: $F_{e}=a F_{l}+b$, where $F_{e}$ is the effort, $F_{l}$ is the load and $a$ and $b$ are constants.
From equation (18.1),
force ratio $=\frac{\text { load }}{\text { effort }}=\frac{F_{l}}{F_{e}}=\frac{F_{l}}{a F_{l}+b}$

Dividing both numerator and denominator by $F_{l}$ gives:
$$\frac{F_{l}}{a F_{l}+b}=\frac{1}{a+\frac{b}{F_{l}}}$$

When the load is large, $F_{l}$ is large and $\frac{b}{F_{l}}$ is small compared with $a$. The force ratio then becomes approximately equal to $\frac{1}{a}$ and is called the limiting force ratio, i.e
$$\text { limiting ratio }=\frac{1}{a}$$

The limiting efficiency of a simple machine is defined as the ratio of the limiting force ratio to the movement ratio, i.e.

\section*{Limiting efficiency}
$$=\frac{1}{\mathrm{a} \times \text { movement ratio }} \times 100 \%$$
where $a$ is the constant for the law of the machine:
$$F_{e}=a F_{l}+b$$

Due to friction and inertia, the limiting efficiency of simple machines is usually well below $100 \%$.

Problem 1. A simple machine raises a load of 160 kg through a distance of 1.6 m . The effort applied to the machine is 200 N and moves through a distance of 16 m . Taking $g$ as $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, determine the force ratio, movement ratio and efficiency of the machine.

From equation (18.1),
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { force ratio } & =\frac{\text { load }}{\text { effort }}=\frac{160 \mathrm{~kg}}{200 \mathrm{~N}} \\
& =\frac{160 \times 9.8 \mathrm{~N}}{200 \mathrm{~N}}=\mathbf{7 . 8 4}
\end{aligned}$$

From equation (18.2),
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { movement ratio } & =\frac{\text { distance moved by the effort }}{\text { distance moved by the load }} \\
& =\frac{16 \mathrm{~m}}{1.6 \mathrm{~m}}=\mathbf{1 0}
\end{aligned}$$

From equation (18.3),
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { efficiency } & =\frac{\text { force ratio }}{\text { movement ratio }} \times 100 \% \\
& =\frac{7.84}{10} \times 100=\mathbf{7 8 . 4 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 2. For the simple machine of Problem 1, determine: (a) the distance moved by the effort to move the load through a distance of 0.9 m , (b) the effort which would be required to raise a load of 200 kg , assuming the same efficiency, (c) the efficiency if, due to lubrication, the effort to raise the 160 kg load is reduced to 180 N .
(a) Since the movement ratio is 10 , then from equation (18.2),
distance moved by the effort
$$\begin{aligned}
& =10 \times \text { distance moved by the load } \\
& =10 \times 0.9=\mathbf{9} \mathbf{~ m}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) Since the force ratio is 7.84 , then from equation (18.1),
$$\text { effort }=\frac{\text { load }}{7.84}=\frac{200 \times 9.8}{7.84}=\mathbf{2 5 0} \mathbf{~ N}$$
(c) The new force ratio is given by
$$\frac{\text { load }}{\text { effort }}=\frac{160 \times 9.8}{180}=8.711$$

Hence the new efficiency after lubrication
$$=\frac{8.711}{10} \times 100=\mathbf{8 7 . 1 1 \%}$$

Problem 3. In a test on a simple machine, the effort/load graph was a straight line of the form $F_{e}=a F_{l}+b$. Two values lying on the graph were at $F_{e}=10 \mathrm{~N}, F_{l}=30 \mathrm{~N}$, and at $F_{e}=74 \mathrm{~N}, F_{l}=350 \mathrm{~N}$. The movement ratio of the machine was 17.
Determine: (a) the limiting force ratio, (b) the limiting efficiency of the machine.
(a) The equation $F_{e}=a F_{l}+b$ is of the form $y=m x+c$, where $m$ is the gradient of the graph. The slope of the line passing through
points $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ of the graph $y=m x+c$ is given by:
$$m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$$

Thus for $F_{e}=a F_{l}+b$, the slope $a$ is given by:
$$a=\frac{74-10}{350-30}=\frac{64}{320}=0.2$$

The limiting force ratio is $\frac{1}{a}$, that is $\frac{1}{0.2}=\mathbf{5}$
(b) The limiting efficiency
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{a \times \text { movement ratio }} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{1}{0.2 \times 17} \times 100=\mathbf{2 9 . 4 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

\section*{Exercise 89 Further problems on force ratio, movement ratio and efficiency}

[410 N, 49\%]

\subsection*{18.3 Pulleys}

A pulley system is a simple machine. A singlepulley system, shown in Figure 18.1(a), changes the line of action of the effort, but does not change the magnitude of the force. A two-pulley system, shown in Figure 18.1(b), changes both the line of action and the magnitude of the force.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-068.jpg?height=407&width=380&top_left_y=1223&top_left_x=896)
(a)

Figure 18.1(a)

Theoretically, each of the ropes marked (i) and (ii) share the load equally, thus the theoretical effort is only half of the load, i.e. the theoretical force ratio is 2 . In practice the actual force ratio is less than 2 due to losses. A three-pulley system is shown in Figure 18.1(c). Each of the ropes marked (i), (ii) and (iii) carry one-third of the load, thus the theoretical force ratio is 3 . In general, for a multiple pulley system having a total of $n$ pulleys, the theoretical force ratio is $n$. Since the theoretical efficiency of a pulley system (neglecting losses) is 100
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-069.jpg?height=750&width=398&top_left_y=144&top_left_x=87)

Figure 18.1(b)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-069.jpg?height=736&width=379&top_left_y=1001&top_left_x=94)

Figure 18.1(c)
and since from equation (18.3),
$$\text { efficiency }=\frac{\text { force ratio }}{\text { movement ratio }} \times 100 \%$$
it follows that when the force ratio is $n$,
$$100=\frac{n}{\text { movement ratio }} \times 100$$
that is, the movement ratio is also $n$.

Problem 4. A load of 80 kg is lifted by a three-pulley system similar to that shown in Figure 18.1(c) and the applied effort is 392 N. Calculate (a) the force ratio, (b) the movement ratio, (c) the efficiency of the system. Take $g$ to be $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.
(a) From equation (18.1), the force ratio is given by $\frac{\text { load }}{\text { effort }}$
The load is 80 kg , i.e. $(80 \times 9.8) \mathrm{N}$, hence
$$\text { force ratio }=\frac{80 \times 9.8}{392}=\mathbf{2}$$
(b) From above, for a system having $n$ pulleys, the movement ratio is $n$. Thus for a three-pulley system, the movement ratio is $\mathbf{3}$
(c) From equation (18.3),
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { efficiency } & =\frac{\text { force ratio }}{\text { movement ratio }} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{2}{3} \times 100=\mathbf{6 6 . 6 7 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 5. A pulley system consists of two blocks, each containing three pulleys and connected as shown in Figure 18.2. An effort of 400 N is required to raise a load of 1500 N. Determine (a) the force ratio, (b) the movement ratio, (c) the efficiency of the pulley system.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-069.jpg?height=443&width=176&top_left_y=1530&top_left_x=940)

Figure 18.2
(a) From equation (18.1),
$$\text { force ratio }=\frac{\text { load }}{\text { effort }}=\frac{1500}{400}=\mathbf{3 . 7 5}$$
(b) An $n$-pulley system has a movement ratio of $n$, hence this 6-pulley system has a movement ratio of 6
(c) From equation (18.3),
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { efficiency } & =\frac{\text { force ratio }}{\text { movement ratio }} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{3.75}{6} \times 100=\mathbf{6 2 . 5 \%}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

[1.5 kN, 93.75\%]

\subsection*{18.4 The screw-jack}

A simple screw-jack is shown in Figure 18.3 and is a simple machine since it changes both the magnitude and the line of action of a force.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-070.jpg?height=512&width=532&top_left_y=1666&top_left_x=97)

Figure 18.3

The screw of the table of the jack is located in a fixed nut in the body of the jack. As the table is rotated by means of a bar, it raises or lowers a load placed on the table. For a single-start thread, as shown, for one complete revolution of the table, the effort moves through a distance $2 \pi r$, and the load moves through a distance equal to the lead of the screw, say, $L$.
$$\text { Movement ratio }=\frac{2 \pi r}{L}$$

Problem 6. A screw-jack is being used to support the axle of a car, the load on it being 2.4 kN . The screw jack has an effort of effective radius 200 mm and a single-start square thread, having a lead of 5 mm . Determine the efficiency of the jack if an effort of 60 N is required to raise the car axle.

From equation (18.3),
$$\text { efficiency }=\frac{\text { force ratio }}{\text { movement ratio }} \times 100 \%$$
where force ratio $=\frac{\text { load }}{\text { effort }}=\frac{2400 \mathrm{~N}}{60 \mathrm{~N}}=40$
From equation (18.4),
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { movement ratio } & =\frac{2 \pi r}{L}=\frac{2 \pi(200) \mathrm{mm}}{5 \mathrm{~mm}} \\
& =251.3
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\quad$ efficiency $=\frac{\text { force ratio }}{\text { movement ratio }} \times 100$
$$=\frac{40}{251.3} \times 100=\mathbf{1 5 . 9 \%}$$

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

[16.91 N]

\subsection*{18.5 Gear trains}

A simple gear train is used to transmit rotary motion and can change both the magnitude and the line of action of a force, hence is a simple machine. The gear train shown in Figure 18.4 consists of spur gears and has an effort applied to one gear, called the driver, and a load applied to the other gear, called the follower.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-071.jpg?height=508&width=592&top_left_y=962&top_left_x=98)

Figure 18.4

In such a system, the teeth on the wheels are so spaced that they exactly fill the circumference with a whole number of identical teeth, and the teeth on the driver and follower mesh without interference. Under these conditions, the number of teeth on the driver and follower are in direct proportion to the circumference of these wheels, i.e.
$$\frac{\begin{array}{c}
\text { number of teeth } \\
\text { on driver }
\end{array}}{\begin{array}{c}
\text { number of teeth } \\
\text { on follower }
\end{array}}=\frac{\begin{array}{c}
\text { circumference } \\
\text { of driver }
\end{array}}{\begin{array}{c}
\text { circumference } \\
\text { of follower }
\end{array}}$$

If there are, say, 40 teeth on the driver and 20 teeth on the follower then the follower makes two revolutions for each revolution of the driver. In general:
$\frac{$\begin{tabular}{c}
\text { number of revolutions } \\
\text { made by driver }
\end{tabular}}{\begin{tabular}{c}
\text { number of revolutions } \\
\text { made by the follower }
\end{tabular}}$=\frac{$\begin{tabular}{c}
\text { number of teeth } \\
\text { on follower }
\end{tabular}}{\begin{tabular}{c}
\text { number of teeth } \\
\text { on driver }
\end{tabular}}

It follows from equation (18.6) that the speeds of the wheels in a gear train are inversely proportional to the number of teeth. The ratio of the speed of the driver wheel to that of the follower is the movement ratio, i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Movement ratio } & =\frac{\text { speed of driver }}{\text { speed of follower }} \\
& =\frac{\text { teeth on follower }}{\text { teeth on driver }}
\end{aligned}$$

When the same direction of rotation is required on both the driver and the follower an idler wheel is used as shown in Figure 18.5.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-071.jpg?height=480&width=756&top_left_y=990&top_left_x=893)

Figure 18.5

Let the driver, idler, and follower be $A, B$ and $C$, respectively, and let $N$ be the speed of rotation and $T$ be the number of teeth. Then from equation (18.7),
and
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{N_{B}}{N_{A}}=\frac{T_{A}}{T_{B}} \text { or } N_{A}=N_{B} \frac{T_{B}}{T_{A}} \\
& \frac{N_{C}}{N_{B}}=\frac{T_{B}}{T_{C}} \text { or } N_{C}=N_{B} \frac{T_{B}}{T_{C}}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus
$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\text { speed of } A}{\text { speed of } C} & =\frac{N_{A}}{N_{C}}=\frac{N_{B} \frac{T_{B}}{T_{A}}}{N_{B} \frac{T_{B}}{T_{C}}} \\
& =\frac{T_{B}}{T_{A}} \times \frac{T_{C}}{T_{B}}=\frac{T_{C}}{T_{A}}
\end{aligned}$$

This shows that the movement ratio is independent of the idler, only the direction of the follower being altered.

A compound gear train is shown in Figure 18.6, in which gear wheels $B$ and $C$ are fixed to the same shaft and hence $N_{B}=N_{C}$.
From equation (18.7),
$$\frac{N_{A}}{N_{B}}=\frac{T_{B}}{T_{A}} \text { i.e. } N_{B}=N_{A} \times \frac{T_{A}}{T_{B}}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-072.jpg?height=366&width=760&top_left_y=581&top_left_x=98)

Figure 18.6

Also,
$$\frac{N_{D}}{N_{C}}=\frac{T_{C}}{T_{D}} \text { i.e. } N_{D}=N_{C} \times \frac{T_{C}}{T_{D}}$$

But $N_{B}=N_{C}$, and
$$N_{D}=N_{B} \times \frac{T_{C}}{T_{D}}$$
therefore
$$N_{D}=N_{A} \times \frac{T_{A}}{T_{B}} \times \frac{T_{C}}{T_{D}}$$

For compound gear trains having, say, $P$ gear wheels,
$$N_{P}=N_{A} \times \frac{T_{A}}{T_{B}} \times \frac{T_{C}}{T_{D}} \times \frac{T_{E}}{T_{F}} \ldots \ldots \times \frac{T_{O}}{T_{P}}$$
from which,
movement ratio $=\frac{N_{A}}{N_{P}}=\frac{T_{B}}{T_{A}} \times \frac{T_{D}}{T_{C}} \ldots \ldots \times \frac{T_{P}}{T_{O}}$

Problem 7. A driver gear on a shaft of a motor has 35 teeth and meshes with a follower having 98 teeth. If the speed of the
motor is 1400 revolutions per minute, find the speed of rotation of the follower.

From equation (18.7),
$$\frac{\text { speed of driver }}{\text { speed of follower }}=\frac{\text { teeth on follower }}{\text { teeth on driver }}$$
i.e.
$$\frac{1400}{\text { speed of follower }}=\frac{98}{35}$$

Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { speed of follower } & =\frac{1400 \times 35}{98} \\
& =\mathbf{5 0 0} \mathbf{~ r e v} / \mathbf{m i n}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 8. A compound gear train similar to that shown in Figure 18.6 consists of a driver gear $A$, having 40 teeth, engaging with gear $B$, having 160 teeth. Attached to the same shaft as $B$, gear $C$ has 48 teeth and meshes with gear $D$ on the output shaft, having 96 teeth. Determine (a) the movement ratio of this gear system and (b) the efficiency when the force ratio is 6 .
(a) From equation (18.8), the speed of $D$
$$=\text { speed of } A \times \frac{T_{A}}{T_{B}} \times \frac{T_{C}}{T_{D}}$$

From equation (18.7), movement ratio
$$\begin{aligned}
=\frac{\text { speed of } A}{\text { speed of } D} & =\frac{T_{B}}{T_{A}} \times \frac{T_{D}}{T_{C}} \\
& =\frac{160}{40} \times \frac{96}{48}=\mathbf{8}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) The efficiency of any simple machine is
$$\frac{\text { force ratio }}{\text { movement ratio }} \times 100 \%$$

Thus, efficiency $=\frac{6}{8} \times 100=\mathbf{7 5 \%}$

[250, 3.6]

\subsection*{18.6 Levers}

A lever can alter both the magnitude and the line of action of a force and is thus classed as a simple machine. There are three types or orders of levers, as shown in Figure 18.7.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-073.jpg?height=1008&width=467&top_left_y=1173&top_left_x=88)

Figure 18.7

A lever of the first order has the fulcrum placed between the effort and the load, as shown in Figure 18.7(a).

A lever of the second order has the load placed between the effort and the fulcrum, as shown in Figure 18.7(b).

A lever of the third order has the effort applied between the load and the fulcrum, as shown in Figure 18.7(c).

Problems on levers can largely be solved by applying the principle of moments (see Chapter 5). Thus for the lever shown in Figure 18.7(a), when the lever is in equilibrium,
$$\text { anticlockwise moment }=\text { clockwise moment }$$
i.e.
$$a \times F_{l}=b \times F_{e}$$

Thus, force ratio
$$=\frac{F_{l}}{F_{e}}=\frac{b}{a}=\frac{\text { distance of effort from fulcrum }}{\text { distance of load from fulcrum }}$$

Problem 9. The load on a first-order lever, similar to that shown in Figure 18.7(a), is 1.2 kN . Determine the effort, the force ratio and the movement ratio when the distance between the fulcrum and the load is 0.5 m and the distance between the fulcrum and effort is 1.5 m . Assume the lever is $100 \%$ efficient.

Applying the principle of moments, for equilibrium:
i.e.
$$\text { anticlockwise moment }=\text { clockwise moment }$$

Hence,
$$1200 \mathrm{~N} \times 0.5 \mathrm{~m}=\text { effort } \times 1.5 \mathrm{~m}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { effort } & =\frac{1200 \times 0.5}{1.5} \\
& =\mathbf{4 0 0} \mathbf{~ N}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\text { force ratio }=\frac{F_{l}}{F_{e}}=\frac{1200}{400}=\mathbf{3}$$

Alternatively, $\quad$ force ratio $=\frac{b}{a}=\frac{1.5}{0.5}=\mathbf{3}$
This result shows that to lift a load of, say, 300 N , an effort of 100 N is required.

Since, from equation (3),
$$\text { efficiency }=\frac{\text { force ratio }}{\text { movement ratio }} \times 100 \%$$
then,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { movement ratio } & =\frac{\text { force ratio }}{\text { efficiency }} \times 100 \\
& =\frac{3}{100} \times 100=\mathbf{3}
\end{aligned}$$

This result shows that to raise the load by, say, 100 mm , the effort has to move 300 mm .

Problem 10. A second-order lever, $A B$, is in a horizontal position. The fulcrum is at point $C$. An effort of 60 N applied at $B$ just moves a load at point $D$, when $B D$ is 0.5 m and $B C$ is 1.25 m . Calculate the load and the force ratio of the lever.

A second-order lever system is shown in Figure 18.7(b). Taking moments about the fulcrum as the load is just moving, gives:
$$\text { anticlockwise moment }=\text { clockwise moment }$$
i.e.
$$60 \mathrm{~N} \times 1.25 \mathrm{~m}=\text { load } \times 0.75 \mathrm{~m}$$

Thus,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { load } & =\frac{60 \times 1.25}{0.75} \\
& =\mathbf{1 0 0 ~ N}
\end{aligned}$$

From equation (1),
$$\text { force ratio }=\frac{\text { load }}{\text { effort }}=\frac{100}{60}=\mathbf{1 . 6 7}$$

Alternatively,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { force ratio } & =\frac{\text { distance of effort from fulcrum }}{\text { distance of load from fulcrum }} \\
& =\frac{1.25}{0.75}=\mathbf{1 . 6 7}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Ideal gas laws}

\subsection*{23.1 Introduction}

The relationships that exist between pressure, volume and temperature in a gas are given in a set of laws called the gas laws.

\subsection*{23.2 Boyle's law}

Boyle's law states:
the volume $V$ of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its absolute pressure $p$ at constant temperature.
i.e. $p \propto \frac{1}{V}$ or $p=\frac{k}{V}$ or $p \boldsymbol{V}=\boldsymbol{k}$ at constant temperature, where $p=$ absolute pressure in Pascal's $(\mathrm{Pa}), V=$ volume in $\mathrm{m}^{3}$, and $k=\mathrm{a}$ constant.

Changes that occur at constant temperature are called isothermal changes. When a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature changes from pressure $p_{1}$ and volume $V_{1}$ to pressure $p_{2}$ and volume $V_{2}$ then:
$$p_{1} V_{1}=p_{2} V_{2}$$

Problem 1. A gas occupies a volume of $0.10 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ at a pressure of 1.8 MPa . Determine (a) the pressure if the volume is changed to $0.06 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ at constant temperature, and (b) the volume if the pressure is changed to 2.4 MPa at constant temperature.
(a) Since the change occurs at constant temperature (i.e. an isothermal change), Boyle's law applies, i.e. $p_{1} V_{1}=p_{2} V_{2}$, where $p_{1}=$ $1.8 \mathrm{MPa}, V_{1}=0.10 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ and $V_{2}=0.06 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$. Hence $(1.8)(0.10)=p_{2}(0.06)$ from which,
$$\text { pressure } p_{2}=\frac{1.8 \times 0.10}{0.06}=\mathbf{3} \mathbf{~ M P a}$$
(b) $p_{1} V_{1}=p_{2} V_{2}$ where $p_{1}=1.8 \mathrm{MPa}$, $V_{1}=0.10 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ and $p_{2}=2.4 \mathrm{MPa}$.

Hence $\quad(1.8)(0.10)=(2.4) V_{2}$ from which
$$\text { volume } \begin{aligned}
V_{\mathbf{2}} & =\frac{1.8 \times 0.10}{2.4} \\
& =\mathbf{0 . 0 7 5} \mathbf{~ m}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 2. In an isothermal process, a mass of gas has its volume reduced from $3200 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$ to $2000 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$. If the initial pressure of the gas is 110 kPa , determine the final pressure.

Since the process is isothermal, it takes place at constant temperature and hence Boyle's law applies, i.e. $p_{1} V_{1}=p_{2} V_{2}$, where $p_{1}=110 \mathrm{kPa}$, $V_{1}=3200 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{2}=2000 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$.

Hence $\quad(110)(3200)=p_{2}(2000)$, from which,
$$\text { final pressure, } \begin{aligned}
p_{2} & =\frac{110 \times 3200}{2000} \\
& =\mathbf{1 7 6} \mathbf{~ k P a}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 3. Some gas occupies a volume of $1.5 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ in a cylinder at a pressure of 250 kPa . A piston, sliding in the cylinder, compresses the gas isothermally until the volume is $0.5 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$. If the area of the piston is $300 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, calculate the force on the piston when the gas is compressed.

An isothermal process means constant temperature and thus Boyle's law applies, i.e. $p_{1} V_{1}=p_{2} V_{2}$, where $V_{1}=1.5 \mathrm{~m}^{3}, V_{2}=0.5 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ and $p_{1}=250 \mathrm{kPa}$.

Hence, $\quad(250)(1.5)=p_{2}(0.5)$, from which,
$$\text { pressure, } p_{2}=\frac{250 \times 1.5}{0.5}=750 \mathrm{kPa}$$

Pressure $=\frac{\text { force }}{\text { area }}$, from which,
force $=$ pressure $\times$ area.

Hence, force on the piston
$$=\left(750 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~Pa}\right)\left(300 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)=\mathbf{2 2 . 5} \mathbf{~ k N}$$

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

\section*{Exercise 119 Further problems on Boyle's law}
1. The pressure of a mass of gas is increased from 150 kPa to 750 kPa at constant temperature. Determine the final volume of the gas, if its initial volume is $1.5 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$.
[ $0.3 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ ]
2. In an isothermal process, a mass of gas has its volume reduced from $50 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ to $32 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. If the initial pressure of the gas is 80 kPa , determine its final pressure.
[ 125 kPa ]
3. The piston of an air compressor compresses air to $\frac{1}{4}$ of its original volume during its stroke. Determine the final pressure of the air if the original pressure is 100 kPa , assuming an isothermal change.
[ 400 kPa ]
4. A quantity of gas in a cylinder occupies a volume of $2 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ at a pressure of 300 kPa . A piston slides in the cylinder and compresses the gas, according to Boyle's law, until the volume is $0.5 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$. If the area of the piston is $0.02 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, calculate the force on the piston when the gas is compressed.
[24 kN]

\subsection*{23.3 Charles' law}

Charles' law states:
for a given mass of gas at constant pressure, the volume $V$ is directly proportional to its thermodynamic temperature $T$,
i.e. $V \propto T$ or $V=k T$ or $\frac{\boldsymbol{V}}{\boldsymbol{T}}=\boldsymbol{k}$
at constant pressure, where
$T=$ thermodynamic temperature in Kelvin (K).

A process that takes place at constant pressure is called an isobaric process. The relationship between the Celsius scale of temperature and the thermodynamic or absolute scale is given by:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \quad \text { kelvin }=\text { degrees Celsius }+273 \\
& \text { i.e. } \boldsymbol{K}={ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}+\mathbf{2 7 3} \text { or }{ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}=\mathbf{K}-\mathbf{2 7 3}
\end{aligned}$$
(as stated in Chapter 19).
If a given mass of gas at a constant pressure occupies a volume $V_{1}$ at a temperature $T_{1}$ and a volume $V_{2}$ at temperature $T_{2}$, then
$$\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}$$

> Problem 4. A gas occupies a volume of 1.2 litres at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine the volume it occupies at $130^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ if the pressure is kept constant.

Since the change occurs at constant pressure (i.e. an isobaric process), Charles' law applies,
i.e. $\quad \frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}$
where $V_{1}=1.21, T_{1}=20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=(20+273) K=$ 293 K and $T_{2}=(130+273) K=403 \mathrm{~K}$.

Hence, $\quad \frac{1.2}{293}=\frac{V_{2}}{403}$
from which, volume at $\mathbf{1 3 0}{ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{V}_{2}=\frac{(1.2)(403)}{293}$
$=1.65$ litres

Problem 5. Gas at a temperature of $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ has its volume reduced by one-third in an isobaric process. Calculate the final temperature of the gas.

Since the process is isobaric it takes place at constant pressure and hence Charles' law applies,
i.e. $\quad \frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}$
where $T_{1}=(150+273) K=423 \mathrm{~K}$ and $V_{2}=\frac{2}{3} \mathrm{~V}_{1}$.

Hence
$$\frac{V_{1}}{423}=\frac{\frac{2}{3} V_{1}}{T_{2}}$$
from which, final temperature,
$\boldsymbol{T}_{2}=\frac{2}{3}(423)=\mathbf{2 8 2 ~ K}$ or $(282-273)^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ i.e. $\mathbf{9}^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

\section*{Exercise 120 Further problems on Charles' law}
1. Some gas initially at $16^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is heated to $96^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at constant pressure. If the initial volume of the gas is $0.8 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$, determine the final volume of the gas. $\quad\left[1.02 \mathrm{~m}^{3}\right]$
2. A gas is contained in a vessel of volume $0.02 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ at a pressure of 300 kPa and a temperature of $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The gas is passed into a vessel of volume $0.015 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$. Determine to what temperature the gas must be cooled for the pressure to remain the same.
$\left[-57^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right]$
3. In an isobaric process gas at a temperature of $120^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ has its volume reduced by a sixth. Determine the final temperature of the gas.
$\left[54.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right]$

\subsection*{23.4 The pressure law}

The pressure law states:
the pressure p of a fixed mass of gas is directly proportional to its thermodynamic temperature $T$ at constant volume.
i.e. $\quad p \propto T$ or $p=k T$ or $\frac{\boldsymbol{p}}{\boldsymbol{T}}=\boldsymbol{k}$

When a fixed mass of gas at constant volume changes from pressure $p_{1}$ and temperature $T_{1}$, to pressure $p_{2}$ and temperature $T_{2}$ then:
$$\frac{p_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{p_{2}}{T_{2}}$$

Problem 6. Gas initially at a temperature of $17^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and pressure 150 kPa is heated at
constant volume until its temperature is $124^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine the final pressure of the gas, assuming no loss of gas.

Since the gas is at constant volume, the pressure law applies, i.e. $\frac{p_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{p_{2}}{T_{2}}$ where $T_{1}=(17+273) \mathrm{K}=$ $290 \mathrm{~K}, T_{2}=(124+273) \mathrm{K}=397 \mathrm{~K}$ and $p_{1}=150 \mathrm{kPa}$.

Hence, $\quad \frac{150}{290}=\frac{p_{2}}{397}$ from which, final pressure,
$$p_{2}=\frac{(150)(397)}{290}=205.3 \mathrm{kPa}$$

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

1. Gas, initially at a temperature of $27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and pressure 100 kPa , is heated at constant volume until its temperature is $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Assuming no loss of gas, determine the final pressure of the gas.
[141 kPa]

\subsection*{23.5 Dalton's law of partial pressure}

\section*{Dalton's law of partial pressure states:}
the total pressure of a mixture of gases occupying a given volume is equal to the sum of the pressures of each gas, considered separately, at constant temperature.

The pressure of each constituent gas when occupying a fixed volume alone is known as the partial pressure of that gas.

An ideal gas is one that completely obeys the gas laws given in Sections 23.2 to 23.5. In practice no gas is an ideal gas, although air is very close to being one. For calculation purposes the difference between an ideal and an actual gas is very small.

Problem 7. A gas $R$ in a container exerts a pressure of 200 kPa at a temperature of $18^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Gas $Q$ is added to the container and the pressure increases to 320 kPa at the same temperature. Determine the pressure that gas $Q$ alone exerts at the same temperature.

Initial pressure $p_{R}=200 \mathrm{kPa}$, and the pressure of gases $R$ and $Q$ together, $p=p_{R}+p_{Q}=320 \mathrm{kPa}$.
By Dalton's law of partial pressure, the pressure of gas $Q$ alone is $p_{Q}=p-p_{R}=320-200=\mathbf{1 2 0 ~ k P a}$

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

Exercise 122 A further problem on Dalton's law of partial pressure
1. A gas $A$ in a container exerts a pressure of 120 kPa at a temperature of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Gas $B$ is added to the container and the pressure increases to 300 kPa at the same temperature. Determine the pressure that gas $B$ alone exerts at the same temperature.
[180 kPa]

\subsection*{23.6 Characteristic gas equation}

Frequently, when a gas is undergoing some change, the pressure, temperature and volume all vary simultaneously. Provided there is no change in the mass of a gas, the above gas laws can be combined, giving
$$\frac{p_{1} V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{p_{2} V_{2}}{T_{2}}=\mathbf{k} \quad \text { where } \mathrm{k} \text { is a constant. }$$

For an ideal gas, constant $k=m R$, where $m$ is the mass of the gas in kg, and $R$ is the characteristic gas constant,
i.e. $\quad \frac{p V}{T}=m R$
or $\quad \boldsymbol{p} \boldsymbol{V}=\boldsymbol{m} \boldsymbol{R} \boldsymbol{T}$
This is called the characteristic gas equation. In this equation, $p=$ absolute pressure in Pascal's, $V=$ volume in $\mathrm{m}^{3}, m=$ mass in kg ,
$R=$ characteristic gas constant in $\mathrm{J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$, and $T=$ thermodynamic temperature in Kelvin.

Some typical values of the characteristic gas constant $R$ include: air, $287 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$, hydrogen $4160 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$, oxygen $260 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$ and carbon dioxide $184 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$.

Standard temperature and pressure (i.e. STP) refers to a temperature of $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, i.e. 273 K , and normal atmospheric pressure of 101.325 kPa .

\subsection*{23.7 Worked problems on the characteristic gas equation}

Problem 8. A gas occupies a volume of $2.0 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ when at a pressure of 100 kPa and a temperature of $120^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine the volume of the gas at $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ if the pressure is increased to 250 kPa .

Using the combined gas law:
$$\frac{p_{1} V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{p_{2} V_{2}}{T_{2}}$$
where $V_{1}=2.0 \mathrm{~m}^{3}, p_{1}=100 \mathrm{kPa}, p_{2}=250 \mathrm{kPa}$, $T_{1}=(120+273) \mathrm{K}=393 \mathrm{~K}$ and
$T_{2}=(15+273) \mathrm{K}=288 \mathrm{~K}$, gives:
$$\frac{(100)(2.0)}{393}=\frac{(250) V_{2}}{288}$$
from which, volume at $\mathbf{1 5}^{\boldsymbol{\circ}} \mathbf{C}$,
$$V_{2}=\frac{(100)(2.0)(288)}{(393)(250)}=\mathbf{0 . 5 8 6} \mathbf{~ m}^{3}$$

Problem 9. $20000 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$ of air initially at a pressure of 600 kPa and temperature $180^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is expanded to a volume of $70000 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$ at a pressure of 120 kPa . Determine the final temperature of the air, assuming no losses during the process.

Using the combined gas law:
$$\frac{p_{1} V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{p_{2} V_{2}}{T_{2}}$$
where $\mathrm{V}_{1}=20000 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}, V_{2}=70000 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$, $p_{1}=600 \mathrm{kPa}, p_{2}=120 \mathrm{kPa}$, and
$T_{1}=(180+273) \mathrm{K}=453 \mathrm{~K}$, gives:
$$\frac{(600)(20000)}{453}=\frac{(120)(70000)}{T_{2}}$$
from which, final temperature,

Problem 10. Some air at a temperature of $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and pressure 4 bar occupies a volume of $0.05 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$. Determine the mass of the air assuming the characteristic gas constant for air to be $287 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$.

From above, $p V=m R T$, where $p=4$ bar $=$ $4 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ (since 1 bar $=10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ - see Chapter 21), $V=0.05 \mathrm{~m}^{3}, T=(40+273) K=313 \mathrm{~K}$, and $\mathrm{R}=287 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$.

Hence $\quad\left(4 \times 10^{5}\right)(0.05)=m(287)(313)$
from which, mass of air,
$$\boldsymbol{m}=\frac{\left(4 \times 10^{5}\right)(0.05)}{(287)(313)}=\mathbf{0 . 2 2 3} \mathbf{~ k g} \text { or } \mathbf{2 2 3} \mathbf{~ g}$$

Problem 11. A cylinder of helium has a volume of $600 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. The cylinder contains 200 g of helium at a temperature of $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine the pressure of the helium if the characteristic gas constant for helium is $2080 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$.

From the characteristic gas equation, $p V=m R T$, where $V=600 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}=600 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$,
$m=200 \mathrm{~g}=0.2 \mathrm{~kg}, T=(25+273) \mathrm{K}=298 \mathrm{~K}$ and $R=2080 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$.

Hence $\quad(p)\left(600 \times 10^{-6}\right)=(0.2)(2080)(298)$
from which, pressure, $\boldsymbol{p} \quad=\frac{(0.2)(2080)(298)}{\left(600 \times 10^{-6}\right)}$

Problem 12. A spherical vessel has a diameter of 1.2 m and contains oxygen at a pressure of 2 bar and a temperature of $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine the mass of oxygen in the vessel. Take the characteristic gas constant for oxygen to be $0.260 \mathrm{~kJ} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$.

From the characteristic gas equation, $p V=m R T$ where $\quad V=$ volume of spherical vessel
$$=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}=\frac{4}{3} \pi\left(\frac{1.2}{2}\right)^{3}=0.905 \mathrm{~m}^{3},$$
$$\begin{aligned}
& p=2 \mathrm{bar}=2 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}, \\
& T=(-20+273) \mathrm{K}=253 \mathrm{~K}
\end{aligned}$$
and $\quad R=0.260 \mathrm{~kJ} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})=260 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$.
Hence $\quad\left(2 \times 10^{5}\right)(0.905)=m(260)(253)$
from which, mass of oxygen,
$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{m} & =\frac{\left(2 \times 10^{5}\right)(0.905)}{(260)(253)} \\
& =\mathbf{2 . 7 5} \mathbf{~ k g}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 13. Determine the characteristic gas constant of a gas which has a specific volume of $0.5 \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{kg}$ at a temperature of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and pressure 150 kPa .

From the characteristic gas equation, $p V=m R T$ from which,
$$R=\frac{p V}{m T}$$
where
$$\begin{aligned}
p & =150 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~Pa}, \\
T & =(20+273) \mathrm{K} \\
& =293 \mathrm{~K}
\end{aligned}$$
and specific volume, $\quad V / m=0.5 \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{kg}$.
Hence the characteristic gas constant,
$$\begin{aligned}
R=\left(\frac{p}{T}\right)\left(\frac{V}{m}\right) & =\left(\frac{150 \times 10^{3}}{293}\right) \\
& =\mathbf{2 5 6} \mathbf{~ J} /(\mathbf{k g K})

\subsection*{23.8 Further worked problems on the characteristic gas equation}

Problem 14. A vessel has a volume of $0.80 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ and contains a mixture of helium and hydrogen at a pressure of 450 kPa and a temperature of $17^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. If the mass of helium present is 0.40 kg determine (a) the partial pressure of each gas, and (b) the mass of hydrogen present. Assume the characteristic gas constant for helium to be $2080 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$ and for hydrogen $4160 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$.
(a) $\quad V=0.80 \mathrm{~m}^{3}, p=450 \mathrm{kPa}$,
$T=(17+273) \mathrm{K}=290 \mathrm{~K}, m_{\mathrm{He}}=0.40 \mathrm{~kg}$,
$R_{\mathrm{He}}=2080 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$.
If $p_{\mathrm{He}}$ is the partial pressure of the helium, then using the characteristic gas equation, $p_{\mathrm{He}} V=m_{\mathrm{He}} R_{\mathrm{He}} T$ gives:
$$\left(p_{\mathrm{He}}\right)(0.80)=(0.40)(2080)(290)$$
from which, the partial pressure of the helium,

\boldsymbol{p}_{\mathbf{H e}} & =\frac{(0.40)(2080)(290)}{(0.80)} \\
& =\mathbf{3 0 1 . 6} \mathbf{~ k P a}
\end{aligned}$$

By Dalton's law of partial pressure the total pressure $p$ is given by the sum of the partial pressures, i.e. $p=p_{\mathrm{H}}+p_{\mathrm{He}}$, from which, the partial pressure of the hydrogen,
$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{p}_{\mathbf{H}}=p-p_{\mathrm{He}} & =450-301.6 \\

$\begin{aligned} p_{\mathrm{H}} V & =m_{\mathrm{H}} R_{\mathrm{H}} T . \\ \text { Hence } \quad\left(148.4 \times 10^{3}\right)(0.8) & =m_{\mathrm{H}}(4160)(290)\end{aligned}$

Problem 15. A compressed air cylinder has a volume of $1.2 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ and contains air at a pressure of 1 MPa and a temperature of

(b) the volume it would occupy at STP.

Assume the characteristic gas constant for air to be $287 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$.
$$\begin{aligned}
V_{1} & =1.2 \mathrm{~m}^{3}\left(=V_{2}\right), p_{1}=1 \mathrm{MPa}=10^{6} \mathrm{~Pa}, \\
T_{1} & =(25+273) \mathrm{K}=298 \mathrm{~K}, \\

p_{2} & =300 \mathrm{kPa}=300 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~Pa} \\
R & =287 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{~K}) .
\end{aligned}$$
(a) Using the characteristic gas equation, $p_{1} V_{1}=m_{1} R T_{1}$, to find the initial mass of air in the cylinder gives:
$$\left(10^{6}\right)(1.2)=m_{1}(287)(298)$$
from which, mass $m_{1}=\frac{\left(10^{6}\right)(1.2)}{(287)(298)}$
$$=14.03 \mathrm{~kg}$$

Similarly, using $p_{2} V_{2}=m_{2} R T_{2}$ to find the final mass of air in the cylinder gives:
$$\left(300 \times 10^{3}\right)(1.2)=m_{2}(287)(288)$$
from which, mass $m_{2}=\frac{\left(300 \times 10^{3}\right)(1.2)}{(287)(288)}$
$$=4.36 \mathrm{~kg}$$

Problem 16. A vessel $X$ contains gas at a pressure of 750 kPa at a temperature of $27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. It is connected via a valve to vessel $Y$ that is filled with a similar gas at a pressure of 1.2 MPa and a temperature of $27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The
volume of vessel $X$ is $2.0 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ and that of vessel $Y$ is $3.0 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$. Determine the final pressure at $27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ when the valve is opened and the gases are allowed to mix. Assume $R$ for the gas to be $300 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$.

\section*{For vessel $X$ :}
$$\begin{aligned}
& p_{X}=750 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~Pa}, T_{X}=(27+273) \mathrm{K}=300 \mathrm{~K}, \\
& V_{X}=2.0 \mathrm{~m}^{3} \text { and } R=300 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{~K})
\end{aligned}$$

From the characteristic gas equation,
$$p_{X} V_{X}=m_{X} R T_{X}$$

Hence $\quad\left(750 \times 10^{3}\right)(2.0)=m_{X}(300)(300)$
from which, mass of gas in vessel $X$,
$$m_{X}=\frac{\left(750 \times 10^{3}\right)(2.0)}{(300)(300)}=16.67 \mathrm{~kg}$$

& V_{Y}=3.0 \mathrm{~m}^{3} \text { and } R=300 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{~K})
\end{aligned}$$

From the characteristic gas equation,
$$\text { Hence } \quad\left(1.2 \times 10^{6}\right)(3.0)=m_{Y}(300)(300)$$
from which, mass of gas in vessel $Y$,
$$m_{Y}=\frac{\left(1.2 \times 10^{6}\right)(3.0)}{(300)(300)}=40 \mathrm{~kg}$$

When the valve is opened, mass of mixture,
$$\begin{aligned}
m & =m_{X}+m_{Y} \\
& =16.67+40=56.67 \mathrm{~kg} .

Total volume, $V=V_{X}+V_{Y}=2.0+3.0=5.0 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$, $R=300 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K}), T=300 \mathrm{~K}$.
From the characteristic gas equation,
$$\begin{aligned}
p V & =m R T \\
p(5.0) & =(56.67)(300)(300)

from which, final pressure,
$$p=\frac{(56.67)(300)(300)}{5.0}=1.02 \mathrm{MPa}$$

Temperature measuring devices available are many and varied. Those described in sections 24.2 to 24.10 are those most often used in science and industry.

\subsection*{24.2 Liquid-in-glass thermometer}

A liquid-in-glass thermometer uses the expansion of a liquid with increase in temperature as its principle of operation.

\section*{Construction}

A typical liquid-in-glass thermometer is shown in Figure 24.1 and consists of a sealed stem of uniform small-bore tubing, called a capillary tube, made of glass, with a cylindrical glass bulb formed at one end. The bulb and part of the stem are filled with a liquid such as mercury or alcohol and the remaining part of the tube is evacuated. A temperature scale is formed by etching graduations on the stem. A safety reservoir is usually provided, into which the liquid can expand without bursting the glass if the temperature is raised beyond the upper limit of the scale.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-087.jpg?height=210&width=707&top_left_y=1745&top_left_x=898)

Figure 24.1

\section*{Principle of operation}

The operation of a liquid-in-glass thermometer depends on the liquid expanding with increase in temperature and contracting with decrease in
temperature. The position of the end of the column of liquid in the tube is a measure of the temperature of the liquid in the bulb - shown as $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in Figure 24.1, which is about room temperature. Two fixed points are needed to calibrate the thermometer, with the interval between these points being divided into 'degrees'. In the first thermometer, made by Celsius, the fixed points chosen were the temperature of melting ice $\left(0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and that of boiling water at standard atmospheric pressure $\left(100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, in each case the blank stem being marked at the liquid level. The distance between these two points, called the fundamental interval, was divided into 100 equal parts, each equivalent to $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, thus forming the scale.

The clinical thermometer, with a limited scale around body temperature, the maximum and/or minimum thermometer, recording the maximum day temperature and minimum night temperature, and the Beckman thermometer, which is used only in accurate measurement of temperature change and has no fixed points, are particular types of liquid-in-glass thermometer which all operate on the same principle.

\section*{Advantages}

The liquid-in-glass thermometer is simple in construction, relatively inexpensive, easy to use and portable, and is the most widely used method of temperature measurement having industrial, chemical , clinical and meteorological applications.

\section*{Disadvantages}

Liquid-in-glass thermometers tend to be fragile and hence easily broken, can only be used where the liquid column is visible, cannot be used for surface temperature measurements, cannot be read from a distance and are unsuitable for high temperature measurements.

\section*{Advantages of mercury}

The use of mercury in a thermometer has many advantages, for mercury:
(i) is clearly visible,
(ii) has a fairly uniform rate of expansion,
(iii) is readily obtainable in the pure state,
(iv) does not 'wet' the glass,
(v) is a good conductor of heat.

Mercury has a freezing point of $-39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and cannot be used in a thermometer below this temperature. Its boiling point is $357^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ but before this temperature is reached some distillation of the mercury occurs if the space above the mercury is a vacuum. To prevent this, and to extend the upper temperature limits to over $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, an inert gas such as nitrogen under pressure is used to fill the remainder of the capillary tube. Alcohol, often dyed red to be seen in the capillary tube, is considerably cheaper than mercury and has a freezing point of $-113^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, which is considerably lower than for mercury. However it has a low boiling point at about $79^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Errors}

Typical errors in liquid-in-glass thermometers may occur due to:
(i) the slow cooling rate of glass,
(ii) incorrect positioning of the thermometer,
(iii) a delay in the thermometer becoming steady (i.e. slow response time),
(iv) non-uniformity of the bore of the capillary tube, which means that equal intervals marked on the stem do not correspond to equal temperature intervals.

\subsection*{24.3 Thermocouples}

Thermocouples use the e.m.f. set up when the junction of two dissimilar metals is heated.

\section*{Principle of operation}

At the junction between two different metals, say, copper and constantan, there exists a difference in electrical potential, which varies with the temperature of the junction. This is known as the 'thermoelectric effect'. If the circuit is completed with a second junction at a different temperature, a current will flow round the circuit. This principle is used in the thermocouple. Two different metal conductors having their ends twisted together are shown in Figure 24.2. If the two junctions are at different temperatures, a current I flows round the circuit.
The deflection on the galvanometer G depends on the difference in temperature between junctions $X$ and $Y$ and is caused by the difference between voltages $V_{x}$ and $V_{y}$. The higher temperature junction

Figure 24.2
is usually called the 'hot junction' and the lower temperature junction the 'cold junction'. If the cold junction is kept at a constant known temperature, the galvanometer can be calibrated to indicate the temperature of the hot junction directly. The cold junction is then known as the reference junction. In many instrumentation situations, the measuring instrument needs to be located far from the point at which the measurements are to be made. Extension leads are then used, usually made of the same material as the thermocouple but of smaller gauge. The reference junction is then effectively moved to their ends. The thermocouple is used by positioning the hot junction where the temperature is required. The meter will indicate the temperature of the hot junction only if the reference junction is at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { (temperature of hot junction) } \\
& \qquad \begin{array}{l}
=\text { (temperature of the cold junction) } \\
\quad+\text { (temperature difference) }
\end{array}
\end{aligned}$$

In a laboratory the reference junction is often placed in melting ice, but in industry it is often positioned in a thermostatically controlled oven or buried underground where the temperature is constant.

\section*{Construction}

Thermocouple junctions are made by twisting together the ends of two wires of dissimilar metals before welding them. The construction of a typical copper-constantan thermocouple for industrial use is shown in Figure 24.3. Apart from the actual junction the two conductors used must be insulated electrically from each other with appropriate insulation and is shown in Figure 24.3 as twin-holed tubing. The wires and insulation are usually inserted into a sheath for protection from environments in which they might be damaged or corroded.

\section*{Applications}

A copper-constantan thermocouple can measure temperature from $-250^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ up to about $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and is used typically with boiler flue gases, food processing and with sub-zero temperature measurement. An iron-constantan thermocouple can measure temperature from $-200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to about $850^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and is used typically in paper and pulp mills, re-heat and annealing furnaces and in chemical reactors. A chromel-alumel thermocouple can measure temperatures from $-200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to about $1100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and is used typically with blast furnace gases, brick kilns and in glass manufacture.
For the measurement of temperatures above $1100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ radiation pyrometers are normally used. However, thermocouples are available made of platinumplatinum/rhodium, capable of measuring temperatures up to $1400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, or tungsten-molybdenum which can measure up to $2600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Advantages}

A thermocouple:
(i) has a very simple, relatively inexpensive construction,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-089.jpg?height=421&width=965&top_left_y=1764&top_left_x=99)

Figure 24.3
(ii) can be made very small and compact,
(iii) is robust,
(iv) is easily replaced if damaged,
(v) has a small response time,
(vi) can be used at a distance from the actual measuring instrument and is thus ideal for use with automatic and remote-control systems.

\section*{Sources of error}

Sources of error in the thermocouple, which are difficult to overcome, include:
(i) voltage drops in leads and junctions,
(ii) possible variations in the temperature of the cold junction,
(iii) stray thermoelectric effects, which are caused by the addition of further metals into the'ideal' two-metal thermocouple circuit.
Additional leads are frequently necessary for extension leads or voltmeter terminal connections.

A thermocouple may be used with a battery- or mains-operated electronic thermometer instead of a millivoltmeter. These devices amplify the small e.m.f.'s from the thermocouple before feeding them to a multi-range voltmeter calibrated directly with temperature scales. These devices have great accuracy and are almost unaffected by voltage drops in the leads and junctions.

Problem 1. A chromel-alumel thermocouple generates an e.m.f. of 5 mV . Determine the temperature of the hot junction if the cold junction is at a temperature of $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the sensitivity of the thermocouple is $0.04 \mathrm{mV} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Temperature difference for 5 mV
$$=\frac{5 \mathrm{mV}}{0.04 \mathrm{mV} /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}=125{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$$

\section*{Temperature at hot junction}
$$\begin{aligned}
= & \text { temperature of cold junction } \\
& + \text { temperature difference } \\
= & 15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}+125^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=\mathbf{1 4 0}^{\circ} \mathbf{C}
\end{aligned}$$

$\left[1270^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right]$

\subsection*{24.4 Resistance thermometers}

Resistance thermometers use the change in electrical resistance caused by temperature change.

\section*{Construction}

Resistance thermometers are made in a variety of sizes, shapes and forms depending on the application for which they are designed. A typical resistance thermometer is shown diagrammatically in Figure 24.4. The most common metal used for the coil in such thermometers is platinum even though its sensitivity is not as high as other metals such as copper and nickel. However, platinum is a very stable metal and provides reproducible results in a resistance thermometer. A platinum resistance thermometer is often used as a calibrating device. Since platinum is expensive, connecting leads of another metal, usually copper, are used with the thermometer to connect it to a measuring circuit.
The platinum and the connecting leads are shown joined at $A$ and $B$ in Figure 24.4, although sometimes this junction may be made outside of the sheath. However, these leads often come into close contact with the heat source which can introduce errors into the measurements. These may be eliminated by including a pair of identical leads, called dummy leads, which experience the same temperature change as the extension leads.

\section*{Principle of operation}

With most metals a rise in temperature causes an increase in electrical resistance, and since resistance can be measured accurately this property can be used to measure temperature. If the resistance of a length of wire at $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is $R_{0}$, and its resistance at
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-091.jpg?height=491&width=1224&top_left_y=139&top_left_x=99)

Figure 24.4
$\theta^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is $R_{\theta}$, then $R_{\theta}=R_{0}(1+\alpha \theta)$, where $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistance of the material (see Chapter 20).
Rearranging gives:
$$\text { temperature, } \theta=\frac{R_{\theta}-R_{0}}{\alpha R_{0}}$$

Values of $R_{0}$ and $\alpha$ may be determined experimentally or obtained from existing data. Thus, if $R_{\theta}$ can be measured, temperature $\theta$ can be calculated. This is the principle of operation of a resistance thermometer. Although a sensitive ohmmeter can be used to measure $R_{\theta}$, for more accurate determinations a Wheatstone bridge circuit is used as shown in Figure 24.5. This circuit compares an unknown resistance $R_{\theta}$ with others of known values, $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ being fixed values and $R_{3}$ being variable. Galvanometer G is a sensitive centre-zero microammeter. $R_{3}$ is varied until zero deflection is obtained on the galvanometer, i.e. no current flows through G and the bridge is said to be 'balanced'.
At balance:
$$R_{2} R_{\theta}=R_{1} R_{3}$$
from which,
$$R_{\theta}=\frac{R_{1} R_{3}}{R_{2}}$$
and if $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are of equal value, then $R_{\theta}=R_{3}$ A resistance thermometer may be connected between points $A$ and $B$ in Figure 24.5 and its resistance $R_{\theta}$ at any temperature $\theta$ accurately measured. Dummy leads included in arm $B C$ help to eliminate errors caused by the extension leads which are normally necessary in such a thermometer.

Figure 24.5

\section*{Limitations}

Resistance thermometers using a nickel coil are used mainly in the range $-100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, whereas platinum resistance thermometers are capable of measuring with greater accuracy temperatures in the range $-200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to about $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This upper range may be extended to about $1500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ if high melting point materials are used for the sheath and coil construction.

\section*{Advantages and disadvantages of a platinum coil}

Platinum is commonly used in resistance thermometers since it is chemically inert, i.e. un-reactive, resists corrosion and oxidation and has a high melting point of $1769^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. A disadvantage of platinum is its slow response to temperature variation.

\section*{Applications}

Platinum resistance thermometers may be used as calibrating devices or in applications such as heattreating and annealing processes and can be adapted easily for use with automatic recording or control systems. Resistance thermometers tend to be fragile and easily damaged especially when subjected to excessive vibration or shock.

Problem 2. A platinum resistance thermometer has a resistance of $25 \Omega$ at $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. When measuring the temperature of an annealing process a resistance value of $60 \Omega$ is recorded. To what temperature does this correspond? Take the temperature coefficient of resistance of platinum as $0.0038 /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
$R_{\theta}=R_{0}(1+\alpha \theta)$, where $R_{0}=25 \Omega, R_{\theta}=60 \Omega$ and $\alpha=0.0038 /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Rearranging gives:
$$\text { temperature, } \begin{aligned}
\theta & =\frac{R_{\theta}-R_{0}}{\alpha R_{0}} \\
& =\frac{60-25}{(0.0038)(25)}=\mathbf{3 6 8 . 4}{ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

\section*{Exercise 128 Further problem on the resistance thermometer}
1. A platinum resistance thermometer has a resistance of $100 \Omega$ at $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. When measuring the temperature of a heat process a resistance value of $177 \Omega$ is measured using a Wheatstone bridge. Given that the temperature coefficient of resistance of platinum is $0.0038 /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, determine the temperature of the heat process, correct to the nearest degree.
[203 ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ]

\subsection*{24.5 Thermistors}

A thermistor is a semi-conducting material - such as mixtures of oxides of copper, manganese, cobalt, etc. - in the form of a fused bead connected to two leads. As its temperature is increased its resistance rapidly decreases. Typical resistance/temperature curves for a thermistor and common metals are shown in Figure 24.6. The resistance of a typical
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-092.jpg?height=590&width=647&top_left_y=152&top_left_x=902)

Figure 24.6
thermistor can vary from $400 \Omega$ at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $100 \Omega$ at $140^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Advantages}

The main advantages of a thermistor are its high sensitivity and small size. It provides an inexpensive method of measuring and detecting small changes in temperature.

\subsection*{24.6 Pyrometers}

A pyrometer is a device for measuring very high temperatures and uses the principle that all substances emit radiant energy when hot, the rate of emission depending on their temperature. The measurement of thermal radiation is therefore a convenient method of determining the temperature of hot sources and is particularly useful in industrial processes. There are two main types of pyrometer, namely the total radiation pyrometer and the optical pyrometer.
Pyrometers are very convenient instruments since they can be used at a safe and comfortable distance from the hot source. Thus applications of pyrometers are found in measuring the temperature of molten metals, the interiors of furnaces or the interiors of volcanoes. Total radiation pyrometers can also be used in conjunction with devices which record and control temperature continuously.

\section*{Total radiation pyrometer}

A typical arrangement of a total radiation pyrometer is shown in Figure 24.7. Radiant energy from a
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-093.jpg?height=443&width=1013&top_left_y=160&top_left_x=99)

Figure 24.7
hot source, such as a furnace, is focused on to the hot junction of a thermocouple after reflection from a concave mirror. The temperature rise recorded by the thermocouple depends on the amount of radiant energy received, which in turn depends on the temperature of the hot source. The galvanometer G shown connected to the thermocouple records the current which results from the e.m.f. developed and may be calibrated to give a direct reading of the temperature of the hot source. The thermocouple is protected from direct radiation by a shield as shown and the hot source may be viewed through the sighting telescope. For greater sensitivity, a thermopile may be used, a thermopile being a number of thermocouples connected in series. Total radiation pyrometers are used to measure temperature in the range $700^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $2000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Optical pyrometers}

When the temperature of an object is raised sufficiently two visual effects occur; the object appears
brighter and there is a change in colour of the light emitted. These effects are used in the optical pyrometer where a comparison or matching is made between the brightness of the glowing hot source and the light from a filament of known temperature. The most frequently used optical pyrometer is the disappearing filament pyrometer and a typical arrangement is shown in Figure 24.8. A filament lamp is built into a telescope arrangement which receives radiation from a hot source, an image of which is seen through an eyepiece. A red filter is incorporated as a protection to the eye.
The current flowing through the lamp is controlled by a variable resistor. As the current is increased the temperature of the filament increases and its colour changes. When viewed through the eyepiece the filament of the lamp appears superimposed on the image of the radiant energy from the hot source. The current is varied until the filament glows as brightly as the background. It will then merge into the background and seem to disappear. The current required to achieve this is a measure of the temperature of
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-093.jpg?height=531&width=1178&top_left_y=1654&top_left_x=98)

Figure 24.8
the hot source and the ammeter can be calibrated to read the temperature directly. Optical pyrometers may be used to measure temperatures up to, and even in excess of, $3000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{Advantages of pyrometers}
(i) There is no practical limit to the temperature that a pyrometer can measure.
(ii) A pyrometer need not be brought directly into the hot zone and so is free from the effects of heat and chemical attack that can often cause other measuring devices to deteriorate in use.
(iii) Very fast rates of change of temperature can be followed by a pyrometer.
(iv) The temperature of moving bodies can be measured.
(v) The lens system makes the pyrometer virtually independent of its distance from the source.

\section*{Disadvantages of pyrometers}
(i) A pyrometer is often more expensive than other temperature measuring devices.
(ii) A direct view of the heat process is necessary.
(iii) Manual adjustment is necessary.
(iv) A reasonable amount of skill and care is required in calibrating and using a pyrometer. For each new measuring situation the pyrometer must be re-calibrated.
(v) The temperature of the surroundings may affect the reading of the pyrometer and such errors are difficult to eliminate.

\subsection*{24.7 Temperature indicating paints and crayons}

Temperature indicating paints contain substances which change their colour when heated to certain temperatures. This change is usually due to chemical decomposition, such as loss of water, in which the change in colour of the paint after having reached the particular temperature will be a permanent one. However, in some types the original colour returns after cooling. Temperature indicating paints are used where the temperature of inaccessible parts of apparatus and machines is required. They are particularly
useful in heat-treatment processes where the temperature of the component needs to be known before a quenching operation. There are several such paints available and most have only a small temperature range so that different paints have to be used for different temperatures. The usual range of temperatures covered by these paints is from about $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $700^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
Temperature sensitive crayons consist of fusible solids compressed into the form of a stick. The melting point of such crayons is used to determine when a given temperature has been reached. The crayons are simple to use but indicate a single temperature only, i.e. its melting point temperature. There are over 100 different crayons available, each covering a particular range of temperature. Crayons are available for temperatures within the range of $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $1400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Such crayons are used in metallurgical applications such as preheating before welding, hardening, annealing or tempering, or in monitoring the temperature of critical parts of machines or for checking mould temperatures in the rubber and plastics industries.

\subsection*{24.8 Bimetallic thermometers}

Bimetallic thermometers depend on the expansion of metal strips which operate an indicating pointer. Two thin metal strips of differing thermal expansion are welded or riveted together and the curvature of the bimetallic strip changes with temperature change. For greater sensitivity the strips may be coiled into a flat spiral or helix, one end being fixed and the other being made to rotate a pointer over a scale. Bimetallic thermometers are useful for alarm and over-temperature applications where extreme accuracy is not essential. If the whole is placed in a sheath, protection from corrosive environments is achieved but with a reduction in response characteristics. The normal upper limit of temperature measurement by this thermometer is about $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, although with special metals the range can be extended to about $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\subsection*{24.9 Mercury-in-steel thermometer}

The mercury-in-steel thermometer is an extension of the principle of the mercury-in-glass thermometer. Mercury in a steel bulb expands via a small bore capillary tube into a pressure indicating device, say a Bourdon gauge, the position of the pointer indicating
the amount of expansion and thus the temperature. The advantages of this instrument are that it is robust and, by increasing the length of the capillary tube, the gauge can be placed some distance from the bulb and can thus be used to monitor temperatures in positions which are inaccessible to the liquid-inglass thermometer. Such thermometers may be used to measure temperatures up to $600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\subsection*{24.10 Gas thermometers}

The gas thermometer consists of a flexible U-tube of mercury connected by a capillary tube to a vessel containing gas. The change in the volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure, or the change in pressure of a fixed mass of gas at constant volume, may be used to measure temperature. This thermometer is cumbersome and rarely used to measure temperature directly, but it is often used as a standard with which to calibrate other types of thermometer. With pure hydrogen the range of the instrument extends from $-240^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $1500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and measurements can be made with extreme accuracy.

\subsection*{19.1 Introduction}

Heat is a form of energy and is measured in joules. Temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of a substance. Heat and temperature are thus not the same thing. For example, twice the heat energy is needed to boil a full container of water than half a container - that is, different amounts of heat energy are needed to cause an equal rise in the temperature of different amounts of the same substance.

Temperature is measured either (i) on the Celsius ( ${ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$ ) scale (formerly Centigrade), where the temperature at which ice melts, i.e. the freezing point of water, is taken as $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the point at which water boils under normal atmospheric pressure is taken as $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, or (ii) on the thermodynamic scale, in which the unit of temperature is the kelvin (K). The kelvin scale uses the same temperature interval as the Celsius scale but as its zero takes the 'absolute zero of temperature' which is at about $-273^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Hence,
$$\text { kelvin temperature }=\text { degree Celsius }+273$$
i.e.
$$\mathrm{K}=\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)+273$$

Thus, for example, $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=273 \mathrm{~K}, 25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=298 \mathrm{~K}$ and $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=373 \mathrm{~K}$

Problem 1. Convert the following temperatures into the kelvin scale:
(a) $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
(b) $-28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

From above,
$$\text { kelvin temperature }=\text { degree Celsius }+273$$
(a) $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ corresponds to a kelvin temperature of $37+273$, i.e. $\mathbf{3 1 0 ~ K}$
(b) $-28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ corresponds to a kelvin temperature of $-28+273$, i.e. $\mathbf{2 4 5 ~ K}$

Problem 2. Convert the following temperatures into the Celsius scale:
(a) 365 K
(b) 213 K

From above, $K=\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)+273$
Hence, degree Celsius $=$ kelvin temperature -273
(a) 365 K corresponds to $365-273$, i.e. $\mathbf{9 2}{ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$
(b) 213 K corresponds to $213-273$, i.e. $-60^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$

\subsection*{19.2 The measurement of temperature}

A thermometer is an instrument that measures temperature. Any substance that possesses one or more
properties that vary with temperature can be used to measure temperature. These properties include changes in length, area or volume, electrical resistance or in colour. Examples of temperature measuring devices include:
(i) liquid-in-glass thermometer, which uses the expansion of a liquid with increase in temperature as its principle of operation,
(ii) thermocouples, which use the e.m.f. set up when the junction of two dissimilar metals is heated,
(iii) resistance thermometer, which uses the change in electrical resistance caused by temperature change, and
(iv) pyrometers, which are devices for measuring very high temperatures, using the principle that all substances emit radiant energy when hot, the rate of emission depending on their temperature.

Each of these temperature measuring devices, together with others, are described in Chapter 24, page 267.

\subsection*{19.3 Specific heat capacity}

The specific heat capacity of a substance is the quantity of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of the substance by $1{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The symbol used for specific heat capacity is $c$ and the units are $\mathrm{J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ or $\mathrm{J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$. (Note that these units may also be written as $\mathrm{J} \mathrm{kg}{ }^{-1}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$ or $\mathrm{J} \mathrm{kg}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ ).

Some typical values of specific heat capacity for the range of temperature $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ include:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Water & $4190 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, & Ice & $2100 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ \\
\hline Aluminium & $950 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, & Copper & $390 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ \\
\hline Iron & $500 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, & Lead & $130 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Hence to raise the temperature of 1 kg of iron by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ requires 500 J of energy, to raise the temperature of 5 kg of iron by $1{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ requires ( $500 \times 5$ ) J of energy, and to raise the temperature of 5 kg of iron by $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ requires ( $500 \times 5 \times 40$ ) J of energy, i.e. 100 kJ .

In general, the quantity of heat energy, $Q$, required to raise a mass $m \mathrm{~kg}$ of a substance with a specific heat capacity $c \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ from temperature $t_{1}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $t_{2}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is given by:
$$Q=m c\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right) \text { joules }$$

Problem 3. Calculate the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 5 kg of water from $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Assume the specific heat capacity of water is $4200 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$.

Quantity of heat energy,
$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{Q} & =m c\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right) \\
& =5 \mathrm{~kg} \times 4200 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) \times(100-0)^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \\
& =5 \times 4200 \times 100 \\
& =\mathbf{2 1 0 0 0 0 0 ~ J} \text { or } \mathbf{2 1 0 0 ~ k J} \text { or } \mathbf{2 . 1 ~ M J}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 4. A block of cast iron having a mass of 10 kg cools from a temperature of $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. How much energy is lost by the cast iron? Assume the specific heat capacity of iron is $500 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$.

Quantity of heat energy,
$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{Q} & =m c\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right) \\
& =10 \mathrm{~kg} \times 500 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) \times(50-150)^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \\
& =10 \times 500 \times(-100) \\
& =\mathbf{- 5 0 0 0 0 0 ~ J} \text { or } \mathbf{- 5 0 0 ~ k J} \text { or } \mathbf{- 0 . 5 ~ M J}
\end{aligned}$$
(Note that the minus sign indicates that heat is given out or lost).

Problem 5. Some lead having a specific heat capacity of $130 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ is heated from $27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to its melting point at $327^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. If the quantity of heat required is 780 kJ , determine the mass of the lead.

Quantity of heat, $\quad Q=m c\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right)$, hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
780 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}=m \times 130 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) & \\
& \times(327-27)^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e.
$$780000=m \times 130 \times 300$$
from which, mass, $\mathbf{m}=\frac{780000}{130 \times 300} \mathrm{~kg}=\mathbf{2 0} \mathbf{~ k g}$

Problem 6. 273 kJ of heat energy are required to raise the temperature of 10 kg of
copper from $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Determine the specific heat capacity of copper.

Quantity of heat, $\quad Q=m c\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right)$, hence:
$$273 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J}=10 \mathrm{~kg} \times c \times(85-15)^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$$
where $c$ is the specific heat capacity, i.e.
$$273000=10 \times c \times 70$$
from which, specific heat capacity,
$$\left.c=\frac{273000}{10 \times 70}=\mathbf{3 9 0 ~ J / ( k g}{ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}\right)$$

Problem 7. 5.7 MJ of heat energy are supplied to 30 kg of aluminium that is initially at a temperature of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. If the specific heat capacity of aluminium is $950 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, determine its final temperature.

Quantity of heat, $Q=m c\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right)$, hence,
$$\begin{array}{r}
5.7 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~J}=30 \mathrm{~kg} \times 950 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right) \\
\times\left(t_{2}-20\right)^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\end{array}$$
from which, $\left(t_{2}-20\right)=\frac{5.7 \times 10^{6}}{30 \times 950}=200$
Hence the final temperature,
$$\boldsymbol{t}_{\mathbf{2}}=200+20=\mathbf{2 2 0}{ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$$

Problem 8. A copper container of mass 500 g contains 1 litre of water at 293 K . Calculate the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of the water and container to boiling point assuming there are no heat losses. Assume that the specific heat capacity of copper is $390 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$, the specific heat capacity of water is
$4.2 \mathrm{~kJ} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{K})$ and 1 litre of water has a mass of 1 kg .

Heat is required to raise the temperature of the water, and also to raise the temperature of the copper container.

For the water: $\quad m=1 \mathrm{~kg}, t_{1}=293 \mathrm{~K}$, ${ }_{2}=373 \mathrm{~K}$ (i.e. boiling point)
and
$$c=4.2 \mathrm{~kJ} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{~K})$$

Quantity of heat required for the water is given by:
$$\begin{aligned}
Q_{W} & =m c\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right) \\
& =(1 \mathrm{~kg})\left(4.2 \frac{\mathrm{~kg}}{\mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~K}}\right)(373-293) \mathrm{K} \\
& =4.2 \times 80 \mathrm{~kJ} \\
\text { i.e. } Q_{W} & =\mathbf{3 3 6} \mathbf{~ k J}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{For the copper container:}
$$\begin{aligned}
m & =500 \mathrm{~g}=0.5 \mathrm{~kg}, t_{1}=293 \mathrm{~K} \\
t_{2} & =373 \mathrm{~K} \text { and } \\
c & =390 \mathrm{~J} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{~K})=0.39 \mathrm{~kJ} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{~K})
\end{aligned}$$

Quantity of heat required for the copper container is given by:
$$\begin{aligned}
Q_{C} & =m c\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right) \\
& =(0.5 \mathrm{~kg})(0.39 \mathrm{~kJ} /(\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{~K})(80 \mathrm{~K})
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. $\quad Q_{C}=15.6 \mathrm{~kJ}$

\section*{Total quantity of heat required,}
$$\boldsymbol{Q}=Q_{W}+Q_{C}=336+15.6=\mathbf{3 5 1 . 6} \mathbf{~ k J}$$

3. A block of aluminium having a specific heat capacity of $950 \mathrm{~J} /\left(\mathrm{kg}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ is heated from $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to its melting point at $660^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. If the quantity of heat required is 2.85 MJ , determine the mass of the aluminium block.

$\left[65^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right]$

\subsection*{19.4 Change of state}

A material may exist in any one of three states - solid, liquid or gas. If heat is supplied at a constant rate to some ice initially at, say, $-30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, its temperature rises as shown in Figure 19.1. Initially the temperature increases from $-30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ as shown by the line $A B$. It then remains constant at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for the time $B C$ required for the ice to melt into water.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-102.jpg?height=599&width=704&top_left_y=935&top_left_x=902)

Figure 19.1

When melting commences the energy gained by continual heating is offset by the energy required for the change of state and the temperature remains constant even though heating is continued. When the ice is completely melted to water, continual heating raises the temperature to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, as shown by $C D$ in Figure 19.1. The water then begins to boil and the temperature again remains constant at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, shown as $D E$, until all the water has vaporised.

Continual heating raises the temperature of the steam as shown by $E F$ in the region where the steam is termed superheated.

Changes of state from solid to liquid or liquid to gas occur without change of temperature and such
changes are reversible processes. When heat energy flows to or from a substance and causes a change of temperature, such as between $A$ and $B$, between $C$ and $D$ and between $E$ and $F$ in Figure 19.1, it is called sensible heat (since it can be 'sensed' by a thermometer).

Heat energy which flows to or from a substance while the temperature remains constant, such as between $B$ and $C$ and between $D$ and $E$ in Figure 19.1, is called latent heat (latent means concealed or hidden).

Problem 9. Steam initially at a temperature of $130^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is cooled to a temperature of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ below the freezing point of water, the loss of heat energy being at a constant rate. Make a sketch, and briefly explain, the expected temperature/ time graph representing this change.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-103.jpg?height=613&width=758&top_left_y=1063&top_left_x=97)

Figure 19.2

A temperature/time graph representing the change is shown in Figure 19.2. Initially steam cools until it reaches the boiling point of water at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Temperature then remains constant, i.e. between $A$ and $B$, even though it is still giving off heat (i.e. latent heat). When all the steam at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ has changed to water at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ it starts to cool again until it reaches the freezing point of water at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. From $C$ to $D$ the temperature again remains constant until all the water is converted to ice. The temperature of the ice then decreases as shown.

\section*{Now try the following exercise}

\section*{Exercise 98 A further problem on change of state}
1. Some ice, initially at $-40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, has heat supplied to it at a constant rate until it becomes superheated steam at $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Sketch a typical temperature/time graph expected and use it to explain the difference between sensible and latent heat.
[Similar to Figure 19.1, page 214]

\subsection*{19.5 Latent heats of fusion and vaporisation}

The specific latent heat of fusion is the heat required to change 1 kg of a substance from the solid state to the liquid state (or vice versa) at constant temperature.

The specific latent heat of vaporisation is the heat required to change 1 kg of a substance from a liquid to a gaseous state (or vice versa) at constant temperature.

The units of the specific latent heats of fusion and vaporisation are $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{kg}$, or more often $\mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{kg}$, and some typical values are shown in Table 19.1

The quantity of heat $Q$ supplied or given out during a change of state is given by:
$$Q=m L$$
where $m$ is the mass in kilograms and $L$ is the specific latent heat.

Thus, for example, the heat required to convert 10 kg of ice at $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to water at $0{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is given by $10 \mathrm{~kg} \times 335 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg}=3350 \mathrm{~kJ}$ or 3.35 MJ

Besides changing temperature, the effects of supplying heat to a material can involve changes in dimensions, as well as in colour, state and electrical resistance. Most substances expand when heated and contract when cooled, and there are many practical applications and design implications of thermal movement (see Chapter 20).

Problem 10. How much heat is needed to melt completely 12 kg of ice at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ?
Assume the latent heat of fusion of ice is $335 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg}$.

Problem 14. Determine the amount of heat energy needed to change 400 g of ice, initially at $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, into steam at $120^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Assume the following:
latent heat of fusion of ice $=335 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg}$, latent heat of vaporisation of water $=2260 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg}$, specific heat capacity of ice $=2.14 \mathrm{~kJ} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, specific heat capacity of water $=4.2 \mathrm{~kJ} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and specific heat capacity of steam $=2.01 \mathrm{~kJ} /\left(\mathrm{kg}{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$.

\end{aligned}$$
(iii) Heat energy needed to change the temperature of water from $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (i.e. melting point) to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (i.e. boiling point) is given by:
$$\begin{aligned}

\subsection*{19.6 A simple refrigerator}

The boiling point of most liquids may be lowered if the pressure is lowered. In a simple refrigerator a working fluid, such as ammonia or freon, has the pressure acting on it reduced. The resulting lowering of the boiling point causes the liquid to vaporise. In vaporising, the liquid takes in the necessary latent heat from its surroundings, i.e. the freezer, which thus becomes cooled. The vapour is immediately removed by a pump to a condenser that is outside of the cabinet, where it is compressed and changed back into a liquid, giving out latent heat. The cycle is repeated when the liquid is pumped back to the freezer to be vaporised.

\subsection*{19.7 Conduction, convection and radiation}

Heat may be transferred from a hot body to a cooler body by one or more of three methods, these being: (a) by conduction, (b) by convection, or (c) by radiation.

\section*{Conduction}

Conduction is the transfer of heat energy from one part of a body to another (or from one body to another) without the particles of the body moving.

Conduction is associated with solids. For example, if one end of a metal bar is heated, the other end will become hot by conduction. Metals and metallic alloys are good conductors of heat, whereas air, wood, plastic, cork, glass and gases are examples of poor conductors (i.e. they are heat insulators).

\section*{Practical applications of conduction include:}
(i) A domestic saucepan or dish conducts heat from the source to the contents. Also, since wood and plastic are poor conductors of heat they are used for saucepan handles.
(ii) The metal of a radiator of a central heating system conducts heat from the hot water inside to the air outside.

\section*{Convection}

Convection is the transfer of heat energy through a substance by the actual movement of the substance itself. Convection occurs in liquids and gases, but not in solids. When heated, a liquid or gas becomes less dense. It then rises and is replaced by a colder liquid or gas and the process repeats. For example, electric kettles and central heating radiators always heat up at the top first.

\section*{Examples of convection are:}
(i) Natural circulation hot water heating systems depend on the hot water rising by convection to the top of the house and then falling back to the bottom of the house as it cools, releasing the heat energy to warm the house as it does so.
(ii) Convection currents cause air to move and therefore affect climate.
(iii) When a radiator heats the air around it, the hot air rises by convection and cold air moves in to take its place.
(iv) A cooling system in a car radiator relies on convection.
(iv) Large electrical transformers dissipate waste heat to an oil tank. The heated oil rises by convection to the top, then sinks through cooling fins, losing heat as it does so.
(v) In a refrigerator, the cooling unit is situated near the top. The air surrounding the cold pipes become heavier as it contracts and sinks towards the bottom. Warmer, less dense air is pushed upwards and in turn is cooled. A cold convection current is thus created.

\section*{Radiation}

Radiation is the transfer of heat energy from a hot body to a cooler one by electromagnetic waves. Heat radiation is similar in character to light waves - it travels at the same speed and can pass through a vacuum-except that the frequency of the waves are different. Waves are emitted by a hot body, are transmitted through space (even a vacuum) and are not detected until they fall on to another body. Radiation is reflected from shining, polished surfaces but absorbed by dull, black surfaces.

\section*{Practical applications of radiation include:}
(i) heat from the sun reaching earth
(ii) heat felt by a flame
(iii) cooker grills
(iv) industrial furnaces
(v) infra-red space heaters

Figure 19.3

\subsection*{19.8 Vacuum flask}

A cross-section of a typical vacuum flask is shown in Figure 19.3 and is seen to be a double-walled bottle with a vacuum space between them, the whole supported in a protective outer case.

Very little heat can be transferred by conduction because of the vacuum space and the cork stopper (cork is a bad conductor of heat). Also, because of the vacuum space, no convection is possible. Radiation is minimised by silvering the two glass surfaces (radiation is reflected off shining surfaces).

Thus a vacuum flask is an example of prevention of all three types of heat transfer and is therefore able to keep hot liquids hot and cold liquids cold.

\subsection*{19.9 Use of insulation in conserving fuel}

Fuel used for heating a building is becoming increasingly expensive. By the careful use of insulation, heat can be retained in a building for longer periods and the cost of heating thus minimised.
(i) Since convection causes hot air to rise it is important to insulate the roof space, which is probably the greatest source of heat loss in the home. This can be achieved by laying fibreglass between the wooden joists in the roof space.
(ii) Glass is a poor conductor of heat. However, large losses can occur through thin panes of glass and such losses can be reduced by using double-glazing. Two sheets of glass, separated by air, are used. Air is a very good insulator but the air space must not be too large otherwise convection currents can occur which would carry heat across the space.
(iii) Hot water tanks should be lagged to prevent conduction and convection of heat to the surrounding air.
(iv) Brick, concrete, plaster and wood are all poor conductors of heat. A house is made from two walls with an air gap between them. Air is a poor conductor and trapped air minimises losses through the wall. Heat losses through the walls can be prevented almost completely by using cavity wall insulation, i.e. plasticfoam.

Besides changing temperature, the effects of supplying heat to a material can involve changes in dimensions, as well as in colour, state and electrical resistance.

Most substances expand when heated and contract when cooled, and there are many practical applications and design implications of thermal movement as explained in Chapter 20 following.

\section*{Hydrostatics}

\subsection*{21.1 Pressure}

The pressure acting on a surface is defined as the perpendicular force per unit area of surface. The unit of pressure is the Pascal, Pa, where 1 Pascal is equal to 1 Newton per square metre. Thus pressure,
$$p=\frac{F}{A} \text { Pascal's }$$
where $F$ is the force in Newton's acting at right angles to a surface of area $A$ square metres.
When a force of 20 N acts uniformly over, and perpendicular to, an area of $4 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, then the pressure on the area, $p$, is given by
$$p=\frac{20 \mathrm{~N}}{4 \mathrm{~m}^{2}}=5 \mathrm{~Pa}$$

Problem 1. A table loaded with books has a force of 250 N acting in each of its legs. If the contact area between each leg and the floor is $50 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$, find the pressure each leg exerts on the floor.

From above, pressure $\quad p=\frac{\text { force }}{\text { area }}$
Hence,
$$\begin{aligned}
p & =\frac{250 \mathrm{~N}}{50 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}}=\frac{250 \mathrm{~N}}{50 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^{2}} \\
& =5 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}=\mathbf{5} \mathbf{~ M P a}
\end{aligned}$$

That is, the pressure exerted by each leg on the floor is 5 MPa .

Problem 2. Calculate the force exerted by the atmosphere on a pool of water that is 30 m long by 10 m wide, when the atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa .

From above, pressure $=\frac{\text { force }}{\text { area }}$, hence, force $=$ pressure $\times$ area.
The area of the pool is $30 \mathrm{~m} \times 10 \mathrm{~m}$, i.e. $300 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.
Thus, force on pool, $F=100 \mathrm{kPa} \times 300 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and since $1 \mathrm{~Pa}=1 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$,
$$\begin{aligned}
F & =\left(100 \times 10^{3}\right) \frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{~m}^{2}} \times 300 \mathrm{~m}^{2}=3 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~N} \\
& =30 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N}=30 \mathrm{MN}
\end{aligned}$$

That is, the force on the pool of water is $\mathbf{3 0 ~ M N}$.
Problem 3. A circular piston exerts a pressure of 80 kPa on a fluid, when the force applied to the piston is 0.2 kN . Find the diameter of the piston.

From above, pressure $=\frac{\text { force }}{\text { area }}$
hence, $\quad$ area $=\frac{\text { force }}{\text { pressure }}$
Force in Newton's
$=0.2 \mathrm{kN}=0.2 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~N}=200 \mathrm{~N}$, and pressure in Pascal's is $80 \mathrm{kPa}=80000 \mathrm{~Pa}$ $=80000 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$.

Hence,
$$\text { area }=\frac{200 \mathrm{~N}}{80000 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}}=0.0025 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$$

Since the piston is circular, its area is given by $\pi d^{2} / 4$, where $d$ is the diameter of the piston. Hence,
$$\text { area }=\frac{\pi d^{2}}{4}=0.0025$$
from which, $\quad d^{2}=0.0025 \times \frac{4}{\pi}=0.003183$
i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
d & =\sqrt{0.003183} \\
& =0.0564 \mathrm{~m}, \text { i.e. } 56.4 \mathrm{~mm}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, the diameter of the piston is $\mathbf{5 6 . 4 ~ m m}$.

\subsection*{21.2 Fluid pressure}

A fluid is either a liquid or a gas and there are four basic factors governing the pressure within fluids.
(a) The pressure at a given depth in a fluid is equal in all directions, see Figure 21.1(a).
(b) The pressure at a given depth in a fluid is independent of the shape of the container in which the fluid is held. In Figure 21.1(b), the pressure at $X$ is the same as the pressure at $Y$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-110.jpg?height=286&width=700&top_left_y=1505&top_left_x=164)

Figure 21.1
(c) Pressure acts at right angles to the surface containing the fluid. In Figure 21.1(c), the pressures at points $A$ to $F$ all act at right angles to the container.
(d) When a pressure is applied to a fluid, this pressure is transmitted equally in all directions. In Figure 21.1(d), if the mass of the fluid is neglected, the pressures at points $A$ to $D$ are all the same.

The pressure, $p$, at any point in a fluid depends on three factors:
(a) the density of the fluid, $\rho$, in $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$,
(b) the gravitational acceleration, $g$, taken as approximately $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ (or the gravitational field force in N/kg), and
(c) the height of fluid vertically above the point, $h$ metres.

The relationship connecting these quantities is:
$$p=\rho g h \text { Pascal's }$$

When the container shown in Figure 21.2 is filled with water of density $1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$, the pressure due to the water at a depth of 0.03 m below the surface is given by:
$$p=\rho g h=(1000 \times 9.8 \times 0.03) \mathrm{Pa}=294 \mathrm{~Pa}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-110.jpg?height=225&width=347&top_left_y=1031&top_left_x=898)

Figure 21.2
Problem 4. A tank contains water to a depth of 600 mm . Calculate the water pressure (a) at a depth of 350 mm , and (b) at the base of the tank. Take the density of water as $1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ and the gravitational acceleration as $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

From above, pressure $p$ at any point in a fluid is given by $p=\rho g h$ pascals, where $\rho$ is the density in $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}, g$ is the gravitational acceleration in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ and $h$ is the height of fluid vertically above the point.
(a) At a depth of 350 mm , i.e. 0.35 m ,
$$p=1000 \times 9.8 \times 0.35=\mathbf{3 4 3 0 ~ P a}=\mathbf{3 . 4 3} \mathbf{~ k P a}$$
(b) At the base of the tank, the vertical height of the water is 600 mm , i.e. 0.6 m . Hence,
$$p=1000 \times 9.8 \times 0.6=\mathbf{5 8 8 0 ~ P a}=\mathbf{5 . 8 8} \mathbf{~ k P a}$$

Problem 5. A storage tank contains petrol to a height of 4.7 m . If the pressure at the
base of the tank is 32.3 kPa , determine the density of the petrol. Take the gravitational field force as $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

From above, pressure $p=\rho g h$ Pascal's, where $\rho$ is the density in $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}, g$ is the gravitational acceleration in $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ and $h$ is the vertical height of the petrol.
Transposing gives: $\quad \rho=\frac{p}{g h}$
The pressure $p$ is $32.2 \mathrm{kPa}=32200 \mathrm{~Pa}$, hence,
$$\text { density, } \rho=\frac{32200}{9.8 \times 4.7}=699 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$$

That is, the density of the petrol is $699 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$.
Problem 6. A vertical tube is partly filled with mercury of density $13600 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. Find the height, in millimetres, of the column of mercury, when the pressure at the base of the tube is 101 kPa . Take the gravitational field force as $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

From above, pressure $p=\rho g h$, hence vertical height $h$ is given by:

Pressure
$$\begin{aligned}
& p=101 \mathrm{kPa}=101000 \mathrm{~Pa}, \text { thus } \\
& h=\frac{101000}{13600 \times 9.8}=0.758 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}$$

That is, the height of the column of mercury is 758 mm .

$\left[1400 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right]$

\subsection*{21.3 Atmospheric pressure}

The air above the Earth's surface is a fluid, having a density, $\rho$, which varies from approximately $1.225 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ at sea level to zero in outer space. Since $p=\rho g h$, where height $h$ is several thousands of metres, the air exerts a pressure on all points on the earth's surface. This pressure, called atmospheric pressure, has a value of approximately 100 kilopascals. Two terms are commonly used when measuring pressures:
(a) absolute pressure, meaning the pressure above that of an absolute vacuum (i.e. zero pressure), and
(b) gauge pressure, meaning the pressure above that normally present due to the atmosphere.

Thus, absolute pressure $=$ atmospheric pressure + gauge pressure
Thus, a gauge pressure of 50 kPa is equivalent to an absolute pressure of $(100+50) \mathrm{kPa}$, i.e. 150 kPa , since the atmospheric pressure is approximately 100 kPa .

Problem 7. Calculate the absolute pressure at a point on a submarine, at a depth of 30 m below the surface of the sea, when the atmospheric pressure is 101 kPa . Take the density of sea water as $1030 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ and the gravitational acceleration as $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

From Section 21.2, the pressure due to the sea, that is, the gauge pressure ( $p_{g}$ ) is given by:
$p_{g}=\rho g h$ Pascal's, i.e.
$p_{g}=1030 \times 9.8 \times 30=302820 \mathrm{~Pa}=302.82 \mathrm{kPa}$

From above, absolute pressure
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\text { atmospheric pressure }+ \text { gauge pressure } \\
& =(101+302.82) \mathrm{kPa}=403.82 \mathrm{kPa}
\end{aligned}$$

That is, the absolute pressure at a depth of 30 m is 403.82 kPa .

\subsection*{21.4 Archimedes' principle}

Archimedes' principle states that:
If a solid body floats, or is submerged, in a liquid, the liquid exerts an upthrust on the body equal to the gravitational force on the liquid displaced by the body.

In other words, if a solid body is immersed in a liquid, the apparent loss of weight is equal to the weight of liquid displaced.

If $V$ is the volume of the body below the surface of the liquid, then the apparent loss of weight $W$ is given by:
$$W=V \omega=V \rho g$$
where $\omega$ is the specific weight (i.e. weight per unit volume) and $\rho$ is the density.

If a body floats on the surface of a liquid all of its weight appears to have been lost. The weight of liquid displaced is equal to the weight of the floating body.

Problem 8. A body weighs 2.760 N in air and 1.925 N when completely immersed in water of density $1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. Calculate
(a) the volume of the body, (b) the density of the body and (c) the relative density of the body. Take the gravitational acceleration as $9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.
(a) The apparent loss of weight is 2.760 N $1.925 \mathrm{~N}=0.835 \mathrm{~N}$. This is the weight of water displaced, i.e. $V \rho g$, where $V$ is the volume of the body and $\rho$ is the density of water, i.e.
$$\begin{aligned}
0.835 \mathrm{~N} & =V \times 1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3} \times 9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2} \\
& =V \times 9.81 \mathrm{kN} / \mathrm{m}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\quad \mathbf{V}=\frac{0.835}{9.81 \times 10^{3}} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =8.512 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{3} \\
& =\mathbf{8 . 5 1 2} \mathbf{\times 1 0} \mathbf{1 0}^{\mathbf{4}} \mathbf{m m}^{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}$$
(b) The density of the body
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { volume }}=\frac{\text { weight }}{g \times V} \\
& =\frac{2.760 \mathrm{~N}}{9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2} \times 8.512 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^{3}} \\
& =\frac{\frac{2.760}{9.81} \mathrm{~kg} \times 10^{5}}{8.512 \mathrm{~m}^{3}}=\mathbf{3 3 0 5 ~ k g} / \mathbf{m}^{\mathbf{3}} \\
& =\mathbf{3 . 3 0 5} \text { tonne } / \mathbf{m}^{\mathbf{3}}
\end{aligned}$$
(c) Relative density $=\frac{\text { density }}{\text { density of water }}$

Hence, the relative density of the body
$$=\frac{3305 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}}{1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}}=\mathbf{3 . 3 0 5}$$

Problem 9. A rectangular watertight box is 560 mm long, 420 mm wide and 210 mm deep. It weighs 223 N .
(a) If it floats with its sides and ends vertical in water of density $1030 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$, what depth of the box will be submerged?
(b) If the box is held completely submerged in water of density $1030 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$, by a vertical chain attached to the underside of the box, what is the force in the chain?
(a) The apparent weight of a floating body is zero. That is, the weight of the body is equal to the weight of liquid displaced. This is given by: $V \rho g$ where $V$ is the volume of liquid displaced, and $\rho$ is the density of the liquid.
Here,
$$\begin{aligned}
223 \mathrm{~N} & =V \times 1030 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3} \times 9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2} \\
& =V \times 10.104 \mathrm{kN} / \mathrm{m}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
$$V=\frac{223 \mathrm{~N}}{10.104 \mathrm{kN} / \mathrm{m}^{3}}=22.07 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$$

This volume is also given by Lbd, where $L=$ length of box, $b=$ breadth of box, and $d=$ depth of box submerged, i.e.
$$22.07 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{3}=0.56 \mathrm{~m} \times 0.42 \mathrm{~m} \times d$$

Hence, depth submerged,
$\mathbf{d}=\frac{22.07 \times 10^{-3}}{0.56 \times 0.42}=0.09384 \mathrm{~m}=\mathbf{9 3 . 8 4} \mathbf{~ m m}$
(b) The volume of water displaced is the total volume of the box. The upthrust or buoyancy of the water, i.e. the 'apparent loss of weight', is greater than the weight of the box. The force in the chain accounts for the difference.

Volume of water displaced,
$$\begin{aligned}
V & =0.56 \mathrm{~m} \times 0.42 \mathrm{~m} \times 0.21 \mathrm{~m} \\
& =4.9392 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{3}
\end{aligned}$$

Weight of water displaced
$$\begin{aligned}
=V \rho g & =4.9392 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{3} \times 1030 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3} \\
& \times 9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2} \\
& =499.1 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{The force in the chain}
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\text { weight of water displaced }- \text { weight of box } \\
& =499.1 \mathrm{~N}-223 \mathrm{~N}=\mathbf{2 7 6 . 1} \mathbf{~ N}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{21.5 Measurement of pressure}

As stated earlier, pressure is the force exerted by a fluid per unit area. A fluid (i.e. liquid, vapour or gas) has a negligible resistance to a shear force, so that the force it exerts always acts at right angles to its containing surface.

The SI unit of pressure is the Pascal, Pa , which is unit force per unit area, i.e. $\mathbf{1} \mathbf{P a}=\mathbf{1} \mathbf{N} / \mathbf{m}^{2}$. The Pascal is a very small unit and a commonly used larger unit is the bar, where
$$1 \mathrm{bar}=10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$$

Atmospheric pressure is due to the mass of the air above the Earth's surface. Atmospheric pressure changes continuously. A standard value of atmospheric pressure, called 'standard atmospheric pressure', is often used, having a value of 101325 Pa or 1.01325 bars or 1013.25 millibars. This latter unit, the millibar, is usually used in the measurement of meteorological pressures. (Note that when atmospheric pressure varies from 101325 Pa it is no longer standard.)

Pressure indicating instruments are made in a wide variety of forms because of their many different applications. Apart from the obvious criteria
such as pressure range, accuracy and response, many measurements also require special attention to material, sealing and temperature effects. The fluid whose pressure is being measured may be corrosive or may be at high temperatures. Pressure indicating devices used in science and industry include:
(i) barometers (see Section 21.6),
(ii) manometers (see Section 21.8),
(iii) Bourdon pressure gauge (see Section 21.9), and
(iv) McLeod and Pirani gauges (see Section 21.10).

\subsection*{21.6 Barometers}

\section*{Introduction}

A barometer is an instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure. It is affected by seasonal changes of temperature. Barometers are therefore also used for the measurement of altitude and also as one of the aids in weather forecasting. The value of atmospheric pressure will thus vary with climatic conditions, although not usually by more than about $10 \%$ of standard atmospheric pressure.

\section*{Construction and principle of operation}

A simple barometer consists of a glass tube, just less than 1 m in length, sealed at one end, filled with mercury and then inverted into a trough containing more mercury. Care must be taken to ensure that no air enters the tube during this latter process. Such a barometer is shown in Figure 21.3(a) and it is seen that the level of the mercury column falls, leaving an empty space, called a vacuum. Atmospheric pressure acts on the surface of the mercury in the trough as shown and this pressure is equal to the pressure at the base of the column of mercury in the inverted tube, i.e. the pressure of the atmosphere is supporting the column of mercury. If the atmospheric pressure falls the barometer height $h$ decreases. Similarly, if the atmospheric pressure rises then $h$ increases. Thus atmospheric pressure can be measured in terms of the height of the mercury column. It may be shown that for mercury the height $h$ is 760 mm at standard atmospheric pressure, i.e. a vertical column of mercury 760 mm
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-115.jpg?height=1166&width=745&top_left_y=147&top_left_x=96)

Figure 21.3
high exerts a pressure equal to the standard value of atmospheric pressure.
There are thus several ways in which atmospheric pressure can be expressed:
Standard atmospheric pressure
$$\begin{aligned}
& =101325 \mathrm{~Pa} \text { or } 101.325 \mathrm{kPa} \\
& =101325 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \text { or } 101.325 \mathrm{kN} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \\
& =1.01325 \text { bars or } 1013.25 \mathrm{mbars} \\
& =760 \mathrm{~mm} \text { of mercury }
\end{aligned}$$

Another arrangement of a typical barometer is shown in Figure 21.3(b) where a U-tube is used instead of an inverted tube and trough, the principle being similar.

If, instead of mercury, water was used as the liquid in a barometer, then the barometric height $h$ at standard atmospheric pressure would be 13.6 times more than for mercury, i.e. about 10.4 m high,
which is not very practicable. This is because the relative density of mercury is 13.6.

\section*{Types of barometer}

The Fortin barometer is an example of a mercury barometer that enables barometric heights to be measured to a high degree of accuracy (in the order of one-tenth of a millimetre or less). Its construction is merely a more sophisticated arrangement of the inverted tube and trough shown in Figure 21.3(a), with the addition of a vernier scale to measure the barometric height with great accuracy. A disadvantage of this type of barometer is that it is not portable.

A Fortin barometer is shown in Figure 21.4. Mercury is contained in a leather bag at the base of the mercury reservoir, and height, $H$, of the mercury in the reservoir can be adjusted using the screw at the base of the barometer to depress or release the leather bag. To measure the atmospheric pressure the screw is adjusted until the pointer at $H$ is just touching the surface of the mercury and the height of the mercury column is then read using the main and vernier scales. The measurement of atmospheric pressure using a Fortin barometer is achieved much more accurately than by using a simple barometer.

Figure 21.5
A portable type often used is the aneroid barometer. Such a barometer consists basically of a circular, hollow, sealed vessel, $S$, usually made from thin flexible metal. The air pressure in the vessel is reduced to nearly zero before sealing, so that a change in atmospheric pressure will cause the shape of the vessel to expand or contract. These small changes can be magnified by means of a lever and be made to move a pointer over a calibrated scale. Figure 21.5 shows a typical arrangement of an aneroid barometer. The scale is usually circular and calibrated in millimetres of mercury. These instruments require frequent calibration.

\subsection*{21.7 Absolute and gauge pressure}

A barometer measures the true or absolute pressure of the atmosphere. The term absolute pressure means the pressure above that of an absolute vacuum (which is zero pressure), as stated earlier. In Figure 21.6 a pressure scale is shown with the line $A B$ representing absolute zero pressure (i.e. a vacuum) and line $C D$ representing atmospheric pressure. With most practical pressure-measuring instruments the part of the instrument that is subjected to the pressure being measured is also subjected to atmospheric pressure. Thus practical instruments actually determine the difference between the pressure being measured and atmospheric pressure. The pressure that the instrument is measuring is then termed the gauge pressure. In Figure 21.6, the line $E F$ represents an absolute pressure which has a value greater than atmospheric pressure, i.e. the 'gauge' pressure is positive.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-116.jpg?height=474&width=782&top_left_y=157&top_left_x=882)

Figure 21.6

\section*{Thus, absolute pressure}
$=$ gauge pressure + atmospheric pressure.
Hence a gauge pressure of, say, 60 kPa recorded on an indicating instrument when the atmospheric pressure is 101 kPa is equivalent to an absolute pressure of $60 \mathrm{kPa}+101 \mathrm{kPa}$, or 161 kPa .

Pressure-measuring indicating instruments are referred to generally as pressure gauges (which acts as a reminder that they measure 'gauge' pressure).

It is possible, of course, for the pressure indicated on a pressure gauge to be below atmospheric pressure, i.e. the gauge pressure is negative. Such a gauge pressure is often referred to as a vacuum, even though it does not necessarily represent a complete vacuum at absolute zero pressure. Such a pressure is shown by the line $G H$ in Figure 21.6. An indicating instrument used for measuring such pressures is called a vacuum gauge.

A vacuum gauge indication of, say, 0.4 bar means that the pressure is 0.4 bar less than atmospheric pressure. If atmospheric pressure is 1 bar, then the absolute pressure is $1-0.4$ or 0.6 bar.

\subsection*{21.8 The manometer}

A manometer is a device for measuring or comparing fluid pressures, and is the simplest method of indicating such pressures.

\section*{U-tube manometer}

A U-tube manometer consists of a glass tube bent into a $U$ shape and containing a liquid such as mercury. A U-tube manometer is shown in Figure 21.7(a). If $\operatorname{limb} A$ is connected to a container of gas whose pressure is above atmospheric, then the pressure of the gas will cause the levels of mercury
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-117.jpg?height=1077&width=791&top_left_y=141&top_left_x=80)

Figure 21.7
to move as shown in Figure 21.7(b), such that the difference in height is $h_{1}$. The measuring scale can be calibrated to give the gauge pressure of the gas as $h_{1} \mathrm{~mm}$ of mercury.

If limb $A$ is connected to a container of gas whose pressure is below atmospheric then the levels of mercury will move as shown in Figure 21.7(c), such that their pressure difference is $h_{2} \mathrm{~mm}$ of mercury.

It is also possible merely to compare two pressures, say, $P_{A}$ and $P_{B}$, using a U-tube manometer. Figure 21.7(d) shows such an arrangement with ( $P_{B}-P_{A}$ ) equivalent to $h \mathrm{~mm}$ of mercury. One application of this differential pressure-measuring device is in determining the velocity of fluid flow in pipes (see Chapter 22).

For the measurement of lower pressures, water or paraffin may be used instead of mercury in the U-tube to give larger values of $h$ and thus greater sensitivity.

\section*{Inclined manometers}

For the measurement of very low pressures, greater sensitivity is achieved by using an inclined
manometer, a typical arrangement of which is shown in Figure 21.8. With the inclined manometer the liquid used is water and the scale attached to the inclined tube is calibrated in terms of the vertical height $h$. Thus when a vessel containing gas under pressure is connected to the reservoir, movement of the liquid levels of the manometer occurs. Since small-bore tubing is used the movement of the liquid in the reservoir is very small compared with the movement in the inclined tube and is thus neglected. Hence the scale on the manometer is usually used in the range 0.2 mbar to 2 mbar .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-117.jpg?height=445&width=765&top_left_y=676&top_left_x=893)

Figure 21.8

The pressure of a gas that a manometer is capable of measuring is naturally limited by the length of tube used. Most manometer tubes are less than 2 m in length and this restricts measurement to a maximum pressure of about 2.5 bar (or 250 kPa ) when mercury is used.

\subsection*{21.9 The Bourdon pressure gauge}

Pressures many times greater than atmospheric can be measured by the Bourdon pressure gauge, which is the most extensively used of all pressureindicating instruments. It is a robust instrument. Its main component is a piece of metal tube (called the Bourdon tube), usually made of phosphor bronze or alloy steel, of oval or elliptical cross-section, sealed at one end and bent into an arc. In some forms the tube is bent into a spiral for greater sensitivity. A typical arrangement is shown in Figure 21.9(a). One end, $E$, of the Bourdon tube is fixed and the fluid whose pressure is to be measured is connected to this end. The pressure acts at right angles to the metal tube wall as shown in the cross-section of the tube in Figure 21.9(b). Because of its elliptical shape it
is clear that the sum of the pressure components, i.e. the total force acting on the sides $A$ and $C$, exceeds the sum of the pressure components acting on ends $B$ and $D$. The result is that sides $A$ and $C$ tend to move outwards and $B$ and $D$ inwards tending to form a circular cross-section. As the pressure in the tube is increased the tube tends to uncurl, or if the pressure is reduced the tube curls up further. The movement of the free end of the tube is, for practical purposes, proportional to the pressure applied to the tube, this pressure, of course, being the gauge pressure (i.e. the difference between atmospheric pressure acting on the outside of the tube and the applied pressure acting on the inside of the tube). By using a link, a pivot and a toothed segment as shown in Figure 21.9(a), the movement can be converted into the rotation of a pointer over a graduated calibrated scale.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-118.jpg?height=1166&width=770&top_left_y=885&top_left_x=91)

Figure 21.9

The Bourdon tube pressure gauge is capable of measuring high pressures up to $10^{4}$ bar (i.e. 7600 m
of mercury) with the addition of special safety features.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-118.jpg?height=414&width=772&top_left_y=281&top_left_x=892)

Figure 21.10

A pressure gauge must be calibrated, and this is done either by a manometer, for low pressures, or by a piece of equipment called a 'dead weight tester'. This tester consists of a piston operating in an oil-filled cylinder of known bore, and carrying accurately known weights as shown in Figure 21.10. The gauge under test is attached to the tester and a screwed piston or ram applies the required pressure, until the weights are just lifted. While the gauge is being read, the weights are turned to reduce friction effects.

\subsection*{21.10 Vacuum gauges}

Vacuum gauges are instruments for giving a visual indication, by means of a pointer, of the amount by which the pressure of a fluid applied to the gauge is less than the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere. Two examples of vacuum gauges are the McLeod gauge and the Pirani gauge.

\section*{McLeod gauge}

The McLeod gauge is normally regarded as a standard and is used to calibrate other forms of vacuum gauges. The basic principle of this gauge is that it takes a known volume of gas at a pressure so low that it cannot be measured, then compresses the gas in a known ratio until the pressure becomes large enough to be measured by an ordinary manometer. This device is used to measure low pressures, often in the range $10^{-6}$ to 1.0 mm of mercury. A disadvantage of the McLeod gauge is that it does not give a continuous reading of pressure and is not suitable for registering rapid variations in pressure.

\section*{Pirani gauge}

The Pirani gauge measures the resistance and thus the temperature of a wire through which current is flowing. The thermal conductivity decreases with the pressure in the range $10^{-1}$ to $10^{-4} \mathrm{~mm}$ of mercury so that the increase in resistance can be used to measure pressure in this region. The Pirani gauge is calibrated by comparison with a McLeod gauge.

\subsection*{21.11 Hydrostatic pressure on submerged surfaces}

From Section 21.2, it can be seen that hydrostatic pressure increases with depth according to the formula:
$$p=\rho g h$$

Problem 10. The deepest part of the oceans is the Mariana's trench, where its depth is approximately 11.52 km ( 7.16 miles). What is the gauge pressure at this depth, assuming that $\rho=1020 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ and $g=9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$

Gauge pressure,
$$\begin{aligned}
p & =\rho g h \\
& =1020 \frac{\mathrm{~kg}}{\mathrm{~m}^{3}} \times 9.81 \frac{\mathrm{~m}}{\mathrm{~s}^{2}} \times 11.52 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~m} \\
& =11.527 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{bar}}{10^{5} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. pressure,
$$p=1152.7 \mathrm{bar}$$

Note that from the above calculation, it can be seen that a gauge pressure of 1 bar is approximately equivalent to a depth of 10 m .

Problem 11. Determine an expression for the thrust acting on a submerged plane surface, which is inclined to the horizontal by an angle $\theta$, as shown in Figure 21.11.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-119.jpg?height=530&width=688&top_left_y=158&top_left_x=898)

Figure 21.11

From Figure 21.11,
but $\quad h=y \sin \theta$
Hence, $\quad \delta F=\rho g y \sin \theta d A$

Total thrust on plane surface
$$=F=\int d F=\int \rho g y \sin \theta d A$$
or $\quad F=\rho \mathrm{g} \sin \theta \int y d \mathrm{~A}$

However, $\int y d A=A \bar{h}$
where $A=$ area of the surface,
and $\bar{h}=$ distance of the centroid of the plane from the free surface.

Problem 12. Determine an expression for the position of the centre of pressure of the plane surface $P\left(x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}\right)$ of Figure 21.11; this is also the position of the centre of thrust.

Taking moments about $O$ gives:
$$\begin{aligned}
F y^{\prime} & =\int \rho g y \sin \theta d A \times y \\
\text { However, } \quad F & =\rho g \sin \theta \int y d A
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, $\quad y^{\prime}=\frac{\int \rho g y^{2} \sin \theta d A}{\rho g \sin \theta \int y d A}$
$$=\frac{\rho g \sin \theta \int y^{2} d A}{\rho g \sin \theta \int y d A}=\frac{\left(A k^{2}\right)_{O x}}{A \bar{y}}$$
where $\left(A k^{2}\right)_{O x}=$ the second moment of area about $O x$
$k=$ the radius of gyration from $O$.

the centre of pressure from the top. The tank may be assumed to be just full.
[0.353 MN; 2 m ]

\subsection*{21.12 Hydrostatic thrust on curved surfaces}

As hydrostatic pressure acts perpendicularly to a surface, the integration of $\delta F$ over the surface can be complicated. One method of determining the thrust on a curved surface is to project its area on flat vertical and horizontal surfaces, as shown by $A B$ and $D E$, respectively, in Figure 21.12.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-120.jpg?height=543&width=657&top_left_y=836&top_left_x=892)

Figure 21.12
From equilibrium considerations, $F=F_{x}$ and $W=F_{y}$ and these thrusts must act through the centre of pressures of the respective vertical and horizontal planes. The resultant thrust can be obtained by adding $F_{x}$ and $F_{y}$ vectorially, where
$$\begin{aligned}
& W=\text { weight of the fluid enclosed by the curved } \\
& \text { surface and the vertical projection lines } \\
& \text { to the free surface, and } \\
& G=\text { centre of gravity of } W
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{21.13 Buoyancy}

The upward force exerted by the fluid on a body that is wholly or partially immersed in it is called the buoyancy of the body.

\subsection*{21.14 The stability of floating bodies}

For most ships and boats the centre of buoyancy ( $B$ ) of the vessel is usually below the vessels' centre of gravity ( $G$ ), as shown in Figure 21.13(a). When this vessel is subjected to a small angle of keel ( $\theta$ ), as shown in Figure 21.13(b), the centre of buoyancy moves to the position $B^{\prime}$, where
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_7875928bbf712b5261e7g-121.jpg?height=407&width=726&top_left_y=541&top_left_x=91)

Therefore,
$$G M=\frac{P x}{W} \cot \theta$$
where $W=$ the weight of the vessel, and
$$\cot \theta=\frac{1}{\tan \theta}$$

Problem 13. A naval architect has carried out hydrostatic calculations on a yacht, where he has found the following:
$$\begin{aligned}
M= & \text { mass of yacht }=100 \text { tonnes, } \\
K B= & \text { vertical distance of the centre of } \\
& \quad \text { buoyancy }(B) \text { above the keel }(K) \\
= & 1.2 \mathrm{~m} \text { (see Figure } 21.15), \\
B M= & \text { distance of the metacentre }(M) \text { above } \\
& \quad \text { the centre of buoyancy }=2.4 \mathrm{~m} .
\end{aligned}$$

Figure 21.13
$$\begin{aligned}
B M= & \text { the centre of curvature of the centre of } \\
& \quad \text { buoyancy }=\frac{I}{V}, \quad \text { (given without proof) } \\
G M= & \text { the metacentric height, } \\
M= & \text { the position of the metacentre, } \\
I= & \text { the second moment of area of the water } \\
& \text { plane about its centreline, and } \\
V= & \text { displaced volume of the vessel. }

He then carries out an inclining experiment, where he moves a mass of 50 kg through a transverse distance of 10 m across the yacht's deck. In doing this, he finds that the resulting angle of keel $\theta=1^{\circ}$. What is the metacentric height (GM) and the position of the centre of gravity of the yacht above the keel, namely $K G$ ? Assume $g=9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.
$$\begin{aligned}
P & =50 \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.81=490.5 \mathrm{~N} \\
W & =100 \text { tonnes } \times 1000 \frac{\mathrm{~kg}}{\text { tonne }} \times 9.81 \frac{\mathrm{~m}}{\mathrm{~s}^{2}} \\
& =981 \mathrm{kN} \\
x & =10 \mathrm{~m} \\
\theta & =1^{\circ} \text { from which, } \tan \theta=0.017455 \text { and } \\
\cot \theta & =\frac{1}{\tan \theta}=57.29
\end{aligned}$$

From equation (21.1),
$$\begin{aligned}
G M & =\frac{P x}{W} \cot \theta \\
& =\frac{490.5 \mathrm{~N} \times 10 \mathrm{~m} \times 57.29}{981 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~N}}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. metacentric height, $\boldsymbol{G} \boldsymbol{M} \boldsymbol{=} \mathbf{0 . 2 8 6} \mathbf{~ m}$
$$\text { Now } \begin{aligned}
K M & =K B+B M \\
& =1.2 \mathrm{~m}+2.4 \mathrm{~m}=3.6 \mathrm{~m} \\
K G & =K M-G M \\
& =3.6-0.286=3.314 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}$$
i.e. centre of gravity above the keel, $\boldsymbol{K} \boldsymbol{G} \mathbf{= 3 . 3 1 4} \mathbf{~ m}$, (where ' $K$ ' is a point on the keel).

Problem 14. A barge of length 30 m and width 8 m floats on an even keel at a depth of 3 m . What is the value of its buoyancy?
Take density of water, $\rho$, as $1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ and $g$ as $9.81 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

The displaced volume of the barge,
$$V=30 \mathrm{~m} \times 8 \mathrm{~m} \times 3 \mathrm{~m}=720 \mathrm{~m}^{3} .$$

From Section 21.4,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { buoyancy } & =V \rho g \\
& =720 \mathrm{~m}^{3} \times 1000 \frac{\mathrm{~kg}}{\mathrm{~m}^{3}} \times 9.81 \frac{\mathrm{~m}}{\mathrm{~s}^{2}} \\
& =7.063 \mathrm{MN}
\end{aligned}$$

Problem 15. If the vertical centre of gravity of the barge in Problem 14 is 2 m above the keel, (i.e. $K G=2 \mathrm{~m}$ ), what is the metacentric height of the barge?

Now $K B=$ the distance of the centre of buoyancy of the barge from the keel $=\frac{3 \mathrm{~m}}{2}$ i.e. $K B=1.5 \mathrm{~m}$.

From page 242, $B M=\frac{I}{V}$ and for a rectangle,
$$\begin{aligned}
& I=\frac{L b^{3}}{12} \text { from Table 7.1, page 91, where } \\
& L=\text { length of the waterplane }=30 \mathrm{~m}, \text { and } \\
& b=\text { width of the waterplane }=8 \mathrm{~m} .
\end{aligned}$$

Hence, moment of inertia,
$$I=\frac{30 \times 8^{3}}{12}=1280 \mathrm{~m}^{4}$$

From Problem 14, volume,
$$V=720 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$$
hence,
$$B M=\frac{I}{V}=\frac{1280}{720}=1.778 \mathrm{~m}$$

Now,
$K M=K B+B M=1.5 \mathrm{~m}+1.778 \mathrm{~m}=3.278 \mathrm{~m}$
i.e. the centre of gravity above the keel,
$$K M=3.278 \mathrm{~m} .$$

Since $K G=2 \mathrm{~m}$ (given), then
$$G M=K M-K G=3.278-2=1.278 \mathrm{~m},$$
i.e. the metacentric height of the barge, $G M=1.278 \mathrm{~m}$.
