                    <p>A liquid-in-glass thermometer uses the expansion of a liquid with increase in temperature as its principle of operation.</p>
                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Construction</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>A typical liquid-in-glass thermometer is shown in Figure 24.1 and consists of a sealed stem of uniform small-bore tubing, called a capillary tube, made of glass, with a cylindrical glass bulb formed at one end. The bulb and part of the stem are filled with a liquid such as mercury or alcohol and the remaining part of the tube is evacuated. A temperature scale is formed by etching graduations on the stem. A safety reservoir is usually provided, into which the liquid can expand without bursting the glass if the temperature is raised beyond the upper limit of the scale.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Principle of operation</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>The operation of a liquid-in-glass thermometer depends on the liquid expanding with increase in temperature and contracting with decrease in temperature. The position of the end of the column of liquid in the tube is a measure of the temperature of the liquid in the bulb - shown as $15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in Figure 24.1, which is about room temperature. Two fixed points are needed to calibrate the thermometer, with the interval between these points being divided into 'degrees'. In the first thermometer, made by Celsius, the fixed points chosen were the temperature of melting ice ($0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$) and that of boiling water at standard atmospheric pressure ($100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$), in each case the blank stem being marked at the liquid level. The distance between these two points, called the fundamental interval, was divided into 100 equal parts, each equivalent to $1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, thus forming the scale.</p>
                         <p>The clinical thermometer, with a limited scale around body temperature, the maximum and/or minimum thermometer, recording the maximum day temperature and minimum night temperature, and the Beckman thermometer, which is used only in accurate measurement of temperature change and has no fixed points, are particular types of liquid-in-glass thermometer which all operate on the same principle.</p>

                    <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Advantages</h4>
                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>The liquid-in-glass thermometer is simple in construction, relatively inexpensive, easy to use and portable, and is the most widely used method of temperature measurement having industrial, chemical , clinical and meteorological applications.</p>

                         <p>Liquid-in-glass thermometers tend to be fragile and hence easily broken, can only be used where the liquid column is visible, cannot be used for surface temperature measurements, cannot be read from a distance and are unsuitable for high temperature measurements.</p>

                         <p>Mercury has a freezing point of $-39^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and cannot be used in a thermometer below this temperature. Its boiling point is $357^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ but before this temperature is reached some distillation of the mercury occurs if the space above the mercury is a vacuum. To prevent this, and to extend the upper temperature limits to over $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, an inert gas such as nitrogen under pressure is used to fill the remainder of the capillary tube. Alcohol, often dyed red to be seen in the capillary tube, is considerably cheaper than mercury and has a freezing point of $-113^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, which is considerably lower than for mercury. However it has a low boiling point at about $79^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.</p>

                         <p>At the junction between two different metals, say, copper and constantan, there exists a difference in electrical potential, which varies with the temperature of the junction. This is known as the 'thermoelectric effect'. If the circuit is completed with a second junction at a different temperature, a current will flow round the circuit. This principle is used in the thermocouple. Two different metal conductors having their ends twisted together are shown in Figure 24.2. If the two junctions are at different temperatures, a current I flows round the circuit. The deflection on the galvanometer G depends on the difference in temperature between junctions $X$ and $Y$ and is caused by the difference between voltages $V_{x}$ and $V_{y}$. The higher temperature junction</p>

                         <p>is usually called the 'hot junction' and the lower temperature junction the 'cold junction'. If the cold junction is kept at a constant known temperature, the galvanometer can be calibrated to indicate the temperature of the hot junction directly. The cold junction is then known as the reference junction. In many instrumentation situations, the measuring instrument needs to be located far from the point at which the measurements are to be made. Extension leads are then used, usually made of the same material as the thermocouple but of smaller gauge. The reference junction is then effectively moved to their ends. The thermocouple is used by positioning the hot junction where the temperature is required. The meter will indicate the temperature of the hot junction only if the reference junction is at $0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for:</p>

                         <p>In a laboratory the reference junction is often placed in melting ice, but in industry it is often positioned in a thermostatically controlled oven or buried underground where the temperature is constant.</p>

Apart from the actual junction the two conductors used must be insulated electrically from each other with appropriate insulation and is shown in Figure 24.3 as twin-holed tubing. The wires and insulation are usually inserted into a sheath for protection from environments in which they might be damaged or corroded.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>Resistance thermometers are made in a variety of sizes, shapes and forms depending on the application for which they are designed. A typical resistance thermometer is shown diagrammatically in Figure 24.4. The most common metal used for the coil in such thermometers is platinum even though its sensitivity is not as high as other metals such as copper and nickel. However, platinum is a very stable metal and provides reproducible results in a resistance thermometer. A platinum resistance thermometer is often used as a calibrating device. Since platinum is expensive, connecting leads of another metal, usually copper, are used with the thermometer to connect it to a measuring circuit. The platinum and the connecting leads are shown joined at $A$ and $B$ in Figure 24.4, although sometimes this junction may be made outside of the sheath. However, these leads often come into close contact with the heat source which can introduce errors into the measurements. These may be eliminated by including a pair of identical leads, called dummy leads, which experience the same temperature change as the extension leads.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>With most metals a rise in temperature causes an increase in electrical resistance, and since resistance can be measured accurately this property can be used to measure temperature. If the resistance of a length of wire at $0{ }^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ is $R_{0}$, and its resistance at $\theta^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ is $R_{\theta}$, then $R_{\theta}=R_{0}(1+\alpha \theta)$, where $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistance of the material (see Chapter 20).</p>
                         <p>Rearranging gives:</p>
                         <div class="equation">
                              $$\text {temperature}, \theta=\frac{R_{\theta}-R_{0}}{\alpha R_{0}}$$
                         </div>
                         <p>Values of $R_{0}$ and $\alpha$ may be determined experimentally or obtained from existing data. Thus, if $R_{\theta}$ can be measured, temperature $\theta$ can be calculated. This is the principle of operation of a resistance thermometer. Although a sensitive ohmmeter can be used to measure $R_{\theta}$, for more accurate determinations a Wheatstone bridge circuit is used as shown in Figure 24.5. This circuit compares an unknown resistance $R_{\theta}$ with others of known values, $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ being fixed values and $R_{3}$ being variable. Galvanometer G is a sensitive centre-zero microammeter. $R_{3}$ is varied until zero deflection is obtained on the galvanometer, i.e. no current flows through G and the bridge is said to be 'balanced'. At balance: $$ R_{2}R_{\theta}=R_{1}R_{3} $$ from which, $$ R_{\theta}=\frac{R_{1}R_{3}}{R_{2}} $$ and if $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are of equal value, then $R_{\theta}=R_{3}$ A resistance thermometer may be connected between points $A$ and $B$ in Figure 24.5 and its resistance $R_{\theta}$ at any temperature $\theta$ accurately measured. Dummy leads included in arm $BC$ help to eliminate errors caused by the extension leads which are normally necessary in such a thermometer.</p>

                    <p>A pyrometer is a device for measuring very high temperatures and uses the principle that all substances emit radiant energy when hot, the rate of emission depending on their temperature. The measurement of thermal radiation is therefore a convenient method of determining the temperature of hot sources and is particularly useful in industrial processes. There are two main types of pyrometer, namely the total radiation pyrometer and the optical pyrometer. Pyrometers are very convenient instruments since they can be used at a safe and comfortable distance from the hot source. Thus applications of pyrometers are found in measuring the temperature of molten metals, the interiors of furnaces or the interiors of volcanoes. Total radiation pyrometers can also be used in conjunction with devices which record and control temperature continuously.</p>

The thermocouple is protected from direct radiation by a shield as shown and the hot source may be viewed through the sighting telescope. For greater sensitivity, a thermopile may be used, a thermopile being a number of thermocouples connected in series.

The most frequently used optical pyrometer is the disappearing filament pyrometer and a typical arrangement is shown in Figure 24.8. A filament lamp is built into a telescope arrangement which receives radiation from a hot source, an image of which is seen through an eyepiece. A red filter is incorporated as a protection to the eye. The current flowing through the lamp is controlled by a variable resistor. As the current is increased the temperature of the filament increases and its colour changes. When viewed through the eyepiece the filament of the lamp appears superimposed on the image of the radiant energy from the hot source.

                         <p>Temperature indicating paints contain substances which change their colour when heated to certain temperatures. This change is usually due to chemical decomposition, such as loss of water, in which the change in colour of the paint after having reached the particular temperature will be a permanent one. However, in some types the original colour returns after cooling. Temperature indicating paints are used where the temperature of inaccessible parts of apparatus and machines is required. They are particularly useful in heat-treatment processes where the temperature of the component needs to be known before a quenching operation. There are several such paints available and most have only a small temperature range so that different paints have to be used for different temperatures. The usual range of temperatures covered by these paints is from about $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.</p>
                         <p>Temperature sensitive crayons consist of fusible solids compressed into the form of a stick. The melting point of such crayons is used to determine when a given temperature has been reached. The crayons are simple to use but indicate a single temperature only, i.e. its melting point temperature. There are over 100 different crayons available, each covering a particular range of temperature. Crayons are available for temperatures within the range of $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $1400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Such crayons are used in metallurgical applications such as preheating before welding, hardening, annealing or tempering, or in monitoring the temperature of critical parts of machines or for checking mould temperatures in the rubber and plastics industries.</p>

                         <p>Bimetallic thermometers depend on the expansion of metal strips which operate an indicating pointer. Two thin metal strips of differing thermal expansion are welded or riveted together and the curvature of the bimetallic strip changes with temperature change. For greater sensitivity the strips may be coiled into a flat spiral or helix, one end being fixed and the other being made to rotate a pointer over a scale. Bimetallic thermometers are useful for alarm and over-temperature applications where extreme accuracy is not essential. If the whole is placed in a sheath, protection from corrosive environments is achieved but with a reduction in response characteristics. The normal upper limit of temperature measurement by this thermometer is about $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, although with special metals the range can be extended to about $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.</p>

                         <p>The mercury-in-steel thermometer is an extension of the principle of the mercury-in-glass thermometer. Mercury in a steel bulb expands via a small bore capillary tube into a pressure indicating device, say a Bourdon gauge, the position of the pointer indicating the amount of expansion and thus the temperature. The advantages of this instrument are that it is robust and, by increasing the length of the capillary tube, the gauge can be placed some distance from the bulb and can thus be used to monitor temperatures in positions which are inaccessible to the liquid-inglass thermometer. Such thermometers may be used to measure temperatures up to $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.</p>

                         <p>The gas thermometer consists of a flexible U-tube of mercury connected by a capillary tube to a vessel containing gas. The change in the volume of a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure, or the change in pressure of a fixed mass of gas at constant volume, may be used to measure temperature. This thermometer is cumbersome and rarely used to measure temperature directly, but it is often used as a standard with which to calibrate other types of thermometer. With pure hydrogen the range of the instrument extends from $-240^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $1500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and measurements can be made with extreme accuracy.</p>
