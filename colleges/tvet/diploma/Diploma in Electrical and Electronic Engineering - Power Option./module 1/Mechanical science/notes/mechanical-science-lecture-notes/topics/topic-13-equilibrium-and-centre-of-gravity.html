                        <h3>13.1: Centre of gravity</h3>

                        <p>The force of gravity normally tends to attract all bodies towards the centre of the earth. The point of application of the resultant force due to the earth's gravitational pull is referred to as the <dfn>centre of gravity</dfn> of the body. This is the point at which the whole weight of the body is concentrated.</p>
                        <p>Centre of gravity</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-054-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating centre of gravity of a regularly shaped object" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>It is at this point where the body can be balanced. The centre of gravity of a body is also its centre of mass.</p>
                        <p>The centre of gravity of a regular object can be obtained through geometrical construction as it is its geometrical centre.</p>
                        <p>c.o.g</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-054-2.jpg" alt="Diagram showing geometric center as center of gravity for simple shapes" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>However, for an irregular object the centre of gravity can be located through the following steps:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">•</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Three holes are made at different points along the edge of the object.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">•</span>
                                <span class="item-text">The object is then suspended in turn using the holes and a plumb line attached to trace the vertical line through its centre of gravity.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The point of intersection of the three lines will be the centre of gravity of the irregular object. Centre of gravity</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-054-3.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating finding the centre of gravity of an irregular laminate using a plumb line" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>At times the centre of gravity can be in an empty space, especially for hollow objects.</p>

                        <h3>13.2: Stability and equilibrium</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Stability</dfn> refers to the state of rest of a body while <dfn>equilibrium</dfn> is the state of balance of a body. When a body is in equilibrium, it stays in that position as long as there is no external influence on it.</p>

                        <p>There are three states of equilibrium namely:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">•</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Stable equilibrium</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">•</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Unstable equilibrium</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">•</span>
                                <span class="item-text">A neutral equilibrium</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>These states can be illustrated by the following set up:</p>
                        <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-055-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating stable equilibrium of a cone" class="content-image">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-055-2.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating unstable equilibrium of a cone" class="content-image">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-055-3.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating neutral equilibrium of a cone" class="content-image">
                        </div>
                        <p>Fig. i</p>

                        <p>a) Stable equilibrium</p>

                        <p>When the cone is given a slight displacement as shown in fig. i, it is observed that the line through its centre of gravity still passes through the base area. The centre of gravity of the cone is also raised. When the force is withdrawn, the object returns to its original position without toppling. The body is said to have a stable equilibrium.</p>

                        <p>In modern buses, the luggage compartments are situated in the lower part so as to lower the position of the centre of gravity and hence increased stability.</p>

                        <p>b) Unstable equilibrium</p>

                        <p>In fig. ii, the cone has been balanced on its tip. When slightly displaced, the vertical line through its centre of gravity will fall outside its base as shown above. When the force is withdrawn, the cone will not be able to regain its original position and is thus said to be in an unstable equilibrium.</p>

                        <p>Most buses which carry heavy luggage on the upper carrier are always unstable as their centres of gravity are always raised.</p>

                        <p>c) Neutral equilibrium</p>

                        <p>In fig. iii, the cone has been placed on its side and can therefore roll over. However, this does not change the position of its centre of gravity. Hence the body is said to be in a state of neutral equilibrium.</p>

                        <h3>13.2.1: Factors affecting stability</h3>
                        <p>Area of the base</p>

                        <p>A body with a larger base area will have the line through its centre of gravity passing through its base even when tilted through a larger angle. Hence the larger the base area the more stable a body is.</p>

                        <p>The position of the centre of gravity</p>

                        <p>A body having its centre of gravity very low is more stable compared to one with a raised centre of gravity. The centre of gravity of a body can be lowered by making its base heavier.</p>
