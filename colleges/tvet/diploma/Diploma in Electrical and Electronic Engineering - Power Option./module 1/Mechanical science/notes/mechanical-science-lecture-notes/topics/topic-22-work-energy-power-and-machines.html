                        <h3>22.1: Work and Energy</h3>
                        <p>When a force acting on a body displaces the body in the direction of the force <dfn>work</dfn> is said to have been done. Work is the product of force and displacement in the direction of the force; Workdone= force $\mathrm{F}^{*}$ displacement s .</p>

                        <p>The SI Unit of work is newton-metre (Nm). 1Nm= 1joule (1J). A joule is defined as the workdone by a force of one newton to displace a body through one metre in the direction of the force.</p>

                        <p>Other multiples of the joule include kilojoule(kJ) and megajoule(MJ). <dfn>Energy</dfn> on the hand is the ability or capacity to do work. Anything that possesses energy is capable of doing work. The SI Unit of energy is the joule. Energy has the following characteristics: - It is not visible. - Occupies no space. - Has no mass nor any other physical property. The most common sources of energy include the sun, wind, geothermal, waterfalls, nuclear or atomic energy, fuels etc.</p>

                        <p>Energy resources may be grouped into two: ${ }^{\text {}}$ Renewable energy- can be reused again and again. Their supplies are inexhaustible e.g solar, geothermal, wind energy. ${ }^{\text {}}$ Non-renewable energy- their supplies are exhaustible i.e. cannot be reused once exhausted e.g. wood, coal biogas, petroleum etc. Energy exists in many forms such as mechanical, chemical, heat and electrical energy amongst others. In this topic, we will look at mechanical energy.</p>

                        <h3>22.1.1: Mechanical energy</h3>
                        <p>It is divided into two areas namely kinetic energy and potential energy. <dfn>Kinetic energy</dfn> is the energy possessed by a body in motion. Suppose a body of mass $m$ is moving with a constant velocity v , then its kinetic energy is given by; Kinetic energy $=1/2\left(\mathrm{mv}^{2}\right)$. <dfn>Potential energy</dfn> on the other hand is a form of stored energy in a body when it is in a particular state or position. A body in a raised position possesses gravitational potential energy given by; P. $\mathbf{Eg}_{\mathbf{g}}=\mathbf{mgh}$, where m - mass of the body, g - gravitational field strength and h - height above the ground. Also, a stretched or compressed material is able to regain its original shape when released. This is because it possesses a type of potential energy known as elastic potential energy. As can be recalled from Hooke's law, the workdone in stretching or compressing an elastic material is given by; $\mathrm{W}=1/2(\mathrm{Fe})=1/2\left(\mathrm{ke}^{2}\right)$. Hence the elastic potential energy is given by; $\mathbf{P} . \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{e}}=\mathbf{1}/ \mathbf{2}(\mathbf{Fe})$ $=1/2\left(\mathrm{ke}^{2}\right)$.</p>

                        <h3>22.1.2: The law of conservation of energy</h3>
                        <p><dfn>The law</dfn> states: energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can be transformed from one form to another. Alternative statement: the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of a system is a constant. Below is the energy transformation in a hydroelectric power station:</p>

                        <h4>Example 22.1</h4>
                        <p>1. A force of 40 N is applied on a body. The body moves a horizontal distance of 7 m . Calculate the workdone on the body. $\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{F}^{*} \mathrm{~s}=40 \mathrm{~N}^{*} 7 \mathrm{~m}$</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\begin{aligned}
                            & =280 \mathrm{Nm} \text { or } 280 \mathrm{~J}

                        </div>
                        <p>2. A box of mass 30 kg is pushed up an inclined plane of length 14 m using a force of 130 N as shown below: If the track is inclined at an angle of $20^{\circ}$, calculate:</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-085-2.jpg" alt="Diagram of a box being pushed up an inclined plane" class="content-image">
                         </div>
                        <p>a) The height of the platform. Sin $20^{\circ}=\mathrm{h}/14\mathrm{h}=14 \sin 20^{\circ}=$ b) Workdone by the force of 130 N . $\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{F}^{*} \mathrm{~s}=130^{*} 14=1820 \mathrm{~J}$ c) Workdone, if the box is lifted vertically upwards. Compare your answer in (b) and (c) above. $\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{mgh}=300 \sin 20^{\circ}=$ Workdone in pushing the body along the inclined plane is greater than the workdone when lifting the body vertically upwards. This is because of the frictional force between the body and the inclined plane. d) The frictional force between the box and the inclined plane. $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{r}}=1820-300 \sin 20^{\circ}=$</p>
                        <p>3. A crane is used to lift a body of mass 30 kg through a vertical distance of 6.0 m . a) How much work is done on the body? $\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{F}^{*} \mathrm{~s}=(\mathrm{mg})\mathrm{s}=300^{*} 6=1800 \mathrm{~J}$ b) What is the potential energy stored in the body? P.E $=$ mgh $=30^{*} 10^{*} 6=1800$ J c) Comment on the two answers above. Workdone on the body is equal to the potential energy stored in the body. Hence the workdone against gravity is stored as the potential energy.</p>
                        <p>4. A spring of spring constant $25 \mathrm{~N}/ \mathrm{m}$ is stretched such that its length increases from 10 cm to 20 cm . calculate the amount of workdone on stretching the spring. $\mathrm{W}=1/2\left(\mathrm{ke}^{2}\right)=1/2(25)(0.1^{2})$</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$=0.125 \mathrm{~J}$$

                        <p>5. A body of mass 12 kg is pulled from the rest with a constant force of 25 N . The force is applied for 6.0 s . Calculate: a) The distance travelled. $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma} \mathrm{a}=25 \mathrm{~N}/12 \mathrm{~kg}=2.1 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}^{2}, u=0, t=6$ $s=ut+1/2 at^{2}=(0 * 6)+1/2(2.1)(6^{2})=37.8 \mathrm{~m}$ b) Workdone on the body. $\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{F}^{*} \mathrm{~s}=25^{*} 37.8=945 \mathrm{~J}$ c) The final kinetic energy of the body. K.E=workdone=945J d) The final velocity of the body. K.E=1/2(mv2)=945J v=$\{(2*945)/12\}^{1/2}=$ $12.6 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$.</p>

                        <h3>22.2: Power</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Power</dfn> is defined as the rate of doing work; Power=workdone/time. The SI Unit of power is the watt (W). 1W=1J/s. Other multiples of the watt include the kilowatt(kW) and megawatt(MW); 1W=10^{-3} \mathrm{~kW}$ 1W=10^{-6} \mathrm{~MW}$ The power of a device is the measure of how fast the device can perform a given task or convert a given amount of energy. For example, a device rated 1 kW converts 1000J of energy to another form in one second. Power=workdone/time $=\mathrm{Fd}/ \mathrm{t}$. But $\mathrm{d}/ \mathrm{t}=$ velocity v . Therefore, power= force F*velocity v.</p>

                        <h4>Example 22.2</h4>
                        <p>1. A person of mass 60 kg climbs 16 m up a rope in 20 seconds. Find the average power developed by the person. Power=workdone/time $=(600^{*} 16)/20=480 \mathrm{~W}$</p>
                        <p>2. A person of mass 40 kg runs up a flight of 50 stairs each of height 20 cm in 5 seconds. Calculate: a) The workdone. $\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{mgh}=40^{*} 10^{*}(50^{*} 0.2)=4000 \mathrm{~J}$ b) The average power of the person. Power $=4000 \mathrm{~J}/5 \mathrm{~s}=800 \mathrm{~W}$ c) Explain why the energy the person actually uses to climb up is greater than the calculated workdone.</p>

                        <h3>22.3: Machines</h3>
                        <p>A <dfn>machine</dfn> is a device that makes work easier. In a machine, a force applied at one point of a system is used to generate another force at a different point of the system to overcome a load. The following terms are used in machines: a) <dfn>Effort</dfn>- the force applied to the machine. b) <dfn>Load</dfn>- the force exerted by the machine.</p>

                        <p>c) <dfn>Mechanical advantage</dfn> (M.A)- the ratio of the load to effort. M.A=Load/Effort. It has no units. It is dependent on friction between the moving parts and the weight of the parts of the machine that have to be lifted when operating the machine; the greater the friction the smaller the mechanical advantage. d) <dfn>Velocity ratio</dfn> (V.R)- it is defined as the ratio of the velocity of the effort to the velocity of the load; $\mathbf{V} . \mathbf{R}=$ velocity of effort/velocity of load $=$ Effort distance/time Load distance/time Thus V.R=effort distance/load distance. Velocity ratio also has no units. e) <dfn>Efficiency</dfn> $\mathbf{\eta}$ It is the ratio of the workdone on the load (work output) to the workdone by the effort (work input) expressed as a percentage; Efficiency $\eta=$ (work output/work input) * 100. Efficiency also depends on the friction between the moving parts and the weight of the moveable parts. Hence the efficiency of a machine is always less than $100 \%$. Efficiency=work output/work input= (load*load distance)/ (effort*effort distance) $=$ (load/effort) *(load distance/effort distance) But load/effort =mechanical advantage (M.A), And, load distance/effort distance $=1$/velocity ratio Therefore, efficiency $\eta=(\text { M.A/V.R })^{*} 100$.</p>

                        <h4>Example 22.3</h4>
                        <p>1. A machine requires 6000 J of energy to lift a mass of 55kg through a vertical distance of 8m. Calculate its efficiency. Work input $=6000 \mathrm{~J}$ Work output $=\mathrm{F}^{*} \mathrm{~s}=55^{*} 10^{*} 8=4400 \mathrm{~J}$ Efficiency $=(\text { work output/work input })^{*} 100=(4400/6000)^{*} 100=73.33 \%$</p>
                        <p>2. An effort of 250 N raises a load of 900 N through 5 m in a machine. If the effort moves through 25 m , find: a) The useful workdone in raising the load. Useful workdone=load*load distance $=900 * 5=4500 \mathrm{~J}$ b) The workdone by the effort. Workdone by the effort= effort*effort distance=250*25=6250J c) The efficiency of the machine. Efficiency $=(\text { work ouput/work input })^{*} 100=(4500/6250)^{*} 100=72 \%$.</p>
                        <p>3. A machine whose velocity ratio is 8 is used to lift a load of 300 N . The effort required is 60 N . calculate: a) The mechanical advantage of the machine. M.A= load/effort $=300/60=5$ b) The efficiency of the machine. Efficiency $=(\text { M.A/V.R })^{*} 100=(5/8)^{*} 100=62.5 \%$</p>

                        <h3>22.4: Types of machines</h3>
                        <p>Below are some of the common machines:</p>

                        <h3>22.4.1: Inclined plane</h3>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-089-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of an inclined plane illustrating load, effort, length, and height" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>The distance moved by the effort is L while the vertical height moved by the load is h . Also, $\sin \theta=\mathrm{h}/ \mathrm{L}$ Or simply $\mathrm{h}=\mathrm{L} \sin \theta$ Therefore, velocity ratio (V.R) $=$ effort distance/ load distance $=\mathrm{L}/ \mathrm{L} \sin \theta$. Hence V.R= $1/ \sin \theta$.</p>

                        <h4>Example 22.4</h4>
                        <p>1. A man uses an inclined plane to lift a 81 kg mass through a vertical height of 4.0 m . Given that the angle of inclination of the plane is $30^{\circ}$ and its efficiency is $75 \%$, determine: a) The effort needed to move the load up the inclined plane at a constant velocity. $V \cdot R=1/ \sin 30=2$ Therefore, (M.A/2)*100=75 M.A $=(2* 75)/100=3/2$ $3/2=810 \mathrm{~N}/$ effort Effort $=(810* 2)/3=540 \mathrm{~N}$ b) The workdone against friction in raising the mass through the height of 4.0 m . Work input=effort*effort distance $=(540^{*} 4)/\sin 30=4320 \mathrm{~J}$ Work output=load*load distance $=81^{*} 10^{*} 4=3240 \mathrm{~J}$ Therefore, workdone against friction= 4320-3240=1180J</p>

                        <h3>22.4.2: A screw and bolt</h3>
                        <p>For a screw, when the effort applied on the head moves through a complete revolution, the screw advances by a distance equivalent to one pitch. A <dfn>pitch</dfn> is the distance between two successive threads. d Pitch</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-090-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the pitch of a screw thread" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>Distance moved by the effort $=$ circumference $=\pi \mathrm{d}$ Distance moved by the load= one pitch Hence, velocity ratio (V.R)= circumference/pitch $=\pi \mathrm{d}/$ pitch .</p>
                        <p>For the bolt, effort is applied at the free end of the spanner.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-090-2.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating effort distance for a bolt and spanner" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>Therefore, the distance moved by the effort in one revolution= circumference $=2 \pi \mathrm{R}$. Hence, V.R= circumference/pitch $=2 \pi \mathrm{R}/$ pitch.</p>
                        <p>Note that a combination of a screw and lever can be used as a jack for fitting heavy loads e.g car jack. When two or more systems are combined together, the overall velocity ratio is the product of the individual velocity ratios; Combined V.R= V.R1*V.R2* $\qquad$ *V. $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{k}}$</p>

                        <h4>Example 22.5</h4>
                        <p>1. The figure below shows a screw jack whose screw has a pitch of 1 mm and has a handle of 25 cm long. 25 cm</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-091-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a screw jack" class="content-image">
                         </div>
                        <p>Determine the velocity ratio of the jack. V.R $=2 \pi \mathrm{r}/$ pitch $=2 \pi(25 \mathrm{~cm})/0.1 \mathrm{~cm}=1571$</p>

                        <h3>22.4.3: Lever system</h3>

                         </div>

                        <p>The velocity ratio of a lever system is the ratio of the effort arm to the load arm; V.R= Effort arm/ Load arm.</p>

                        <h3>22.4.4: Gears</h3>
                        <p>A <dfn>gear</dfn> is a wheel with equally spaced teeth or cogs around it. The wheel on which the effort is applied is called the driving (input) gear while the load gear is referred to as the driven (output) gear. Suppose the driving gear has $\mathbf{n}$ teeth and the driven gearN teeth, then when the driving gear makes one complete revolution the driven gear makes $\mathbf{n}/ \mathbf{N}$ revolutions. V.R of the system $=$ Number of revolutions made by the effort (driving) gear Number of revolutions made by the load (driven) gear. V.R = 1revolution $=\mathrm{N}/ \mathrm{n}$ $\mathrm{n}/ \mathrm{N}$ revolutions</p>

                        <p>Hence, velocity ratio of a gear system is the ratio of the number of teeth of the driven gear to the number of teeth of the driving gear; V.R $=$ Number of teeth of the driven gear Number of teeth of the driving gear</p>

                        <h3>22.4.5: Pulleys</h3>
                        <p>A <dfn>pulley</dfn> is a wheel with a groove to accommodate a string or rope. There are three possible systems of pulleys namely single fixed, single moveable and a block and tackle. a) Single fixed pulley E</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-092-2.jpg" alt="Diagram of a single fixed pulley" class="content-image">
                         </div>
                        <p>In this arrangement, both the effort and load move through the same distance. Hence the velocity ratio of the system is one.</p>

                        <p>b) Single moveable pulley E</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-093-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a single movable pulley" class="content-image">
                         </div>
                        <p>The load is supported by two sections of the string. If the load is pulled upwards through a distance of 1 m , each section of the string also moves through 1 m . Hence the effort moves through a total distance of 2 m . Therefore, the velocity ratio of the system $=$ effort distance/load distance $=2 \mathrm{~m}/1 \mathrm{~m}=2$.</p>
                        <p>c) A block and tackle</p>

                        <p>This system comprises two sets; one set fixed and the other moveable. A single string is then passed around each pulley in turn. The arrangement can take several forms depending on the desired velocity ratio. Below is an example: E</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-093-2.jpg" alt="Diagram of a block and tackle pulley system" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>In this case, there are four sections of the string supporting the load. Hence, when the load moves upwards through a distance of 1 m , each section of the string also shortens by 1 m . Therefore, the total distance moved by the effort (string) is 4 m . Thus, V.R of the system= effort distance/load distance $=4 \mathrm{~m}/ 1 \mathrm{~m}=4$. Coincidentally, the velocity ratio of the system is the same as the number of sections of the string supporting the load. Generally, the velocity ratio of a block and tackle system is given by the number of sections of the string supporting the load. Practically, the efficiency of any pulley system is less than $100 \%$. This is as a result of two reasons: - The friction between the moveable parts. - The weight of the parts that have to be lifted when operating the system.</p>

                        <h4>Example 22.7</h4>

                        <p>V. $\mathrm{R}=$ number of strings supporting the load $=6$ b) If an effort of 1000 N is needed to raise a load of 4500 N , determine the efficiency of the system. M.A= load/effort= $4500 \mathrm{~N}/1000 \mathrm{~N}=4.5$ Efficiency $=(\text { M.A/V.R })^{*} 100=(4.5/6) * 100=75 \%$ c) Calculate the wasted energy if a mass of 500 kg is lifted up through a height of 2 m using the same system. Work ouput= load*load distance $=500 * 10 * 2=10000 \mathrm{~J}$ Efficiency= (work output/work input)*100 Therefore, (10000J/work input)*100=75 Work input $=(10000* 100)/75=13333.33 \mathrm{~J}$ Wasted energy= 13333.33-10000=3333.33J Alternatively, wasted energy=25% of work input= $(25/100) * 13333.33 \mathrm{~J}=3333.33$</p>

                        <p>Therefore, the velocity ratio of a hydraulic system is the ratio of the area of the load piston to the area of the effort piston. If the pistons are circular then; V.

                        <p>Note that in this case, both the wheel and axle make the same number of revolutions at any time; Thus, in one revolution the distance moved by the effort $=2 \pi R$, And the distance moved by the load $=2 \pi$. Hence, the velocity ratio of the system $=2 \pi R/2 \pi r=R/r$.</p>
