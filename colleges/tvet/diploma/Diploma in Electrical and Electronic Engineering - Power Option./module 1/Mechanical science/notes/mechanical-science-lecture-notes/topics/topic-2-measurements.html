                        <p>The study of physics deals mostly with physical quantities. It involves investigation, making observations, collection of data and their analysis, interpretation and drawing conclusions.one important aspect in data collection is taking measurements. When taking measurements, one must first know the quantity to be measured and the unit for measuring it.</p>

                        <p>For purposes of uniformity, physical quantities have been assigned specific units which are acceptable world over. These are referred to as International Standard Unit (SI Unit).</p>

                        <p>Physical quantities are categorized into two namely basic physical quantities and derived physical quantities. A basic physical quantity is a quantity that cannot be obtained by either multiplication or division of other basic physical quantities. They are seven in number. The table below shows the seven basic physical quantities, their symbols, SI units and the symbols to the units:</p>

                        <p>Length can be defined as the distance between any two points. The SI unit of length is the metre (m). Other multiples and submultiples of the metre are stated below:</p>

                        <p>Length can be estimated or measured accurately using appropriate measuring instrument. The type of instrument to be used at any time depends on two factors:</p>

                            <li class="list-item">

                        <h3>2.2.1: Estimation</h3>
                        <p>This method involves comparing the object to be measured with another of standard measure. For example, the height of a tall flag post can be compared with that of a wooden rod whose length is known. Thus at any given time;</p>

                        <p>Height of flag post/ height of rod = length of shadow of post/ length of shadow of rod</p>

                        <p>From this expression, the height of the flag post can be estimated. Suppose the height of the rod= 1 m , length of shadow of rod $=120 \mathrm{~cm}$ and length of shadow of post $=480 \mathrm{~cm}$, then the height of the flag post is given by; $\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{p}}$ / $100 \mathrm{~cm}=480 \mathrm{~cm} / 120 \mathrm{~cm}$</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\begin{aligned}
                            & \mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{p}}=100 \times 4=400 \mathrm{~cm}

                        </div>
                        <p>Also, the thickness of a sheet of paper may be estimated by taking several sheets of the paper and measuring their thickness then dividing by the number of sheets of paper;</p>

                        <p>Thickness of a sheet of paper= thickness of n papers/ number of papers, n .</p>

                        <h3>2.2.2: Accurate measurement</h3>
                        <p>To measure length accurately, the following instruments can be used:</p>
                        <p>a) Metre rule</p>

                        <p>A metre rule is marked in centimetres. It is marked 0 and 100 cm at its extreme ends. If some space is left before 0 cm and 100 cm mark then it is referred to as a ruler.</p>
                        <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-004-1.jpg" alt="Illustration of a metre rule" class="content-image">
                        </div>

                        <p>The smallest scale division of a metre rule is $0.1 \mathrm{~cm}(1 \mathrm{~mm})$. The smallest scale division of any instrument is known as its accuracy. Thus the accuracy of a metre rule is 0.1 cm .</p>

                        <p>When using a metre, one must ensure the following:</p>

                        <p>b) Vernier calipers( form two work)</p>
                        <p>A vernier calliper is more accurate compared to a metre rule. It has two scales; the main scale and vernier scale. It has an accuracy of 0.01 cm compared to that of a metre rule of 0.1 cm . It also has two jaws; the inside jaws and outside jaws. The object whose length is to be measured is placed between the outside jaws.</p>
                        <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-006-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of vernier calipers showing main and vernier scales" class="content-image">
                        </div>

                        <p>Consider a section of the scale shown below:</p>
                        <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-006-2.jpg" alt="Close-up view of vernier scale and main scale" class="content-image">
                        </div>

                        <p>The smallest scale division of the main scale is 0.1 cm . The whole of the vernier scale is of length $9 \mathrm{~mm}(0.9 \mathrm{~cm})$ which is sub-divided into ten equal divisions. Therefore each division of the vernier scale represents 0.09 cm . The accuracy of the callipers is given by the difference between the two least readings;</p>
                        <p>i.e. accuracy of a vernier calliper $=0.1-0.09=0.01 \mathrm{~cm}$</p>

                        <p>The reading by the vernier callipers can be obtained in three steps:</p>
                        <p>Step 1: Reading of the main scale. Take the reading of the main scale just before the zero mark of the vernier scale i.e. main scale reading $=2.1 \mathrm{~cm}$.</p>

                        <p>Step 2: Reading of the vernier scale. Check which mark on the vernier scale coincides exactly with a mark on the main scale i.e $2^{\text {nd }}$ mark. Vernier scale reading $=\left(\mathrm{n}^{\text {th }}\right.$ mark $\left.\times 0.01\right) \mathrm{cm}$.</p>

                        <p>Step 3: Adding the two readings.</p>

                        <p>Therefore for the figure above, the reading $=2.1+(2 \times 0.01)$</p>

                        <p>A micrometer screw gauge can be used to measure very small distances accurately like measuring the diameter of a thin wire. The accuracy of a micrometer screw gauge is 0.01 mm . It also has two scales; sleeve scale and a thimble scale. The sleeve scale is marked in millimetres while the thimble scale is divided into either 50 or 100 equal divisions.</p>
                        <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-007-2.jpg" alt="Diagrams illustrating thimble scales with 50 and 100 divisions" class="content-image">
                        </div>
                        <p>(a) Thimble having 50 divisions</p>
                        <p>(b) Thimble having 100 divisions</p>

                        <p>The distance moved by the spindle in one complete rotation of the thimble is called a pitch.</p>
                        <p>In (a), the spindle advances or retreats by 0.5 mm per complete rotation of the thimble;</p>
                        <p>50 divisions on the thimble scale $=0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$</p>
                        <p>And 1 division $=0.5 \mathrm{~mm} / 50=0.01 \mathrm{~mm}$</p>
                        <p>In (b), the spindle moves through 1 mm per complete rotation of the thimble.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, 100 divisions $=1 \mathrm{~mm}$</p>
                        <p>Hence 1 division $=1 \mathrm{~mm} / 100=0.01 \mathrm{~mm}$</p>
                        <p>So whether the thimble has 50 or 100 divisions, the least reading of the micrometer screw gauge remains the same i.e 0.01 mm .</p>

                        <p>Taking measurements using the micrometer screw gauge also involves three steps:</p>
                        <p>Step 1: Taking the sleeve scale reading. Read the observable mark at the edge of the thimble in mm .</p>
                        <p>Step 2: Taking the thimble scale reading. Read off the mark on the thimble scale that coincides directly with the centre line of the sleeve scale.</p>

                        <p>Hence the thimble scale reading $=\left(\mathrm{n}^{\text {th }}\right.$ mark $\left.{ }^{*} 0.01\right) \mathrm{mm}$.</p>
                        <p>Step 3: adding the two readings. The sum of the two readings gives the reading by the micrometer screw gauge.</p>

                        <h4>Example 2.1</h4>
                        <p>1. State the reading indicated in each case:</p>

                        <h3>2.2.3: Zero error of a vernier calliper and micrometer screw gauge</h3>
                        <p>When the jaws of the vernier calliper are closed without any object between them then the zero marks of the main scale and that of the vernier scale should coincide. In this case the calliper is said to have no zero error.</p>
                        <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-008-2.jpg" alt="Diagram showing zero error on a vernier scale (no error)" class="content-image">

                        <p>However, when the two zero marks do not coincide then the calliper has a zero error. When the zero of the vernier scale is found to the left of the zero of the main scale, the calliper is said to have a negative zero error. If the instrument is used with this error, then the reading obtained will be lower than the actual value. To get the actual reading the error must be added to the instrument's reading.</p>

                        <p>If the zero of the vernier scale is to the right of the zero of the main scale, the calliper has a positive zero error.</p>

                        <p>If the I calliper is used with such an error, the reading obtained will be higher than the actual value. Hence the error should be subtracted from the reading to get the correct value.</p>

                        <p>Similarly, when the micrometer screw gauge is closed without any object between its anvil and spindle and the 0mark of the thimble scale fails to coincide with the centre line of the sleeve scale then it is said to have a zero</p>

                        <h3>2.3: Area (form one)</h3>
                        <p>Area is defined as the measure of surface. Its SI Unit is the square metre ( $\mathrm{m}^{2}$ ). Other units of area include $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, $\mathrm{km}^{2}$, hectares etc. area can also be estimated or calculated accurately. The area of regular shapes can be calculated from known formulas;</p>
                        <p>e.g. area of a triangle $=1 / 2$ (base $x$ height)</p>

                        <p>Area of a rectangle $=$ length x width</p>

                        <p>Area of a circle $=\pi r^{2}$</p>
                        <p>The area of irregular shapes can be estimated by counting the number of small squares which are covered by the irregular object. Not that in this case the area of each small must be known. Consider the figure below of an irregularly- shaped object.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-010-2.jpg" alt="Diagram of an irregular shape overlaid on a grid of squares" class="content-image">

                        <p>The number of complete squares covered by the shape= 14</p>
                        <p>The number of incomplete squares covered by the shape=19</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the number of complete squares covered by the shape is approximately $(14+19 / 2)=23.5$ squares.</p>
                        <p>Suppose the area of one square is $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, then the area of the shape is approximately;</p>
                        <p>Area $=23.5 \times 1=22 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.</p>

                        <h3>2.4: Volume</h3>
                        <p>Volume is the amount of space occupied by an object. It's measured in cubic metre ( $\mathrm{m}^{3}$ ). Other commonly used units include $\mathrm{cm}^{3}, \mathrm{ml}$, litre etc.</p>

                        <h3>2.4.1: Volume of regularly shaped objects</h3>
                        <p>Volumes of regularly shaped objects can be calculated from known formulas. Generally, the volume a regular object is given the product of its cross section area by the height.</p>

                        <p>Volume $=$ cross section area x height</p>

                        <h3>2.4.2: Volume of liquids</h3>
                        <p>Volumes of liquids can be measured using specific instruments. These include the measuring cylinder, volumetric flask, beaker, burette and pipette. Note that liquids have no definite shapes but take the shape of the container in which they are put.</p>

                        <h3>2.4.3: Volume of irregularly shaped objects</h3>
                        <p>Volumes of irregularly shaped solids can be obtained by displacement method. This may involve using a measuring cylinder or a Eureka can.</p>

                        <p>Using a measuring cylinder.</p>

                        <p>The cylinder is first filled with water upto a certain level and its volume read off. Then the object whose volume is required is immersed in the water completely. The new level is read off. The volume of the object is equal to the difference between the two readings.</p>

After the flow has stopped, carefully immerse the object and collect the water which flows out through the spout using a measuring cylinder. Wait until the last drop comes out and then read off the volume of the water collected. This is equal to the volume of the solid immersed since it has been displaced by the solid.</p>

                        <h3>2.5: Mass</h3>
                        <p>Mass is the quantity of matter in a body. It is measured in kilogram. Other commonly used units include gram, milligram and tonne.</p>
                        <p>$1 \mathrm{~kg}=0.001 \mathrm{ton}$</p>
                        <p>$1 \mathrm{~kg}=1000 \mathrm{~g}$</p>
                        <p>$1 \mathrm{~kg}=1000000 \mathrm{mg}$</p>
                        <p>Mass of a body depends on the number of particles it has and its size. Hence the mass of a body is the same everywhere since the number of particles in a body is always constant. Mass is measured using a beam balance. There are other types of balances which may be used to measure mass. These include the top pan balance and a lever balance.</p>

                        <h3>2.6: Density</h3>
                        <p>Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance;</p>
                        <p>Density= mass/volume</p>
                        <p>The SI Unit of density is the kilogram per cubic metre. The other commonly used unit is gram per cubic centimetre ( $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ ). The symbol of density is rho ( $\rho$ ).</p>

                        <p>The density of a regularly shaped object can be obtained by first finding its mass and volume separately and then substituting in the formula, $\rho=m / v$.</p>

                        <h4>Example 2.3</h4>
                        <p>1. An object of mass 50.1 g has a density of $16.7 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$. What is the volume of the object?</p>
                        <p>$\rho=m / v$</p>

                        <p>Therefore, $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{m} / \rho=50.1 \mathrm{~g} / 16.7 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$=3 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

                        <h3>2. 6.1: Density bottle</h3>
                        <p>This is a special glass bottle that can be used to determine the density of liquids and certain solids like lead shot. The bottle has its capacity indicated on its surface.</p>

                        <p>a) Density of a liquid using a density bottle</p>

                        <p>The empty bottle with its stopper is first weighed and its mass noted, say $\mathrm{m}_{1}$. It is then filled with the liquid, stopper replaced and wiped carefully. It should always be held by its neck to avoid unnecessary heating and expansion of the bottle. The bottle is then weighed and the mass noted, say $\mathrm{m}_{2}$.</p>

                        <p>The difference between the two volumes is equal to the volume of the liquid in the bottle. Suppose the capacity of the bottle is $V$, then the density of the liquid is given by:</p>

                        <p>Density of liquid $=\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right) / V$.</p>

                        <p>b) Density of a solid (lead shot) using a density bottle.</p>

                        <p>The empty bottle is first weighed and its mass noted; $\mathrm{m}_{1}$. Some lead shot are added into the bottle and weighed again. Let the mass of the bottle and lead shot be $m_{2}$. Hence the mass of lead shot is $\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)$. Water is then added into the bottle until it is completely filled. The new mass of the bottle and its contents noted. Let the mass of bottle, lead shot and added water be $m_{3}$. Thus the mass of water added is $\left(m_{3}-m_{2}\right)$. Since the density of water is $1 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$, the volume of water added to the bottle is given by;</p>
                        <p>$V_{w}=m / \rho=\left(m_{3}-m_{2}\right) / 1=\left(m_{3}-m_{2}\right)$.</p>
                        <p>Suppose the capacity of the bottle is V, then the volume of the lead shot is given by;</p>
                        <p>$V_{L}=V-V_{w}=V-\left(m_{3}-m_{2}\right)$.</p>
                        <p>And the density of lead shot $=\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right) /\left\{V-\left(m_{3}-m_{2}\right)\right\}$.</p>

                        <h4>Example2. 4</h4>
                        <p>1. The mass a $50 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ density bottle is 10.0 g when empty and 60.0 g when filled with copper turnings upto a certain level. Some water is added into the bottle until it is full. The mass of the bottle and its contents is found to be 90.0 g . Determine the density of the copper turnings.</p>

                        <p>Mass of copper turnings $=60.0-10.0=50.0 \mathrm{~g}$</p>
                        <p>Mass of water added $=90.0-60.0=30.0 \mathrm{~g}$</p>
                        <p>Since $\rho$ of water $=1 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$</p>
                        <p>The volume of water added $=30.0 / 1=30 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the volume copper turnings $=50-30=20 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.</p>
                        <p>Hence density of copper turnings $=50 \mathrm{~g} / 20 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}=2.5 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$.</p>

                        <p>The density of mixture is the mass of the mixture divided by its volume;</p>
                        <p>Density of mixture= mass of mixture/ volume of mixture.</p>
                        <p>The density of a mixture always lies between the densities of its constituent substances.</p>

                        <h4>Example 2.5</h4>
                        <p>1. $1800 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of fresh water of density $1000 \mathrm{kgm}^{-3}$ is mixed with $2200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of sea water of density $1025 \mathrm{kgm}^{-3}$. Calculate the density of the mixture in $\mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$.</p>

                        <p>Volume of mixture $=1800+2200=4000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$</p>
                        <p>Mass of fresh water $=1800 \times 1=1800 \mathrm{~g}$</p>
                        <p>Mass of sea water $=2200 \times 1.025=2255 \mathrm{~g}$</p>
                        <p>Hence density of mixture $=(1800+2255) \mathrm{g} /(1800+2200) \mathrm{cm}^{3}$</p>

                        <h3>2.7: Time</h3>
                        <p>Time is the measure of duration of an event. The SI Unit of time is the second (s). time can also be measured in microseconds ( $\mu \mathrm{s}$ ), milliseconds ( ms ), minutes ( min ), hours ( hr ), days, weeks, months, years etc. time can be measured using stop watches or stop clocks. A stop watch is more accurate compared to stop clock.</p>

                        <h3>2.8: The oil drop experiment(form two)</h3>
                        <p>The aim of this experiment is to estimate the size of an oil molecule. When a drop of oil is placed on the surface of clean water, it spreads out into a uniform circular patch. The oil lowers the surface tension of water whose particles then pull away from the oil.</p>

                        <p>The patch is assumed to have a thickness equal to the thickness of the oil molecule. The oil drop is also assumed to be a perfect sphere. Thus its volume is given by $4/3\left(\pi r^{3}\right)$. For clarity of the patch, some lycopodium powder is gently sprinkled of the surface of water.</p>

                        <p>So, volume of an oil drop= volume of patch.</p>
                        <p>$4/3\left(\pi r^{3}\right)=\pi r_{p}{}^{2}t$;</p>
                        <p>Where $\mathrm{r}=$ radius of the oil drop, $\mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{p}}=$ radius of patch. $t=$ thickness of the oil molecule.</p>
                        <p>In the experiment, a number of assumptions are made. These include:</p>
