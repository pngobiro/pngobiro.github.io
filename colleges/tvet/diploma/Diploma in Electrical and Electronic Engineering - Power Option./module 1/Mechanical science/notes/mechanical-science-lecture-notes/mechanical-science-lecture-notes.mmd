\section*{Mechanical Science Lecture Notes}

\section*{TOPIC 1: INTRODUCTION TO PHYSICS}

Physics falls under a broader category of Science. Science is divided into three areas namely Biology, Physics and Chemistry. The main objective of these subjects is to study and try to understand the universe and everything in it. The three subjects are very much interrelated.

Specifically, Physics is a branch of science that deals with the study of matter and how it relates to energy. What is matter? Matter is everything that we see and interact with which has mass and occupies some space.

In trying to study the universe, Physicists in most cases endeavor to carry out experiments where quantities are measured and then collected as data. Such data and observations made are then used to study any logical pattern(s) to reveal any relationship between the data. Before the actual experimentation, propositions can be made which are actually investigated by the experiment. This is called a hypothesis. The data is taken through a process of analysis and interpretation and conclusions drawn. The conclusion may or may not concur with the hypothesis earlier stated. In case of any pattern between the quantities, this can be expressed in the form of a law, principle or theory.

A law is a description of a relationship between quantities that manifests itself in recurring patterns of events. Some of the laws we will be looking at include Hooke's law, Ohm's law, etc.

A theory is an explanation of phenomena in terms of most basic natural processes and relationships. Theories are tentative but can help us affirm already known laws. When tested and proved, a theory can become a law. A theory that has survived longer time is assumed to possess some measure of truth.

Physics as a subject is divided into six broad branches as discussed below:

\section*{i. Mechanics}

This branch deals majorly with motions under the influence of forces. Under this branch, we look into details the aspects of linear, circular and oscillatory motions as well as motion of fluids.

\section*{ii. Optics}

This branch takes a keen look at the behavior of light in various media.

\section*{iii. Electricity and magnetism}

This branch looks at the interaction between electric fields and magnetic fields and the applications of such interactions.

\section*{iv. Thermodynamics}

This branch looks at how heat as a form of energy is transformed to/from other forms of energy. $\mathbf{v}$.

\section*{Atomic Physics}

This area of study is targeted at the behavior of particles of the nucleus and the accompanying energy changes.

\section*{vi. Waves}

It deals with the study of the propagation of energy through space.
Physics does not only relate the remaining two science subjects but also enjoys a relationship with other subjects as well. For instance, it is the foundation of technological development in any country.

The study of Physics can open up many avenues of professions including engineering, degree, diploma or certificate courses.

\section*{N/B. Add the relationship between physics and other disciplines,career opportunities in physics and basic laboratory rules.}

\section*{TOPIC 2: MEASUREMENTS}

\section*{2.1: Physical quantities}

The study of physics deals mostly with physical quantities. It involves investigation, making observations, collection of data and their analysis, interpretation and drawing conclusions.one important aspect in data collection is taking measurements. When taking measurements, one must first know the quantity to be measured and the unit for measuring it.

For purposes of uniformity, physical quantities have been assigned specific units which are acceptable world over. These are referred to as International Standard Unit (SI Unit).

Physical quantities are categorized into two namely basic physical quantities and derived physical quantities.
A basic physical quantity is a quantity that cannot be obtained by either multiplication or division of other basic physical quantities. They are seven in number. The table below shows the seven basic physical quantities, their symbols, SI units and the symbols to the units:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Basic physical quantity & Symbol of quantity & SI Unit & Symbol of unit \\
\hline Length & L & Metre & M \\
\hline Mass & M & Kilogram & Kg \\
\hline Time & T & Second & S \\
\hline Electric current & I & ampere & A \\
\hline Thermodynamic temperature & T & Kelvin & K \\
\hline Amount of substance & & Mole & Mol \\
\hline Luminous intensity & & Candela & Cd \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A derived physical quantity is one which can be obtained by either multiplication or division of other basic physical quantities. The table shows some of the derived physical quantities, how they are obtained and their SI Units:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Derived physical quantity & How it is calculated & SI Unit & Symbol of unit \\
\hline Area & Length*length & Square metre & $\mathrm{m}^{2}$ \\
\hline Volume & Length*length*length & Cubic metre & $\mathrm{m}^{3}$ \\
\hline Pressure & Force/area & newton per square metre or pascal & $\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ or Pa \\
\hline Density & Mass/ volume & Kilogram per cubic metre & $\mathrm{Kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{2.2: Length}

Length can be defined as the distance between any two points. The SI unit of length is the metre (m). Other multiples and submultiples of the metre are stated below:
\begin{tabular}{ll} 
Kilometre $(\mathrm{km}) ; 1 \mathrm{~m}=10^{-3} \mathrm{~km}$ & Centimetre $(\mathrm{cm}) ; 1 \mathrm{~m}=100 \mathrm{~cm}$ \\
Hectometre $(\mathrm{Hm}) ; 1 \mathrm{~m}=10^{-2} \mathrm{Hm}$ & Millimetre $(\mathrm{mm}) ; 1 \mathrm{~m}=1000 \mathrm{~mm}$
\end{tabular}

Â©PHYSICS PLUS

Length can be estimated or measured accurately using appropriate measuring instrument. The type of instrument to be used at any time depends on two factors:
- The object to be measured.
- The desired accuracy.

\subsection*{2.2.1: Estimation}

This method involves comparing the object to be measured with another of standard measure. For example, the height of a tall flag post can be compared with that of a wooden rod whose length is known. Thus at any given time;

\section*{Height of flag post/ height of rod = length of shadow of post/ length of shadow of rod}

From this expression, the height of the flag post can be estimated. Suppose the height of the rod= 1 m , length of shadow of rod $=120 \mathrm{~cm}$ and length of shadow of post $=480 \mathrm{~cm}$, then the height of the flag post is given by; $\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{p}}$ / $100 \mathrm{~cm}=480 \mathrm{~cm} / 120 \mathrm{~cm}$
$\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{p}}=100 \times 4=400 \mathrm{~cm}$
Also, the thickness of a sheet of paper may be estimated by taking several sheets of the paper and measuring their thickness then dividing by the number of sheets of paper;

Thickness of a sheet of paper= thickness of n papers/ number of papers, n .

\subsection*{2.2.2: Accurate measurement}

To measure length accurately, the following instruments can be used:
a) Metre rule

A metre rule is marked in centimetres. It is marked 0 and 100 cm at its extreme ends. If some space is left before 0 cm and 100 cm mark then it is referred to as a ruler.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-004.jpg?height=242&width=1573&top_left_y=1912&top_left_x=132)

The smallest scale division of a metre rule is $0.1 \mathrm{~cm}(1 \mathrm{~mm})$. The smallest scale division of any instrument is known as its accuracy. Thus the accuracy of a metre rule is 0.1 cm .

When using a metre, one must ensure the following:
- That the object to be measured is in contact with the metre rule.
- That one end of the object is at 0cm mark.
- That the eye is perpendicular to the scale so as to avoid parallax error.

\section*{b) Vernier calipers( form two work)}

A vernier calliper is more accurate compared to a metre rule. It has two scales; the main scale and vernier scale. It has an accuracy of 0.01 cm compared to that of a metre rule of 0.1 cm . It also has two jaws; the inside jaws and outside jaws. The object whose length is to be measured is placed between the outside jaws.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-006.jpg?height=404&width=1001&top_left_y=351&top_left_x=340)

Consider a section of the scale shown below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-006.jpg?height=321&width=684&top_left_y=861&top_left_x=290)

The smallest scale division of the main scale is 0.1 cm . The whole of the vernier scale is of length $9 \mathrm{~mm}(0.9 \mathrm{~cm})$ which is sub-divided into ten equal divisions. Therefore each division of the vernier scale represents 0.09 cm . The accuracy of the callipers is given by the difference between the two least readings;
i.e. accuracy of a vernier calliper $=0.1-0.09=0.01 \mathrm{~cm}$

The reading by the vernier callipers can be obtained in three steps:
Step 1: Reading of the main scale. Take the reading of the main scale just before the zero mark of the vernier scale i.e. main scale reading $=2.1 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Step 2: Reading of the vernier scale. Check which mark on the vernier scale coincides exactly with a mark on the main scale i.e $2^{\text {nd }}$ mark. Vernier scale reading $=\left(\mathrm{n}^{\text {th }}\right.$ mark $\left.\times 0.01\right) \mathrm{cm}$.

Step 3: Adding the two readings.

Therefore for the figure above, the reading $=2.1+(2 \times 0.01)$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =2.1+0.02 \\
& =2.12 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}$$
c) Micrometer screw gauge
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-007.jpg?height=410&width=1181&top_left_y=169&top_left_x=266)

A micrometer screw gauge can be used to measure very small distances accurately like measuring the diameter of a thin wire. The accuracy of a micrometer screw gauge is 0.01 mm . It also has two scales; sleeve scale and a thimble scale. The sleeve scale is marked in millimetres while the thimble scale is divided into either 50 or 100 equal divisions.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-007.jpg?height=354&width=1445&top_left_y=910&top_left_x=134)
(a) Thimble having 50 divisions
(b) Thimble having 100 divisions

The distance moved by the spindle in one complete rotation of the thimble is called a pitch.
In (a), the spindle advances or retreats by 0.5 mm per complete rotation of the thimble;
50 divisions on the thimble scale $=0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$
And 1 division $=0.5 \mathrm{~mm} / 50=0.01 \mathrm{~mm}$
In (b), the spindle moves through 1 mm per complete rotation of the thimble.
Similarly, 100 divisions $=1 \mathrm{~mm}$
Hence 1 division $=1 \mathrm{~mm} / 100=0.01 \mathrm{~mm}$
So whether the thimble has 50 or 100 divisions, the least reading of the micrometer screw gauge remains the same i.e 0.01 mm .

Taking measurements using the micrometer screw gauge also involves three steps:
Step 1: Taking the sleeve scale reading. Read the observable mark at the edge of the thimble in mm .
Step 2: Taking the thimble scale reading. Read off the mark on the thimble scale that coincides directly with the centre line of the sleeve scale.

Hence the thimble scale reading $=\left(\mathrm{n}^{\text {th }}\right.$ mark $\left.{ }^{*} 0.01\right) \mathrm{mm}$.
Step 3: adding the two readings. The sum of the two readings gives the reading by the micrometer screw gauge.

\section*{Example 2.1}
1. State the reading indicated in each case:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-008.jpg?height=348&width=1157&top_left_y=298&top_left_x=271)

65
a) Reading $=7.5+(12 \times 0.01) \quad=7.5+0.12=7.62 \mathrm{~mm}$
b) Reading $=12+(62 \times 0.01)$
$=12+0.62=12.62 \mathrm{~mm}$

\subsection*{2.2.3: Zero error of a vernier calliper and micrometer screw gauge}

When the jaws of the vernier calliper are closed without any object between them then the zero marks of the main scale and that of the vernier scale should coincide. In this case the calliper is said to have no zero error.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-008.jpg?height=147&width=651&top_left_y=1192&top_left_x=276)

However, when the two zero marks do not coincide then the calliper has a zero error. When the zero of the vernier scale is found to the left of the zero of the main scale, the calliper is said to have a negative zero error. If the instrument is used with this error, then the reading obtained will be lower than the actual value. To get the actual reading the error must be added to the instrument's reading.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-008.jpg?height=188&width=698&top_left_y=1543&top_left_x=150)

Zero error $=-(3 \times 0.01)=-0.03 \mathrm{~cm}$
If the zero of the vernier scale is to the right of the zero of the main scale, the calliper has a positive zero error.
0
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-008.jpg?height=155&width=592&top_left_y=1966&top_left_x=308)

0
10
Zero error $=+\{0+(1 \times 0.01)\}=+0.01 \mathrm{~cm}$
If the I calliper is used with such an error, the reading obtained will be higher than the actual value. Hence the error should be subtracted from the reading to get the correct value.

Similarly, when the micrometer screw gauge is closed without any object between its anvil and spindle and the 0mark of the thimble scale fails to coincide with the centre line of the sleeve scale then it is said to have a zero

error. Note that the edge of the thimble should also be in line with the zero mark of the sleeve scale when taking the zero error.

(a)No error

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-009.jpg?height=280&width=175&top_left_y=272&top_left_x=1330)

In (b), the error $=-(3 \times 0.01)=-0.03 \mathrm{~mm}$
$\operatorname{In}(\mathrm{c})$, the error $=+(4 \times 0.01)=+0.04 \mathrm{~mm}$.
Generally, when the signs of the zero errors are taken into account, all zero errors are subtracted from the instrument's reading to give the correct reading.

\section*{Example 2.2}
1. A micrometer screw gauge was used to measure the diameter of a thin wire. The reading is as shown in the figure below:
mm 0
55
50
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-009.jpg?height=275&width=502&top_left_y=1142&top_left_x=383)

State the diameter of the wire if the micrometer had:
a) A negative zero error of 0.22 mm

Correct reading $=$ instrument's reading - zero error
$$\begin{aligned}
& =7.52-(-0.22) \\
& =7.52+0.22=7.74 \mathrm{~mm}
\end{aligned}$$
b) A positive zero error of 0.10 mm

Correct reading $=7.52-(+0.10)$
$$=7.52-0.10=7.42 \mathrm{~mm}$$

\section*{2.3: Area (form one)}

Area is defined as the measure of surface. Its SI Unit is the square metre ( $\mathrm{m}^{2}$ ). Other units of area include $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, $\mathrm{km}^{2}$, hectares etc. area can also be estimated or calculated accurately. The area of regular shapes can be calculated from known formulas;
e.g. area of a triangle $=1 / 2$ (base $x$ height)

Area of a rectangle $=$ length x width

\section*{8|Page}
Â©PHYSICS PLUS

Area of a circle $=\pi r^{2}$
The area of irregular shapes can be estimated by counting the number of small squares which are covered by the irregular object. Not that in this case the area of each small must be known. Consider the figure below of an irregularly- shaped object.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-010.jpg?height=708&width=744&top_left_y=394&top_left_x=219)

The number of complete squares covered by the shape= 14
The number of incomplete squares covered by the shape=19
Therefore, the number of complete squares covered by the shape is approximately $(14+19 / 2)=23.5$ squares.
Suppose the area of one square is $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, then the area of the shape is approximately;
Area $=23.5 \times 1=22 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.

\section*{2.4: Volume}

Volume is the amount of space occupied by an object. It's measured in cubic metre ( $\mathrm{m}^{3}$ ). Other commonly used units include $\mathrm{cm}^{3}, \mathrm{ml}$, litre etc.

\subsection*{2.4.1: Volume of regularly shaped objects}

Volumes of regularly shaped objects can be calculated from known formulas. Generally, the volume a regular object is given the product of its cross section area by the height.

Volume $=$ cross section area x height

\subsection*{2.4.2: Volume of liquids}

Volumes of liquids can be measured using specific instruments. These include the measuring cylinder, volumetric flask, beaker, burette and pipette. Note that liquids have no definite shapes but take the shape of the container in which they are put.

\subsection*{2.4.3: Volume of irregularly shaped objects}

Volumes of irregularly shaped solids can be obtained by displacement method. This may involve using a measuring cylinder or a Eureka can.

\section*{Using a measuring cylinder.}

The cylinder is first filled with water upto a certain level and its volume read off. Then the object whose volume is required is immersed in the water completely. The new level is read off. The volume of the object is equal to the difference between the two readings.
$V_{f} \underline{\mathbf{V}}_{i}$

\section*{Using the}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-011.jpg?height=269&width=179&top_left_y=429&top_left_x=374)
eureka can
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-011.jpg?height=272&width=215&top_left_y=417&top_left_x=874)

The can is first filled with water until it overflows through the spout. After the flow has stopped, carefully immerse the object and collect the water which flows out through the spout using a measuring cylinder. Wait until the last drop comes out and then read off the volume of the water collected. This is equal to the volume of the solid immersed since it has been displaced by the solid.

These two methods only work when the solid:
- Does not react with water.
- Does not absorb water.
- Can sink in water (denser than water).

\subsection*{2.4.4: Volume of a floating object}

The same method of displacement is used but with a sinker. It involves three steps:
1. Fill the eureka can with water.
2. Carefully immerse the sinker and note the volume of water it displaces.
3. Fill the eureka can again and now immerse both the sinker and the floating object. Note the new volume of water displaced.

The difference between the two volumes gives the volume of the floating object.

\section*{2.5: Mass}

Mass is the quantity of matter in a body. It is measured in kilogram. Other commonly used units include gram, milligram and tonne.
$1 \mathrm{~kg}=0.001 \mathrm{ton}$
$1 \mathrm{~kg}=1000 \mathrm{~g}$
$1 \mathrm{~kg}=1000000 \mathrm{mg}$
Mass of a body depends on the number of particles it has and its size. Hence the mass of a body is the same everywhere since the number of particles in a body is always constant. Mass is measured using a beam balance. There are other types of balances which may be used to measure mass. These include the top pan balance and a lever balance.

\section*{2.6: Density}

Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance;
Density= mass/volume
The SI Unit of density is the kilogram per cubic metre. The other commonly used unit is gram per cubic centimetre ( $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ ). The symbol of density is rho ( $\rho$ ).

The density of a regularly shaped object can be obtained by first finding its mass and volume separately and then substituting in the formula, $\rho=m / v$.

\section*{Example 2.3}
1. An object of mass 50.1 g has a density of $16.7 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$. What is the volume of the object?
$$\rho=m / v$$

Therefore, $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{m} / \rho=50.1 \mathrm{~g} / 16.7 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$
$$=3 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

\section*{2. 6.1: Density bottle}

This is a special glass bottle that can be used to determine the density of liquids and certain solids like lead shot. The bottle has its capacity indicated on its surface.

\section*{a) Density of a liquid using a density bottle}

The empty bottle with its stopper is first weighed and its mass noted, say $\mathrm{m}_{1}$. It is then filled with the liquid, stopper replaced and wiped carefully. It should always be held by its neck to avoid unnecessary heating and expansion of the bottle. The bottle is then weighed and the mass noted, say $\mathrm{m}_{2}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-013.jpg?height=275&width=247&top_left_y=838&top_left_x=451)
(a) Empty bottle
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-013.jpg?height=277&width=242&top_left_y=837&top_left_x=925)
(b) Bottle filled with water

The difference between the two volumes is equal to the volume of the liquid in the bottle. Suppose the capacity of the bottle is $V$, then the density of the liquid is given by:

Density of liquid $=\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right) / V$.

\section*{b) Density of a solid (lead shot) using a density bottle.}

The empty bottle is first weighed and its mass noted; $\mathrm{m}_{1}$. Some lead shot are added into the bottle and weighed again. Let the mass of the bottle and lead shot be $m_{2}$. Hence the mass of lead shot is $\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right)$. Water is then added into the bottle until it is completely filled. The new mass of the bottle and its contents noted. Let the mass of bottle, lead shot and added water be $m_{3}$. Thus the mass of water added is $\left(m_{3}-m_{2}\right)$. Since the density of water is $1 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$, the volume of water added to the bottle is given by;
$V_{w}=m / \rho=\left(m_{3}-m_{2}\right) / 1=\left(m_{3}-m_{2}\right)$.
Suppose the capacity of the bottle is V, then the volume of the lead shot is given by;
$V_{L}=V-V_{w}=V-\left(m_{3}-m_{2}\right)$.
And the density of lead shot $=\left(m_{2}-m_{1}\right) /\left\{V-\left(m_{3}-m_{2}\right)\right\}$.

\section*{Note:}
1. There should be no air bubbles in the liquid being used to fill the bottle.
2. The solid being used in (b) above should be one that does not dissolve in and react with water.

\section*{Example2. 4}
1. The mass a $50 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ density bottle is 10.0 g when empty and 60.0 g when filled with copper turnings upto a certain level. Some water is added into the bottle until it is full. The mass of the bottle and its contents is found to be 90.0 g . Determine the density of the copper turnings.

Mass of copper turnings $=60.0-10.0=50.0 \mathrm{~g}$
Mass of water added $=90.0-60.0=30.0 \mathrm{~g}$
Since $\rho$ of water $=1 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$
The volume of water added $=30.0 / 1=30 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Therefore, the volume copper turnings $=50-30=20 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Hence density of copper turnings $=50 \mathrm{~g} / 20 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}=2.5 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$.

\section*{2. 6.2: Density of mixtures}

The density of mixture is the mass of the mixture divided by its volume;
Density of mixture= mass of mixture/ volume of mixture.
The density of a mixture always lies between the densities of its constituent substances.

\section*{Example 2.5}
1. $1800 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of fresh water of density $1000 \mathrm{kgm}^{-3}$ is mixed with $2200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of sea water of density $1025 \mathrm{kgm}^{-3}$. Calculate the density of the mixture in $\mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$.

Volume of mixture $=1800+2200=4000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Mass of fresh water $=1800 \times 1=1800 \mathrm{~g}$
Mass of sea water $=2200 \times 1.025=2255 \mathrm{~g}$
Hence density of mixture $=(1800+2255) \mathrm{g} /(1800+2200) \mathrm{cm}^{3}$
$$=4055 / 4000=1.01375 \mathrm{gcm}^{-3}$$

\section*{2.7: Time}

Time is the measure of duration of an event. The SI Unit of time is the second (s). time can also be measured in microseconds ( $\mu \mathrm{s}$ ), milliseconds ( ms ), minutes ( min ), hours ( hr ), days, weeks, months, years etc. time can be measured using stop watches or stop clocks. A stop watch is more accurate compared to stop clock.

\section*{2.8: The oil drop experiment(form two)}

The aim of this experiment is to estimate the size of an oil molecule. When a drop of oil is placed on the surface of clean water, it spreads out into a uniform circular patch. The oil lowers the surface tension of water whose particles then pull away from the oil.

The patch is assumed to have a thickness equal to the thickness of the oil molecule. The oil drop is also assumed to be a perfect sphere. Thus its volume is given by $4 / 3\left(\pi r^{3}\right)$. For clarity of the patch, some lycopodium powder is gently sprinkled of the surface of water.

So, volume of an oil drop= volume of patch.
$4 / 3\left(\pi r^{3}\right)=\pi r_{p}{ }^{2} t ;$
Where $\mathrm{r}=$ radius of the oil drop, $\mathrm{r}_{\mathrm{p}}=$
radius of patch. $t=$ thickness of
the oil molecule.
In the experiment, a number of assumptions are made. These include:
- Volume of an oil drop is equal to the volume of the patch.
- The oil drop is a perfect sphere.
- The patch is perfectly circular and one molecule thick.
- The oil drop is one molecule thick.

The knowledge of the oil drop experiment can be used to determine the extent of environmental damage as a result of oil spillage from ships in large water bodies.

\section*{TOPIC 3: FORCE}

Force is defined as a push or a pull on a body.si unit of force is the newton (N).force is a vector quantity i.e. has both magnitude (size) and direction.

\section*{3.1: Effects of force on a body}

Sets a body into motion.
Can stop a moving body.
Can increase or reduce the speed of a moving body.
Can change the direction of a moving body.
May deform (change the shape of) a body.
Force is represented by a straight line with an arrow, which shows the direction in which it acts. One newton is the force which gives a mass of 1 kg an acceleration of $1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

\section*{3.2: Types of force}

Force can be categorized in two ways. These are:
- As either a push or a pull
- As either contact or non-contact force

Contact forces are those forces between bodies which are in contact e.g. action and reaction, viscous drag, friction etc. Non-contact forces act between bodies at a distance e.g. gravitational force, magnetic force, electrostatic force etc.

Below are some common types of forces:

\subsection*{3.2.1: Gravitational force}

It is the force that attracts all objects towards the centre of the earth. It is unique in every planet. The earth's gravitational force is that force of attraction between the earth and the body. The pull of gravity on a body towards the centre of the earth is called its weight. Weight varies from place to place although its mass remains constant.

The weight of a body is the product of its mass and the gravitational force acting on the body i.e. weight = mass *gravitational force.

\subsection*{3.2.2: Tension}

When a string is stretched or compressed at both of its ends, it experiences a force called tension. A stretched or compressed material will tend to regain its original shape when the stretching or compressing force is withdrawn. Materials that do not break after stretching or compression is said to be elastic.

\subsection*{3.2.3: Upthrust}

When an object is immersed in a fluid (liquid/gas), there is always an opposite upward force acting on it. This is called upthrust force.

NB. There is no upthrust force in a vacuum.

PLUS

\subsection*{3.2.4: Friction force}

This is the force that tends to oppose the motion of one object over another when they are in contact. Friction force is useful in many ways for instance during walking, writing, applying brakes, lighting a match stick, etc. Friction in fluids is called viscous drag or simply viscosity.

\subsection*{3.2.5: Magnetic force}

A magnet can either attract or repel a magnetic material. This force of attraction or repulsion is called magnetic force. Materials that are not affected by a magnet are said to be non-magnetic materials.

\subsection*{3.2.6: Electrostatic force}

This is the force of attraction or repulsion between static charges. Like charges repel while unlike charges attract. Electrostatic force is evident in the following cases:

A plastic pen or ruler rubbed on dry air picks up small pieces of paper placed on a table.
Such a pen can attract a stream of water from a water tap.
A glass window wiped using a dry piece of cloth on a dry day immediately attracts dust particles.
Brushed shoes attract dust particles.
When combing a dry hair, a cracking sound is produced.
All these are as a result of attraction between the formed charges and the opposite charges.

\subsection*{3.2.7: Centripetal force}

This is the force that constraints a body to maintain a circular path as it move. It is usually directed towards the centre of the circle.

\subsection*{3.2.8: Action and reaction}

Action and reaction are equal and opposite forces. When a block of wood rests on a table its weight is exerted on the table. This is action force. The table on the other hand exerts an equal upward force on the block of wood. This is reaction force and it prevents the block from sinking down below the table.

\subsection*{3.2.9: Cohesive and adhesive force}

Cohesive force is the force of attraction between molecules of the same kind e.g. force between water molecules. Adhesive force is the force of attraction between molecules of different kinds e.g. force between water molecule and the surface of glass.

For instance when a molecule of water is put on a clean glass surface, the water spreads on (wets) the glass surface. This is because there is greater adhesive force between water and glass molecule than the cohesive force between the water molecules. However, when the glass surface is waxed, the water forms spherical balls. This is because for a waxed surface, the adhesive force between water and glass is lower than the cohesive force between water molecules.

Mercury on the other hand will form spherical balls both on a clean and waxed glass surface. This is because cohesive force between mercury molecules is greater than adhesive force between mercury and glass molecules. Waxing the glass surface in this case even lowers the adhesive force further.

In fig (i), greater adhesive force between glass and water makes water to rise up the narrow glass tube by capillary action so that as many water molecules as possible can be in contact with glass. Hence the meniscus of water curves downwards. The narrower the glass tube the higher the level of water.

In fig (ii), cohesive force between the mercury molecules is greater than the adhesive force between mercury and glass. Mercury thus sinks down the tube so that its molecules can stick together. Hence the meniscus of mercury curves upwards from the glass surface. The narrower the tube, the lower the level of mercury in the tube.

\subsection*{3.2.10: Surface tension}

The cohesive force between the molecules of a liquid gives it some strength. The surface can thus resist stretching. Surface tension is the force that makes the surface of the liquid to behave like a fully stretched elastic skin.

Surface tension allows light insects to rest over water without sinking. a steel razor blade or needle floats on water if placed carefully but sinks when soap solution or kerosene is placed around it. Also if one end of the needle is pressed into the water, it breaks the surface tension and the needle sinks.

Molecular explanation of surface tension
Consider two molecules, A and B shown below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-018.jpg?height=266&width=370&top_left_y=1507&top_left_x=341)

A molecule A deep in the water is surrounded by other molecules from all sides. The net force on this molecule is thus zero i.e. the forces cancel out. A molecule B at the surface has fewer molecules on the upper part. The inward resultant force on B thus causes the surface of water to be under tension.

\section*{Note:}

Different liquids have different strengths of surface tension.

\section*{Activity 1}
1. Describe the behavior of soap bubble when blown to the wider end of a funnel.
2. Explain why a glass tumbler can be filled with water above the brim without pouring out.
3. Explain why brush bristles would spread when it is dipped in water but cling together when taken out of water.

\section*{3.3: Factors affecting surface tension}

\subsection*{3.3.1: Temperature}

When the temperature of a liquid is increased the kinetic energy of its molecules is also increased. The intermolecular distance increases lowering the cohesive force between the liquid molecules. Consequently the surface tension of the liquid is reduced.

\subsection*{3.3.2: Impurities}

The presence of impurities in a liquid lowers its surface tension. Examples of impurities include kerosene and detergents like soap solution.

\section*{3.4: Mass and weight}

Mass is defined as the quantity of matter in a substance. Weight on the other hand is the pull of gravity on an object. Weight of a body depends on the mass of the body and the gravitational field strength at the place. The earth is flatter at the poles such that the distance between the centre of the earth and the poles is shorter than the radius of the earth at the equator. This implies that the force of attraction between the surface of the earth and its centre is greater at the poles than at the equator. Hence a body will weigh more at the poles than at the equator.

The table below summarizes the differences between mass and weight:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Mass & Weight \\
\hline Is the quantity of matter in a body & Is the pull of gravity on a body \\
\hline Measured in kilogram & Measured in newton \\
\hline Constant/same everywhere & Varies from place to place \\
\hline Measured by a beam balance & Measured by spring balance \\
\hline Scalar quantity & Vector quantity \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A scalar quantity is a quantity that can be described in terms of magnitude (size) only eg speed, distance, area etc while a vector quantity is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction e.g. displacement, velocity, momentum etc. Example 3.1
1. A body weighs 75 N on the earth's surface. Calculate its mass in grams if $g=10 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{kg}$. $W=\mathrm{mxg}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{m} & =\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{g}=75 \mathrm{~N} / 10 \mathrm{Nkg}^{-1} \\
& =7.5 \mathrm{~kg}=7500 \mathrm{~g}
\end{aligned}$$
2. A man weighs 900 N on earth and 150 N on the moon. If the earth's gravitational field strength is $10 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{kg}$, determine the moon's gravitational field strength.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Mass on earth } & =\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{g}=900 \mathrm{~N} / 10 \mathrm{Nkg}^{-1} \\
& =90 \mathrm{~kg}=\text { mass on the moon }
\end{aligned}$$

Gravitational field strength on the moon=W/m=150N/90kg
$$=1.67 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{kg}$$

\section*{3.5: Measurement of force}

The most common instrument for measuring force is the spring balance. It uses the principle of extension when there is a stretching force. Some spring balances are calibrated in newtons ( N ) while others are calibrated in kilogram or even gram. In the latter case, it is advisable to convert the kg or g into newtons.

Two or more spring balances can be assembled to act as one spring balance. When the springs are joined in series, the combined extension will be the sum of the individual spring extension.

However, when they are connected in parallel, the springs will share the load. The combined extension therefore will be the extension of one spring divided by the number of such springs in parallel.

\section*{Example 3.2}

State the reading on each spring balance.
Each spring will read $=80 / 2=40 \mathrm{~N}$

\section*{TOPIC 4: PRESSURE}

\section*{4.1: Introduction}

Pressure is defined as the compressive force acting normally (perpendicularly) per unit area; i.e.
```
pressure= force/area
```

The SI unit of pressure is newton per square metre ( $\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ). Pressure can also be expressed in pascals ( Pa ); $1 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}=1 \mathrm{~Pa}$

Atmospheric pressure is sometimes expressed as $\mathrm{mmHg}, \mathrm{cmHg}$ or atmospheres.
For a given amount of force, the smaller the area of contact the greater the pressure exerted. This explains why it would be easier for a sharp pin to penetrate a piece of cardboard than a blunt one when the same force is used.

\section*{4.2: Pressure in solids}

A solid resting on a horizontal surface exerts a normal contact force equals to its weight. The pressure of the solid on the surface depends on the area of contact.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-021.jpg?height=215&width=774&top_left_y=1183&top_left_x=304)

\section*{Example 4.1}
1. A man whose mass is 90 kg stands on a floor.
a) If the area of contact between his feet and the floor is $0.0368 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, determine how much pressure he able to exert on the floor.
$$\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{F} / \mathrm{A}=900 \mathrm{~N} / 0.0368 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$$
$$=24,456.5217 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2} .$$
b) What pressure will he exert on the floor if now he stands on one foot?
$$\mathrm{P}=900 \mathrm{~N} /(0.0368 / 2)=48,913.0435 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$$

\section*{4.3: Pressure in fluids}

A fluid is a term that refers to either liquids and gases. The set up below can be used to illustrate pressure in fluids:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-022.jpg?height=345&width=703&top_left_y=744&top_left_x=223)

The lower hole $\mathbf{A}$ is observed to throw water the farthest, followed by hole $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{C}$ the closest. This indicates that pressure at $\mathbf{A}$ is greater than that at $\mathbf{B}$ and pressure at $B$ is greater than that at $C$. Conclusion

Pressure in fluids increases with depth i.e. the greater the depth the higher the pressure it exerts.
This explains why the walls of a dam are made wider downwards.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-022.jpg?height=224&width=871&top_left_y=1376&top_left_x=410)

A diver under water experiences pressure due to the weight of water above him plus the atmospheric pressure above the water surface. The deeper the diver, the greater the pressure.

When a liquid is poured into a set of connected tubes of different shapes, it rises up until the levels are the same in all the tubes.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-022.jpg?height=272&width=1058&top_left_y=1859&top_left_x=227)

\section*{4.4: The fluid pressure formula}

Consider a liquid of density $\rho$ in a container of uniform cross-section area $A$, such that the depth of the liquid in the container is h ;

Cross
sectional area, A

21 | P a g e Â©PHYSICS
PLUS Â©PHYSICS

Liquid
Depth, h
Volume of the liquid $=A^{*} h$
Mass = volume * density
$=\mathrm{Ah} \rho$
Weight of the liquid = mass * gravitational field intensity= force exerted
$$=\mathrm{Ah} \rho \mathrm{~g}$$

From the definition of pressure, $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{F} / \mathrm{A}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\mathrm{Ah} \rho \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{A} \\
& =\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{~g}
\end{aligned}$$

It is thus clear that pressure in fluids is directly proportional to the height of the column h , the density of the fluid $\rho$ and the gravitational field strength g.

Note: Pressure in fluids does not depend on the cross section area of the container which holds it.

\section*{Example 4.2}
1. Calculate the pressure exerted by a column of kerosene of 850 mm . take the density of kerosene $=800 \mathrm{kgm}^{-}$ ${ }^{3}$.
$\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{g}=0.85 \mathrm{~m} \times 800 \mathrm{kgm}^{-3} \times 10 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{kg}$
$=6800 \mathrm{~Pa}$

\section*{4.5: Transmission of pressure in fluids}

The figure below shows a liquid under pressure due to the force $F$ acting on the plunger.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-023.jpg?height=350&width=898&top_left_y=1755&top_left_x=153)

Assuming that the holes are identical, when the plunger is pushed forward, the liquid squirts out through the holes with equal force. If the piston area is $\mathbf{A}$, then the pressure developed is $\mathbf{F} / \mathbf{A}$. this pressure is transmitted equally to all parts of the liquid. This is called Pascal's principle. The principle states that pressure applied at one part of a liquid is transmitted equally to all other parts of the enclosed liquid. Gases can also transmit pressure in a similar way provided they are incompressible.

The working of hydraulic machines is based on Pascal's principle.

\section*{4.6: Atmospheric pressure}

The term atmosphere refers to the air surrounding the earth. The weight of air above the earth's surface exerts pressure on the earth. This pressure is called atmospheric pressure. The presence of atmospheric pressure can be demonstrated by the crushing can experiment;
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-024.jpg?height=403&width=968&top_left_y=403&top_left_x=145)

The can is filled with water then heated for several minutes. After sometime, the can is sealed and then cooled by running cold water over it.

When the water is heated, steam is produced which displaces air in the can. When cold water is run over it, steam condenses leaving a vacuum in the can. Pressure inside is thus reduced below the external atmospheric pressure. Hence the can crushes inwards.

Atmospheric pressure is also very vital when using a drinking straw. By sucking through a drinking straw the pressure inside is reduced. The atmospheric pressure acting on the surface of the liquid overcomes the pressure inside the straw. The pressure difference and hence the resultant force pushes the liquid up the straw.

\section*{4.7:Measurement of pressure}

Atmospheric pressure is measured using an instrument called a barometer. The following are some types of barometers:

\section*{- A mercury barometer}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-024.jpg?height=321&width=768&top_left_y=1707&top_left_x=150)

Atmospheric pressure can support a liquid column in a tube. One end of the tube is closed and the tube is filled with mercury. When inverted and with the open end below the liquid surface in the container. The atmospheric pressure ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{atm}}$ ) on the open surface is transmitted by the liquid to the base of the liquid column and supports its weight.

With the liquid column h, the atmospheric pressure can be determined from the equation; Pressure
$=\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{g}$
Where h -is the height of the liquid column
23 | Page Â©PHYSICS
PLUS
$\rho$ - Density of the liquid (mercury)

\section*{g- Gravitational field strength}

At sea level atmospheric pressure can support approximately 76 cm column of mercury equivalent to approximately 10 m column of water. Mercury is thus preferred as a barometric fluid since it gives a shorter and measurable column compared to water.

In general, atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude. The value of atmospheric pressure at sea level is called the standard atmospheric pressure and is at times referred to as one atmosphere.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Pressure at sea level } & =\mathrm{h} \rho g=0.76 \mathrm{~m}^{*} 13600 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3} * 10 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{kg} \\
& =103,360 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

If there is air trapped in the space above the mercury column then the barometer is faulty. This space above the mercury column is called toricellian vacuum. To test whether this space has some air trapped, the test tube is tilted until it is at the same level with the mercury column when the tube is upright. If the space is truly a vacuum, the test tube will be completely filled with mercury while if it has trapped air a space will still remain at the top.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-025.jpg?height=351&width=1131&top_left_y=1028&top_left_x=161)

Normally the toricellian vacuum contains some little mercury vapour.
Note that this barometer is not readily portable.

\section*{- A manometer}

This is a U-shaped tube open on both ends. One end is connected to a source of gas whose pressure is to be determined. The other arm is open to the atmosphere. This creates a pressure difference which displaces the manometer liquid.

The points $A$ and $B$ are at the same level and as such experience the same amount of pressure. The pressure at $A$ is the gas pressure while that at B equals the pressure due to the liquid column plus atmospheric pressure; $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{g}}=$ $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}}+\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{g}$

Mercury
Protective brass tube

The fixed ivory index with a sharp point acts asthe zero mark of the main scale. Before taking any reading the level of the mercury in the reservoir must first be adjusted until the tip of the ivory index just touches the surface of mercury.

The height of mercury column is then read from the main scale .this reading is then used to calculate the pressure at the place. Any change in the atmospheric pressure causes the level of mercury in the reservoir to move up or down, hence the adjustment of the ivory index is necessary.
- Aneroid barometer

This type of barometer is more portable.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-027.jpg?height=541&width=1006&top_left_y=163&top_left_x=264)

When the pressure outside the corrugated metal box is reduced, the box expands setting the levers into motion. However, when the pressure outside increases, the box reduces in volume. The resultant movements of the springs and levers moves the pointer across the scale recording the value of the atmospheric pressure.

The aneroid barometer can also be used to measure heights. For instance, altimeters are aneroid barometers used in aircrafts to measure heights.

\section*{- Pressure gauge}

Pressure gauges are also easily portable. It is commonly used to measure gas pressure, tyre pressure, etc. It consists of a coiled flexible metal tube. When the pressure inside the tube increases, the tube uncoils. The movement of the tube is magnified by the lever and gear mechanism which then moves the pointer across the scale.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-027.jpg?height=378&width=1082&top_left_y=1275&top_left_x=153)

\section*{4.8: Applications of pressure}

\section*{1. A bicycle pump} Barrel
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-027.jpg?height=253&width=1031&top_left_y=1760&top_left_x=241)

The leather washer is very flexible and works both as a valve and a piston. During the upstroke, air in the barrel expands and its pressure reduced below the atmospheric pressure outside. The pressure difference and hence the resultant force acting downwards pushes the air past into the barrel. The valve remains closed due to the high pressure in the tube.

During down stroke, air in the barrel is compressed raising its pressure. This high pressure presses the leather washer against the wall of the barrel hence no air leaks out. When the pressure of the air in the barrel overcomes that inside the tube, the air is forced through the valve into the tube. The work done in compressing the air in the barrel generates some heat raising the temperature of the barrel.

\section*{2. The hydraulic machines}

These machines apply Pascal's principle in their working. They include the following machines: a)

\section*{Hydraulic lift}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-028.jpg?height=435&width=1394&top_left_y=414&top_left_x=151)

When a force $F_{1}$ is exerted on the smaller piston of cross section area $A_{1}$, the pressure developed $\left(F_{1} / A_{1}\right)$ is transmitted by the liquid to the larger piston of cross section area $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ and is able to support a load $\mathrm{F}_{2}$.Alternatively, the pressure exerted on the liquid by the larger piston can be expressed as $\mathrm{F}_{2} / \mathrm{A}_{2}$. If the system is in equilibrium, then $F_{1} / A_{1}=F_{2} / A_{2}$.
b) Hydraulic brake system
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-028.jpg?height=537&width=1256&top_left_y=1141&top_left_x=253)

The force applied on the foot pedal exerts pressure on the master cylinder. This pressure is transmitted equally by the brake fluid to the slave cylinder. The pistons of the slave cylinder are then forced to open outwards. This opens the brake shoe. The brake lining then presses the drum, resisting the rotation of the wheel. When the force on the foot pedal is released, the return spring pulls back the brake shoe and the wheel can rotate once again
.The pressure exerted on the master cylinder is transmitted equally to all the four wheels and so the braking force is uniform
In order for the brake system not to fail, the liquid used should have the following properties;

Be incompressible.
Have low freezing point and high boiling point.
Should not corrode parts of the brake system.

\section*{3. The lift pump}

The lift pump relies on the atmospheric pressure to raise water from a borehole or well. It has two valves, $A$ and B.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-029.jpg?height=595&width=919&top_left_y=266&top_left_x=153)

To start the pump, water must be poured on top of the piston, a process called priming. This creates an air-tight seal around the piston and in valve A. The pump is operated by means of a lever. It has two cycles, upstroke and down stroke.

\section*{During upstroke}

When the plunger moves up during upstroke, valve A closes due to the pressure of water above it plus the weight of the plunger. At the same time, air above valve B expands and the atmospheric pressure on the surface of water pushes water past valve $B$ into the barrel. The plunger is moved up and down until the region between $A$ and $B$ is filled with water. Water above the piston is then lifted out through the side tube.

\section*{During down stroke}

During downstroke, valve B closes due to its weight plus pressure of water above the piston.

\section*{Limitation of the lift pump.}

The atmospheric pressure can only support a column of water of about 10 mm i.e. Normal atmospheric can raise water to a maximum height of 10 m .

In practice, this height is usually below 10m. This due to;
Low atmospheric pressure in places at high altitudes.
Leakages at the valves and piston

\section*{4. The force pump.}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-030.jpg?height=608&width=1318&top_left_y=168&top_left_x=146)

In this design, the pressure used to raise water is created by the person operating the pump handle. The pump handle moves a piston in the cylinder, which is placed within 10 m of the water level i.e. 10 m or below $[\mathrm{h}]$. The cylinder is connected to a chamber.

\section*{Upstroke.}

During upstroke, air above valve P expands and its pressure falls below atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure on the water surface pushes water up past valve $P$ into the barrel.
The pressure above valve Q is atmospheric pressure and hence this valve remains closed during this stroke.

\section*{Down stroke}

During down stroke, valve P closes. Increase in pressure in water in the barrel opens valve Q and water is forced into the chamber R. As water fills the chamber, some air is trapped and compressed at the upper part.

In the next upstroke, valve Q closes and the compressed air forces water up the delivery pipe ensuring a continuous flow of water as the valves open and close.

NB: The height to which water can be raised is affected by two factors, namely:
- The strength of the person pumping i.e. the force applied during the down stroke
- The ability of the pump and its working parts to withstand the pressure of the long column of water in the chamber R.

The pressure at $A$ and $B$ is the same and equal to the atmospheric pressure. The pressure at $C$ is the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the column of water, $h$.
$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{c}}=\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{atm}}+\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{g}$
The pressure of the surrounding air at C is atmospheric pressure. This creates a pressure difference. The resultant downward force due to this pressure difference causes water to flow out of the end C. The water column doesn't break due to strong cohesive force between water molecules.

For the siphon to work, the following conditions must be met:
- The end C must be below the surface of the liquid to be emptied, A.
- The tube must first be filled with the liquid having NO bubble in it.
- One end of the tube must be in the liquid
- The tube must not rise beyond the barometric height of the liquid from the surface of the liquid.

Note that a siphon can work in a vacuum provided a pressure difference is created.

\section*{TOPIC 5: PARTICULATE NATURE OF MATTER}

\section*{5.1: Introduction}

Matter - is anything that occupies space and has mass. Matter exists in three states namely; solid, liquid and gas.

\section*{Experiment}

Aim: to demonstrate that matter is made up of smaller particles
Apparatus: Beakers, potassium permanganate crystals, water.

\section*{Procedure}
i. Pour water into the beaker till it is half full
ii. Dissolve some potassium permanganate crystals until the solution is purple iii. Transfer half the solution into another beaker and fill it with water iv. Continue the process with other beakers, comparing the colour of the solution through each dilution. Observation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-031.jpg?height=218&width=1386&top_left_y=1729&top_left_x=153)

The colour of the solution fades away through each dilution until the solution appears colourless.
This shows that the particles of potassium permanganate are spread out evenly in the water. Each dilution spreads them out further as the water molecules increase in number. Hence the purple colour fades away with each dilution until it becomes colourless.

\section*{Conclusion}

Potassium permanganate is made up of tiny particles.
Also, when some salt particles are put in a flask and water added, it is observed that after shaking the flask to dissolve the salt, the volume of the final solution is less than the original volume of the water plus undissolved
salt. This is because salt particles fitted into some spaces between the water molecules. Hence the particles of the solution are more packed together, reducing the volume of the solution. This also indicates that the particles of water and those of salt differ in size. 5.2: Brownian motion

Brownian motion refers to the irregular movement of light particles when they are knocked by heavier bodies.

\section*{Experiment 1}

Aim: To demonstrate Brownian motion in liquids
Apparatus: Beaker, hand lens, pollen grains (chalk dust), transparent lid.

\section*{Procedure}
i. Pourwater into the beaker about $3 / 4$ full.
ii. Sprinkle pollen grains on the surface of the water. iii. Cover the beaker with a transparent lid.
iv. By the use of a hand lens, observe the behavior of the pollen grains on the water surface.

\section*{Observation}

The pollen grains suspended in the water are in constant random motion.
The pollen grains are constantly knocked by smaller invisible particles of water from all sides. The net force on the pollen grain at any instant makes it to move with an irregular pattern. This is called Brownian motion.

\section*{Experiment2}

Aim: to demonstrate Brownian motion in air (the smoke cell experiment)
Apparatus: A drinking straw, smoke cell, microscope and a bright light source

\section*{Procedure}
i. Burn one end of the straw and let the smoke fill the smoke cell from the other end.
ii. Remove the straw and cover the cell using the cover plate.
iii. Illuminate the cell and with the use of a microscope observe the behavior of the smoke particles in the smoke cell.

\section*{Observation}

Bright specks which are in continuous random motion are observed.
The bright specks are smoke particles scattering light. The random motion is due to constant collision between smoke particles and invisible air particles and also with walls of the cell.

The above findings can be summarized by the kinetic theory of matter which states: matter is made up of tiny particles which are in continuous random motion.

\section*{5.3: States of matter}

31 | P a g e Â©PHYSICS
PLUS

Matter exists in three states which are interconvertible through either heating or cooling.

\subsection*{5.3.1: Solids}

In solid state, the particles are closely packed together due to strong cohesive force between them. They vibrate in their fixed positions. Hence solids have definite shape and volume. When the temperature of the solid is raised, the vibration becomes rapid. At a certain temperature the particles of the solid break away from the structure of the solid and the solid is said to have melted. This temperature is called the melting point of the solid.

\subsection*{5.3.2: Liquids}

The particles of a liquid are generally not as close as in solids. The attractive force between the liquid particles is weaker than solids'. Hence liquids have neither definite shape nor volume but take the shape of the container.

The density of a liquid is a little less than that of its liquid. This is because the liquid occupies more space than its own solid. Hence solid materials sink in their own liquids.

When a liquid is heated to a certain temperature, it changes to a gas. This temperature is known as its boiling point and the process is called vaporization.

A liquid can sometimes lose its energy and fall back to solid state. This is called freezing.

\subsection*{5.3.3: Gases}

In gases, the particles are far apart with the weakest cohesive force. For this reason gases are highly compressible. Gases have densities which are much less than those of their respective liquids and solids.

Gas particles can sometimes lose their energy and fall back to liquid state. This is called condensation.
NB: certain solids change directly to gas when heated while some gases can be cooled directly to solid. This process is called sublimation.

\section*{5.4: Diffusion}

Diffusion is defined as the process by which particles move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration.
- Diffusion in liquids can be demonstrated by putting a potassium permanganate crystal at the bottom of a beaker of water. After some time the water is observed to turn deep purple at the bottom and light purple near the top.

Also when a saturated copper II sulphate solution is added to water in a beaker, initially the water layer floats on top of the copper II sulphate solution due to its lower density. After some time the boundary disappears and the two form a homogeneous pale blue mixture.

32 | Page Â©PHYSICS
PLUS

When warm liquids are used in the illustrations above, similar observations would be made but after a shorter time. This suggests that temperature speeds up the rate of diffusion.
- Diffusion in gases is faster than in liquids due to their lower density, high kinetic energy and weaker cohesive forces (or larger intermolecular distance). Diffusion in gases can be investigated by setting up two gas jars, one filled with air and the other with bromine gas as shown below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-034.jpg?height=248&width=1411&top_left_y=448&top_left_x=285)

After some time a pale brown gas mixture is observed in both the jars. The bromine gas spreads into jar B while air particles also spread into jar A.

NB: The rate of diffusion will be slower when the gas jars were set upright. This is because the denser gas will tend to remain at the base and the lighter one up.

This experiment should be carried out in a fumed cupboard or fume chamber.
- Diffusion in solids is very slow but can occur between two metals like gold and lead.

\subsection*{5.4.1: Rate of diffusion}

The rate of diffusion between ammonia gas and hydrochloric acid gas can be investigated by the set up below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-034.jpg?height=324&width=1266&top_left_y=1372&top_left_x=153)

After some time, a white deposit of ammonium chloride is formed near the end with the hydrochloric acid. This indicates that ammonia gas diffuses faster than hydrochloric acid gas. Note that ammonia gas is lighter compared to hydrochloric acid gas.

\section*{Conclusion}

The rate of diffusion depends on the density of the substance and the temperature. 5.4.2:

\section*{Diffusion through porous materials}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-035.jpg?height=445&width=755&top_left_y=165&top_left_x=140)

A porous pot has very fine holes through which hydrogen gas diffuses into the pot while air diffuses out. The level of water in the tube falls as hydrogen diffuses into the pot. If hydrogen is supplied for a longer time, bubbles of hydrogen gas will be observed from the end in the water.

When the gas supply is stopped, hydrogen gas diffuses out of the pot as air diffuses into the pot and the level of water in the tube rises.

\section*{TOPIC 6: THERMAL EXPANSION}

\section*{6.1: Introduction}

Temperature - it is the degree of coldness or hotness of a body on some chosen scale. It is measured using a thermometer. The SI unit of temperature is the Kelvin (K). Other units include degrees Celsius ( ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), Fahrenheit, F. Temperature is a basic physical quantity as well as a scalar quanity.

\section*{6.2: Temperature scale}

The scale of a thermometer is obtained by selecting two temperatures called fixed points; the lower fixed point and the upper fixed point. The lower fixed point is the temperature of pure melting ice. It is taken to be $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The upper fixed point is the temperature of steam above pure boiling water at normal atmospheric pressure. It is taken to be $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The temperature of steam is used since impurities do not affect its temperature but will raise the boiling point of water. The range between these two points is then divided into equal divisions.

On the Kelvin (absolute) scale, $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is at 273 K while $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is at 373 K . Hence to convert ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to K , add 273 to the temperature in ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{6.3: Types of thermometers}

A thermometer is designed according to the purpose for which it is required. The following are some of the commonly used thermometers:

\subsection*{6.3.1: Liquid-in-glass thermometer}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-036.jpg?height=380&width=454&top_left_y=523&top_left_x=272)

In this thermometer the liquid expands up a capillary tube when the bulb is heated. The liquid used in this thermometer should posses the following qualities for the thermometer to be effective:

Be easily visible
Expand and contract uniformly
Have a wide range of temperature i.e high boiling point and low freezing point
Be sensitive to small temperature changes
Should not wet the glass
The most commonly used liquid is mercury althoughcoloured alcohol can also be used. Water does not meet all the above desirable properties. The table below compares mercury and alcohol as a thermometric liquid:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Mercury & Alcohol \\
\hline Has high b.p, $357^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ & Has low b.p, $78{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ \\
\hline Relatively high freezing point, $-39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ & Low freezing point, $-115^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ \\
\hline Good thermal conductor & Poor thermal conductor \\
\hline Has regular expansion & Has a slight irregular expansion \\
\hline Does not wet the glass & Wets the glass \\
\hline Easily visible & Ii coloured to make it easily visible \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

These thermometers are commonly used in normal laboratories.

\subsection*{6.3.2: A clinical thermometer}

This is a special thermometer used to measure human body temperature. It has a short scale between $35-43^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This is because the optimal body temperature is $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. It has a constriction to prevent back flow of the mercury into the bulb. This is to allow time to take the reading. After use the thermometer is shaken to return the mercury back to the bulb.

35 | P a g e Â©PHYSICS
PLUS

Methylated spirit can be used to sterilize the thermometer after use.

\subsection*{6.3.3: Six's maximum and minimum thermometer}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-037.jpg?height=481&width=1044&top_left_y=296&top_left_x=150)

Maximum index
It is used to record minimum and maximum temperatures of a given place. When the temperature of the surrounding rises, the oil in the bulb A expands pushing the mercury which in turn pushes up the oil in the other arm. This compresses the vapour above the oil and the maximum index is pushed up to the maximum position.
This is the maximum temperature.
When the temperature falls, the oil contracts back into the bulb. Mercury flows back pushing the minimum index to the minimum position. This gives the minimum temperature.

After taking the readings, the indices are pulled down to the level of the mercury using a magnet.

\subsection*{6.3.4: A bimetallic thermometer}

It is made up of a coiled bimetallic strip whose one end is fixed and the other end connected to a pointer. Commonly used metals are brass and invar. When the temperature rises brass expands more than invar. The strip thus curls forcing the pointer to move over a calibrated scale.

\section*{6.4: Expansion in solids}

A solid can expand in three ways:
â  Linear expansion; increase in length
åº Superficial expansion; increase in surface area
Cubic expansion; increase in volume
Solids expand when heated and contract when cooled. During expansion the volume increases, density decreases but mass remains the same. Expansion in solids can be demonstrated by the ball and ring experiment.

When both the ball and ring are at room temperature, the ball easily passes through the ring but when the ball is heated it does not go through the ring. When left in contact for some time the ball finally passes through the ring again.

On heating the ball expanded and so could not go through the ring. After sometime it went through because the ball lost some of its heat to the ring which then expanded while the ball slightly contracted.

Different solids like metals will expand at different rates when exposed to the same amount of heat for the same duration. This can be investigated by the bar and gauge experiment.

36 | Page Â©PHYSICS
PLUS

One end of the metal bar is fixed while the other end is kept in contact with the pointer. Any slight expansion of the bar is magnified by the long pointer and can be read from the scale. The experiment is then repeated using bars of other materials. The pointer readings are then used to compare their rates of expansion.

In the above experiment, the following parameters must be kept constant:

> Length of the rods
> Diameter / thickness of the rods
> Source of heat
> Duration of heating

The measure of the tendency of a material to expand is called its expansivity. The ability of a material to expand when heated is referred to as its linear expansivity.

\section*{Linear expansivity, $\alpha=$ expansion (change in length)/ \{original length * temperature change \}}

The SI unit of linear expansivity is per Kelvin ( $\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ ).
Linear expansivity of a substance may also be defined as the fraction of its original length by which a rod of the same substance expands per Kelvin rise in temperature.

\section*{Example 6.1}
1. Consider a brass rod of length 50.2 cm at $16.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. if the rod is heated until a temperature of $99.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ where its new length is 50.279 cm , determine the linear expansivity of brass.

Linear expansivity, $\alpha=\mathrm{e} / \mathrm{l}_{0}{ }^{*} \Delta \mathrm{~T}=(50.279-50.20) \mathrm{cm} / 50.2 \mathrm{~cm} *(99.5-16.6) \mathrm{K}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =0.079 / 50.2-82.9 \\
& =1.9 * 10^{-5} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}
\end{aligned}$$

The table below shows some substances with their linear expansivities:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Material & Linear expansitivty ( ${ }^{*} \mathbf{1 0}^{-5}$ ) $\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ \\
\hline Aluminum & 2.6 \\
\hline Copper & 1.68 \\
\hline Brass & 1.9 \\
\hline Iron & 1.2 \\
\hline Steel & 1.1 \\
\hline Concrete & 1.1 \\
\hline Platinum alloy & 0.9 \\
\hline Glass & 0.85 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Invar & 0.1 \\
\hline silica & 0.042 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The knowledge of linear expansivity is used in designing various materials to ensure that they are able to operate well under varying thermal conditions. For instance ordinary glass has a higher linear expansivity than a pyrex glass. When hot water is put in an ordinary glass, it breaks but when a pyrex glass is used it does not crack. The pyrex glass has lower linear expansivity and cannot suffer very large forces of expansion while the ordinary glass does as it undergoes temperature changes.

In building and construction, concrete is always reinforced using steel because both have the same linear expansivity.

\section*{6.5: Bimetallic strip}

It is formed when two metals of different linear expansivitiesare riveted together e.g. brass and iron or brass and invar. When the temperature of the strip is raised, brass expands more than iron. Hence the strip curves with brass curving outwards and iron inwards. When the temperature falls, brass again contracts more than iron and the strip curves with brass now on the inner side and brass on the outer side.

\section*{6.6: Applications of expansion and contraction in solids}

\subsection*{6.6.1: Railway lines}

Railway lines are fixed with gaps to allow for expansion when temperature rises. The bolt holes are also oval in shape for the same reason. Another way of creating room for expansion in railway lines is by planing the ends of the rails so that they are able to overlap during expansion.

\subsection*{6.6.2: Telephone/electricity wires}

Telephone and electricity wires are loosely fixed during installation to allow for contraction during cold weather.

\subsection*{6.6.3: Steam pipes}

Pipes carrying steam from boilers are fitted with expansion loops to allow for expansion and contraction. Without the loop the pipe is likely to break due to the resultant force as a result of expansion and contraction. It is necessary that oil companies make this allowance when constructing fuel pipelines. 6.6.4: Steel bridges

In the construction of steel bridges, one end is fixed while the other end is placed on rollers. This is to allow for expansion and contraction.

\subsection*{6.6.5: Rivets}

Rivets are fitted when hot and then hammered flat. On cooling, the rivet contract, pulling the two plates firmly together.

\subsection*{6.6.6: Thermostat}

It is a device that can be used to control the temperature of a room. It uses a bimetallic strip. It is connected to a heater circuit. When the temperature of the room rises beyond the set value, the bimetallic strip expands and bends away breaking the contact. Hence the heater circuit is switched off.

38 | P a g e Â©PHYSICS
PLUS

The strip cools and contracts and the contact is remade switching on the heater circuit. The setting knob is used to adjust the temperature at which the thermostat is switched on and off.

Other uses of the thermostat include controlling the temperature of electric iron, cookers and fridge, fire alarms and car indicators.

\section*{6.7:Expansion and contraction in liquids}

The rate expansion in liquids is more than in solids because the particles are slightly far apart. When temperature increases, the liquid molecules gain more energy increasing their rate of movement. The weak bonds between these molecules are further weakened. The molecules thus expand and occupy more space. Expansion in liquids can be demonstrated by the set up below:

Liquid
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-040.jpg?height=326&width=253&top_left_y=726&top_left_x=454)

When heated, the level of the liquid in the glass tube first drops and then starts rising. This initial fall in the level is because the glass was heated first and expanded. Later the liquid received the heat energy and expanded hence the rise in the level.

Just like solids, liquids expand at different rates. In order to investigate this, a number of identical flasks are filled with different liquids ensuring that their initial levels are the same in the glass tubes. For a fair comparison, the tubes should be identical i.e. of same diameter. The flasks are then simultaneously immersed in a bath of hot water. The bath of water should be stirred continuously to ensure that temperature is uniform.

It will be observed that the level of the liquids in the tubes differ after some time. If water, alcohol and methylated spirit were used, it would be observed that methylated spirit expanded the most, followed by alcohol and water the least.

\section*{6.8: Expansion in gases}

Gases have the highest rate of expansion because their particles are very far apart and are held by very weak forces. When heated, they gain more energy and move farther apart occupying more space. It can be shown by a round bottomed flask fitted with a glass tube in a tight-fitting cork. The flask is first inverted with the glass tube dipped in water. By use of the palms, the flask is warmed for some time.

Air
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-040.jpg?height=367&width=313&top_left_y=2164&top_left_x=510)

39 | Page Â©PHYSICS
PLUS

It will be observed that the level of water in the tube drops and if warmed for a longer time, bubbles are observed escaping from the end of the tube in water. This shows that air expanded on heating and needed more space, hence the drop in the level of water in the tube and the bubbles.

If the heat is withdrawn, the level of the water rises again in the tube. Expansion and contraction in gases is the basis of the formation of land and sea breezes.

\section*{6.9: The Unusual expansion (anomalous) expansion of water}

It is normal experience that substances expand on heating and contract on cooling. But for water, this is never to be between the temperatures $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Water can exist as a solid (ice), liquid (liquid water) and as a gas (steam).

At temperatures below $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, water exists as a solid, occupying a bigger volume. When heated, it expands just like any other solid up to $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. At $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, ice melts at constant temperature. Melting is accompanied by a decrease in volume by about $8 \%$. Beyond $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, water contracts further up to $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Therefore water has minimum volume at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and hence maximum density which is slightly higher than $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$.

Above $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, water expands like any other liquid. This behavior of water is described as anomalous, unusual, or irregular.

The variation of volume with temperature and density with temperature when water is heated is illustrated by the graphs below:

\subsection*{6.9.1: Effects of anomalous expansion of water}

\section*{a. Biological importance}

During cold weather, the temperature of lakes and ponds drops and water contracts, becomes denser and sinks. A circulation of water is thus set up until all the water attain maximum density i.e. at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. If further cooling occurs (below $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), then any water below 40 C will stay at the top due to its lower density. At $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, ice forms on top and this acts as an insulator to the layers below. Hence the warmth underneath can sustain aquatic life and thus the aquatic animals and plants can survive there.

\section*{b. Icebergs}

Ice has a slightly lower density, about $0.92 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$, than that of water and hence it floats with a small portion above the water surface. The rest and a bigger portion of the ice rests under water. This is called an iceberg. Icebergs pose a great danger to ships as the submerged parts cannot be seen easily by navigators.

\section*{c. Weathering of rocks}

Water sometimes finds its way into cracks within the rocks. When such water freezes during cold weather, it expands forcing the rock to break into smaller pieces. This is very important for agriculture as soil is formed. d.

\section*{Bursting of water pipes}

At times the water flowing through a pipe may freeze when it passes through a cold region. The water thus contracts, expanding and this may lead to pipe bursts if expansion allowances were not catered for.

\section*{TOPIC 7: HEAT TRANSFER}

\section*{7.1: Heat and temperature}

Heat may be defined as a form of energy that flows from a hot body to a cold body. Its SI unit is the joule (J). When a body loses heat its temperature is lowered while when a body gains heat its temperature rises. If two bodies which are at the same temperature are in contact, there is NO net heat transfer and the bodies are said to be at thermal equilibrium. No instrument can measure directly the amount of heat on a body.

Temperature on the other hand is the measure of the degree of hotness or coldness of a body. Its SI unit is the Kelvin (K). The most commonly used unit is degrees Celsius ( ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). Heat energy can only flow if there is a temperature difference between the two bodies.

\section*{7.2: Modes of heat transfer}

There are three modes of heat transfer namely conduction, convection and radiation.

\subsection*{7.2.1: Conduction}

Conduction is mainly prominent in solids. When a solid is heated, say from one end, the other end also becomes hot after some time. The means by which the heat is conducted to the other end can be explained by two theories:

\section*{a) Particle/atomic vibration}

When a material is heated from one end, the heat energy entering the material increases the vibration of the particles/atoms at that end. These atoms also set the other neighboring atoms into vibration transferring the energy to the other end.

\section*{b) Free/mobile/delocalized electrons}

Generally metals have free electrons which move all over the metal body. Heat energy supplied at one end of the material increases the kinetic energy of the electrons which then transfers this energy to the other end.

The ability of a material to conduct heat is called thermal conductivity. Materials that easily conduct heat are referred to as good conductors e.g. most metals. This is because metals conduct both by atom vibration as well as movement of free/delocalized electrons. This is why cooking utensils, soldering irons are made from metals. Nonmetals are generally bad conductors of heat because they do not have free electrons.

The set up below can be used to compare thermal conductivity of different materials:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-043.jpg?height=340&width=933&top_left_y=1250&top_left_x=382)

The order in which wax on the rods fall is the order of thermal conductivity of the materials i.e. the rod from which wax first falls is the best thermal conductor and decreases in that order. It is important to ensure the following when doing this comparison:
- Use same length of the rods with the same length in the hot water.
- Keep the temperature of the water bath uniform
- Use same thickness or amounts of wax

Below is a table of good and bad conductors:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Good thermal conductors & Bad thermal conductors \\
\hline Silver & Concrete \\
\hline Copper & Glass \\
\hline Aluminum & Brick \\
\hline Brass & Asbestos paper \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Zinc & Rubber \\
\hline Iron & Wood \\
\hline Lead & Water \\
\hline Mercury & Air \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

NB:
+ During thermal conduction, heat flows through materials without the materials shifting or moving.
+ Thermal conduction requires a material medium.

\section*{Factors affecting thermal conduction in solids}
- Temperature difference between the ends of the material

More heat flows when the temperature difference is large.
- Cross-section area

The thermal conductivity of a thicker material is higher than that of a thinner one of the same material. This is because the number of free electrons (metals only) per unit length of the thicker material is higher than that of a thinner one. Also, the number of atoms vibrating per unit length of the thicker material is higher than that of a thinner one.
- Length of the conductor

Heat energy reaches the other end of a shorter conductor faster than a longer one. Heat travels in a conductor along imaginary lines known as lines of heat flow. These lines diverge away from the hot end and therefore as the length of the conductor increases, some of the energy is 'dropped'.

- Nature of the material

Some materials are good conductors while others are bad conductors e.g. copper is a better conductor compared to iron.

The above four factors can be combined together in the following equation:
Rate of heat flow $=$ thermal conductivity of the material, k * Cross-section area, A * Temp. Difference, $\Delta \theta$

Length, 1
Lagging

This involves covering good conductors with bad one (insulators) with the aim of minimizing heat loss to the surroundings. For instance pipes used to convey hot water from boilers are normally covered using thick asbestos material.

\section*{Conduction in liquids}

Conduction in liquids is not as pronounced as in solids. Liquids are generally poor thermal conductors with the exception of a few like mercury and some electrolytes (e.g. salt solution). Note that mercury exists as a liquid at room temperature. Thermal conductivity of water may be investigated by the set up below:

Steam
Ice wrapped in a wire gauze
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-045.jpg?height=250&width=644&top_left_y=607&top_left_x=448)

Ice wrapped in wire gauze is placed at the bottom of a boiling tube containing water and heated from the top. It is observed that as water at the boils producing steam, the ice remains unmelted. This shows that heat did not reach the bottom even having been aided by the wire gauze which is a good conductor. In this experiment:
- The boiling tube is made of glass which is a poor thermal conductor and thus limits the possible heat conduction down the tube by glass.
- The ice is wrapped in wire gauze to ensure that it does not float on water. Wire gauze is a good thermal conductor but still the ice did not melt, indicating that there is very little, if any, heat conducted down by water.
- Heating water at the top eliminates the possibility of heat transfer to the ice by convection.

Although liquids are poor thermal conductors, some liquids are better conductors than others. This can be investigated by the set up below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-045.jpg?height=421&width=1451&top_left_y=1611&top_left_x=142)

The test tubes are coated with a uniform layer of wax. When the rod is heated as shown, the wax on the test tube with mercury is observed to melt downwards after sometime. Later on, wax on the other test tube started melting but very slowly.

In conclusion, mercury is a better thermal conductor compared to water. Note that the heating should be done at the centre for a fair result. Also, the region of the rods in the liquids should be the same.

\section*{Conduction in gases}

Gases are the worst thermal conductors. This is because they have larger intermolecular distance minimizing collision between their molecules. This can be verified by the set up below:

Match stick

A match stick held
in the unburnt gas region of a flame is never ignited by the heat from the hot region above it. This shows that gases are poor thermal conductors.

\section*{Applications of good and poor conductors}
- Cooking utensils, soldering iron and boilers are made of metals because they are good thermal conductors. In some cooking utensils, their handles are covered using bad heat conductors such as wood, plastic
- Integrated circuits (ICs) and transistors in electronic devices are normally fixed to a heat sink; a metal plate with fins. This is to conduct away undesired heat which may otherwise affect the operation of the device.
- Fire fighters put on protective clothing made from asbestos material to keep them safe while putting out fires. Film actors involved in stunts involving burning also put on similar clothing.
- Birds flap their wings after getting wet in order to introduce air pockets in their feathers. Air is a poor thermal conductor and hence reduces heat loss from their bodies. The same applies to wool, fur, and thatch on roofs. Soft board ceiling have many air pockets than concrete one hence its preference to the concrete ceiling.
- When heating liquids using a glass beaker, the beaker is usually placed on a wire gauze. A wire gauze is a good heat conductor and hence spreads out the heat to a larger area of the beaker. If the gauze was not used, heat would only be concentrated on a small area and the beaker may crack as a result.
- In some buildings where the inside temperature is to be stabilized, double walls are constructed with an insulator like glass wool or foam plastic between them. Also, double glazed windows have air trapped between the two glass sheets.

\subsection*{7.2.2: Convection}

It is a process by which heat is transferred in fluids. The term fluid refers to both liquids and gases. In this case heat transfer is by actual movement of the fluid itself. When a portion of liquid at the bottom of a container is heated, the particles there acquire more energy and expand. Since its mass does not change, the liquid in that portion becomes less dense and rises to the top. Cold, heavy portion of the liquid move down to replace the warm rising portion. A circulation of hot and cold water sets up a convectional current. Heat transfer in this manner is called convection.

However, if heated from top no convection current is set up. This is because hot, lighter liquid cannot sink down below the cold, heavy liquid.

To show convection in liquids, a beaker is filled with water and some crystals of potassium permanganate placed at one corner of the beaker.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-047.jpg?height=397&width=1489&top_left_y=162&top_left_x=145)

When heated from the position shown, a purple coloration is observed to rise from the potassium permanganate crystal forming a loop. Hence when a liquid is heated, it rises and a cold one descends to replace it. This movement of the liquid forms convection currents.

Convection in gases can be demonstrated using the set up below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-047.jpg?height=502&width=968&top_left_y=806&top_left_x=351)

A smoldering straw/ rug burning on one end is used to introduce smoke through chimney A into the box. After sometime, the smoke is observed to exist through chimney B. however, when the candle is put off, NO smoke is sucked into the box.

The candle heats up the air above it which then expands and rises up chimney B. cold , heavy air is drawn in through chimney A to replace the rising warm air. It carries along with it smoke particles. Hence smoke exists through chimney A so long as the candle is burning and the produces smoke.

\section*{Applications of convection}
I. The domestic hot water system

Overflow pipe
Cold supply tank
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-047.jpg?height=670&width=1874&top_left_y=2080&top_left_x=147)

Water is heated up in the boiler, expands thereby becoming less dense. It then rises up tube A. cold water descends to the boiler through the return pipe B. The force of gravity helps in pushing the cold water down from the cold water tank to the boiler. The storage tank thus contains hot water on the upper part and cold water on the lower part. The valve controls the amount of water in the cold water tank. The overflow pipe helps in removing excess water from the cold water tank.

The pipes conveying hot water, the boiler and the storage tank are normally lagged to minimize heat loss through conduction.

\section*{II. House ventilation}

Generally windows of houses are normally put closer to the floor and ventilation holes/openings high up in the walls. Air expelled by the house occupants is warm, lighter and thus rises and escapes through the ventilation openings. Cold, fresh heavier air flows into the room through the windows and doors to replace the escaping air. Thus a continuous circulation of air is set up in the room.

In certain modern houses, air conditioning devices are fitted to bring about forced convection of air, giving out cold dry air and absorbing warm moist air.

\section*{III. Car engine cooling system}

A car engine gets heated as it operates. This heat must be disposed of to ensure the engine remains efficient. The engine is normally surrounded by a metallic water jacket connected to the radiator. The metal surface conducts away heat from the engine to the water. Water is heated up causing convection currents. The hot water is pumped into the radiator with thin copper fins that further conducts the heat away from the water. Fast moving air flowing between the fins speeds up the cooling process.

\section*{IV. Land and sea breeze.}

This is a natural occurrence. A mass of water takes a much longer time to be heated up to the same temperature as a nearby land. It also loses heat slowly compared to land. It is on this argument that land and sea breezes are formed.

During the day, land gets heated much faster than a nearby mass of water. The mass of air just above the land is thus heated faster, expands and rises due to its reduced density. Cold air from above the water e.g. sea, drifts towards the land to replace the warm rising air. This is termed as sea breeze.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-048.jpg?height=369&width=1326&top_left_y=1816&top_left_x=145)

At night, the land cools faster than the sea. The air above the sea will be at a higher temperature. It expands and rises up due to its low density. Cold air from the land drifts towards the sea to replace the warm rising air. This constitutes a land breeze.

\subsection*{7.2.3: Radiation}

It is the flow of heat energy from one point to another by means of electromagnetic waves. It requires NO material medium. These waves are able to pass through a vacuum. Energy from the sun reaches the earth's surface by radiation. All bodies emit and absorb radiant energy (radiation). A body emitting thermal radiation can also emit visible light when it is hot enough. The higher the temperature of a body the greater the amount of radiant energy it can emit. Thermal radiation can be reflected and causes a heating effect. The amount of radiant energy absorbed by a body depends on the nature of its surface. Dull/ black surfaces are good absorbers than shinny/ polished surfaces. This can be illustrated by the set up below:

Wax
Dull surface
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-049.jpg?height=228&width=519&top_left_y=859&top_left_x=597)

Source of heat
Polished surface

After some time, the cork on the dull surface is observed to fall off first once the wax melts. The one on the polished surface takes longer to fall off. This shows that dull surfaces are good absorbers of radiation than polished surfaces. The radiation falling on the polished surface is partly absorbed and partly reflected.

Generally, good heat absorbers are also good emitters/ radiators. Hence black/ dull surfaces are good emitters while polished surfaces are poor emitters. Note that poor emitters (polished surfaces) are good reflectors.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-049.jpg?height=470&width=1378&top_left_y=1413&top_left_x=146)

After some time, the level of water in limb A is observed to rise while that in limb B falls. The boiling tube B receives more heat than A . Hence the air in B expands pushing the water in limb B down. This is a proof that dull surfaces are good emitters.

\section*{Applications of thermal radiators}
1. Kettles, cooking pans and iron boxes have polished surfaces to minimize heat loss through radiation.
2. Petrol tanks are painted silvery bright to reflect away as much heat as possible.
3. Buildings which are whitewashed or painted using bright colours remain cool even during hot conditions because the bright colours reflect much of the sun's radiation. In cold regions, it is the inner walls and roofs which are painted with bright colours and the outer walls with dull colours. In very hot countries, people do put on white clothing because they reflect much light.

\section*{4. Solar concentrators}

Concave reflectors concentrate light that fall on them to a common point. The temperature at this point may be high enough to boil water.

\section*{5. Green house effect}

A green house acts as a heat trap by preventing the reflected radiation from the earth's surface from passing through glass. High energetic short wavelength radiation from the sun passes through glass without being absorbed. Inside the greenhouse, this heat is absorbed by the earth and the objects in it. These objects in turn emit long wavelength radiation of low amount of energy that cannot penetrate glass. This raises the temperature inside the greenhouse. This is called greenhouse effect.

Greenhouses provide optimum conditions for plants in cold regions. In the atmosphere especially at the lower layers, the gases and air pollutants suspended behave like glass, trapping the long wavelength reflected radiation. This may raise the temperature of the atmosphere to some dangerous levels, a phenomenon known as global warming.

\section*{6. Solar heater}

A solar heater uses radiation from the sun to heat water. It comprises a coiled blackened copper pipe resting on a blackened insulating surface. Radiation from the sun passes through glass and absorbed by the copper pipes. Copper conducts this heat to the water flowing through it.

\section*{7. A thermos (vacuum) flask.}

A vacuum flask is designed to keep its contents at a constant temperature by minimizing heat transfer into or out of the flask. It has a double wall; silvered to prevent heat loss or heat gain through radiation. Between the two walls is a vacuum which is a perfect insulator and minimizes heat loss through conduction and convection. The cork/lid minimizes heat loss through convection.

\section*{TOPIC 12: TURNING EFFECT OF A FORCE}

\section*{12.1: Moment of a force}

We have seen earlier the effects of force on a body. One such effect is force can make a body turn about a point. The turning effect of a force is referred to as moment of that force. it is defined as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance between the line of action of the force and the pivot;

\section*{Moment of a force =force (F)x perpendicular distance (d)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-051.jpg?height=177&width=733&top_left_y=947&top_left_x=146)

The moment of force $\mathrm{F}_{1}=\mathrm{F}_{1} \mathrm{xd}_{1}$
Similarly, the moment of force $\mathrm{F}_{2}=\mathrm{F}_{2} \mathrm{xd}_{2}$
The SI Unit of moment of a force is the newton-metre (Nm). The moment of a force is a vector quantity i.e has both magnitude and direction.

The knowledge of the moment of a force helps us to understand why:
It is easier to open or close a door with the handle farthest from the hinges.
It is easier to tighten or loosen a bolt using a longer spanner.

\section*{Example 12.1}
1. A force of 20 N acts on a uniform rod at a distance of 25 cm from the pivot. Determine the moment of the force.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Moment } & =\text { force } F \times \text { perpendicular distance } d \\
& =20 \mathrm{~N} \times 0.25 \mathrm{~m}=5 \mathrm{Nm} 12.2
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Principle of moments}

Consider the system below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-051.jpg?height=218&width=806&top_left_y=2206&top_left_x=253)
```
50 | P ag e Â©PHYSICS

```

The moment(s) to the right of the pivot is referred to as the clockwise moments while that to the left is referred to as the anticlockwise moments;

Clockwise moment $=\mathrm{F}_{2} \mathrm{~d}_{2}$
Anticlockwise moment $=\mathrm{F}_{1} \mathrm{~d}_{1}$
When a body is in equilibrium; Clockwise moment= Anticlockwise moment
The principle of moments states: for a body in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments is equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments;
$\mathrm{F}_{2} \mathrm{~d}_{2}=\mathrm{F}_{1} \mathrm{~d}_{1}$
For a system of parallel forces, two conditions must be satisfied for the system to be in equilibrium:
The sum of clockwise moments must be equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments.
The sum of upward forces must be equal to the sum of downward forces i.e the algebraic sum of the parallel forces is zero.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-052.jpg?height=186&width=1224&top_left_y=1040&top_left_x=155)
$\mathbf{F 3 F}_{\mathbf{4}}$

Clockwise moments $=\mathrm{F}_{1} \mathrm{~d}_{1}+\mathrm{F}_{4} \mathrm{~d}_{4}$
Anticlockwise moments $=\mathrm{F}_{2} \mathrm{~d}_{2}+\mathrm{F}_{3} \mathrm{~d}_{3}$
If the system is in equilibrium, then:
$\mathrm{F}_{1} \mathrm{~d}_{1}+\mathrm{F}_{4} \mathrm{~d}_{4}=\mathrm{F}_{2} \mathrm{~d}_{2}+\mathrm{F}_{3} \mathrm{~d}_{3}$
And $F_{1}+F_{2}=F_{3}+F_{4}$

\section*{12.3: Moments of anti-parallel forces}

Consider two equal and parallel forces acting on a body in opposite directions as shown below: dF

1
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-052.jpg?height=194&width=654&top_left_y=1906&top_left_x=275)

Clockwise moment= F(d-l)
Anticlockwise moment= Fl
The total moment of the system $=\mathrm{F}(\mathrm{d}-\mathrm{l})+\mathrm{Fl}=\mathrm{Fd}-\mathrm{Fl}+\mathrm{Fl}=\mathrm{Fd}$
Hence the total moment of two equal anti-parallel forces is the product of one of the forces and the perpendicular distance separating them.

When two equal forces act on a body in opposite directions, one of the moments acts inwards and the other outwards. The overall effect is a turning effect on the body. Such forces are called a couple.

Some common situations where anti-parallel forces are applied include using the bicycle handle bars, car's steering wheel when negotiating a bend, tightening or loosening a nut, opening a water tap, movement of the bicycle pedals etc. Example 12.2

below shows a system at equilibrium under forces. Find the distance $y$.

Clockwise moments $=(2 \mathrm{Nx} 40 \mathrm{~cm})+4 \mathrm{y}$
Anticlockwise moment $=12 \mathrm{Nx} 20 \mathrm{~cm}$
But, Clockwise moments= Anticlockwise moment
$80+4 y=240$
$4 \mathrm{y}=160 \mathrm{y}=40 \mathrm{~cm}$

Since the line of action of the 3 N force must be perpendicular to the distance, the vertical component $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}$ of the force will be used;
$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}=80 \operatorname{Cos} 60=3 \times 0.5=40 \mathrm{~N}$
Clockwise moment= 40x
Anticlockwise moment $=20 \mathrm{~N} \times 20 \mathrm{~cm}$
But, Clockwise moments= Anticlockwise moment
$40 \mathrm{x}=20 \mathrm{~N} \times 20 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{x}=(20 \times 20) / 40$

\section*{EQUILIBRIUM AND CENTRE}

\section*{OF GRAVITY}

\section*{13.1: Centre of gravity}

52|Page Â©PHYSICS
PLUS

The force of gravity normally tends to attract all bodies towards the centre of the earth. The point of application of the resultant force due to the earth's gravitational pull is referred to as the centre of gravity of the body. This is the point at which the whole weight of the body is concentrated.

Centre of gravity
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-054.jpg?height=388&width=500&top_left_y=367&top_left_x=512)

It is at this point where the body can be balanced. The centre of gravity of a body is also its centre of mass.
The centre of gravity of a regular object can be obtained through geometrical construction as it is its geometrical centre.

However, for an irregular object the centre of gravity can be located through the following steps:
Three holes are made at different points along the edge of the object.
The object is then suspended in turn using the holes and a plumb line attached to trace the vertical line through its centre of gravity.

The point of intersection of the three lines will be the centre of gravity of the irregular object.

Centre of gravity

At times the centre of gravity can be in an empty space, especially for hollow objects.

\section*{13.2: Stability and equilibrium}

Stability refers to the state of rest of a body while equilibrium is the state of balance of a body. When a body is in equilibrium, it stays in that position as long as there is no external influence on it.

There are three states of equilibrium namely:
- Stable equilibrium
- Unstable equilibrium
- A neutral equilibrium

These states can be illustrated by the following set up:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-055.jpg?height=184&width=959&top_left_y=676&top_left_x=185)

\section*{a) Stable equilibrium}

When the cone is given a slight displacement as shown in fig. i, it is observed that the line through its centre of gravity still passes through the base area. The centre of gravity of the cone is also raised. When the force is withdrawn, the object returns to its original position without toppling. The body is said to have a stable equilibrium.

In modern buses, the luggage compartments are situated in the lower part so as to lower the position of the centre of gravity and hence increased stability.

\section*{b) Unstable equilibrium}

In fig. ii, the cone has been balanced on its tip. When slightly displaced, the vertical line through its centre of gravity will fall outside its base as shown above. When the force is withdrawn, the cone will not be able to regain its original position and is thus said to be in an unstable equilibrium.

Most buses which carry heavy luggage on the upper carrier are always unstable as their centres of gravity are always raised.

\section*{c) Neutral equilibrium}

In fig. iii, the cone has been placed on its side and can therefore roll over. However, this does not change the position of its centre of gravity. Hence the body is said to be in a state of neutral equilibrium.

\subsection*{13.2.1: Factors affecting stability}

\section*{Area of the base}

A body with a larger base area will have the line through its centre of gravity passing through its base even when tilted through a larger angle. Hence the larger the base area the more stable a body is.

\section*{The position of the centre of gravity}

A body having its centre of gravity very low is more stable compared to one with a raised centre of gravity. The centre of gravity of a body can be lowered by making its base heavier.

\section*{13.3: Applications of stability}

54 | P a g e Â©PHYSICS

- Buses are built using lighter materials on the upper part but heavy ones on the lower part in order to lower their centres of gravity. The luggage is also put in the compartments below the passenger seats. Both these are meant to enhance stability of the bus.

O Racing cars have wider wheel bases. They are also built using heavy metals at their bases. These lower their centres of gravity thereby making them more stable and can therefore move round corners at relatively high speeds without overturning.

O A person carrying a bucket of water normally leans on the opposite side in order to adjust the position of his centre of gravity until a state of balance is achieved.

\section*{TOPIC 16: WAVES}

\section*{16.1: Introduction}

A wave is a continuous disturbance of a medium. A pulse is short lived disturbance produced by a single vibration. Waves may be put into the following uses:
- Radio waves are used for communication e.g in radio, television, mobile phones, remote control systems, etc.
- Microwaves are used for cooking.
- Water waves are harnessed for the production of hydropower.
- Sound waves are used in ultra-sounding in hospitals.

Note that waves can also be dangerous to the environment. For instance, earthquakes which produce shock waves can lead to damage of buildings, infrastructure if its magnitude is very big.

\section*{16.2: Types of waves}

Waves are broadly categorized into two namely electromagnetic and mechanical waves.
åº Electromagnetic waves - these waves do not require a material medium for their transmission. They include radio waves, radiant heat, light and microwaves, etc.

åº Mechanical waves - they require material medium for their transmission. They include water waves, sound waves, etc.

Waves can be further classified in terms of the propagation of their particles as follows:

\section*{1. Transverse waves}

In this case, the wave motion is perpendicular to the vibration of the particles. Electromagnetic waves as well water waves are examples of transverse waves.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-057.jpg?height=261&width=871&top_left_y=1870&top_left_x=150)

\section*{2. Longitudinal waves}

This is a wave in which the wave motion is along or parallel to the direction of vibration of the particles of the medium. Sound waves are examples of longitudinal waves. When a slinky spring is stretched and released along a smooth surface with one end fixed, the spring vibrates to and fro generating regions of compression and regions of rarefaction.

\section*{Rarefaction}

A region of compression is where the particles of the medium are under great pressure and are therefore closely packed together. A region of rarefaction is where the particles are spread out due to low pressure.

Some waves continuously move away from the source and are referred to as progressive waves.

\section*{16.3: Characteristics of waves}

The following terms are associated with a wave:

\section*{a) Oscillation}

It is a single complete to and fromovement from the mean position.

\section*{b) Amplitude}

It is the maximum displacement of the wave particles on either side from the mean position. It is measured in metre. The position of maximum displacement is called a crest while the position of minimum displacement is called a trough.

\section*{c) Frequency, f.}

It is the number of complete oscillations or cycles made in one second. It is measured in hertz (Hz). It can also be expressed as number of oscillations per second.

\section*{d) Period, T.}

It is the time taken to make a complete oscillation or cycle. It is measured in second. Note that, $\mathbf{f = 1 / T}$ or $\mathbf{T = 1 / f}$.

\section*{e) Wavelength, $\lambda$}

This is the distance travelled by the wave in one periodic time. It can also be defined as the distance between two successive particles which are in phase e.g. between two successive crests or troughs. Two particles of a waveform are said to be in phase if they are at similar positions and are travelling in the same direction.

\section*{Activity 16.1}
1. Show two waves which are $90^{\circ}$ out of phase.

\section*{16.4: The Speed of a wave}

Since wavelength is the distance covered by the wave in one period, the wave speed can be determined as follows:

Speed $=$ distance $/$ time $=$ wavelength, $\lambda /$ period, T
$\mathrm{V}=\lambda / \mathrm{T}$

Hence $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{f} \lambda$.
Thus wave speed is the product of its frequency by wavelength. This formula is true for all types of waves.

\section*{Example 16.1}
1. A source of waves has a frequency of 512 Hz . Calculate the wavelength of the waves produced if the speed of the waves is $330 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
$$\lambda=\mathrm{v} / \mathrm{f}=330 / 512=0.64 \mathrm{~m}$$
2. The wheel of a car is rotated at 120 revolutions per second, calculate: a) The period, T
b) The speed of the waves generated if the wavelength is $1.5^{*} 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}$.
$\mathrm{T}=1 / 120=0.0083 \mathrm{~s}$
$\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{f} \lambda=\lambda / \mathrm{T}=\left(1.5^{*} 10^{-2}\right) /\left(8.3^{*} 10^{-3}\right)=1.802 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

\section*{16.5: Properties of waves(form three)}

Wave properties refer to the behaviour of waves under certain conditions. They include reflection, refraction, diffraction and interference among others. They can be investigated using a ripple tank which consists of a transparent tray containing water, a lamp for illumination, a white screen underneath and an electric motor (a vibrator). The motor is connected to a straight bar which produces straight waves. If circular waves are required, the bar is raised and a small spherical ball fitted to it to produce circular waves. To view the waves with ease, a stroboscope is used. A stroboscope is a disc having equally spaced slits. It is rotated and its speed controlled such that the waves appear stationary i.e frozen.

\subsection*{16.5.1: Reflection of waves}

All waves undergo reflection. It is the bouncing back of waves when they hit an obstacle. All waves undergoing reflection obey the laws of reflection as earlier stated.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-060.jpg?height=239&width=890&top_left_y=1859&top_left_x=146)

Note that the wavelength of the waves remains unchanged. The pattern of the reflected waves depends on the shape of the incident waves and the reflector. Below are some patterns:

\section*{a) Plane waves incident on a straight reflector}

The waves converge at the principal focus F after reflection.

\subsection*{16.5.2: Refraction of waves}

This is the bending of waves as they travel from one medium into another. In the process, the speed of the waves changes from one medium to another. In the case of water waves, refraction occurs as the waves move from a region of a certain depth into another region of a different depth i.e. from a shallow region to a deeper region or vice versa. In general, the speed of water waves is greater in a deeper region than in a shallow region. It is important to note that the source of waves remains the same regardless of the depth thereafter. Hence, the frequency of the waves is a constant.

\section*{Recall: wave speed= frequency $\mathbf{f}^{\boldsymbol{*}}$ wavelength $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$.}

From the equation, it is clear that when the wave speed increases the wavelength also increases and vice versa. Thus, the wavelength is longer in deeper regions than in shallow regions.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-062.jpg?height=339&width=779&top_left_y=1370&top_left_x=340)

To obtain a shallow region in a ripple tank, a transparent glass block is placed in the tank with one end of its edge parallel to the vibrating bar.

However, when the waves strike the boundary normally/perpendicularly, no bending occurs even though the speed and hence the wavelength changes.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-062.jpg?height=319&width=776&top_left_y=1998&top_left_x=290)

Refraction of sound waves can be used to explain the long range of sound at night compared to daytime. This has been explained in the 'topic refraction of light'. TV and radio signals from a distant station also undergo a series of refraction and total internal reflection in the ionosphere towards the earth's surface making their reception possible.

\subsection*{16.5.3: Diffraction of waves}

Diffraction may be defined as the spreading of waves behind an obstacle. When the aperture is nearly the same size as the wavelength of the waves, the waves emerge as circular waves spreading out around the obstacle as shown in (a) below. However, when the size of the aperture is relatively wider than the wavelength of the waves, the waves pass through as plane waves bending slightly at the edges as shown in (b).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-063.jpg?height=389&width=1406&top_left_y=426&top_left_x=194)

Diffraction of sound waves can be used to explain why sound within a room can be heard round a corner without necessarily having to see the source of the sound.

Diffraction of light waves is not a common occurrence due to their shorter wavelengths. Nevertheless, diffraction of light waves can be observed when light pass through a small opening at the roof of a dark room. A shadow which is broader than the opening forms on the floor of the room.

\subsection*{16.5.4: Interference of waves}

Interference occurs when two waves merge. Such a merger may give rise to three cases:
- A much larger wave is formed i.e. constructive interference.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-063.jpg?height=384&width=955&top_left_y=1456&top_left_x=272)

The waves are in phase and superimpose to produce a wave with a greateramplitude.
- A smaller wave is formed i.e. destructive interference.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-063.jpg?height=313&width=978&top_left_y=2077&top_left_x=273)

The waves are out of phase with a phase difference of $180^{\circ}$. Since they have different amplitudes, they superimpose to form a wave with a smaller amplitude.
- A stationary wave.

A
A
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-064.jpg?height=307&width=434&top_left_y=226&top_left_x=252)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-064.jpg?height=312&width=343&top_left_y=229&top_left_x=880)

When the two waves which are out of phase with a phase difference of $180^{\circ}$ superimpose, the result is a stationary wave having a zero amplitude.

Interference is a product of the principle of superposition which states: for two waves travelling in at a given point in the same medium, the resultant effect is the vector sum of their respective displacements.
- Interference of water waves can be shown by setting up two spherical dippers in a ripple tank which simultaneously generate waves. Alternating dark and bright radial lines will be observed on the screen representing regions of constructive and destructive interference respectively.

For interference to occur there ought to be a coherent source i.e. a source that generates waves of the same frequency and wavelength, equal or comparable amplitudes and having a constant phase difference.
- Interference of sound waves can be investigated by the set up below:

X
$\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{1}}$
A
$\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{2}}$

Y
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-064.jpg?height=424&width=855&top_left_y=1523&top_left_x=375)

Two loudspeakers $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ connected to an audio-frequency generator act as a coherent source. To an observer walking along a straight path XY, alternating loud and soft sound is heard. Along the line AB , a constant loud sound will be heard.

The regions with loud sound represent areas of constructive interference while the regions with soft sound represent areas of destructive interference. When the frequency of the signal is increased, the separation between the alternating loud and soft sound is reduced i.e. more close. Note that for a signal of any velocity, the higher the frequency the shorter the wavelength.

If instead the loudspeakers are connected such that the waves generated by one loudspeaker are exactly out of phase with those from the other, then all points along XY will have destructive interference and hence soft sound is heard throughout.
- Interference of light waves- this can be demonstrated by the Young's double slit experiment. Two narrow and very close slits $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are placed infront of a monochromatic light source.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-065.jpg?height=575&width=975&top_left_y=268&top_left_x=146)

The light waves from the two slits undergo diffraction and superimpose as they spread out. A series of alternating bright and dark fringes are observed on the screen. The bright fringes are due to constructive interference while the dark fringes are due to destructive interference. However, along the central line through the centre of the slits and point 0 , it is bright throughout.

At 0 , the path difference of the two waves is zero since $S_{1} O=S_{2} O$. Moving upwards or downwards to the first bright fringe, the path difference is equivalent to one wavelength; i.e $\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{1}}-\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{1}} \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{1}}=\mathbf{1} \boldsymbol{\lambda}$

At $D_{1}$, the path difference is equivalent to half a wavelength;
$\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{D}_{1}-\mathrm{S}_{1} \mathrm{D}_{1}=1 / 2 \lambda$
Similarly, at the second bright fringe $\mathrm{B}_{2}$, the path difference is equivalent to two wavelengths; i.e $\mathbf{S}_{2} \mathbf{B}_{2}-\mathbf{S}_{1} \mathbf{B}_{2}=$ $2 \lambda$

And $\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{2}}-\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{1}} \mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{2}}=\mathbf{3 / 2} \boldsymbol{\lambda}$
Generally, at the $\mathrm{n}^{\text {th }}$ bright fringe, the path difference will be n times the wavelength;
$\mathbf{S}_{2} \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{n}}-\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{1}} \mathbf{B}_{\mathbf{n}}=\mathbf{n} \boldsymbol{\lambda}$
The wavelength of the light used can also be determined from the expression below: $\lambda=$ $\mathrm{xy} / \mathrm{d}$,

Where x - the slit separation, y - Distance between successive bright fringes and d- Perpendicular distance of the slits from the screen. 16.6: Stationary
waves verses progressive waves A progressive
wave is a wave that continuously moves away from
the source. When two progressive waves equal in amplitude and travelling in opposite directions
superpose on each other, the resultant wave is
referred to as a stationary or standing wave. It is a
common occurrence in stringed instruments. When
the string is plucked/played, a transverse wave
travels along the string and is reflected back on
reaching the other end of the string.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-066.jpg?height=324&width=904&top_left_y=651&top_left_x=150)

The points marked N are always at rest (zero displacement) and are called nodes while those marked A are where the wave has maximum amplitude (maximum displacement). They are called antinodes.

When two loudspeakers connected to the same audio-frequency generator are such that they face each other, then the two sound waves superpose to produce a stationary wave.

For two progressive waves to produce a stationary wave, the following conditions must be satisfied:
- They must be travelling in opposite directions.
- Must have same speed, frequency and same or nearly the same amplitudes.

The following table gives the comparison between a stationary and a progressive wave:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Stationary waves & Progressive waves \\
\hline Do not move through the medium hence does not transfer any energy from the source. & Move through the medium transferring energy from the source to a point away. \\
\hline The distance between successive nodes or antinodes is equal to $1 / 2 \lambda$. & The distance between successive crests or troughs is equal to the wavelength of the wave. \\
\hline The amplitudes of particles between successive nodes are different. & The amplitudes of any two particles which are in phase are the same. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{TOPIC 19: LINEAR MOTION}

\section*{19.1: Introduction}

The study of motion is divided into two areas namely kinematics and dynamics. Kinematics deals with the motion aspect only while dynamics deals with the motion and the forces associated with it.

There are three common types of motion:
+ Linear or translational motion.
+ Circular or rotational motion.
+ Oscillatory or vibrational motion.
In this topic, we concentrate on linear motion.

Note that all motion is relative i.e the state of a body; at rest or in motion, is ONLY true with respect to the observer's position.

\section*{19.2: Terms associated with linear motion}
(1) Distance- is the length of the path covered by a body. It only gives the magnitude but no direction i.e it is a scalar quantity.
O Displacement- is the distance through which a body travels in a specified direction. It is a vector quantity.

Both distance and displacement are measured in metres.
O Speed- is the distance covered per unit time.
Speed= distance/time.
- Velocity- is the rate of change of displacement.

Velocity= displacement/time.
It is a vector quantity.
When the rate of change of displacement is non-uniform, we talk about average velocity;
Average velocity= total displacement/total time.
Both speed and velocity are expressed in metre per second (m/s).
- Acceleration- is the rate of change of velocity.

Thus, Acceleration= change in velocity/time interval $=($ final velocity v - initial veolicity u $) /$ time.
Acceleration is measured in metre per square second ( $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ ).
If the velocity of a body decreases with time, its acceleration becomes negative. A negative acceleration is referred to as deceleration or retardation.

\section*{Example 19.1}
1. A body covers a distance of 10 m in 4 seconds, rests for 10 seconds and finally covers a distance of 90 m in 6seconds. Calculate its average speed.

Average speed $=$ total distance $/$ time $=(10 m+90 m) /(4 s+10 s+6 s)$
$=100 \mathrm{~m} / 20 \mathrm{~s}=5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
2. A body moves 30 m due east in 2 seconds, then 40 m due north in 4 seconds. Determine its: a) Average speed.

Average speed $=$ total distance $/$ time $=(30 m+40 m) /(2 s+4 s)$
$=70 \mathrm{~m} / 6 \mathrm{~s}=11.67 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
c) Average velocity.
d) Average velocity= total displacement/time $=50 \mathrm{~m} / 6 \mathrm{~s}$

3. A body is made to change its velocity from $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ to $36 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in 0.1 s . What is the acceleration produced?
$a=(v-u) / t=(36 m / s-20 m / s) / 0.1 s$
$=160 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.
4. A particle moving with a velocity of $200 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ is brought to rest in 0.02 s . What is the acceleration of the particle?
$\mathrm{a}=(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) / \mathrm{t}=(0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}-200 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}) / 0.02$
$=-200 / 0.02=-10,000 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

\section*{19.3: Motion graphs.}

There are two categories; displacement-time graphs and velocity time graphs.

\subsection*{19.3.1: Displacement-time graphs}

The slope of a displacement-time graph gives the velocity of the body.
The various displacement-time graphs are as illustrated below:
D B

Displacement
(m)

A
C

Time (s)

Graph A: the body is at rest i.e there is no change in displacement as time changes. The slope of the graph and hence the velocity is zero.

Graph B: the body moves with a uniform or constant velocity.
Graph C: the graph becomes steeper with time. The steeper the slope, the higher the velocity. Thus velocity of the body increases with time. The body is therefore accelerating.

Graph D: the graph becomes less and less steep with time i.e the body has a higher velocity at the beginning and decreases with time. Therefore, the body is said to be decelerating.
19.3.2: Velocity-time graphs

The slope of area under PLUS
a velocity-time graph gives the acceleration of the body. Note that the a velocity-time graph gives the distance covered by the body.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-068.jpg?height=318&width=386&top_left_y=2421&top_left_x=349)

The diagram below shows the possible velocity-time graphs:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-069.jpg?height=364&width=860&top_left_y=241&top_left_x=166)

Graph A: the velocity remains constant/uniform as time increases. The slope of the graph and hence the acceleration of the body is zero.

Graph B: the velocity changes uniformly with time. The body moves with a uniform/constant acceleration.
Graph C: the acceleration is lower where the graph is gentle and higher where the graph is steeper. Hence the acceleration of the body increases with time.

Graph D: in this case, the graph is steeper at the beginning and becomes gentle with time. Hence the acceleration of the body decreases with time.

\section*{19.4: Determination of velocity and acceleration}

Two methods are applicable here:
Method 1: Using appropriate instruments e.g a tape measure and a stop watch to measure the displacement of a body and the duration then applying the formula;

Velocity $=$ total displacement/time taken.
Method 2: Using a ticker-timer. It is used to measure velocity of a body specifically over short distances. It consists of an electronic vibrator which makes dots on a moving paper tape attached to the object whose velocity is being measured. The dots are made at a certain set frequency. For instance, a ticker-timer whose frequency is 50 Hz makes dots at intervals of 0.02 s . The time interval between successive dots is referred to as a tick.

The spacing between the dots depends on the manner in which the body is moving i.e moving at constant velocity or with increasing velocity or decreasing velocity. Generally, the dots are close together when the velocity is low and wide apart when the velocity is high. There are three possible patterns that can be obtained by a ticker-timer as illustrated below:
a) Moving at constant velocity.

The dots are equally or evenly spaced.
Direction of motion of the body

b) Moving with increasing velocity (accelerating).

The spacing between the dots is initially small but increases away.

\section*{Example 19.2}
1. A paper tape was attached to a moving trolley and allowed to run through a ticker-timer. The figure below shows a section of the tape.

A
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-070.jpg?height=115&width=1389&top_left_y=696&top_left_x=227)

If the frequency of the ticker-timer is 100 Hz , determine:
a) The velocity between $A B$ and $C D$.

1 tick $=1 / 100=0.01 \mathrm{~s}$
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{AB}} & =15 \mathrm{~cm} /\left(5 \text { ticks }^{*} 0.01 \mathrm{~s}\right)=15 \mathrm{~cm} / 0.05 \mathrm{~s} \\
& =300 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$
$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{CD}}=30 \mathrm{~cm} /(5$ ticks $* 0.01 \mathrm{~s})=30 \mathrm{~cm} / 0.05 \mathrm{~s}$
$$=600 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$$
b) The acceleration of the trolley.

Note that the velocities calculated in (a) above are average velocities and as such are taken to be the velocities at the midpoints of AB and CD respectively. Hence, the time taken for the change in velocity is the time between the midpoints of AB and CD .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-070.jpg?height=185&width=1397&top_left_y=1604&top_left_x=147)
$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{AB}} \Delta \mathrm{t}=10$ ticks* $0.01=0.10 \mathrm{~s}$

Therefore, acceleration $=\left(V_{C D}-V_{A B}\right) / \Delta t=(600-300) \mathrm{cms}^{-1} / 0.10 \mathrm{~s}=3000 \mathrm{cms}^{-2}$.

$\Delta \mathrm{t}=5$ ticks* $0.02 \mathrm{~s}=0.10 \mathrm{~s}$

Note that 1 tick $=1 / 50=0.02 \mathrm{~s}$.
Initial velocity $u=0.5 \mathrm{~cm} / 0.02 \mathrm{~s}=25 \mathrm{cms}^{-1}$

Final velocity $\mathrm{v}=2.5 \mathrm{~cm} / 0.02 \mathrm{~s}=125 \mathrm{cms}^{-1}$
Hence, acceleration $=(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) / \Delta \mathrm{t}=(125-25) \mathrm{cms}^{-1} / 0.10 \mathrm{~s}$
$$=1000 \mathrm{cms}^{-2}$$

\section*{19.5: Equations of linear motion}

There are three equations governing linear motion. Consider a body moving in a straight line from an initial velocity $u$ to a final velocity $v(u, v \neq 0)$ within a time $t$ as represented on the graph below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-071.jpg?height=499&width=833&top_left_y=645&top_left_x=147)

The slope of the graph represents the acceleration of the body;
Acceleration, $\mathrm{a}=(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) / \mathrm{t}$.
Therefore, $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at}$. i.

This is the first equation of linear motion.
The area under the graph (area of a trapezium) gives the displacement of the body.
Hence, displacement $s=1 / 2$ (sum of // sides)*perpendicular height between them. $s=$ $1 / 2(u+v) t$.

But v=u+at,
Therefore, $s=1 / 2\{u+(u+a t)\} t s=1 / 2(2 u+a t) t$
Hence, $s=u t+1 / 2 a t^{2}$ ii.

This is the second equation of linear motion.
Also, rearranging equation i , we have $\mathrm{t}=(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) / \mathrm{a}$. substituting this in equation ii, we obtain; $\mathrm{s}=\mathrm{ut}+1 / 2 \mathrm{at}{ }^{2}=\mathrm{u}\{(\mathrm{v}-$ $u) / a\}+1 / 2 a\{(v-u) / a\}^{2}$.

Hence, $v^{2}=u^{2}+2 a s$ iii.

This is the third equation of linear motion.
The three equations hold for any body moving with uniform acceleration.
Note that for a body which is retarding, the acceleration a is given a negative sign.

8 seconds. Calculate the displacement of the particle. $s=u t+1 / 2 a^{2}=(2 * 8)+\left(1 / 2 * 5^{*} 8^{2}\right)$ $=176 \mathrm{~m}$.
2. An object accelerates uniformly at $3 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$. It attains a velocity of $19 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in 5 seconds. a)

What was its initial velocity?
$v=u+a t u=19-(3 * 5)=19-15$

b) How far does it travel during this period?

3. A car travelling at $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ decelerates uniformly at $4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. In what time will it come to rest?
$\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}-\mathrm{at}$, (a is negative since the body is decelerating).
$0=20-4 \mathrm{t} \mathrm{t}=20 / 4$
$=5$ seconds.

\section*{19.6: Motions under the influence of gravity}

These include free fall, vertical projection and horizontal projection. The three equations of linear motion hold for motions under the influence of gravity.

\subsection*{19.6.1: Free fall}

A body falling freely in a vacuum starts from an initial velocity zero and accelerates at approximately $9.8 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$ towards the centre of the earth. This is called the acceleration due to gravity $\mathbf{g}$. In this case, the air resistance is assumed to be negligible. Note that in a vacuum, a feather and a stone released from the same height will take the same amount of time to reach the surface of the earth.

Therefore, in the three equations of linear motion $\mathrm{u}=0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{s}=\mathrm{h}$ and $\mathrm{a}=\mathrm{g}$. thus the three equations become:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{gt},(\text { from } \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at}) \\
& \mathrm{h}=1 / 2 \mathrm{gt}{ }^{2},\left(\text { from } \mathrm{s}=\mathrm{ut}+1 / 2 \mathrm{gt}{ }^{2}\right) \\
& \mathrm{v}^{2}=2 \mathrm{gh},\left(\text { from } \mathrm{v}^{2}=\mathrm{u}^{2}+2 \mathrm{as}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

From the above equations:
- $\quad v=(2 g h)^{1 / 2}$, where $v$ is the velocity of the body just before it hits the ground.
- $h=1 / 2 g t^{2}=v^{2} / 2 g$, where $h$ is the height through which the body falls.
- $\mathrm{t}=\mathrm{v} / \mathrm{g}=(2 \mathrm{~h} / \mathrm{g})^{1 / 2}$, where t is the time of flight.

\section*{Example 19.4}
1. A hammer falls from the top of a building 5 m high.
a) How long does it take to reach the ground? Take $g=10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$.
$h=1 / 2 g t^{2} 5=1 / 2 * 10 t^{2}$
$\mathrm{t}=1^{1 / 2}=1 \mathrm{~s}$
b) With what velocity does it strike the ground?
$\mathrm{v}=(2 \mathrm{gh})^{1 / 2}=\left(2 * 10^{*} 5\right)^{1 / 2}=10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

\subsection*{19.6.2: Vertical projection}

When a body is projected vertically upwards, it decelerates uniformly due to gravity until its velocity reduces to zero at maximum height. After attaining the maximum height, the body then falls back with an increasing velocity. The body must be given an initial velocity and attains a final velocity of zero at its maximum height. Note that the sign of ' g ' is negative for a vertical projection. This is because the body moves against gravity.

Hence the three equations of linear motion become:
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}-\mathrm{gt},(\text { from } \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at}) \\
& \mathrm{h}=\mathrm{ut}-1 / 2 \mathrm{gt}{ }^{2},\left(\text { from } \mathrm{s}=\mathrm{ut}+1 / 2 \mathrm{gt}{ }^{2}\right) \\
& \mathrm{v}^{2}=\mathrm{u}^{2}-2 \mathrm{gh},\left(\text { from } \mathrm{v}^{2}=\mathrm{u}^{2}-2 \mathrm{as}\right)
\end{aligned}$$

But at maximum height $\mathrm{h}_{\text {max }}, \mathrm{v}=0$. Thus, the three equations reduce to:
i. $g t=u$, ii. $h=u t-1 / 2 g t^{2}$ iii. $u^{2}=2 g h$.

From equation (i), the time taken to attain the maximum height is given by; $\mathrm{t}=\mathrm{u} / \mathrm{g}$.
Similarly, the initial velocity $u$ and the maximum height attained by the body $h_{\text {max }}$ can be expressed as:
$u=g t=\left(2 g h_{\max }\right)^{1 / 2}$
And $h_{\max }=u t-1 / 2 g t^{2}=u^{2} / 2 g$.
When the body finally falls back to its point of projection, the displacement of the body will be zero. Substituting this in equation (ii), we obtain;
$0=u t-1 / 2 g t^{2}$
Therefore, 0=t(2u-gt)
And $\mathrm{t}=0$ or $\mathrm{t}=2 \mathrm{u} / \mathrm{g}$, where $\mathrm{t}=0$ is the time at the start of the projection and,
72 | P a g e Â©PHYSICS
PLUS
t is this is the total time of flight i.e for both upward projection and fall back. Note that the total time of flight is twice the time taken to attain maximum height.
also, the velocity of the body just before hitting its point of projection as it falls back is the same in magnitude but in opposite direction to its initial velocity; v=-u.

\section*{Example 19.5}
1. A bullet is shot vertically upwards and rises to a maximum height of 1000 m . Calculate:
a) the initial velocity of the bullet, $u=\left(2 g h_{\max }\right)^{1 / 2}=\left(2 * 10^{*} 1000\right)^{1 / 2}=$
b) the total time of flight.
$\mathrm{t}=2 \mathrm{u} / \mathrm{g}=2$ *
2. An object is released to fall vertically from a height of 100 m . At the same time, another object is projected vertically upwards with a velocity of $40 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
a) Calculate the time taken before the two objects meet.

Let the time taken to meet be $t$. then, after a time $t$ the distance covered by the object moving downwards will be; $\mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{d}}=1 / 2 \mathrm{gt}^{2}$, (since $\mathrm{u}=0$ ).
$$=1 / 2^{*} 10 t^{2}=5 t^{2}$$

The distance covered by the object projected upwards after a time $t$ will be; $s_{u}=u t-1 / 2 g t^{2}=40 t-5 t^{2}$
But $\mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{d}}+\mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{u}}=100 \mathrm{~m}$
Therefore, $5 t^{2}+40 t-5 t^{2}=100 t=100 / 40=2.5 s$
b) At what height above the point of projection do they meet?
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{u}} & =\mathrm{ut}-1 / 2 \mathrm{gt}^{2}=\left(40^{*} 2.5\right)-\left(1 / 2 * 10^{*} 2.5^{2}\right) \\
& =68.75 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{19.6.3: Horizontal projection}

If two objects A and B at a point some height above the ground are such that A is allowed to fall freely (vertically downwards) while is B given a horizontal projection with an initial velocity $u$, then both objects take the same duration to reach the ground. This is because both are acted on by the same gravitational force. The object on the horizontal projection moves with a constant velocity $u$. hence, the horizontal acceleration of the object is zero. For the object falling freely, the acceleration is equivalent to ' $g$ ' and the initial velocity $u$ is zero. However, the object under horizontal projection will strike the ground some distance away from the point the other object strikes the ground. This horizontal distance covered by the object is referred to as the 'range $\mathbf{R}^{\prime}$.

Note that both A and B will strike the ground with the same velocity.

expressed as; $\mathrm{t}=\mathrm{u} / \mathrm{g}$.

\section*{Example 19.6}
1. A stone is thrown at a velocity of $30 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ to the horizontal by a girl at the top of a tree whose height is 30 m . Calculate:
a) the time taken for the stone to strike the ground.

Since both free fall and horizontal projection take the same duration;
$\mathrm{h}=1 / 2 \mathrm{gt}{ }^{2}$
$30=1 / 2 * 10 * t^{2} t=6^{1 / 2}$
=
b) the velocity at which the stone strikes the ground.
$\mathrm{u}=0$ (for free fall).
Therefore, $\mathrm{v}=(2 \mathrm{gh})^{1 / 2}=\left(2 * 10^{*} 30\right)^{1 / 2}$
$$=$$
2. A jet fighter on practice moving at a velocity of $100 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ released a bomb above the ground which hits the ground after 3s. Calculate:
a) the distance from the ground to the jet,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{h} & =1 / 2 \mathrm{gt}^{2}=1 / 2^{*} 10^{*} 3^{2} \\
& =45 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}$$
b) the horizontal distance from the target when the bomb is released.
$$\begin{aligned}

The frequency of oscillation increases with decrease in length of the string. A graph of $\mathrm{T}^{2}$ against length l is a straight line through the origin.

Generally, a graph of $\mathrm{T}^{2}$ against length for a simple pendulum satisfies the equation $\mathrm{T}^{2}=4 \pi^{2} \mathrm{l} / \mathrm{g}$.

\section*{NEWTON'S LAWS OF MOTION}

\section*{21.1: Introduction}

The laws governing the motion of a body are grouped into three. They are based on the effects of force on a body. Some of the effects of force on a body include:
- Force can make a stationary body to start moving.
- Can make a moving to stop.
- Can deform a body i.e. change its shape.
- Can change the direction of a moving body.
- Can change the speed of a moving body.

\section*{21.2: Newton's first law of motion}

The law states: a body remains in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This explains the following common observations:
- Passengers in a bus are pushed forward when brakes are applied suddenly or backwards when a bus at rest takes off suddenly. Hence the fitting of seatbelts in vehicles.
- A coin placed on a cardboard on top of a glass tumbler drops into the tumbler when the cardboard is pulled sideways.
- Athletes run past the finish line of a race before they finally stop.

These observations show that bodies have an in-built reluctance to changes in their state of motion or rest. The tendency of a body to resist change in its state of rest or motion is called inertia. Hence Newton's first law of motion is also referred to as the law of inertia.

\section*{21.3: Newton's second law}

This law states: the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the resultant external force acting on the body and takes place in the direction of the force.

Moment of a body is defined as the product of its mass and velocity. Since velocity is a vector quantity, momentum is also a vector quantity having both magnitude (size) and direction.

Momentum $\mathrm{P}=$ mass $\mathrm{m}^{*}$ velocity v

Hence the unit of momentum is the kilogram-metre per second (kgm/s). The direction of momentum is the same as that of the velocity. The change of momentum is therefore caused by a change in velocity.

Suppose the velocity of a body of mass $\mathbf{m}$ changes from an initial value $\mathbf{u}$ to a value $\mathbf{v}$ after a time $\mathbf{t}$, then:
The initial momentum $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}=\mathrm{mu}$
The final momentum $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{f}}=\mathrm{mv}$
The change in momentum= final momentum- initial momentum
Thus $\Delta \mathrm{P}=\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{f}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}=\mathrm{mv}-\mathrm{mu}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u})$
Therefore, the rate of change of momentum $=\Delta \mathrm{P} / \mathrm{t}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) / \mathrm{t}$.
From the equations of linear motion, $(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) / \mathrm{t}=$ acceleration $\mathbf{a}$
Hence $\Delta \mathrm{P} / \mathrm{t}=\mathrm{ma}$.
From the second law of motion, F $\alpha$ ma.
And so the force $\mathrm{F}=$ mass $\mathrm{m}^{*}$ acceleration a ( $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma}$ ).
Therefore, $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) / \mathrm{t}$ And
$\mathrm{Ft}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u})$.
The product of the force and time is called impulse. It is a vector quantity since force is a vector quantity. The unit of impulse is the newton-second(Ns). Impulse is also equal to the change in momentum(mv-mu). Hence impulse can also be expressed in kgm/s.

\section*{Example 21.1}
1. Two stones of mass 8 kg and 4 kg move with velocities $3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ respectively. Compare their momentum.
$$\begin{aligned}
& P_{8 \mathrm{~kg}}=m v=8 * 3=24 \mathrm{kgm} / \mathrm{s} \\
& P_{4 \mathrm{~kg}}=m v=4 * 6=24 \mathrm{kgm} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence they have the same momentum.
2. A ball of mass 35 g travelling horizontally at $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ strikes a barrier normally and rebounds with a speed of $16 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Find the impulse exerted on the ball.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Impulse }=\mathrm{Ft}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u})=\left(0.035^{*} 20\right)-\left(0.035^{*}-16\right) \\
& =1.26 \mathrm{Ns}
\end{aligned}$$

Note that the two speeds are in opposite directions.
3. A kick that lasts 0.03 s sends a ball of mass 0.65 kg with a velocity of $15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ northwards. Find: a) The change in momentum of the ball.

Note that the ball is initially at rest, i.e. $u=0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
$$\Delta \mathrm{P}=\mathrm{mv}-\mathrm{mu}=\left(0.65^{*} 15\right)-\left(0.65^{*} 0\right)=9.75 \mathrm{kgm} / \mathrm{s}$$

b) The average force exerted on the ball.
$$\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) / \mathrm{t}=(9.75 \mathrm{kgm} / \mathrm{s}) / 0.03 \mathrm{~s})=325 \mathrm{~N}$$
c) The displacement of the ball in 2 seconds.

The upward acceleration of the ball is negative $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.
$$\mathrm{S}=\mathrm{ut}+1 / 2 \mathrm{at}^{2}=\left(15^{*} 0.03\right)+\left(1 / 2^{*}-10^{*} 0.03^{2}\right)=10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$$

\section*{21.4: Newton's third law}

The law states: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. We look at the working of a lift in relation to the third law of motion in three situations:
a) When the lift is at rest.

This implies that the resultant force on the lift is zero i.e. action and reaction are equal in size. The force acting on the lift is the weight of the person standing in the lift. This is balanced by the reaction by the floor of the lift. Therefore, weight $\mathrm{mg}=-$ reaction R ,

Or simply; $\mathrm{mg}+\mathrm{R}=0$.

\section*{b) When the lift descends with an acceleration a}

For the lift to move downwards, the weight of the occupant must be greater than the reaction by the floor of the lift. Therefore, the resultant force pulling the lift downwards is equal to the difference between the weight mg and the reaction R ;

Resultant force $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{mg}-\mathrm{R}$.
From the second law of motion, the resultant force $F=m a$.
Therefore, $\mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{mg}-\mathrm{R}$.
And $\mathrm{R}=\mathrm{mg}-\mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{g}-\mathrm{a})$.

\section*{c) When the lift ascends with an acceleration a}

In this case, the reaction by the floor of the lift must be greater than the weight of the occupant. Hence, the resultant force $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{mg}$.

And $\mathrm{R}=\mathrm{ma}+\mathrm{mg}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{g})$.
The following are some cases where the third law of motion has been applied in everyday life:
- A balloon moves in an opposite direction when air in it is released.

- When a gun is fired, the bullet leaves the gun while the gun recoils backwards.
- For a person running or walking, one exerts a backward force on the ground with the ground exerting a forward push on the foot of the person. This makes running or walking possible.

\section*{Example 21.2}
1. A man of mass 75 kg stands on a weighing machine in a lift. Determine the reading on the weighing machine when the lift:
a) Ascends with an acceleration of $2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.
$\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{mg}$
$\left(75^{*} 2\right)=\mathrm{R}-\left(75^{*} 10\right)$

b) Descends at a constant velocity of $1.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. F $=$ ma $=$ mg - R

But $\mathrm{a}=0$ since the velocity is constant.
Therefore, $75^{*} 0=75^{*} 10-\mathrm{R}$
$\mathrm{R}=750 \mathrm{~N}$
c) Descends with an acceleration of $2.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.
$75^{*} 2.5=75^{*} 10-\mathrm{R}$
$\mathrm{R}=750-187.5=562.5 \mathrm{~N}$

$\Delta \mathrm{P}=\mathrm{mv}-\mathrm{mu}=1500(0-25)=-37500 \mathrm{kgm} / \mathrm{s}$.
$\mathrm{Ft}=\Delta \mathrm{P}$
We ignore the negative sign in this part because time is a scalar quantity.
$3000 * t=37500 t=37500 / 3000$
$=12.5$ seconds.

\section*{21.5: Collision and the law of conservation of momentum}

This body states that when two or more bodies collide, their total linear momentum before and after collision remain constant provided no external force acts on them;
i.e. momentum before collision= momentum after collision.

There are basically two types of collisions namely elastic and inelastic collision. a)

\section*{Elastic collision}

This is where the bodies move separate ways after collision. In this collision, not only linear momentum is conserved but also kinetic energy;
- Total linear momentum before collision= total linear momentum after momentum.
- Total kinetic energy before collision= total kinetic energy after collision. b) Inelastic collision

This is where the colliding bodies stick together and move as one body after collision. In this type of collision, it is only linear momentum which is conserved but not kinetic energy. This is because during this collision, some deformation takes place which eats up part of the energy while some is converted to heat, sound or light energy.
- Total linear momentum before collision= total linear momentum after collision.

\section*{Example 21.3}
1. A bullet of mass 20 g is shot from a gun of mass 20 kg with a muzzle velocity of $200 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. if the bullet is 30 cm long, determine:
a) The acceleration of the bullet. For the bullet: $u=0, v=200 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, s=0.3 \mathrm{~m}$ $v^{2}=u^{2}+2$ as $200^{2}=0+(2)(0.3 a) a=40000 / 0.6=6.667^{*} 10^{4} m / s^{2}$
b) The recoil velocity of the gun.

Total linear momentum before collision=total linear momentum after collision $\left(20^{*} 0\right)+\left(0.02^{*} 0\right)=\left(20^{*} \mathrm{v}\right)+\left(0.02^{*} 200\right) \mathrm{v}=-4 / 20=-0.2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
2. A 5 kg mass moving with a velocity of $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ collides with a 10 kg mass moving at $7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ along the same line. If the two masses join together on impact, find their common velocity if they were moving: a) In opposite directions.

Total linear momentum before collision=total linear momentum after collision
$\left(5^{*} 10\right)+\left(10^{*}-7\right)=(5+10) \mathrm{v}$
$15 v=-20 v=-20 / 15=-1.33 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ the bodies move in the
initial direction of the 10 kg mass.
b) In the same direction.

Total linear momentum before collision=total linear momentum after collision
$\left(5^{*} 10\right)+\left(10^{*} 7\right)=(5+10) \mathrm{v}$
$15 v=120 v=120 / 15$
$=8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$

b) The height through which the block rises.

At the maximum height, all the kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. k.e=p.e

$\mathrm{h}=0.05 \mathrm{~m}$

\section*{21.6: Friction}

This is a force acting between two surfaces in contact and tends to oppose the intended motion. Friction may be beneficial but can also be a nuisance.

\subsection*{21.6.1: Advantages of friction}
+ Makes walking, writing possible.
- Required for braking in cars, bicycles etc.
+ Makes rotation of the conveyor belts in factories possible.
+ Necessary for lighting matchsticks.
+ Useful when using nuts, bolts, screw jacks, vices etc.

\subsection*{21.6.2: Limitations of friction}
- A lot of energy is lost in the form of heat.
- Causes wear and tear on the pars of machines.
- May lead to noise pollution.

It is therefore important to minimize friction at all cost. This can be done through the following ways:
- Using rollers.
- Using ball bearings.
- Lubrication
- Air cushioning.

\subsection*{21.6.3: Factors affecting friction}

Frictional force is directly proportional to the normal reaction $R$;
F $\alpha$ R
Or simply F/R= a constant.
The constant is called coefficient of friction $\mu$. It is a measure of the nature of the surfaces in contact.
Hence, frictional force $\mathrm{F}=$ normal reaction $\mathrm{R}^{*}$ coefficient of friction $\mu$.
When the two bodies are at rest, then the coefficient of friction is referred to as coefficient of static friction while if they are in relative motion, it is called coefficient of kinetic friction. Coefficient of friction has no units.

Hence, friction depends on two factors:
1. The normal reaction $R$.
2. The nature of the surface. Frictional force is greater between rough surfaces than between smooth surfaces.

Note that frictional force is independent of the area of contact of the two surfaces and relative velocity of the bodies.

\section*{21.7: Viscosity}

Friction exerted by fluids is called viscosity or viscous drag. It is the force which opposes relative motion between layers of the fluid. Viscosity is caused by the forces of attraction between the molecules of the fluid. When a body is put in a fluid, three forces act on it, namely:
- Weight of the body which acts downwards.
- Upthrust due to the fluid which acts upwards.
- Viscous drag due to the fluid which acts upwards.

When the body enters the fluid, its weight is initially higher than the total upward forces i.e. upthrust plus viscous drag. The resultant force acting on the body accelerates it towards the bottom of the container. As the body sinks down, the viscous drag increases until the three forces balance i.e. W=U+F. at this point, the body attains its maximum constant velocity called terminal velocity. The resultant force on the body is therefore zero.

\section*{22.1: Work and Energy}

When a force acting on a body displaces the body in the direction of the force work is said to have been done. Work is the product of force and displacement in the direction of the force;

Workdone= force $\mathrm{F}^{*}$ displacement s .
The SI Unit of work is newton-metre (Nm).
1Nm= 1joule (1J).
A joule is defined as the workdone by a force of one newton to displace a body through one metre in the direction of the force.

Other multiples of the joule include kilojoule(kJ) and megajoule(MJ).
Energy on the hand is the ability or capacity to do work. Anything that possesses energy is capable of doing work. The SI Unit of energy is the joule. Energy has the following characteristics:
- It is not visible.
- Occupies no space.
- Has no mass nor any other physical property.

The most common sources of energy include the sun, wind, geothermal, waterfalls, nuclear or atomic energy, fuels etc.

Energy resources may be grouped into two:
${ }^{\text { }}$ Renewable energy- can be reused again and again. Their supplies are inexhaustible e.g solar, geothermal, wind energy.
${ }^{\text { }}$ Non-renewable energy- their supplies are exhaustible i.e. cannot be reused once exhausted e.g. wood, coal biogas, petroleum etc.

Energy exists in many forms such as mechanical, chemical, heat and electrical energy amongst others. In this topic, we will look at mechanical energy.

\subsection*{22.1.1: Mechanical energy}

It is divided into two areas namely kinetic energy and potential energy.

Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body in motion. Suppose a body of mass $m$ is moving with a constant velocity v , then its kinetic energy is given by;

Kinetic energy $=1 / 2\left(\mathrm{mv}^{2}\right)$.
Potential energy on the other hand is a form of stored energy in a body when it is in a particular state or position. A body in a raised position possesses gravitational potential energy given by;
P. $\mathbf{E g}_{\mathbf{g}}=\mathbf{m g h}$, where m - mass of the body, g - gravitational field strength and h - height above the ground.

Also, a stretched or compressed material is able to regain its original shape when released. This is because it possesses a type of potential energy known as elastic potential energy. As can be recalled from Hooke's law, the workdone in stretching or compressing an elastic material is given by;
$\mathrm{W}=1 / 2(\mathrm{Fe})=1 / 2\left(\mathrm{ke}^{2}\right)$.
Hence the elastic potential energy is given by; $\mathbf{P} . \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{e}}=\mathbf{1} / \mathbf{2}(\mathbf{F e})$
$=1 / 2\left(\mathrm{ke}^{2}\right)$.

\subsection*{22.1.2: The law of conservation of energy}

The law states: energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can be transformed from one form to another.
Alternative statement: the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of a system is a constant.
Below is the energy transformation in a hydroelectric power station:

\section*{Example 22.1}
1. A force of 40 N is applied on a body. The body moves a horizontal distance of 7 m . Calculate the workdone on the body.
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{W} & =\mathrm{F}^{*} \mathrm{~s}=40 \mathrm{~N}^{*} 7 \mathrm{~m} \\
& =280 \mathrm{Nm} \text { or } 280 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}$$
2. A box of mass 30 kg is pushed up an inclined plane of length 14 m using a force of 130 N as shown below:

If the track is inclined at an angle of $20^{\circ}$, calculate:
```
84 | P a g e Â©PHYSICS
PLUS
```
a) The height of the platform. Sin $20^{\circ}=\mathrm{h} / 14 \mathrm{~h}=14 \sin 20^{\circ}=$
b) Workdone by the force of 130 N .
$\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{F}^{*} \mathrm{~s}=130^{*} 14=1820 \mathrm{~J}$
c) Workdone, if the box is lifted vertically upwards. Compare your answer in (b) and (c) above.
$\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{mgh}=300 \sin 20^{\circ}=$
Workdone in pushing the body along the inclined plane is greater than the workdone when lifting the body vertically upwards. This is because of the frictional force between the body and the inclined plane.
d) The frictional force between the box and the inclined plane.
$\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{r}}=1820-300 \sin 20^{\circ}=$
3. A crane is used to lift a body of mass 30 kg through a vertical distance of 6.0 m .
a) How much work is done on the body?
$\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{F}^{*} \mathrm{~s}=(\mathrm{mg}) \mathrm{s}=300^{*} 6=1800 \mathrm{~J}$
b) What is the potential energy stored in the body?
P.E $=$ mgh $=30^{*} 10^{*} 6=1800$ J
c) Comment on the two answers above.

Workdone on the body is equal to the potential energy stored in the body. Hence the workdone against gravity is stored as the potential energy.
4. A spring of spring constant $25 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}$ is stretched such that its length increases from 10 cm to 20 cm . calculate the amount of workdone on stretching the spring.
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{W} & =1 / 2\left(\mathrm{ke}^{2}\right)=1 / 2(25)\left(0.1^{2}\right) \\
& =0.125 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}$$
5. A body of mass 12 kg is pulled from the rest with a constant force of 25 N . The force is applied for 6.0 s . Calculate:
a) The distance travelled. $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma} \mathrm{a}=25 \mathrm{~N} / 12 \mathrm{~kg}=2.1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}, \mathrm{u}=0, \mathrm{t}=6$
$\mathrm{s}=\mathrm{ut}+1 / 2 \mathrm{at}^{2}=\left(0^{*} 6\right)+1 / 2(2.1)\left(6^{2}\right)=37.8 \mathrm{~m}$
b) Workdone on the body.
$\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{F}^{*} \mathrm{~s}=25^{*} 37.8=945 \mathrm{~J}$
c) The final kinetic energy of the body.
K.E=workdone=945J
d) The final velocity of the body. K.E=1/2(mv2)=945J v=\{(2*945)/12 $\}^{1 / 2}=$ $12.6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

\section*{22.2: Power}

Power is defined as the rate of doing work;
Power=workdone/time.
The SI Unit of power is the watt (W).
$1 \mathrm{~W}=1 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{s}$.
Other multiples of the watt include the kilowatt(kW) and megawatt(MW);
$1 \mathrm{~W}=10^{-3} \mathrm{~kW}$
$1 \mathrm{~W}=10^{-6} \mathrm{MW}$
The power of a device is the measure of how fast the device can perform a given task or convert a given amount of energy. For example, a device rated 1 kW converts 1000J of energy to another form in one second.

Power=workdone/time $=\mathrm{Fd} / \mathrm{t}$.
But $\mathrm{d} / \mathrm{t}=$ velocity v .
Therefore, power= force F*velocity v.

\section*{Example 22.2}
1. A person of mass 60 kg climbs 16 m up a rope in 20 seconds. Find the average power developed by the person.

Power=workdone/time $=\left(600^{*} 16\right) / 20=480 \mathrm{~W}$
2. A person of mass 40 kg runs up a flight of 50 stairs each of height 20 cm in 5 seconds. Calculate: a) The workdone.
$\mathrm{W}=\mathrm{mgh}=40^{*} 10^{*}\left(50^{*} 0.2\right)=4000 \mathrm{~J}$
b) The average power of the person.

Power $=4000 \mathrm{~J} / 5 \mathrm{~s}=800 \mathrm{~W}$
c) Explain why the energy the person actually uses to climb up is greater than the calculated workdone.

\section*{22.3: Machines}

A machine is a device that makes work easier. In a machine, a force applied at one point of a system is used to generate another force at a different point of the system to overcome a load. The following terms are used in machines:
a) Effort- the force applied to the machine.
b) Load- the force exerted by the machine.
```
86 | P a g e Â©PHYSICS
PLUS
```
c) Mechanical advantage (M.A)- the ratio of the load to effort. M.A=Load/Effort.

It has no units.
It is dependent on friction between the moving parts and the weight of the parts of the machine that have to be lifted when operating the machine; the greater the friction the smaller the mechanical advantage.
d) Velocity ratio (V.R)- it is defined as the ratio of the velocity of the effort to the velocity of the load;
$\mathbf{V} . \mathbf{R}=$ velocity of effort/velocity of load $=$ Effort distance/time

Load distance/time
Thus V.R=effort distance/load distance.
Velocity ratio also has no units.
e) Efficiency $\mathbf{\eta}$

It is the ratio of the workdone on the load (work output) to the workdone by the effort (work input) expressed as a percentage;

Efficiency $\eta=($ work output/work input $) * 100$.
Efficiency also depends on the friction between the moving parts and the weight of the moveable parts. Hence the efficiency of a machine is always less than $100 \%$.

Efficiency=work output/work input= (load*load distance)/ (effort*effort distance)
$=($ load $/$ effort $) *($ load distance $/$ effort distance $)$
But load/effort =mechanical advantage (M.A), And,
load distance/effort distance $=1 /$ velocity ratio
Therefore, efficiency $\eta=(\text { M.A/V.R })^{*} 100$.

\section*{Example 22.3}
1. A machine requires 6000 J of energy to lift a mass of 55kg through a vertical distance of 8m. Calculate its efficiency.

Work input $=6000 \mathrm{~J}$
Work output $=\mathrm{F}^{*} \mathrm{~s}=55^{*} 10^{*} 8=4400 \mathrm{~J}$
Efficiency $=($ work output/work input $) * 100=(4400 / 6000) * 100=73.33 \%$
2. An effort of 250 N raises a load of 900 N through 5 m in a machine. If the effort moves through 25 m , find: a) The useful workdone in raising the load.

Useful workdone=load*load distance $=900 * 5=4500 \mathrm{~J}$
b) The workdone by the effort.

Workdone by the effort= effort*effort distance=250*25=6250J
c) The efficiency of the machine.

Efficiency $=($ work ouput/work input $) * 100=(4500 / 6250)^{*} 100=72 \%$.
3. A machine whose velocity ratio is 8 is used to lift a load of 300 N . The effort required is 60 N . calculate: a) The mechanical advantage of the machine.
M.A= load/effort =300/60 =5
b) The efficiency of the machine.
$$\text { Efficiency }=(\text { M.A/V.R })^{*} 100=(5 / 8)^{*} 100=62.5 \%$$

\section*{22.4: Types of machines}

Below are some of the common machines:

\subsection*{22.4.1: Inclined plane}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-089.jpg?height=451&width=659&top_left_y=948&top_left_x=153)

The distance moved by the effort is L while the vertical height moved by the load is h .
Also, $\sin \theta=\mathrm{h} / \mathrm{L}$
Or simply $\mathrm{h}=\mathrm{L} \sin \theta$
Therefore, velocity ratio (V.R) $=$ effort distance/ load distance $=\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{L} \sin \theta$.
Hence V.R= $1 / \sin \theta$.

\section*{Example 22.4}
1. A man uses an inclined plane to lift a 81 kg mass through a vertical height of 4.0 m . Given that the angle of inclination of the plane is $30^{\circ}$ and its efficiency is $75 \%$, determine:
a) The effort needed to move the load up the inclined plane at a constant velocity.
$V \cdot R=1 / \sin 30=2$
Therefore, (M.A/2)*100=75
M.A $=(2 * 75) / 100=3 / 2$
$3 / 2=810 \mathrm{~N} /$ effort
Effort $=\left(810^{*} 2\right) / 3=540 \mathrm{~N}$
b) The workdone against friction in raising the mass through the height of 4.0 m .

Work input=effort*effort distance $=\left(540^{*} 4\right) / \sin 30=4320 \mathrm{~J}$
Work output=load*load distance $=81^{*} 10^{*} 4=3240 \mathrm{~J}$
Therefore, workdone against friction= 4320-3240=1180J

\subsection*{22.4.2: A screw and bolt}

For a screw, when the effort applied on the head moves through a complete revolution, the screw advances by a distance equivalent to one pitch. A pitch is the distance between two successive threads.
d

Pitch
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-090.jpg?height=383&width=223&top_left_y=1017&top_left_x=631)

Distance moved by the effort $=$ circumference $=\pi \mathrm{d}$
Distance moved by the load= one pitch
Hence, velocity ratio (V.R)= circumference/pitch $=\pi \mathrm{d} /$ pitch .
For the bolt, effort is applied at the free end of the spanner.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-090.jpg?height=473&width=716&top_left_y=1750&top_left_x=146)

Therefore, the distance moved by the effort in one revolution= circumference $=2 \pi \mathrm{R}$.
Hence, V.R= circumference/pitch $=2 \pi \mathrm{R} /$ pitch.

Note that a combination of a screw and lever can be used as a jack for fitting heavy loads e.g car jack. When two or more systems are combined together, the overall velocity ratio is the product of the individual velocity ratios; Combined V.R= V.R1*V.R2* $\qquad$ *V. $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{k}}$

\section*{Example 22.5}
1. The figure below shows a screw jack whose screw has a pitch of 1 mm and has a handle of 25 cm long. 25 cm
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-091.jpg?height=389&width=535&top_left_y=597&top_left_x=535)

Determine the velocity ratio of the jack.
V.R $=2 \pi \mathrm{r} /$ pitch $=2 \pi(25 \mathrm{~cm}) / 0.1 \mathrm{~cm}=1571$

\subsection*{22.4.3: Lever system}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-091.jpg?height=272&width=752&top_left_y=1284&top_left_x=150)

The velocity ratio of a lever system is the ratio of the effort arm to the load arm; V.R= Effort arm/ Load arm.

\subsection*{22.4.4: Gears}

A gear is a wheel with equally spaced teeth or cogs around it. The wheel on which the effort is applied is called the driving (input) gear while the load gear is referred to as the driven (output) gear. Suppose the driving gear has $\mathbf{n}$ teeth and the driven gearN teeth, then when the driving gear makes one complete revolution the driven gear makes $\mathbf{n} / \mathbf{N}$ revolutions.
V.R of the system $=\quad$ Number of revolutions made by the effort (driving) gear

Number of revolutions made by the load (driven) gear. V.R
= 1revolution =N/n
$\mathrm{n} / \mathrm{N}$ revolutions
```
90 | P a g e Â©PHYSICS
PLUS
```

Hence, velocity ratio of a gear system is the ratio of the number of teeth of the driven gear to the number of teeth of the driving gear;
V.R $=$ Number of teeth of the driven gear

Number of teeth of the driving gear

\section*{Example 22.6}
1. A driving gear having 25teeth engages with a second gear with 100teeth. A third gear with 30 teeth on the same shaft as the second one engages with a fourth gear having 60teeth. Find:
a) The total velocity ratio of the system.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-092.jpg?height=285&width=741&top_left_y=828&top_left_x=378)

Combined V.R=V.R1*V.R2
V. $\mathrm{R}_{1}=$ No. of teeth of driven gear/ No. of teeth of driving gear
$$=100 / 25=4$$
V. $R_{2}=60 / 30=2$

Hence, V.R=4*2=8
b) The mechanical advantage of the system if its efficiency is $85 \%$.

Efficiency $=($ M.A/8 $) * 100=85$
M.A $=\left(85^{*} 8\right) / 100=6.8$

\subsection*{22.4.5: Pulleys}

A pulley is a wheel with a groove to accommodate a string or rope. There are three possible systems of pulleys namely single fixed, single moveable and a block and tackle.
a) Single fixed pulley

E
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-092.jpg?height=340&width=207&top_left_y=2085&top_left_x=417)

In this arrangement, both the effort and load move through the same distance. Hence the velocity ratio of the system is one.

\section*{b) Single moveable pulley}

E
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-093.jpg?height=378&width=237&top_left_y=342&top_left_x=348)

The load is supported by two sections of the string. If the load is pulled upwards through a distance of 1 m , each section of the string also moves through 1 m . Hence the effort moves through a total distance of 2 m .

Therefore, the velocity ratio of the system $=$ effort distance/load distance $=2 \mathrm{~m} / 1 \mathrm{~m}=2 . \mathbf{c}$ )

\section*{A block and tackle}

This system comprises two sets; one set fixed and the other moveable. A single string is then passed around each pulley in turn. The arrangement can take several forms depending on the desired velocity ratio. Below is an example:

E

In this case, there are four sections of the string supporting the load. Hence, when the load moves upwards through a distance of 1 m , each section of the string also shortens by 1 m . Therefore, the total distance moved by the effort (string) is 4 m .

Thus, V.R of the system= effort distance/load distance $=4 \mathrm{~m} / 1 \mathrm{~m}=4$. Coincidentally, the velocity ratio of the system is the same as the number of sections of the string supporting the load.

Generally, the velocity ratio of a block and tackle system is given by the number of sections of the string supporting the load.

Practically, the efficiency of any pulley system is less than $100 \%$. This is as a result of two reasons:
- The friction between the moveable parts.
- The weight of the parts that have to be lifted when operating the system.

\section*{Example 22.7}
1. The figure below shows a pulley system used to raise a load.
a) State the velocity ratio of the system.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-094.jpg?height=541&width=220&top_left_y=163&top_left_x=188)
V. $R=$ number of strings supporting the load $=6$
b) If an effort of 1000 N is needed to raise a load of 4500 N , determine the efficiency of the system.
M.A= load/effort= $4500 \mathrm{~N} / 1000 \mathrm{~N}=4.5$

Efficiency $=(\text { M.A/V.R })^{*} 100=(4.5 / 6) * 100=75 \%$
c) Calculate the wasted energy if a mass of 500 kg is lifted up through a height of 2 m using the same system.

Work ouput= load*load distance $=500 * 10 * 2=10000 \mathrm{~J}$
Efficiency= (work output/work input)*100
Therefore, (10000J/work input)*100=75
Work input $=\left(10000^{*} 100\right) / 75=13333.33 \mathrm{~J}$
Wasted energy= 13333.33-10000=3333.33J
Alternatively, wasted energy=25\% of work input= $(25 / 100) * 13333.33 \mathrm{~J}=3333.33$ 22.6:

\section*{Hydraulic machine}

Consider the diagram below:
$\mathrm{d}_{1}$
de

When the effort is applied as shown, the volume of the liquid leaving the effort arm is the same as the volume of the liquid entering the load arm;
i.e. $a^{*} d_{e}=A^{*} d_{l}, \mathbf{d}_{e} / \mathbf{d}_{l}=$

A/a
Therefore, the velocity ratio of a hydraulic system is the ratio of the area of the load piston to the area of the effort piston. If the pistons are circular then;
V. $\mathrm{R}=$ area of load piston/area of effort piston $=\pi \mathrm{R}^{2} / \pi \mathrm{r}^{2}$
$\mathrm{V} .=\mathrm{R}^{2} / \mathrm{r}^{2}$, where R - is the radius of the load piston and r - is the radius of the effort piston.

\section*{Example 22.8}
1. In the figure below $x=30 \mathrm{~cm}, y=6 \mathrm{~cm}$, effort $E=60 \mathrm{~N}, A_{1}=4 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and $A_{2}=12 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-094.jpg?height=318&width=1873&top_left_y=2432&top_left_x=145)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-095.jpg?height=419&width=891&top_left_y=178&top_left_x=254)

Calculate:
a) The force F exerted on the liquid at $\mathrm{A}_{1}$.

By the principle of moments;
$60 \mathrm{~N} * 30 \mathrm{~cm}=\mathrm{F}^{*} 6 \mathrm{~cm}$
$\mathrm{F}=\left(60^{*} 30\right) / 6=300 \mathrm{~N}$
b) The velocity ratio of the system.
V.R of the lever system= effort arm/load arm $=30 \mathrm{~cm} / 6 \mathrm{~cm}=5$
V.R of the hydraulic system $=$ area of load piston/area of effort piston $=12 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} / 4 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}=3$

Therefore, the combined V.R=5*3= 15
c) The maximum load that can be raised by the system.

Pressure at $\mathrm{A}_{1}=$ Pressure at $\mathrm{A}_{2}$
$300 \mathrm{~N} / 4 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}=\mathrm{L} / 12 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$
$\mathrm{L}=\left(300^{*} 12\right) / 4=900 \mathrm{~N}$.

\section*{22.7: Wheel and axle}

It consists of a large wheel of radius $R$ attached to an axle of radius $r$.

Wheel
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-095.jpg?height=413&width=1073&top_left_y=1813&top_left_x=345)

Note that in this case, both the wheel and axle make the same number of revolutions at any time;
Thus, in one revolution the distance moved by the effort $=2 \pi R$,
And the distance moved by the load $=2 \pi$.
Hence, the velocity ratio of the system $=2 \pi R / 2 \pi r=R / r$.
```
94 | P a g e Â©PHYSICS

```

Thus the velocity ratio of a wheel and axle is the ratio of the radius of the wheel to the radius of the axle.

\section*{Example 22.9}
1. A wheel and axle is used to raise a load of 140 N by a force of 20 N applied to the brim of the wheel. If the radii of the wheel and axle are 70 cm and 5 cm respectively, calculate the mechanical advantage, velocity ratio and efficiency of the system.
M.A= load/effort $=140 \mathrm{~N} / 20 \mathrm{~N}=7$
V. $R=$ radius of the wheel/radius of the axle $=70 \mathrm{~cm} / 5 \mathrm{~cm}=14$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Efficiency } & =(\text { M.A/V.R })^{*} 100 \\
& =(7 / 14)^{*} 100=50 \%
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{22.8: Pulley belt}

This is where one wheel is used to drive another wheel by means of a belt.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-096.jpg?height=225&width=1129&top_left_y=950&top_left_x=143)

The driving wheel covers a distance $2 \pi \mathrm{R}$ in one revolution while the driven wheel covers a distance $2 \pi \mathrm{r}$ in one revolution. If the driving wheel makes one revolution, the driven wheel makes $2 \pi R / 2 \pi r(R / r)$ revolutions.
V.R of the system= Number of revolutions made by the effort (driving) wheel

Number of revolutions made by the load (driven) wheel
V. $\mathrm{R}=1 /(\mathrm{R} / \mathrm{r})=\mathrm{r} / \mathrm{R}$

Therefore, the velocity ratio of a pulley belt is the ratio of the radius of the driven (load) wheel to the radius of the driving (effort) wheel.

\section*{TOPIC 24: QUANTITY OF HEAT}

This is the quantity of heat energy required to raise the temperature of a given mass of substance by one Kelvin.

The SI Unit of specific heat capacity is joules per kilogram per Kelvin ( $\mathrm{JKg}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ ).
Note that $\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{C} / \mathbf{m}$
Therefore heat capacity, $C=$ mass, $m$ * specific heat capacity, $c$.

\section*{Determination of the specific heat capacity}

\section*{By the method of mixtures}

\section*{a) S.h.c of solids}

In this method, a known mass of a solid, e.g. a metal block is heated by dipping it in a bath of hot water. After some time, the solid is very fast transferred into cold water in a calorimeter and whose mass is known.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-098.jpg?height=605&width=1890&top_left_y=1473&top_left_x=128)

The calorimeter is then covered using a piece of cardboard and stirred continuously. The following measurements are then recorded:
- Mass of the solid metal block, $\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{s}}$
- Mass of copper calorimeter with the stirrer, $\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{c}}$
- Mass of the calorimeter and stirrer + water, $\mathrm{m}_{1}$
- Temperature of the boiling water (initial temperature of the metal block), $\theta_{s}$
- Temperature of cold water in the calorimeter (initial temperature of calorimeter), $\theta_{w}$
- Final steady temperature of the mixture, $\theta$

\section*{Calculation}

Mass of the water in the calorimeter $=\mathrm{m}_{1}-\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{c}}=\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{w}}$
Temperature change of the hot metal block $=\theta_{s}-\theta$
Temperature change of the water in the calorimeter and the calorimeter $=\theta-\theta_{\mathrm{w}}$
Assuming there is no heat loss to the surrounding when the metal block is being transferred into the cold water and thereafter;

Amount of heat lost by the metal block = amount of heat gained by calorimeter with stirrer + amount of heat gained by water in the calorimeter.
i.e. $m_{s} c_{s}\left(\theta_{s}-\theta\right)=m_{c} c_{c}\left(\theta-\theta_{w}\right)+m_{w} c_{w}\left(\theta-\theta_{w}\right)$
wherec $_{\text {s }}-$ s.h.c. of the metal block
$\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{c}}-$ s.h.c. of the copper calorimeter $\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{w}}-$
s.h.c. of water.

Hence s.h.c. of the metal block, $c_{s}=\left[m_{c} c_{c}(\theta-\theta w)+m_{w} c_{w}\left(\theta-\theta_{w}\right)\right] / m_{s}\left(\theta_{s}-\theta\right)$ b)

\section*{S.h.c. of a liquid}

In this case, a solid of known s.h.c. is used and the water in the calorimeter is replaced with the liquid whose s.h.c. is to be determined. The solid metallic block is first heated in a bath of boiling water and then transferred into the calorimeter containing the liquid. The following measurements are then collected:
- Mass of the metal block, $\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{s}}$
- Mass of the calorimeter with stirrer, $\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{c}}$
- Mass of the calorimeter, stirrer and the liquid, $\mathrm{m}_{1}$
- Initial temperature of the metal block, $\theta_{\mathrm{s}}$
- Initial temperature of the liquid, $\theta_{1}$
- Final steady temperature of the mixture, $\theta$

If the there is no heat loss to the surrounding, then the quantity of heat lost by the metal block equals the quantity of heat gained by the calorimeter with stirrer and the liquid.
i.e. $m_{s} c_{s}\left(\theta_{s}-\theta\right)=\left[m_{c} c_{c}\left(\theta-\theta_{l}\right)+m_{l} c_{l}\left(\theta-\theta_{l}\right)\right]$

Hence $c_{\mathrm{l}}=\left[m_{\mathrm{c}} c_{\mathrm{s}}\left(\theta_{\mathrm{s}}-\theta\right)-m_{\mathrm{c}} c_{\mathrm{c}}\left(\theta-\theta_{\mathrm{l}}\right)\right] / m_{\mathrm{l}}\left(\theta-\theta_{\mathrm{l}}\right)$
Alternatively the s.h.c. of a liquid can be obtained by mixing it with another liquid whose specific heat capacity is known and their common temperature determined.

The following precautions must be taken to minimize heat losses to the surroundings:
- Using a highly polished calorimeter
- Heavily lag the calorimeter
- Using a lid of poor thermal conductivity

\section*{Electrical method}

\section*{a) Specific heat capacity of a solid}

In this method, two holes are drilled in the solid to accommodate the heater and thermometer. The solid is heated electrically for a given time. Below is an arrangement that can be used:

In this method, the following data is recorded:
- Mass of the metal (solid)
- Heater voltage, V
- Heater current, I
- Time (duration) of heating, t
- Initial temperature of the solid
- Final temperature of the solid

The electrical energy lost by the heater is given by; $\mathrm{E}=\mathrm{VIt}$
Suppose there is no heat loss to the surroundings, then the heat lost by the heater equal heat gained the solid. i.e.
VIt $=$ mc $\Delta \theta$
Hence $\mathrm{c}=\mathrm{VIt} / \mathrm{m} \Delta \theta$

\section*{Note}

Heat loss is minimized by lagging the calorimeter as well as oiling the holes. Specific

The heat lost by the heater equal the heat gained by the liquid and the calorimeter.

\section*{24.3: CHANGE OF STATE}

When ice is heated say from $-10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ until it boils, it undergoes changes which can be represented by the heating curve below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-103.jpg?height=516&width=946&top_left_y=1954&top_left_x=145)

Between the points AB , ice absorbs heat energy and its temperature rises. Between BC , the ice absorbs its latent heat of fusion which it uses to melt. This change of state occurs at a constant temperature. Between CD water absorbs heat energy as its temperature rises until boiling point. As the water boils at constant temperature, it absorbs its latent heat of vaporization.

When the vapour condenses to liquid, it gives out its latent heat of vaporization. Similarly, when a liquid freezes to solid, it gives out its latent heat of fusion.

\section*{Note:}

Latent heat of fusion- it is the quantity of heat needed to convert a given mass of a solid to liquid at constant temperature.

Specific latent heat of fusion- it is the quantity of heat needed to convert a unit mass of a solid to liquid at constant temperature. i.e. $\mathbf{l}_{\mathrm{f}}=\mathbf{Q} / \mathbf{m}$

\section*{Therefore $\mathbf{Q}=\mathbf{m l}_{\mathbf{f}}$}

The SI unit of the specific latent heat of fusion is the joule per kilogram ( $\mathrm{JKg}^{-1}$ ). A unit mass of a substance changing from liquid to solid will give out heat energy equivalent to its specific latent heat of fusion.

\subsection*{24.3.1: Determination of specific latent heat of fusion.}

There are two methods used:

\section*{Mixture method}

A piece of dry ice is dropped into a calorimeter containing water slightly above room temperature. Stir the mixture until all the ice has melted. Suppose there is no heat loss to the surroundings, then the heat energy lost by the water and calorimeter equals the heat energy gained by the melting ice
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-104.jpg?height=538&width=998&top_left_y=1834&top_left_x=146)

In the above experiment, the following data is recorded for purposes of determining the specific latent heat of fusion:
-Mass of the dry ice
-mass of the water in the calorimeter
-mass of the calorimeter plus stirrer
-Temperature change of the water
Hence $\operatorname{mc} \Delta \theta_{\mathrm{w}}+\operatorname{mc} \Delta \theta_{\mathrm{c}}=\operatorname{ml}_{\mathrm{f}}$
$\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{f}}=\left(\mathrm{mc} \Delta \theta_{\mathrm{w}}+\mathrm{mc} \Delta \theta_{\mathrm{c}}\right) / \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{i}}$
NoteDry ice is used due to its low moisture content. This implies that all the heat absorbed by the ice is used to melt the ice and not warming the moisture.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-105.jpg?height=507&width=1078&top_left_y=994&top_left_x=145)

Equal amounts of crushed ice are put simultaneously in two identical filter funnels. A heater is then immersed in the funnel in set up P. Place clean dry beakers below each funnel. Wait until a reasonable amount of water has collected in the beaker $\mathbf{P}$ then switch off the heater and remove the beakers. Weigh the beakers and their contents.

In the above experiment, the following data is collected:
- Mass of the beaker under $\mathbf{P}$ before experiment, $\mathrm{m}_{1}$
- Mass of the beaker under P after the experiment, $m_{2}$
- Mass of beaker under $\mathbf{Q}$ before experiment, $m_{3}$
- Mass of beaker under Q after experiment, $\mathrm{m}_{4}$
- Heater voltage, V
- Heater current, I
- Duration of heating, t

\section*{Calculations}

Mass of melted ice in set up $\mathbf{P}, \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{p}}=\mathrm{m}_{2}-\mathrm{m}_{1}$
Mass of melted ice in set up $\mathbf{Q}, \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{q}}=\mathrm{m}_{4}-\mathrm{m}_{3}$
Set up $\mathbf{Q}$ is called the control experiment. It helps to determine the mass of ice that melted as a result of the temperature of the room during the experiment. In order to obtain the mass of ice melted by the heater only, it is important to subtract the mass of melted ice in Q from that melted in P; i.e. $m=m_{p}-m_{q}$.

Then, heat energy supplied by the heater = heat energy absorbed by the melting ice.
VIt $=\mathrm{ml}_{\mathrm{f}}$
Hence $\mathrm{l}_{\mathrm{f}}=\mathrm{VIt} / \mathrm{m}$
The table below gives some common solids and their specific latent heats of fusion:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Material & s.l.h of fusion (*10 ${ }^{5}$ ) JKg ${ }^{-1}$ \\
\hline Copper & 4.0 \\

Take s.h.c.of water $=4200 \mathrm{JKg}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ and the s.l.h. of fusion of ice $=340,000 \mathrm{JKg}^{-1}$. Heat lost by the hot water $=$ heat gained by melting ice + heat gained by melted ice $\mathrm{mc} \Delta \theta_{\mathrm{h}}=\mathrm{ml}_{\mathrm{f}}+\mathrm{mc} \Delta \theta_{\mathrm{m}}$

3. An aluminium tray of mass 400 g containing 300 g of water is placed in a refrigerator. After 80 minutes, the tray is removed and it is found that 60 g of water remains unfrozen at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. If the initial temperature of the

Take s.h.c of aluminium $=900 \mathrm{JKg}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$, s.h.c of water $=4200 \mathrm{JKg}-1 \mathrm{~K}-1$, s.l.h. of fusion of ice $=$ $3.4^{*} 105 \mathrm{JKg}^{-1}$.

Heat lost by tray $=\operatorname{mc} \Delta \theta=0.4^{*} 900^{*}(20-0)=7200 \mathrm{~J}$
Heat lost by water $=\operatorname{mc} \Delta \theta=0.3 * 4200^{*} 20=25,200 \mathrm{~J}$

\section*{Procedure}
1. Set up the apparatus as shown above.
2. Find the mass of the calorimeter when empty and when filled with water to the level shown.
3. Measure and record the initial temperature of water in the calorimeter.
4. Heat the water in the flask until it delivers steam through the delivery tube. Ensure that the free end of the delivery tube is inside water in the calorimeter.
5. Allow steam to bubble into the water while stirring until the temperature of water rises by about 200C above the room temperature.
6. Remove the delivery tube from the calorimeter and record the temperature of the water.
7. Determine the new mass of the calorimeter and its contents. Hence, determine the mass of the condensed steam.

Note
Steam first condenses to water which then cools down, losing heat energy.
Therefore, heat energy lost by steam and the cooling water equal to the heat energy gained by the water and calorimeter.
$\mathrm{ml}_{\mathrm{v}}+\mathrm{mc} \Delta \theta_{\mathrm{h}}=\mathrm{mc} \Delta \theta_{\mathrm{w}}+\mathrm{mc} \Delta \theta_{\mathrm{c}}$
$\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{v}}=\left(\mathrm{mc} \Delta \theta \mathrm{w}+\mathrm{mc} \Delta \theta_{\mathrm{c}}-\mathrm{mc} \Delta \theta_{\mathrm{h}}\right) / \mathrm{m}$
It is important to first cool the water in the calorimeter to a certain value below the room temperature and then pass the steam through it until the temperature rises above the room temperature by the same value. This will help minimize errors due to the heat loss to the surrounding.

The heating process is allowed to continue until a steady state where condensed water drips out at a constant rate has been achieved. The mass of water collected after a time, $t$ is measured. The following data is collected in this experiment:
- Heater current, I
- Heater voltage, V
- Mass of empty beaker
- Mass of beaker and collected water
- Time taken to collect the condensed water

Suppose all the heat given by the heater is used to convert water to steam, then:
VIt $=\mathrm{ml}_{\mathrm{V}}$
Hence, $\mathrm{l}_{\mathrm{v}}=\mathrm{VIt} / \mathrm{m}$

Increase in pressure lowers the melting point of a material. This can be illustrated by suspending two weights supported by a copper wire on the surface of an ice block as shown below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-110.jpg?height=483&width=1492&top_left_y=1805&top_left_x=151) the copper wire to exert pressure on the ice directly underneath which is made to melt at a temperature below its melting point. As the wire cuts through, the water formed flows over the wire and immediately solidifies since it is no longer under pressure. As the water solidifies, it gives out its latent heat of fusion which is conducted by the copper wire to melt the ice below it. This continues until the copper wire completely cuts through the ice leaving it intact.

Note that copper wire has been used due to its high thermal conductivity. If a poor thermal conductor like cotton string was used, it would not cut through the ice block.

The process by which water refreezes is referred to as regelation.
The effects of high pressure on the melting point are applicable in ice skating and joining two pieces of ice blocks together. The weight of the skater acts on the thin blades of the skates exerting high pressure on the ice. The ice underneath thus melts, forming a thin film of water over which the skater slides.

When two ice cubes are pressed hard against each, the high pressure between them lowers the melting point of the ice at the point of contact. When the pressing force is withdrawn, water recondenses and the two cubes are joined together.
2. The presence of impurities lowers the melting point of a material. This is the reason behind spreading salt on roads and paths during winter in cold regions. This will prevent freezing on the roads. Boiling

Generally:
-The presence of impurities in a liquid raises the boiling point of the liquid.
-An increase in pressure raises the boiling point of the liquid.
The effects of pressure on boiling point may be illustrated by the set ups below: Effects
of increased pressure on boiling point

The heating is done until water starts to boil. The temperature at which water boils is noted. When the rubber tube issuing steam is squeezed momentarily, the reading on the thermometer is observed to rise and boiling reduces. Note that closing the tube raises the vapour pressure within the flask. This makes it difficult for the molecules from the surface of the liquid to escape, raising the boiling point of the liquid.

The effect of high pressure on boiling point is applied in a pressure cooker. Here the pressure is raised which raises the boiling point of water hence the food is cooked at a higher temperature. Effects of reduced pressure on boiling point

Water is first heated to tooling. The flask is then turned upside down and cold water poured over it. It would be Cold water

observed that when heating stops, boiling also stops. When cold water is poured over the flask, the water inside the flask begins boiling again although its temperature is below the boiling point.

The cold water condenses the steam reducing vapour pressure inside in the flask. Hence a decrease in pressure lowers the boiling point of a liquid.

\section*{24.5: Boiling and Evaporation}

When a liquid is heated, the molecules close to the surface may gain sufficient kinetic energy to break away from the forces of attraction between the neighboring molecules and escape. This is called evaporation. Evaporation takes place at any temperature, even below the boiling point of the liquid.

\section*{Factors affecting rate of evaporation}

\section*{a) Temperature}

Increase in temperature of the liquid enhances evaporation. This is why clothes dry faster on a hot day. b)

\section*{Surface area}

When the surface area is increased, the molecules of the liquid have greater chance of escaping. Hence a wet cloth would dry faster when it is spread out than when it is folded. c) Humidity

When there is high amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, it becomes difficult for the molecules to escape. This is why clothes take longer to dry on a humid day.

\section*{d) Draught/moving wind}

Moving air above the surface of the liquid sweeps away the escaping molecules. Thus evaporation is enhanced by the passing air.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOILING AND EVAPORATION
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Evaporation & Boiling \\
\hline Occurs at all temperatures & Occurs at a fixed temperature \\
\hline Occurs at the surface of the liquid & Takes place throughout the liquid \\
\hline No bubbles are formed & Bubbles are formed in the liquid \\
\hline Decrease in atmospheric pressure increases the rate of evaporation & Decrease in atmospheric pressure lowers the boiling point of the liquid \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Evaporation has a cooling effect which is applied in sweating in human beings and animals, cooling of water in porous pots and the refrigerator.

When water evaporates, it absorbs the latent heat from the body causing a cooling effect. Different animals have different ways by which they cool their bodies. For instance, dogs expose their tongues when it is hot while the muzzle of a cow becomes more wet when it is hot. Both these are to increase the rate of evaporation thereby cooling the body.

A porous pot has tiny holes which allow water to seep out slowly. As the water evaporates, it absorbs the latent heat causing a cooling effect.

\section*{TOPIC 25: GAS LAWS}

Gas laws looks at the relationship between temperature, volume and pressure of gases.

\section*{25.1: Boyle's law}

In this law, temperature of the gas is kept constant. Boyle's law states: the pressure of a fixed mass of a gas is inversely proportional to the volume, provided temperature is constant.

P $\alpha 1 / \mathrm{V}$
$\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{k} / \mathrm{V}$
$\mathrm{PV}=$ constant.
The following set up can be used to illustrate Boyle's law:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-114.jpg?height=638&width=809&top_left_y=841&top_left_x=243)

When pressure is exerted on the oil, the trapped gas (usually air) is compressed and the column h reduces. The pressure is measured using the pressure gauge. Since the cross-section area of the glass tube is uniform, the column h can be taken to represent the volume of the trapped gas (air).

Several values of pressure, P and volume, h are collected and recorded.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Pressure, P (Pa) & Volume, h(cm) & $1 / \mathrm{v}$ (or 1/h m-1) & PV \\
\hline & & & \\
\hline & & & \\
\hline & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A graph of pressure against volume is a curve as shown in (a) below:

P

A graph of P against $1 / \mathrm{V}$ is a straight line through the origin as shown in (b) above while a graph of PV against P is a straight line parallel to the x -axis. If the experiment is repeated at different temperatures, similar curves to the above will be obtained. This isshownbelow:

Hence for a given mass of a gas, $\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{~V}_{1}=\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{~V}_{2}$

\section*{Molecular explanation of Boyle's law}

When a gas is put in a closed container, the gas molecules collide with walls of the container generating gas pressure. When the volume of the fixed mass of gas is reduced, the number of collisions per unit time and therefore the rate of change of momentum will increase. Consequently the gas pressure is raised. Hence a reduction in volume leads to an increase in the gas pressure.

\section*{Example 25.1}
1. A gas occupies a volume of $1.6 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ at a pressure of $1.5 * 10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$. find the volume it will occupy at a pressure of $3.0 * 10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ if the temperature is kept constant.
$\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{~V}_{1}=\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{~V}_{2}$
$V_{2}=\left(1.5^{*} 10^{5} * 1.6^{*} 10^{-6}\right) /\left(3.0^{*} 10^{5}\right)=8.0^{*} 10^{-7} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ or $0.8 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
2. A column of air 26 cm long is trapped by mercury thread 5 cm long as shown in (a) below. When the tube is inverted as shown in (b), the air column becomes 30 cm long. What is the value of the atmospheric pressure?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-116.jpg?height=416&width=1288&top_left_y=166&top_left_x=153)
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { In (a), the gas pressure }=\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Atm}}+\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{~g} \\
& \text { In (b), the gas pressure }=\mathrm{PAtm}-\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{~g}
\end{aligned}$$

Let the atmospheric pressure be x metres of mercury.
From Boyle's law, $\mathrm{P} 1 \mathrm{~V} 1=\mathrm{P} 2 \mathrm{~V} 2$
$(\mathrm{x}+0.05) \rho \mathrm{g}^{*} 0.26=(\mathrm{x}-0.05) \rho \mathrm{g}^{*} 0.3$
$0.26 x+0.013=0.3 x-0.015$
$0.04 \mathrm{x}=0.028$
$\mathrm{X}=0.028 / 0.04$
$=0.7 \mathrm{~m}$ (or 70 cm )
Hence the atmospheric pressure $=70 \mathrm{cmHg}$.
3. The table below shows the results obtained in an experiment to study the variations of the volume of a fixed mass of a gas with pressure at constant temperature:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Pressure, P(cmHg) & 60 & $\ldots \ldots$ & 90 & $\ldots \ldots$ \\
\hline Volume, $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ & 36 & 80 & $\ldots \ldots$ & 40 \\
\hline

\section*{Charles' law}

This law looks at the relationship between temperature and volume of a given mass of gas at constant pressure. It is obvious that when a gas is heated it expands i.e. increases in volume. The law states: the volume of a fixed mass of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature provided the pressure is kept constant. i.e. V $\alpha$ T

V $=\mathrm{kT}$ or V/T = Constant
The set-up below can be used to verify Charles' law:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-117.jpg?height=698&width=819&top_left_y=177&top_left_x=146)

When the gas (trapped air) is heated in a water bath, it increases in volume. This is showed by an increase in the column h of the trapped air. Thus an increase in temperature of the gas causes an increase in its volume.

A graph of volume against absolute temperature appears as shown below:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-117.jpg?height=351&width=725&top_left_y=1115&top_left_x=258)

If the graph is extrapolated, it cuts the x-axis at $-273^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. at this temperature, the gas is assumed to have a volume equals to zero. This is the lowest temperature a gas can ever fall to and is called the absolute zero. A temperature scale based on the absolute zero is referred to as the absolute or Kelvin scale. On this scale, the temperature must be expressed in Kelvin.

For a given mass of a gas, $\mathrm{V}_{1} / \mathrm{T}_{1}=\mathrm{V}_{2} / \mathrm{T}_{2}$
This equation ONLY holds when the temperature is expressed in Kelvin.

\section*{Molecular explanation of Charles' law}

When the temperature of a gas is increased, its molecules gain kinetic energy and move faster. This increases the rate of collision with walls of the container and hence increased pressure. However, since in Charles' law,
pressure must be constant, the volume of the container must be increased accordingly so that the gas molecules can cover larger distance before colliding with the walls of the container. This would keep the gas pressure constant although its temperature is raised.

\section*{Example 25.2}
1. A gas occupies a volume of $125 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ at $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 755 mmHg pressure. Find the volume of the gas at a temperature of $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ if the pressure is constant.
$$\begin{aligned}
& V_{1} / T_{1}=V_{2} / T_{2} \\
& 125 /(15+273)=V_{2} /(25+273) \\
& V_{2}=(125 * 298) / 288=129.34 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} .
\end{aligned}$$
2. To what temperature must $2000 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of a gas at $27{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ be heated at a constant pressure in order to raise its volume to $2500 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ ? $\mathrm{V}_{1} / \mathrm{T}_{1}=\mathrm{V}_{2} / \mathrm{T}_{2}$
$\mathrm{T}_{2}=\left(2500^{*} 300\right) / 2000=375 \mathrm{~K}$ or $102^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\section*{25.3: Pressure law}

Raising the temperature of a fixed mass of a gas at a constant volume increases the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules. Pressure law states: the pressure of a fixed mass of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at a constant volume;
$\mathrm{P} \alpha \mathrm{T} \mathrm{P}=\mathrm{kT}$ or $\mathrm{P} / \mathrm{T}=\mathrm{k}$
Thus at constant volume, $\mathrm{P}_{1} / \mathrm{T}_{1}=\mathrm{P}_{2} / \mathrm{T}_{2}$

Several values of temperature and the corresponding pressures can be collected and used to plot a graph of pressure against absolute temperature. The graph will appear as shown below:

\section*{Example 25.3}
1. A tin closed with an airtight lid contains air at a pressure of $1.0^{*} 10^{5} \mathrm{~Pa}$ at a temperature of $12^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. If the temperature at which the lid opens is $88^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, determine the pressure attained by the gas.
$$\begin{aligned}
& P_{1} / T_{1}=P_{2} / T_{2} \\
& P_{2}=\left[1.0^{*} 10^{5} * 361\right] / 285=126,666.67 \mathrm{~Pa}
\end{aligned}$$

The three laws combined can be expressed as; $\mathrm{PV} / \mathrm{T}=$ constant, k Or simply
$\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{~V}_{1} / \mathrm{T}_{1}=\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{~V}_{2} / \mathrm{T}_{2}$
The above equation is referred to as the equation of state. In general for a fixed mass of a gas, $\mathrm{PV} / \mathrm{T}=\mathrm{a}$ constant. If 1 mole of the gas is used, then;
$P V / T=R$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant.

1. A gas occupies a volume of $200 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 760 mmHg . Find its new volume at $-23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 750 mmHg . $\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{~V}_{1} / \mathrm{T}_{1}=$ $\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{~V}_{2} / \mathrm{T}_{2}$
$\mathrm{V}_{2}=\left[\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{~V}_{1} \mathrm{~T}_{2}\right] / \mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{~T}_{1}=[760 * 200 * 250] /[750 * 298]=170 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
