                        <p>The study of motion is divided into two areas namely kinematics and dynamics. Kinematics deals with the motion aspect only while dynamics deals with the motion and the forces associated with it.</p>

                        <p>There are three common types of motion:</p>

                        <p>In this topic, we concentrate on linear motion.</p>

                        <p>Note that all motion is relative i.e the state of a body; at rest or in motion, is ONLY true with respect to the observer's position.</p>

                        <h3>19.2: Terms associated with linear motion</h3>
                        <p>(1) <dfn>Distance</dfn>- is the length of the path covered by a body. It only gives the magnitude but no direction i.e it is a scalar quantity. O <dfn>Displacement</dfn>- is the distance through which a body travels in a specified direction. It is a vector quantity.</p>

                        <p>Both distance and displacement are measured in metres. O <dfn>Speed</dfn>- is the distance covered per unit time. Speed= distance/time. - <dfn>Velocity</dfn>- is the rate of change of displacement. Velocity= displacement/time. It is a vector quantity. When the rate of change of displacement is non-uniform, we talk about <dfn>average velocity</dfn>; Average velocity= total displacement/total time. Both speed and velocity are expressed in metre per second (m/s).</p>
                        <p>- <dfn>Acceleration</dfn>- is the rate of change of velocity. Thus, Acceleration= change in velocity/time interval $=($ final velocity v - initial veolicity u $) /$ time. Acceleration is measured in metre per square second ( $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ ). If the velocity of a body decreases with time, its acceleration becomes negative. A negative acceleration is referred to as deceleration or retardation.</p>

                        <h4>Example 19.1</h4>
                        <p>1. A body covers a distance of 10 m in 4 seconds, rests for 10 seconds and finally covers a distance of 90 m in 6seconds. Calculate its average speed.</p>

                        <p>Average speed $=$ total distance $/$ time $=(10m+90m) /(4s+10s+6s)$</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$=100 \mathrm{~m} / 20 \mathrm{~s}=5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} .$$
                        </div>
                        <p>2. A body moves 30 m due east in 2 seconds, then 40 m due north in 4 seconds. Determine its: a) Average speed. 40m</p>

                            $$=70 \mathrm{~m} / 6 \mathrm{~s}=11.67 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} .$$
                        </div>
                        <p>c) Average velocity. d) Average velocity= total displacement/time $=50 \mathrm{~m} / 6 \mathrm{~s}$</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>3. A body is made to change its velocity from $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ to $36 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in 0.1 s . What is the acceleration produced? $a=(v-u) / t=(36 m / s-20 m / s) / 0.1 s$</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$=160 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2} .$$

                        <p>4. A particle moving with a velocity of $200 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ is brought to rest in 0.02 s . What is the acceleration of the particle? $\mathrm{a}=(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) / \mathrm{t}=(0 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}-200 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s})/0.02$ $=-200/0.02=-10,000 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}^{2}$.</p>

                        <h3>19.3: Motion graphs.</h3>
                        <p>There are two categories; displacement-time graphs and velocity time graphs. The slope of a displacement-time graph gives the velocity of the body. The various displacement-time graphs are as illustrated below: D B</p>

                        <p>Displacement (m) A C Time (s)</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-068-1.jpg" alt="Displacement-time graphs illustrating different types of motion" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>Graph A: the body is at rest i.e there is no change in displacement as time changes. The slope of the graph and hence the velocity is zero. Graph B: the body moves with a uniform or constant velocity. Graph C: the graph becomes steeper with time. The steeper the slope, the higher the velocity. Thus velocity of the body increases with time. The body is therefore accelerating. Graph D: the graph becomes less and less steep with time i.e the body has a higher velocity at the beginning and decreases with time. Therefore, the body is said to be decelerating.</p>
                        <h3>19.3.2: Velocity-time graphs</h3>

                        <p>The slope of area under a velocity-time graph gives the acceleration of the body. Note that the a velocity-time graph gives the distance covered by the body.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-068-2.jpg" alt="Simple velocity-time graph" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>The diagram below shows the possible velocity-time graphs:</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-069-1.jpg" alt="Velocity-time graphs illustrating different types of motion" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>Graph A: the velocity remains constant/uniform as time increases. The slope of the graph and hence the acceleration of the body is zero. Graph B: the velocity changes uniformly with time. The body moves with a uniform/constant acceleration. Graph C: the acceleration is lower where the graph is gentle and higher where the graph is steeper. Hence the acceleration of the body increases with time. Graph D: in this case, the graph is steeper at the beginning and becomes gentle with time. Hence the acceleration of the body decreases with time.</p>

                        <h3>19.4: Determination of velocity and acceleration</h3>
                        <p>Two methods are applicable here: Method 1: Using appropriate instruments e.g a tape measure and a stop watch to measure the displacement of a body and the duration then applying the formula; Velocity $=$ total displacement/time taken. Method 2: Using a ticker-timer. It is used to measure velocity of a body specifically over short distances. It consists of an electronic vibrator which makes dots on a moving paper tape attached to the object whose velocity is being measured. The dots are made at a certain set frequency. For instance, a ticker-timer whose frequency is 50 Hz makes dots at intervals of 0.02 s . The time interval between successive dots is referred to as a tick. The spacing between the dots depends on the manner in which the body is moving i.e moving at constant velocity or with increasing velocity or decreasing velocity. Generally, the dots are close together when the velocity is low and wide apart when the velocity is high. There are three possible patterns that can be obtained by a ticker-timer as illustrated below:</p>
                        <p>a) Moving at constant velocity. The dots are equally or evenly spaced. Direction of motion of the body</p>

                         </div>
                        <p>b) Moving with increasing velocity (accelerating). The spacing between the dots is initially small but increases away. Direction of motion of the body</p>

                        <p>c) Moving with decreasing velocity (decelerating). The spacing between the dots is initially large but decreases away. Direction of motion of the body</p>

                        <h3>19.5: Equations of linear motion</h3>
                        <p>There are three equations governing linear motion. Consider a body moving in a straight line from an initial velocity $u$ to a final velocity $v(u, v \neq 0)$ within a time $t$ as represented on the graph below:</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-071-1.jpg" alt="Velocity-time graph for uniform acceleration" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>The slope of the graph represents the acceleration of the body; Acceleration, $\mathrm{a}=(v-u)/ t$. Therefore, $v=u+at$. i. This is the first equation of linear motion. The area under the graph (area of a trapezium) gives the displacement of the body. Hence, displacement $s=1/2$ (sum of // sides)*perpendicular height between them. $s=$ $1/2(u+v)t$. But v=u+at, Therefore, $s=1/2\{u+(u+at)\}t s=1/2(2u+at)t$ Hence, $s=ut+1/2 at^{2}$ ii. This is the second equation of linear motion. Also, rearranging equation i , we have $t=(v-u)/ a$. substituting this in equation ii, we obtain; $s=ut+1/2 at^{2}=u\{(v- u)/a\}+1/2 a\{(v-u)/a\}^{2}$. $s=u(v-u)/a+a(v-u)^{2}/2a^{2}=u(v-u)/a+(v-u)^{2}/2a s=$ $\{2u(v-u)+(v-u)^{2}\}/2a=\{2uv-2u^{2}+v^{2}+u^{2}-2uv\}/2a s=$ $\{v^{2}-u^{2}\}/2a$</p>

                        <p>2as $=v^{2}-u^{2}$ Hence, $v^{2}=u^{2}+2as$ iii. This is the third equation of linear motion. The three equations hold for any body moving with uniform acceleration. Note that for a body which is retarding, the acceleration a is given a negative sign.</p>

                        <p>When a body is projected vertically upwards, it decelerates uniformly due to gravity until its velocity reduces to zero at maximum height. After attaining the maximum height, the body then falls back with an increasing velocity. The body must be given an initial velocity and attains a final velocity of zero at its maximum height. Note that the sign of ' g ' is negative for a vertical projection. This is because the body moves against gravity. Hence the three equations of linear motion become:</p>

                        <p>But at maximum height $\mathrm{h}_{\text{max}}, \mathrm{v}=0$. Thus, the three equations reduce to: i. $gt=u$, ii. $h=ut-1/2 g t^{2}$ iii. $u^{2}=2gh$. From equation (i), the time taken to attain the maximum height is given by; $\mathrm{t}=\mathrm{u}/ \mathrm{g}$. Similarly, the initial velocity $u$ and the maximum height attained by the body $h_{\text{max}}$ can be expressed as: $u=gt=\left(2gh_{\max}\right)^{1/2}$ And $h_{\max}=ut-1/2 gt^{2}=u^{2}/2g$. When the body finally falls back to its point of projection, the displacement of the body will be zero. Substituting this in equation (ii), we obtain; $0=ut-1/2 g t^{2}$ Therefore, 0=t(2u-gt) And $\mathrm{t}=0$ or $\mathrm{t}=2\mathrm{u}/\mathrm{g}$, where $\mathrm{t}=0$ is the time at the start of the projection and, t is this is the total time of flight i.e for both upward projection and fall back. Note that the total time of flight is twice the time taken to attain maximum height. also, the velocity of the body just before hitting its point of projection as it falls back is the same in magnitude but in opposite direction to its initial velocity; v=-u.</p>

This is because both are acted on by the same gravitational force. The object on the horizontal projection moves with a constant velocity $u$. hence, the horizontal acceleration of the object is zero. For the object falling freely, the acceleration is equivalent to ' $g$ ' and the initial velocity $u$ is zero. However, the object under horizontal projection will strike the ground some distance away from the point the other object strikes the ground. This horizontal distance covered by the object is referred to as the <dfn>range</dfn> $\mathbf{R}$.</p>

                        <p>Note that both A and B will strike the ground with the same velocity.</p>

                        <p>Observations and conclusion The frequency of oscillation increases with decrease in length of the string. A graph of $\mathrm{T}^{2}$ against length l is a straight line through the origin. Generally, a graph of $\mathrm{T}^{2}$ against length l for a simple pendulum satisfies the equation $\mathrm{T}^{2}=4\pi^{2} \mathrm{l}/ \mathrm{g}$. Hence, the slope of the graph above is equals to $4\pi^{2} /g$.</p>
