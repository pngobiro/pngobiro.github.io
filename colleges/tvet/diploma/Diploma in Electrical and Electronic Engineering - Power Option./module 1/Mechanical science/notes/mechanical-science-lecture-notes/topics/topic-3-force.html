                        <p>Force is represented by a straight line with an arrow, which shows the direction in which it acts. One newton is the force which gives a mass of 1 kg an acceleration of $1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.</p>

                        <h3>3.2: Types of force</h3>
                        <p>Force can be categorized in two ways. These are:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">As either a push or a pull</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">As either contact or non-contact force</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Contact forces are those forces between bodies which are in contact e.g. action and reaction, viscous drag, friction etc. Non-contact forces act between bodies at a distance e.g. gravitational force, magnetic force, electrostatic force etc.</p>

                        <p>Below are some common types of forces:</p>

                        <h3>3.2.1: Gravitational force</h3>
                        <p>It is the force that attracts all objects towards the centre of the earth. It is unique in every planet. The earth's gravitational force is that force of attraction between the earth and the body. The pull of gravity on a body towards the centre of the earth is called its weight. Weight varies from place to place although its mass remains constant.</p>

                        <p>The weight of a body is the product of its mass and the gravitational force acting on the body i.e. weight = mass *gravitational force.</p>

                        <h3>3.2.2: Tension</h3>
                        <p>When a string is stretched or compressed at both of its ends, it experiences a force called tension. A stretched or compressed material will tend to regain its original shape when the stretching or compressing force is withdrawn. Materials that do not break after stretching or compression is said to be elastic.</p>

                        <h3>3.2.3: Upthrust</h3>
                        <p>When an object is immersed in a fluid (liquid/gas), there is always an opposite upward force acting on it. This is called upthrust force.</p>

                        <p>NB. There is no upthrust force in a vacuum.</p>

                        <h3>3.2.4: Friction force</h3>
                        <p>This is the force that tends to oppose the motion of one object over another when they are in contact. Friction force is useful in many ways for instance during walking, writing, applying brakes, lighting a match stick, etc. Friction in fluids is called viscous drag or simply viscosity.</p>

                        <h3>3.2.5: Magnetic force</h3>
                        <p>A magnet can either attract or repel a magnetic material. This force of attraction or repulsion is called magnetic force. Materials that are not affected by a magnet are said to be non-magnetic materials.</p>

                        <h3>3.2.6: Electrostatic force</h3>
                        <p>This is the force of attraction or repulsion between static charges. Like charges repel while unlike charges attract. Electrostatic force is evident in the following cases:</p>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>All these are as a result of attraction between the formed charges and the opposite charges.</p>

                        <h3>3.2.7: Centripetal force</h3>
                        <p>This is the force that constraints a body to maintain a circular path as it move. It is usually directed towards the centre of the circle.</p>

                        <h3>3.2.8: Action and reaction</h3>
                        <p>Action and reaction are equal and opposite forces. When a block of wood rests on a table its weight is exerted on the table. This is action force. The table on the other hand exerts an equal upward force on the block of wood. This is reaction force and it prevents the block from sinking down below the table.</p>

                        <h3>3.2.9: Cohesive and adhesive force</h3>
                        <p>Cohesive force is the force of attraction between molecules of the same kind e.g. force between water molecules. Adhesive force is the force of attraction between molecules of different kinds e.g. force between water molecule and the surface of glass.</p>

                        <p>For instance when a molecule of water is put on a clean glass surface, the water spreads on (wets) the glass surface. This is because there is greater adhesive force between water and glass molecule than the cohesive force between the water molecules. However, when the glass surface is waxed, the water forms spherical balls. This is because for a waxed surface, the adhesive force between water and glass is lower than the cohesive force between water molecules.</p>

                        <p>Mercury on the other hand will form spherical balls both on a clean and waxed glass surface. This is because cohesive force between mercury molecules is greater than adhesive force between mercury and glass molecules. Waxing the glass surface in this case even lowers the adhesive force further.</p>

                        <p>Cohesive and adhesive force can be used to explain the meniscus of water and mercury in a glass tube.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Water</p>
                        <p>Fig. (i)</p>
                        <p>Mercury</p>
                        <p>Fig. (ii)</p>

                        <p>In fig (i), greater adhesive force between glass and water makes water to rise up the narrow glass tube by capillary action so that as many water molecules as possible can be in contact with glass. Hence the meniscus of water curves downwards. The narrower the glass tube the higher the level of water.</p>

                        <p>In fig (ii), cohesive force between the mercury molecules is greater than the adhesive force between mercury and glass. Mercury thus sinks down the tube so that its molecules can stick together. Hence the meniscus of mercury curves upwards from the glass surface. The narrower the tube, the lower the level of mercury in the tube.</p>

                        <h3>3.2.10: Surface tension</h3>
                        <p>The cohesive force between the molecules of a liquid gives it some strength. The surface can thus resist stretching. Surface tension is the force that makes the surface of the liquid to behave like a fully stretched elastic skin.</p>

                        <p>Surface tension allows light insects to rest over water without sinking. a steel razor blade or needle floats on water if placed carefully but sinks when soap solution or kerosene is placed around it. Also if one end of the needle is pressed into the water, it breaks the surface tension and the needle sinks.</p>

                        <h4>Molecular explanation of surface tension</h4>
                        <p>Consider two molecules, A and B shown below:</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-018-3.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating forces on molecules within and at the surface of a liquid" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>A molecule A deep in the water is surrounded by other molecules from all sides. The net force on this molecule is thus zero i.e. the forces cancel out. A molecule B at the surface has fewer molecules on the upper part. The inward resultant force on B thus causes the surface of water to be under tension.</p>

                        <p>Note:</p>

                        <p>Different liquids have different strengths of surface tension.</p>

                        <h3>3.3: Factors affecting surface tension</h3>
                        <h4>3.3.1: Temperature</h4>
                        <p>When the temperature of a liquid is increased the kinetic energy of its molecules is also increased. The intermolecular distance increases lowering the cohesive force between the liquid molecules. Consequently the surface tension of the liquid is reduced.</p>

                        <h4>3.3.2: Impurities</h4>
                        <p>The presence of impurities in a liquid lowers its surface tension. Examples of impurities include kerosene and detergents like soap solution.</p>

                        <h3>3.4: Mass and weight</h3>
                        <p>Mass is defined as the quantity of matter in a substance. Weight on the other hand is the pull of gravity on an object. Weight of a body depends on the mass of the body and the gravitational field strength at the place. The earth is flatter at the poles such that the distance between the centre of the earth and the poles is shorter than the radius of the earth at the equator. This implies that the force of attraction between the surface of the earth and its centre is greater at the poles than at the equator. Hence a body will weigh more at the poles than at the equator.</p>

                        <p>The table below summarizes the differences between mass and weight:</p>

                        <h3>3.5: Measurement of force</h3>
                        <p>The most common instrument for measuring force is the spring balance. It uses the principle of extension when there is a stretching force. Some spring balances are calibrated in newtons ( N ) while others are calibrated in kilogram or even gram. In the latter case, it is advisable to convert the kg or g into newtons.</p>

                        <p>Two or more spring balances can be assembled to act as one spring balance. When the springs are joined in series, the combined extension will be the sum of the individual spring extension.</p>

                        <p>However, when they are connected in parallel, the springs will share the load. The combined extension therefore will be the extension of one spring divided by the number of such springs in parallel.</p>

                        <h4>Example 3.2</h4>
                        <p>1. The figure below shows two identical spring balances supported as shown:</p>

                        <p>A</p>
                        <p>B</p>

                        <p>State the reading on each spring balance.</p>
                        <p>Each spring will read $=80 / 2=40 \mathrm{~N}$</p>
                        <p>2. Three identical arranged as shown below were used to support a load of weight 20 N . If the beam has a weight of 1 N and each spring would extend by 1 cm if a load of weight 4 N is suspended from it, determine the extension of each spring.</p>
