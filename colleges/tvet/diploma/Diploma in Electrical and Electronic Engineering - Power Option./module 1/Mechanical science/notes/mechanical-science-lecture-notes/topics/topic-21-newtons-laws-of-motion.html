                        <h3>21.2: Newton's first law of motion</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Newton's first law of motion</dfn> states: a body remains in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. This explains the following common observations:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">

                        </ul>
                        <p>These observations show that bodies have an in-built reluctance to changes in their state of motion or rest. The tendency of a body to resist change in its state of rest or motion is called <dfn>inertia</dfn>. Hence Newton's first law of motion is also referred to as the law of inertia.</p>

                        <h3>21.3: Newton's second law</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Newton's second law</dfn> states: the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the resultant external force acting on the body and takes place in the direction of the force.</p>

                        <p><dfn>Momentum</dfn> of a body is defined as the product of its mass and velocity. Since velocity is a vector quantity, momentum is also a vector quantity having both magnitude (size) and direction.</p>

                        <p>Momentum $\mathrm{P}=$ mass $\mathrm{m}^{*}$ velocity v</p>

                        <p>Hence the unit of momentum is the kilogram-metre per second (kgm/s). The direction of momentum is the same as that of the velocity. The change of momentum is therefore caused by a change in velocity.</p>

                        <p>Suppose the velocity of a body of mass $\mathbf{m}$ changes from an initial value $\mathbf{u}$ to a value $\mathbf{v}$ after a time $\mathbf{t}$, then: The initial momentum $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}=\mathrm{mu}$ The final momentum $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{f}}=\mathrm{mv}$ The change in momentum= final momentum- initial momentum Thus $\Delta \mathrm{P}=\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{f}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}=\mathrm{mv}-\mathrm{mu}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u})$ Therefore, the rate of change of momentum $=\Delta \mathrm{P}/ \mathrm{t}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u})/ \mathrm{t}$. From the equations of linear motion, $(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u})/ \mathrm{t}=$ acceleration $\mathbf{a}$ Hence $\Delta \mathrm{P}/ \mathrm{t}=\mathrm{ma}$. From the second law of motion, F $\alpha$ ma. And so the force $\mathrm{F}=$ mass $\mathrm{m}^{*}$ acceleration a ( $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma}$ ). Therefore, $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u})/ \mathrm{t}$ And $\mathrm{Ft}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u})$.</p>
                        <p>The product of the force and time is called <dfn>impulse</dfn>. It is a vector quantity since force is a vector quantity. The unit of impulse is the newton-second(Ns). Impulse is also equal to the change in momentum(mv-mu). Hence impulse can also be expressed in kgm/s.</p>

                        <h4>Example 21.1</h4>
                        <p>1. Two stones of mass 8 kg and 4 kg move with velocities $3 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$ and $6 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$ respectively. Compare their momentum.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\begin{aligned}
                            & P_{8 \mathrm{~kg}}=m v=8 * 3=24 \mathrm{kgm} / \mathrm{s} \\
                            & P_{4 \mathrm{~kg}}=m v=4 * 6=24 \mathrm{kgm} / \mathrm{s}
                            \end{aligned}$$
                        </div>
                        <p>Hence they have the same momentum.</p>
                        <p>2. A ball of mass 35 g travelling horizontally at $20 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$ strikes a barrier normally and rebounds with a speed of $16 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$. Find the impulse exerted on the ball.</p>

                            $$\begin{aligned}

                            & =1.26 \mathrm{Ns}
                            \end{aligned}$$
                        </div>
                        <p>Note that the two speeds are in opposite directions.</p>
                        <p>3. A kick that lasts 0.03 s sends a ball of mass 0.65 kg with a velocity of $15 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$ northwards. Find: a) The change in momentum of the ball.</p>

                        <p>Note that the ball is initially at rest, i.e. $u=0 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$. $\Delta \mathrm{P}=\mathrm{mv}-\mathrm{mu}=(0.65^{*} 15)-(0.65^{*} 0)=9.75 \mathrm{kgm}/ \mathrm{s}$</p>

                        <p>b) The average force exerted on the ball.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) / \mathrm{t}=(9.75 \mathrm{kgm} / \mathrm{s})/0.03 \mathrm{~s})=325 \mathrm{~N}$$
                        </div>
                        <p>c) The displacement of the ball in 2 seconds. The upward acceleration of the ball is negative $10 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}^{2}$. $\mathrm{S}=\mathrm{ut}+1/2 \mathrm{at}^{2}=(15^{*} 0.03)+(1/2^{*}-10^{*} 0.03^{2})=10 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$</p>

                        <h3>21.4: Newton's third law</h3>
                        <p><dfn>The law</dfn> states: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. We look at the working of a lift in relation to the third law of motion in three situations: a) When the lift is at rest. This implies that the resultant force on the lift is zero i.e. action and reaction are equal in size. The force acting on the lift is the weight of the person standing in the lift. This is balanced by the reaction by the floor of the lift. Therefore, weight $\mathrm{mg}=-$ reaction R , Or simply; $\mathrm{mg}+\mathrm{R}=0$.</p>

                        <p>b) When the lift descends with an acceleration a</p>

                        <p>For the lift to move downwards, the weight of the occupant must be greater than the reaction by the floor of the lift. Therefore, the resultant force pulling the lift downwards is equal to the difference between the weight mg and the reaction R ; Resultant force $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{mg}-\mathrm{R}$. From the second law of motion, the resultant force $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma}$. Therefore, $\mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{mg}-\mathrm{R}$. And $\mathrm{R}=\mathrm{mg}-\mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{g}-\mathrm{a})$.</p>

                        <p>c) When the lift ascends with an acceleration a</p>

                        <p>In this case, the reaction by the floor of the lift must be greater than the weight of the occupant. Hence, the resultant force $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{mg}$. And $\mathrm{R}=\mathrm{ma}+\mathrm{mg}=\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{g})$. The following are some cases where the third law of motion has been applied in everyday life: - A balloon moves in an opposite direction when air in it is released. Reaction</p>

                        <p>1. A man of mass 75 kg stands on a weighing machine in a lift. Determine the reading on the weighing machine when the lift: a) Ascends with an acceleration of $2 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}^{2}$. $F=ma=R-mg$ $(75^{*} 2)=R-(75^{*} 10)$ $\mathrm{R}=150+750=900 \mathrm{~N}$ b) Descends at a constant velocity of $1.5 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$. F $=$ ma $=$ mg - R But $\mathrm{a}=0$ since the velocity is constant. Therefore, $75^{*} 0=75^{*} 10-\mathrm{R}$ $\mathrm{R}=750 \mathrm{~N}$ c) Descends with an acceleration of $2.5 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}^{2}$. $75^{*} 2.5=75^{*} 10-\mathrm{R}$ $\mathrm{R}=750-187.5=562.5 \mathrm{~N}$</p>

Determine the change in momentum produced by the force and the time it takes the car to come to rest. $\Delta \mathrm{P}=\mathrm{mv}-\mathrm{mu}=1500(0-25)=-37500 \mathrm{kgm}/ \mathrm{s}$. $\mathrm{Ft}=\Delta \mathrm{P}$ We ignore the negative sign in this part because time is a scalar quantity. $3000 * t=37500t=37500/3000$</p>

                        <h3>21.5: Collision and the law of conservation of momentum</h3>
                        <p>This body states that when two or more bodies collide, their total linear momentum before and after collision remain constant provided no external force acts on them; i.e. momentum before collision= momentum after collision. There are basically two types of collisions namely elastic and inelastic collision.</p>
                        <p>a) Elastic collision This is where the bodies move separate ways after collision. In this collision, not only linear momentum is conserved but also kinetic energy; - Total linear momentum before collision= total linear momentum after momentum. - Total kinetic energy before collision= total kinetic energy after collision.</p>
                        <p>b) Inelastic collision This is where the colliding bodies stick together and move as one body after collision. In this type of collision, it is only linear momentum which is conserved but not kinetic energy. This is because during this collision, some deformation takes place which eats up part of the energy while some is converted to heat, sound or light energy. - Total linear momentum before collision= total linear momentum after collision.</p>

                        <h4>Example 21.3</h4>
                        <p>1. A bullet of mass 20 g is shot from a gun of mass 20 kg with a muzzle velocity of $200 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$. if the bullet is 30 cm long, determine: a) The acceleration of the bullet. For the bullet: $u=0, v=200 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}, s=0.3 \mathrm{~m}$ $v^{2}=u^{2}+2$ as $200^{2}=0+(2)(0.3a)a=40000/0.6=6.667^{*} 10^{4} m/s^{2}$ b) The recoil velocity of the gun. Total linear momentum before collision=total linear momentum after collision $(20^{*} 0)+(0.02^{*} 0)=(20^{*} \mathrm{v})+(0.02^{*} 200)\mathrm{v}=-4/20=-0.2 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$.</p>
                        <p>2. A 5 kg mass moving with a velocity of $10 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$ collides with a 10 kg mass moving at $7 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$ along the same line. If the two masses join together on impact, find their common velocity if they were moving: a) In opposite directions.

                        <p>It is therefore important to minimize friction at all cost. This can be done through the following ways: - Using rollers. - Using ball bearings. - Lubrication - Air cushioning.</p>

                        <h3>21.6.3: Factors affecting friction</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Frictional force</dfn> is directly proportional to the normal reaction R ; F $\alpha$ R Or simply F/R= a constant. The constant is called <dfn>coefficient of friction</dfn> $\mu$. It is a measure of the nature of the surfaces in contact. Hence, frictional force $\mathrm{F}=$ normal reaction $\mathrm{R}^{*}$ coefficient of friction $\mu$. When the two bodies are at rest, then the coefficient of friction is referred to as coefficient of static friction while if they are in relative motion, it is called coefficient of kinetic friction. Coefficient of friction has no units. Hence, friction depends on two factors: 1. The normal reaction R. 2. The nature of the surface. Frictional force is greater between rough surfaces than between smooth surfaces. Note that frictional force is independent of the area of contact of the two surfaces and relative velocity of the bodies.</p>

                        <h3>21.7: Viscosity</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Friction exerted by fluids</dfn> is called <dfn>viscosity</dfn> or viscous drag. It is the force which opposes relative motion between layers of the fluid. Viscosity is caused by the forces of attraction between the molecules of the fluid. When a body is put in a fluid, three forces act on it, namely: - Weight of the body which acts downwards. - Upthrust due to the fluid which acts upwards. - Viscous drag due to the fluid which acts upwards.</p>
                        <p>Upthrust U Viscous drag F Weight W</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-083-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating forces acting on a body falling through a fluid" class="content-image">
                         </div>
                        <p>When the body enters the fluid, its weight is initially higher than the total upward forces i.e. upthrust plus viscous drag. The resultant force acting on the body accelerates it towards the bottom of the container. As the body sinks down, the viscous drag increases until the three forces balance i.e. W=U+F. at this point, the body attains its maximum constant velocity called terminal velocity. The resultant force on the body is therefore zero. The graph of velocity against time for a body falling through a fluid appears as shown below:</p>

                         </div>
                        <p>Note that viscosity decreases with increase in temperature.</p>
