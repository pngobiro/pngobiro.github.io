                        <p>A wave is a continuous disturbance of a medium. A pulse is short lived disturbance produced by a single vibration. Waves may be put into the following uses:</p>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Note that waves can also be dangerous to the environment. For instance, earthquakes which produce shock waves can lead to damage of buildings, infrastructure if its magnitude is very big.</p>

                        <h3>16.2: Types of waves</h3>
                        <p>Waves are broadly categorized into two namely electromagnetic and mechanical waves.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">Âá∫</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Electromagnetic waves - these waves do not require a material medium for their transmission. They include radio waves, radiant heat, light and microwaves, etc.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">Âá∫</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Mechanical waves - they require material medium for their transmission. They include water waves, sound waves, etc.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Waves can be further classified in terms of the propagation of their particles as follows:</p>

                        <p>1. Transverse waves</p>

                        <p>In this case, the wave motion is perpendicular to the vibration of the particles. Electromagnetic waves as well water waves are examples of transverse waves.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-057-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating a transverse wave" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>2. Longitudinal waves</p>

                        <p>This is a wave in which the wave motion is along or parallel to the direction of vibration of the particles of the medium. Sound waves are examples of longitudinal waves. When a slinky spring is stretched and released along a smooth surface with one end fixed, the spring vibrates to and fro generating regions of compression and regions of rarefaction.</p>

                        <p>Rarefaction Compression</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-058-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating a longitudinal wave with compressions and rarefactions" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>A region of <dfn>compression</dfn> is where the particles of the medium are under great pressure and are therefore closely packed together. A region of <dfn>rarefaction</dfn> is where the particles are spread out due to low pressure.</p>

                        <p>Some waves continuously move away from the source and are referred to as progressive waves.</p>

                        <h3>16.3: Characteristics of waves</h3>
                        <p>The following terms are associated with a wave:</p>

                        <p>a) Oscillation</p>

                        <p>It is a single complete to and fromovement from the mean position.</p>

                        <p>b) Amplitude</p>

                        <p>It is the maximum displacement of the wave particles on either side from the mean position. It is measured in metre. The position of maximum displacement is called a crest while the position of minimum displacement is called a trough.</p>

                        <p>c) Frequency, f.</p>

                        <p>It is the number of complete oscillations or cycles made in one second. It is measured in hertz (Hz). It can also be expressed as number of oscillations per second.</p>

                        <p>d) Period, T.</p>

                        <p>It is the time taken to make a complete oscillation or cycle. It is measured in second. Note that, $\mathbf{f=1/T}$ or $\mathbf{T=1/f}$.</p>

                        <p>e) Wavelength, $\lambda$</p>

                        <p>This is the distance travelled by the wave in one periodic time. It can also be defined as the distance between two successive particles which are in phase e.g. between two successive crests or troughs. Two particles of a waveform are said to be in phase if they are at similar positions and are travelling in the same direction.</p>

                         </div>

                        <h4>Activity 16.1</h4>
                        <p>1. Show two waves which are $90^{\circ}$ out of phase.</p>

                        <h3>16.4: The Speed of a wave</h3>
                        <p>Since wavelength is the distance covered by the wave in one period, the wave speed can be determined as follows:</p>

                        <p>Speed $=$ distance $/$ time $=$ wavelength, $\lambda /$ period, T $\mathrm{V}=\lambda / \mathrm{T}$</p>

                        <p>Hence $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{f} \lambda$. Thus wave speed is the product of its frequency by wavelength. This formula is true for all types of waves.</p>

                        <h4>Example 16.1</h4>
                        <p>1. A source of waves has a frequency of 512 Hz . Calculate the wavelength of the waves produced if the speed of the waves is $330 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\lambda=\mathrm{v} / \mathrm{f}=330 / 512=0.64 \mathrm{~m}$$
                        </div>
                        <p>2. The wheel of a car is rotated at 120 revolutions per second, calculate: a) The period, T</p>
                        <p>b) The speed of the waves generated if the wavelength is $1.5^{*} 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}$. $\mathrm{T}=1/120=0.0083 \mathrm{~s}$ $\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{f} \lambda=\lambda / \mathrm{T}=\left(1.5^{*} 10^{-2}\right)/(8.3^{*} 10^{-3})=1.802 \mathrm{~m}/ \mathrm{s}$.</p>

                        <h3>16.5: Properties of waves(form three)</h3>
                        <p>Wave properties refer to the behaviour of waves under certain conditions. They include reflection, refraction, diffraction and interference among others. They can be investigated using a ripple tank which consists of a transparent tray containing water, a lamp for illumination, a white screen underneath and an electric motor (a vibrator). The motor is connected to a straight bar which produces straight waves. If circular waves are required, the bar is raised and a small spherical ball fitted to it to produce circular waves. To view the waves with ease, a stroboscope is used. A stroboscope is a disc having equally spaced slits. It is rotated and its speed controlled such that the waves appear stationary i.e frozen.</p>

                        <h3>16.5.1: Reflection of waves</h3>
                        <p>All waves undergo <dfn>reflection</dfn>. It is the bouncing back of waves when they hit an obstacle. All waves undergoing reflection obey the laws of reflection as earlier stated.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-060-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating reflection of waves from a straight barrier" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>Note that the wavelength of the waves remains unchanged. The pattern of the reflected waves depends on the shape of the incident waves and the reflector. Below are some patterns:</p>

                        <h3>16.5.2: Refraction of waves</h3>
                        <p>This is the <dfn>bending of waves</dfn> as they travel from one medium into another. In the process, the speed of the waves changes from one medium to another. In the case of water waves, refraction occurs as the waves move from a region of a certain depth into another region of a different depth i.e. from a shallow region to a deeper region or vice versa. In general, the speed of water waves is greater in a deeper region than in a shallow region. It is important to note that the source of waves remains the same regardless of the depth thereafter. Hence, the frequency of the waves is a constant.</p>

                        <p>Recall: wave speed= frequency $\mathbf{f}^{\boldsymbol{*}}$ wavelength $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$.</p>

                        <p>From the equation, it is clear that when the wave speed increases the wavelength also increases and vice versa. Thus, the wavelength is longer in deeper regions than in shallow regions.</p>

                        <p>To obtain a shallow region in a ripple tank, a transparent glass block is placed in the tank with one end of its edge parallel to the vibrating bar.</p>

                        <p>However, when the waves strike the boundary normally/perpendicularly, no bending occurs even though the speed and hence the wavelength changes.</p>

                        <p>Refraction of sound waves can be used to explain the long range of sound at night compared to daytime. This has been explained in the 'topic refraction of light'. TV and radio signals from a distant station also undergo a series of refraction and total internal reflection in the ionosphere towards the earth's surface making their reception possible.</p>

                        <h3>16.5.3: Diffraction of waves</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Diffraction</dfn> may be defined as the spreading of waves behind an obstacle. When the aperture is nearly the same size as the wavelength of the waves, the waves emerge as circular waves spreading out around the obstacle as shown in (a) below. However, when the size of the aperture is relatively wider than the wavelength of the waves, the waves pass through as plane waves bending slightly at the edges as shown in (b).</p>

                        <p>Diffraction of sound waves can be used to explain why sound within a room can be heard round a corner without necessarily having to see the source of the sound. Diffraction of light waves is not a common occurrence due to their shorter wavelengths. Nevertheless, diffraction of light waves can be observed when light pass through a small opening at the roof of a dark room. A shadow which is broader than the opening forms on the floor of the room.</p>

To an observer walking along a straight path XY, alternating loud and soft sound is heard. Along the line AB , a constant loud sound will be heard. The regions with loud sound represent areas of constructive interference while the regions with soft sound represent areas of destructive interference. When the frequency of the signal is increased, the separation between the alternating loud and soft sound is reduced i.e. more close. Note that for a signal of any velocity, the higher the frequency the shorter the wavelength. If instead the loudspeakers are connected such that the waves generated by one loudspeaker are exactly out of phase with those from the other, then all points along XY will have destructive interference and hence soft sound is heard throughout.</p>

                        <p>The light waves from the two slits undergo diffraction and superimpose as they spread out. A series of alternating bright and dark fringes are observed on the screen. The bright fringes are due to constructive interference while the dark fringes are due to destructive interference.

                        <p>A progressive wave is a wave that continuously moves away from the source. When two progressive waves equal in amplitude and travelling in opposite directions superpose on each other, the resultant wave is referred to as a stationary or standing wave. It is a common occurrence in stringed instruments. When the string is plucked/played, a transverse wave travels along the string and is reflected back on reaching the other end of the string.</p>
