                        <h3>4.1: Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Pressure is defined as the compressive force acting normally (perpendicularly) per unit area; i.e.</p>
                        <p>pressure= force/area</p>

                        <p>The SI unit of pressure is newton per square metre ( $\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ). Pressure can also be expressed in pascals ( Pa ); $1 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}=1 \mathrm{~Pa}$</p>

                        <p>Atmospheric pressure is sometimes expressed as $\mathrm{mmHg}, \mathrm{cmHg}$ or atmospheres. For a given amount of force, the smaller the area of contact the greater the pressure exerted. This explains why it would be easier for a sharp pin to penetrate a piece of cardboard than a blunt one when the same force is used.</p>

                        <h3>4.2: Pressure in solids</h3>
                        <p>A solid resting on a horizontal surface exerts a normal contact force equals to its weight. The pressure of the solid on the surface depends on the area of contact.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-021-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating pressure exerted by solids with different contact areas" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <h4>Example 4.1</h4>
                        <p>1. A man whose mass is 90 kg stands on a floor. a) If the area of contact between his feet and the floor is $0.0368 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, determine how much pressure he able to exert on the floor.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\begin{aligned}
                            \mathrm{P}=\mathrm{F} / \mathrm{A}=900 \mathrm{~N} / 0.0368 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
                            =24,456.5217 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2} .

                        <p>b) What pressure will he exert on the floor if now he stands on one foot?</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\mathrm{P}=900 \mathrm{~N} /(0.0368 / 2)=48,913.0435 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$$
                        </div>

                        <h3>4.3: Pressure in fluids</h3>
                        <p>A fluid is a term that refers to either liquids and gases. The set up below can be used to illustrate pressure in fluids:</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-022-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating pressure at different depths in a liquid" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>The lower hole $\mathbf{A}$ is observed to throw water the farthest, followed by hole $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{C}$ the closest. This indicates that pressure at $\mathbf{A}$ is greater than that at $\mathbf{B}$ and pressure at $B$ is greater than that at $C$. Conclusion</p>

                        <p>Pressure in fluids increases with depth i.e. the greater the depth the higher the pressure it exerts. This explains why the walls of a dam are made wider downwards.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-022-2.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the shape of a dam wall, wider at the base" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>A diver under water experiences pressure due to the weight of water above him plus the atmospheric pressure above the water surface. The deeper the diver, the greater the pressure.</p>

                        <p>When a liquid is poured into a set of connected tubes of different shapes, it rises up until the levels are the same in all the tubes.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-022-3.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating connected tubes with liquid levels the same" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <h3>4.4: The fluid pressure formula</h3>
                        <p>Consider a liquid of density $\rho$ in a container of uniform cross-section area $A$, such that the depth of the liquid in the container is h ;</p>

                        <p>Cross sectional area, A</p>
                        <p>Liquid Depth, h</p>
                        <p>Volume of the liquid $=A^{*} h$</p>
                        <p>Mass = volume * density</p>
                        <p>$=\mathrm{Ah} \rho$</p>
                        <p>Weight of the liquid = mass * gravitational field intensity= force exerted</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$=\mathrm{Ah} \rho \mathrm{~g}$$
                        </div>

                        <p>From the definition of pressure, $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{F} / \mathrm{A}$</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\begin{aligned}
                            & =\mathrm{Ah} \rho \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{A} \\
                            & =\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{g}
                            \end{aligned}$$
                        </div>

                        <p>It is thus clear that pressure in fluids is directly proportional to the height of the column h , the density of the fluid $\rho$ and the gravitational field strength g.</p>

                        <p>Note: Pressure in fluids does not depend on the cross section area of the container which holds it.</p>

                        <h4>Example 4.2</h4>
                        <p>1. Calculate the pressure exerted by a column of kerosene of 850 mm . take the density of kerosene $=800 \mathrm{kgm}^{- 3}$.</p>
                        <p>$\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{g}=0.85 \mathrm{~m} \times 800 \mathrm{kgm}^{-3} \times 10 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{kg}$</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$=6800 \mathrm{~Pa}$$
                        </div>

                        <h3>4.5: Transmission of pressure in fluids</h3>
                        <p>The figure below shows a liquid under pressure due to the force $F$ acting on the plunger.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-023-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating transmission of pressure in a fluid with holes" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>Assuming that the holes are identical, when the plunger is pushed forward, the liquid squirts out through the holes with equal force. If the piston area is $\mathbf{A}$, then the pressure developed is $\mathbf{F} / \mathbf{A}$. this pressure is transmitted equally to all parts of the liquid. This is called Pascal's principle. The principle states that pressure applied at one part of a liquid is transmitted equally to all other parts of the enclosed liquid. Gases can also transmit pressure in a similar way provided they are incompressible.</p>

                        <p>The working of hydraulic machines is based on Pascal's principle.</p>

                        <h3>4.6: Atmospheric pressure</h3>
                        <p>The term atmosphere refers to the air surrounding the earth. The weight of air above the earth's surface exerts pressure on the earth. This pressure is called atmospheric pressure. The presence of atmospheric pressure can be demonstrated by the crushing can experiment;</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-024-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the crushing can experiment" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>The can is filled with water then heated for several minutes. After sometime, the can is sealed and then cooled by running cold water over it.</p>

                        <p>When the water is heated, steam is produced which displaces air in the can. When cold water is run over it, steam condenses leaving a vacuum in the can. Pressure inside is thus reduced below the external atmospheric pressure. Hence the can crushes inwards.</p>

                        <p>Atmospheric pressure is also very vital when using a drinking straw. By sucking through a drinking straw the pressure inside is reduced. The atmospheric pressure acting on the surface of the liquid overcomes the pressure inside the straw. The pressure difference and hence the resultant force pushes the liquid up the straw.</p>

                        <h3>4.7:Measurement of pressure</h3>
                        <p>Atmospheric pressure is measured using an instrument called a barometer. The following are some types of barometers:</p>

                        <p>- A mercury barometer</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-024-2.jpg" alt="Diagram of a simple mercury barometer" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>Atmospheric pressure can support a liquid column in a tube. One end of the tube is closed and the tube is filled with mercury. When inverted and with the open end below the liquid surface in the container. The atmospheric pressure ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{atm}}$ ) on the open surface is transmitted by the liquid to the base of the liquid column and supports its weight.</p>

                        <p>With the liquid column h, the atmospheric pressure can be determined from the equation; Pressure $=\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{g}$</p>
                        <p>Where h -is the height of the liquid column</p>
                        <p>$\rho$ - Density of the liquid (mercury)</p>

                        <p>g- Gravitational field strength</p>

                        <p>At sea level atmospheric pressure can support approximately 76 cm column of mercury equivalent to approximately 10 m column of water. Mercury is thus preferred as a barometric fluid since it gives a shorter and measurable column compared to water. In general, atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude. The value of atmospheric pressure at sea level is called the standard atmospheric pressure and is at times referred to as one atmosphere.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                            $$\begin{aligned}
                            \text { Pressure at sea level } & =\mathrm{h} \rho g=0.76 \mathrm{~m}^{*} 13600 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3} * 10 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{kg} \\
                            & =103,360 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}
                            \end{aligned}$$
                        </div>

                        <p>If there is air trapped in the space above the mercury column then the barometer is faulty. This space above the mercury column is called toricellian vacuum. To test whether this space has some air trapped, the test tube is tilted until it is at the same level with the mercury column when the tube is upright. If the space is truly a vacuum, the test tube will be completely filled with mercury while if it has trapped air a space will still remain at the top.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-025-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating testing for air trapped in a mercury barometer" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>Normally the toricellian vacuum contains some little mercury vapour. Note that this barometer is not readily portable.</p>

                        <p>- A manometer</p>

                        <p>This is a U-shaped tube open on both ends. One end is connected to a source of gas whose pressure is to be determined. The other arm is open to the atmosphere. This creates a pressure difference which displaces the manometer liquid.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-025-2.jpg" alt="Diagram of a U-tube manometer measuring gas pressure" class="content-image">
                         </div>
                        <p>h</p>

                        <p>The points $A$ and $B$ are at the same level and as such experience the same amount of pressure. The pressure at $A$ is the gas pressure while that at B equals the pressure due to the liquid column plus atmospheric pressure; $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{g}}=$ $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}}+\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{g}$</p>
                        <p>- Fortin barometer</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-026-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a Fortin barometer" class="content-image">

                        <p>Mercury</p>
                        <p>Protective brass tube</p>

                        <p>The fixed ivory index with a sharp point acts asthe zero mark of the main scale. Before taking any reading the level of the mercury in the reservoir must first be adjusted until the tip of the ivory index just touches the surface of mercury. The height of mercury column is then read from the main scale .this reading is then used to calculate the pressure at the place. Any change in the atmospheric pressure causes the level of mercury in the reservoir to move up or down, hence the adjustment of the ivory index is necessary.</p>
                        <p>- Aneroid barometer</p>

                        <p>This type of barometer is more portable.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-027-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of an aneroid barometer mechanism" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>When the pressure outside the corrugated metal box is reduced, the box expands setting the levers into motion. However, when the pressure outside increases, the box reduces in volume. The resultant movements of the springs and levers moves the pointer across the scale recording the value of the atmospheric pressure.</p>

                        <p>The aneroid barometer can also be used to measure heights. For instance, altimeters are aneroid barometers used in aircrafts to measure heights.</p>

                        <p>- Pressure gauge</p>

                        <p>Pressure gauges are also easily portable. It is commonly used to measure gas pressure, tyre pressure, etc. It consists of a coiled flexible metal tube. When the pressure inside the tube increases, the tube uncoils. The movement of the tube is magnified by the lever and gear mechanism which then moves the pointer across the scale.</p>

                        <p>1. A bicycle pump Barrel</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-027-3.jpg" alt="Diagram of a bicycle pump" class="content-image">

                        <p>The leather washer is very flexible and works both as a valve and a piston. During the upstroke, air in the barrel expands and its pressure reduced below the atmospheric pressure outside. The pressure difference and hence the resultant force acting downwards pushes the air past into the barrel. The valve remains closed due to the high pressure in the tube.</p>

                        <p>During down stroke, air in the barrel is compressed raising its pressure. This high pressure presses the leather washer against the wall of the barrel hence no air leaks out. When the pressure of the air in the barrel overcomes that inside the tube, the air is forced through the valve into the tube. The work done in compressing the air in the barrel generates some heat raising the temperature of the barrel.</p>

                        <p>2. The hydraulic machines</p>

                        <p>These machines apply Pascal's principle in their working. They include the following machines: a) Hydraulic lift</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-028-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a hydraulic lift" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>When a force $F_{1}$ is exerted on the smaller piston of cross section area $A_{1}$, the pressure developed $\left(F_{1} / A_{1}\right)$ is transmitted by the liquid to the larger piston of cross section area $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ and is able to support a load $\mathrm{F}_{2}$.Alternatively, the pressure exerted on the liquid by the larger piston can be expressed as $\mathrm{F}_{2} / \mathrm{A}_{2}$. If the system is in equilibrium, then $F_{1} / A_{1}=F_{2} / A_{2}$.</p>
                        <p>b) Hydraulic brake system</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-028-2.jpg" alt="Diagram of a hydraulic brake system" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>The force applied on the foot pedal exerts pressure on the master cylinder. This pressure is transmitted equally by the brake fluid to the slave cylinder. The pistons of the slave cylinder are then forced to open outwards. This opens the brake shoe. The brake lining then presses the drum, resisting the rotation of the wheel. When the force on the foot pedal is released, the return spring pulls back the brake shoe and the wheel can rotate once again .The pressure exerted on the master cylinder is transmitted equally to all the four wheels and so the braking force is uniform</p>
                        <p>In order for the brake system not to fail, the liquid used should have the following properties;</p>

                        <p>3. The lift pump</p>

                        <p>The lift pump relies on the atmospheric pressure to raise water from a borehole or well. It has two valves, $A$ and B.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-029-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a lift pump" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>To start the pump, water must be poured on top of the piston, a process called priming. This creates an air-tight seal around the piston and in valve A. The pump is operated by means of a lever. It has two cycles, upstroke and down stroke.</p>

                        <p>During upstroke</p>

                        <p>When the plunger moves up during upstroke, valve A closes due to the pressure of water above it plus the weight of the plunger. At the same time, air above valve B expands and the atmospheric pressure on the surface of water pushes water past valve $B$ into the barrel. The plunger is moved up and down until the region between $A$ and $B$ is filled with water. Water above the piston is then lifted out through the side tube.</p>

                        <p>During down stroke</p>

                        <p>During downstroke, valve B closes due to its weight plus pressure of water above the piston.</p>

                        <p>Limitation of the lift pump.</p>

                        <p>The atmospheric pressure can only support a column of water of about 10 mm i.e. Normal atmospheric can raise water to a maximum height of 10 m . In practice, this height is usually below 10m. This due to;</p>

                        <p>4. The force pump.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">

                        <p>In this design, the pressure used to raise water is created by the person operating the pump handle. The pump handle moves a piston in the cylinder, which is placed within 10 m of the water level i.e. 10 m or below $[\mathrm{h}]$. The cylinder is connected to a chamber.</p>

                        <p>Upstroke.</p>

                        <p>During upstroke, air above valve P expands and its pressure falls below atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure on the water surface pushes water up past valve P into the barrel. The pressure above valve Q is atmospheric pressure and hence this valve remains closed during this stroke.</p>

                        <p>Down stroke</p>

                        <p>During down stroke, valve P closes. Increase in pressure in water in the barrel opens valve Q and water is forced into the chamber R. As water fills the chamber, some air is trapped and compressed at the upper part.</p>

                        <p>In the next upstroke, valve Q closes and the compressed air forces water up the delivery pipe ensuring a continuous flow of water as the valves open and close.</p>

                        <p>NB: The height to which water can be raised is affected by two factors, namely:</p>

                        <p>The pressure at $A$ and $B$ is the same and equal to the atmospheric pressure. The pressure at $C$ is the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure due to the column of water, $h$. $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{c}}=\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{atm}}+\mathrm{h} \rho \mathrm{g}$</p>
                        <p>The pressure of the surrounding air at C is atmospheric pressure. This creates a pressure difference. The resultant downward force due to this pressure difference causes water to flow out of the end C. The water column doesn't break due to strong cohesive force between water molecules.</p>

                        <p>For the siphon to work, the following conditions must be met:</p>
