                        <h3>5.1: Introduction</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Matter</dfn> - is anything that occupies space and has mass. Matter exists in three states namely; solid, liquid and gas.</p>

                        <p>Experiment</p>

                        <p>Aim: to demonstrate that matter is made up of smaller particles Apparatus: Beakers, potassium permanganate crystals, water.</p>

                        <p>Procedure</p>
                        <p>i. Pour water into the beaker till it is half full ii. Dissolve some potassium permanganate crystals until the solution is purple iii. Transfer half the solution into another beaker and fill it with water iv. Continue the process with other beakers, comparing the colour of the solution through each dilution. Observation</p>
                        <div class="image-gallery">
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-031-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating serial dilution of potassium permanganate solution" class="content-image">
                        </div>

                        <p>The colour of the solution fades away through each dilution until the solution appears colourless. This shows that the particles of potassium permanganate are spread out evenly in the water. Each dilution spreads them out further as the water molecules increase in number. Hence the purple colour fades away with each dilution until it becomes colourless.</p>

                        <p>Conclusion</p>

                        <p>Potassium permanganate is made up of tiny particles. Also, when some salt particles are put in a flask and water added, it is observed that after shaking the flask to dissolve the salt, the volume of the final solution is less than the original volume of the water plus undissolved salt. This is because salt particles fitted into some spaces between the water molecules. Hence the particles of the solution are more packed together, reducing the volume of the solution. This also indicates that the particles of water and those of salt differ in size.</p>

                        <h3>5.2: Brownian motion</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Brownian motion</dfn> refers to the irregular movement of light particles when they are knocked by heavier bodies.</p>

                        <p>Experiment 1</p>

                        <p>Aim: To demonstrate Brownian motion in liquids Apparatus: Beaker, hand lens, pollen grains (chalk dust), transparent lid.</p>

                        <p>Procedure</p>
                        <p>i. Pourwater into the beaker about $3/4$ full. ii. Sprinkle pollen grains on the surface of the water. iii. Cover the beaker with a transparent lid. iv. By the use of a hand lens, observe the behavior of the pollen grains on the water surface.</p>

                        <p>Observation</p>

                        <p>The pollen grains suspended in the water are in constant random motion. The pollen grains are constantly knocked by smaller invisible particles of water from all sides. The net force on the pollen grain at any instant makes it to move with an irregular pattern. This is called Brownian motion.</p>

                        <p>Experiment2</p>

                        <p>Aim: to demonstrate Brownian motion in air (the smoke cell experiment) Apparatus: A drinking straw, smoke cell, microscope and a bright light source</p>

                        <p>Procedure</p>
                        <p>i. Burn one end of the straw and let the smoke fill the smoke cell from the other end. ii. Remove the straw and cover the cell using the cover plate. iii. Illuminate the cell and with the use of a microscope observe the behavior of the smoke particles in the smoke cell.</p>

                        <p>Observation</p>

                        <p>Bright specks which are in continuous random motion are observed. The bright specks are smoke particles scattering light. The random motion is due to constant collision between smoke particles and invisible air particles and also with walls of the cell.</p>

                        <p>The above findings can be summarized by the kinetic theory of matter which states: matter is made up of tiny particles which are in continuous random motion.</p>

                        <h3>5.3: States of matter</h3>

                        <p>Matter exists in three states which are interconvertible through either heating or cooling.</p>

                        <h3>5.3.1: Solids</h3>
                        <p>In solid state, the particles are closely packed together due to strong cohesive force between them. They vibrate in their fixed positions. Hence solids have definite shape and volume. When the temperature of the solid is raised, the vibration becomes rapid. At a certain temperature the particles of the solid break away from the structure of the solid and the solid is said to have melted. This temperature is called the melting point of the solid.</p>

                        <h3>5.3.2: Liquids</h3>
                        <p>The particles of a liquid are generally not as close as in solids. The attractive force between the liquid particles is weaker than solids'. Hence liquids have neither definite shape nor volume but take the shape of the container.</p>

                        <p>The density of a liquid is a little less than that of its liquid. This is because the liquid occupies more space than its own solid. Hence solid materials sink in their own liquids.</p>

                        <p>When a liquid is heated to a certain temperature, it changes to a gas. This temperature is known as its boiling point and the process is called vaporization.</p>

                        <p>A liquid can sometimes lose its energy and fall back to solid state. This is called freezing.</p>

                        <h3>5.3.3: Gases</h3>
                        <p>In gases, the particles are far apart with the weakest cohesive force. For this reason gases are highly compressible. Gases have densities which are much less than those of their respective liquids and solids.</p>

                        <p>Gas particles can sometimes lose their energy and fall back to liquid state. This is called condensation. NB: certain solids change directly to gas when heated while some gases can be cooled directly to solid. This process is called sublimation.</p>

                        <h3>5.4: Diffusion</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Diffusion</dfn> is defined as the process by which particles move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">-</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Diffusion in liquids can be demonstrated by putting a potassium permanganate crystal at the bottom of a beaker of water. After some time the water is observed to turn deep purple at the bottom and light purple near the top.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Also when a saturated copper II sulphate solution is added to water in a beaker, initially the water layer floats on top of the copper II sulphate solution due to its lower density. After some time the boundary disappears and the two form a homogeneous pale blue mixture.</p>

                        <p>When warm liquids are used in the illustrations above, similar observations would be made but after a shorter time. This suggests that temperature speeds up the rate of diffusion.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">•</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Diffusion in gases is faster than in liquids due to their lower density, high kinetic energy and weaker cohesive forces (or larger intermolecular distance). Diffusion in gases can be investigated by setting up two gas jars, one filled with air and the other with bromine gas as shown below.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                         <div class="image-gallery">

                         </div>

                        <p>After some time a pale brown gas mixture is observed in both the jars. The bromine gas spreads into jar B while air particles also spread into jar A.</p>

                        <p>NB: The rate of diffusion will be slower when the gas jars were set upright. This is because the denser gas will tend to remain at the base and the lighter one up.</p>

                        <p>This experiment should be carried out in a fumed cupboard or fume chamber.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="item-text">Diffusion in solids is very slow but can occur between two metals like gold and lead.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>5.4.1: Rate of diffusion</h3>
                        <p>The rate of diffusion between ammonia gas and hydrochloric acid gas can be investigated by the set up below.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-034-2.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the rate of diffusion of ammonia and hydrochloric acid gases in a tube" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>After some time, a white deposit of ammonium chloride is formed near the end with the hydrochloric acid. This indicates that ammonia gas diffuses faster than hydrochloric acid gas. Note that ammonia gas is lighter compared to hydrochloric acid gas. Conclusion The rate of diffusion depends on the density of the substance and the temperature.</p>

                        <h3>5.4.2: Diffusion through porous materials</h3>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-035-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating diffusion through a porous pot" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>A porous pot has very fine holes through which hydrogen gas diffuses into the pot while air diffuses out. The level of water in the tube falls as hydrogen diffuses into the pot. If hydrogen is supplied for a longer time, bubbles of hydrogen gas will be observed from the end in the water.</p>

                        <p>When the gas supply is stopped, hydrogen gas diffuses out of the pot as air diffuses into the pot and the level of water in the tube rises.</p>
