                        <h3>7.1: Heat and temperature</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Heat</dfn> may be defined as a form of energy that flows from a hot body to a cold body. Its SI unit is the joule (J). When a body loses heat its temperature is lowered while when a body gains heat its temperature rises. If two bodies which are at the same temperature are in contact, there is NO net heat transfer and the bodies are said to be at thermal equilibrium. No instrument can measure directly the amount of heat on a body.</p>

                        <p>Temperature on the other hand is the measure of the degree of hotness or coldness of a body. Its SI unit is the Kelvin (K). The most commonly used unit is degrees Celsius ( ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). Heat energy can only flow if there is a temperature difference between the two bodies.</p>

                        <h3>7.2: Modes of heat transfer</h3>
                        <p>There are three modes of heat transfer namely conduction, convection and radiation.</p>

                        <h3>7.2.1: Conduction</h3>
                        <p>Conduction is mainly prominent in solids. When a solid is heated, say from one end, the other end also becomes hot after some time. The means by which the heat is conducted to the other end can be explained by two theories:</p>

                        <p>a) Particle/atomic vibration</p>

                        <p>When a material is heated from one end, the heat energy entering the material increases the vibration of the particles/atoms at that end. These atoms also set the other neighboring atoms into vibration transferring the energy to the other end.</p>

                        <p>b) Free/mobile/delocalized electrons</p>

                        <p>Generally metals have free electrons which move all over the metal body. Heat energy supplied at one end of the material increases the kinetic energy of the electrons which then transfers this energy to the other end.</p>

                        <p>The ability of a material to conduct heat is called thermal conductivity. Materials that easily conduct heat are referred to as good conductors e.g. most metals. This is because metals conduct both by atom vibration as well as movement of free/delocalized electrons. This is why cooking utensils, soldering irons are made from metals. Nonmetals are generally bad conductors of heat because they do not have free electrons.</p>

                        <p>The set up below can be used to compare thermal conductivity of different materials:</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">

                         </div>

                        <p>The order in which wax on the rods fall is the order of thermal conductivity of the materials i.e. the rod from which wax first falls is the best thermal conductor and decreases in that order. It is important to ensure the following when doing this comparison:</p>

                                <span class="item-text">Use same length of the rods with the same length in the hot water.</span>
                            </li>

                        <p>The thermal conductivity of a thicker material is higher than that of a thinner one of the same material.

                        <p>Some materials are good conductors while others are bad conductors e.g. copper is a better conductor compared to iron.</p>

                        <p>The above four factors can be combined together in the following equation: Rate of heat flow $=$ thermal conductivity of the material, k * Cross-section area, A * Temp. Difference, $\Delta \theta$</p>

                        <p>Lagging</p>

                        <p>This involves covering good conductors with bad one (insulators) with the aim of minimizing heat loss to the surroundings. For instance pipes used to convey hot water from boilers are normally covered using thick asbestos material.</p>

                        <p>Conduction in liquids</p>

                        <p>Conduction in liquids is not as pronounced as in solids. Liquids are generally poor thermal conductors with the exception of a few like mercury and some electrolytes (e.g. salt solution). Note that mercury exists as a liquid at room temperature. Thermal conductivity of water may be investigated by the set up below:</p>

                        <p>Although liquids are poor thermal conductors, some liquids are better conductors than others. This can be investigated by the set up below:</p>

                        <p>The test tubes are coated with a uniform layer of wax. When the rod is heated as shown, the wax on the test tube with mercury is observed to melt downwards after sometime. Later on, wax on the other test tube started melting but very slowly. In conclusion, mercury is a better thermal conductor compared to water. Note that the heating should be done at the centre for a fair result. Also, the region of the rods in the liquids should be the same.</p>

                        <p>Gases are the worst thermal conductors. This is because they have larger intermolecular distance minimizing collision between their molecules. This can be verified by the set up below:</p>
                        <p>Match stick</p>

                        <p>A match stick held in the unburnt gas region of a flame is never ignited by the heat from the hot region above it. This shows that gases are poor thermal conductors.</p>

                        <h3>7.2.2: Convection</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Convection</dfn> It is a process by which heat is transferred in fluids. The term fluid refers to both liquids and gases. In this case heat transfer is by actual movement of the fluid itself. When a portion of liquid at the bottom of a container is heated, the particles there acquire more energy and expand. Since its mass does not change, the liquid in that portion becomes less dense and rises to the top. Cold, heavy portion of the liquid move down to replace the warm rising portion. A circulation of hot and cold water sets up a convectional current. Heat transfer in this manner is called convection. However, if heated from top no convection current is set up. This is because hot, lighter liquid cannot sink down below the cold, heavy liquid.</p>

                        <p>To show convection in liquids, a beaker is filled with water and some crystals of potassium permanganate placed at one corner of the beaker.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-047-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating convection currents in a liquid heated from below" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>When heated from the position shown, a purple coloration is observed to rise from the potassium permanganate crystal forming a loop. Hence when a liquid is heated, it rises and a cold one descends to replace it. This movement of the liquid forms convection currents.</p>

                        <p>Convection in gases can be demonstrated using the set up below:</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-047-2.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating convection currents in air using a box with chimneys and a candle" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>A smoldering straw/ rug burning on one end is used to introduce smoke through chimney A into the box. After sometime, the smoke is observed to exist through chimney B. however, when the candle is put off, NO smoke is sucked into the box. The candle heats up the air above it which then expands and rises up chimney B. cold , heavy air is drawn in through chimney A to replace the rising warm air. It carries along with it smoke particles. Hence smoke exists through chimney A so long as the candle is burning and the produces smoke.</p>

                        <p>Applications of convection</p>
                        <p>I. The domestic hot water system Overflow pipe Cold supply tank</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-047-3.jpg" alt="Diagram of a domestic hot water system showing convection flow" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>Water is heated up in the boiler, expands thereby becoming less dense. It then rises up tube A. cold water descends to the boiler through the return pipe B. The force of gravity helps in pushing the cold water down from the cold water tank to the boiler. The storage tank thus contains hot water on the upper part and cold water on the lower part. The valve controls the amount of water in the cold water tank. The overflow pipe helps in removing excess water from the cold water tank. The pipes conveying hot water, the boiler and the storage tank are normally lagged to minimize heat loss through conduction.</p>

                        <p>II. House ventilation</p>

                        <p>Generally windows of houses are normally put closer to the floor and ventilation holes/openings high up in the walls. Air expelled by the house occupants is warm, lighter and thus rises and escapes through the ventilation openings. Cold, fresh heavier air flows into the room through the windows and doors to replace the escaping air. Thus a continuous circulation of air is set up in the room. In certain modern houses, air conditioning devices are fitted to bring about forced convection of air, giving out cold dry air and absorbing warm moist air.</p>

                        <p>III. Car engine cooling system</p>

                        <p>A car engine gets heated as it operates. This heat must be disposed of to ensure the engine remains efficient. The engine is normally surrounded by a metallic water jacket connected to the radiator. The metal surface conducts away heat from the engine to the water. Water is heated up causing convection currents. The hot water is pumped into the radiator with thin copper fins that further conducts the heat away from the water. Fast moving air flowing between the fins speeds up the cooling process.</p>

                        <p>IV. Land and sea breeze.</p>

                        <p>This is a natural occurrence. A mass of water takes a much longer time to be heated up to the same temperature as a nearby land. It also loses heat slowly compared to land. It is on this argument that land and sea breezes are formed.</p>

                        <p>During the day, land gets heated much faster than a nearby mass of water. The mass of air just above the land is thus heated faster, expands and rises due to its reduced density. Cold air from above the water e.g. sea, drifts towards the land to replace the warm rising air. This is termed as sea breeze.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-048-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating sea breeze during the day" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>At night, the land cools faster than the sea. The air above the sea will be at a higher temperature. It expands and rises up due to its low density. Cold air from the land drifts towards the sea to replace the warm rising air. This constitutes a land breeze.</p>

                        <h3>7.2.3: Radiation</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Radiation</dfn> It is the flow of heat energy from one point to another by means of electromagnetic waves. It requires NO material medium. These waves are able to pass through a vacuum. Energy from the sun reaches the earth's surface by radiation. All bodies emit and absorb radiant energy (radiation). A body emitting thermal radiation can also emit visible light when it is hot enough. The higher the temperature of a body the greater the amount of radiant energy it can emit. Thermal radiation can be reflected and causes a heating effect. The amount of radiant energy absorbed by a body depends on the nature of its surface. Dull/ black surfaces are good absorbers than shinny/ polished surfaces. This can be illustrated by the set up below:</p>

                        <p>Wax Dull surface</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-049-1.jpg" alt="Diagram comparing absorption of radiation by dull and polished surfaces using wax" class="content-image">
                         </div>
                        <p>Source of heat Polished surface</p>

                        <p>After some time, the cork on the dull surface is observed to fall off first once the wax melts. The one on the polished surface takes longer to fall off. This shows that dull surfaces are good absorbers of radiation than polished surfaces. The radiation falling on the polished surface is partly absorbed and partly reflected.</p>

                        <p>Generally, good heat absorbers are also good emitters/ radiators. Hence black/ dull surfaces are good emitters while polished surfaces are poor emitters. Note that poor emitters (polished surfaces) are good reflectors.</p>
                         <div class="image-gallery">
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_11_6ae76bc8bb44bb6c228fg-049-2.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating emission of radiation from dull and polished surfaces using Leslie's cube" class="content-image">
                         </div>

                        <p>After some time, the level of water in limb A is observed to rise while that in limb B falls. The boiling tube B receives more heat than A . Hence the air in B expands pushing the water in limb B down. This is a proof that dull surfaces are good emitters.</p>

                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>4. Solar concentrators</p>

                        <p>Concave reflectors concentrate light that fall on them to a common point. The temperature at this point may be high enough to boil water.</p>

                        <p>5. Green house effect</p>

                        <p>A green house acts as a heat trap by preventing the reflected radiation from the earth's surface from passing through glass. High energetic short wavelength radiation from the sun passes through glass without being absorbed. Inside the greenhouse, this heat is absorbed by the earth and the objects in it. These objects in turn emit long wavelength radiation of low amount of energy that cannot penetrate glass. This raises the temperature inside the greenhouse. This is called greenhouse effect. Greenhouses provide optimum conditions for plants in cold regions. In the atmosphere especially at the lower layers, the gases and air pollutants suspended behave like glass, trapping the long wavelength reflected radiation. This may raise the temperature of the atmosphere to some dangerous levels, a phenomenon known as global warming.</p>

                        <p>6. Solar heater</p>

                        <p>A solar heater uses radiation from the sun to heat water. It comprises a coiled blackened copper pipe resting on a blackened insulating surface. Radiation from the sun passes through glass and absorbed by the copper pipes. Copper conducts this heat to the water flowing through it.</p>

                        <p>7. A thermos (vacuum) flask.</p>

                        <p>A vacuum flask is designed to keep its contents at a constant temperature by minimizing heat transfer into or out of the flask. It has a double wall; silvered to prevent heat loss or heat gain through radiation. Between the two walls is a vacuum which is a perfect insulator and minimizes heat loss through conduction and convection. The cork/lid minimizes heat loss through convection.</p>
