                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>For the purpose of measuring resistance, if L1 is of known resistance R1 and L2 is of unknown resistance and both E1 and E2 are known, then it follows that E1/E2 = R1/R2, thus R2 = (R1 x E2)/E1</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">DC-bridges</h3>
                        <p>Bridge's usually consists of four arms, balance detector and source. Abridge circuit in its simplest form consists of network of four resistance arms forming a closed circuit. A source of current is applied to two opposite junctions. The current detector is connected to other two junctions. DC bridges use DC source.<br>
                           So called bridges are based on comparison to precision resistors; they are versatile and yield very good accuracy. For DC-bridges you need naturally a DC-power source. The bridges are used not only for the measurement of resistances, but also used for the measurement of various component values like capacitor, inductor etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Uses of D.C. bridges.</h3>
                        <p>The D.C. bridges are used for the measurement of very high and very low value resistances. In practice, the variety of D.C. bridges are available. The commonly used D. bridges are (i) wheatstone bridge (ii) Kelvin bridge</p>

                        <p>The Wheatstone bridge is an instrument for making comparison measurements and operates upon a null indication principal.<br>
                           A Wheatstone bridge circuit is shown in its most common "diamond" configuration. It consists of four resistors, and voltage source connected across the top and bottom point of the "diamond". The output voltage is taken across the left and right points of the "diamond" between A and B. The arms consisting the resistances R1 and R2 are called ratio arms. The arm consisting the standard known resistance R3 is called standard arm. The resistance R4 is the unknown resistance to be measured. The bridge is brought to balance by adjusting one of the resistors.</p>
                        <p>The Wheatstone bridge is in the balanced bridge condition when the output voltage ( V out) between terminals A and B is equal to zero. No potential difference across the galvanometer (there is no current through the galvanometer)</p>
