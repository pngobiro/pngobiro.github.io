                        <p>Reliability can be generally of two types:</p>
                        <p>(i) Inherent Reliability: It is associated with the quality of the material and design of machine parts.<br>
                           (ii) Achievable Reliability: It depends upon other factors such as maintenance and operation of the equipment.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Repairable Items</h3>
                        <p>For repairable items, reliability is the probability that failure will not occur in the time period of interest; or when more than one failure can occur, reliabdity can be expressed as the failure rate, $\lambda$, or the rate of occurrence of failures (ROCOF). In the case of repairáble items, reliability can be characterized by MTBF described above, but only under the condition of constage failure rate.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Non-repairable items</h3>
                        <p>Non-repairable items are components or systemssuch as a light bulb, transistor, rocket motor, etc. Their reliability is the survival probability over the jitems expected life or over a specific period of time during its life, when only one failure can occur. During the component or systems life, the instantaneous probability of the first and only failure is called the hazard rate or failure rate, $\mathrm{r}(\mathrm{t})$. Life values such as MTTF described above are used to define non-repairable items.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">FAILURE RATE</h3>
                        <p>The term failure may be defined as<br>
                           1. any loss that interrupts the continuity of production<br>
                           2. a loss of assets availability<br>
                           3. the unavailability of equipment<br>
                           4. a deviation from the status quo<br>
                           5. not meeting target expectations<br>
                           6. Any secondary defect.</p>
                        <p>Failure - inability to produce work in appropriate manner . OR Failure rate($\lambda$): Rate at which components fail per unit time<br>
                           . Failure rate is the ratio of the number of failures during particular unit interval to the average population during that interval. This failure rate is also known as hazard rate and instantaneous failure rate.</p>
