\section*{MODULE I}

\section*{ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS AND FAULT DIAGNOSIS DIP 1}

Measurement is the comparison of an unknown physical quantity with a known fixed physical quantity. Measurement is the process of obtaining the magnitude of a quantity relative to an agreed standard.

\section*{Basic requirements of measurement}

The two basic requirements of measurement are
- The standard used for comparison purposes must be accurately defined and should be commonly accepted.
- The apparatus used and the method adopted must be provable.

The two methods of measurement may be broadly classified into two categories:
- Direct method
- Indirect method.

In direct method of measurement, the unknown quantity is directly compared against the standard. The result is expressed as a numerical number

\section*{Significance of Measurements:}

The significance (importance) of measurement is expressed in the following statement of the famous physicist
Lord Kelvin: "I often say that when you can measure whatyou are speaking about and can express it in numbers, you know something about it; when you cannofexpress in it numbers your knowledge is of a meagre (insufficient) and unsatisfactory kind."

\section*{Measurement Systems:}

A measurement system is defined as the system (Group of physical components) which is used for making measurements.

There are three main functional elements of the measurement systems are:
a) Primary sensing element: these are basically transducers.
b) Variable conversion element or Signal conditioning elements: these are generally filters and amplifiers circuit.
c) Data presentation element or Outputs elements: these are basically display devices, like LED or LCD display.

\section*{Functions of Measurement systems:}

Measurement systems may be classified into three important categories based on their functions they perform.
i) Indicating Measurement system
ii) Recording Measurement system and
iii) Controlling Measurement system.

\section*{i) Indicating Function (Indicating measurement system)}

In this case information is obtained as a deflection of pointer of a measuring instrument. Example, The speed of automobile is indicated by deflection of pointer of a speedometer, Ammeter, Voltmeter and Wattmeter.

\section*{ii) Recording Function (Recording measurement system)}

This involves a written record on the paper according to given input unknown quantity under measurement against time or against some other variable.
Example, Monitoring of instantaneous values of temperature records using potentiometric strip chart recorder with respect to time, monitoring of pressure and temperature relationship record for boiler and compressor using $\mathrm{X}-\mathrm{Y}$ recorder.

\section*{iii) Controlling Function (Controlling measurement system)}

In this case, the information is used by the instrument or the system to control the original measured input unknown quantity.

\section*{Applications of Measurement systems:}

The Measurement systems are used for different applications are as under the following functions:
i) Monitoring of processes and operations
ii) Control of Processes and Operations and
iii) Experimental Engineering analysis

\section*{QUANTITIES, UNITS AND STANDARDS}

Quantity: Quantity is a property that is measured [e.g. mass, length, time, volume, pressure].
Physical Quantities: All quantities in terms of which laws of physics can be expressed and which can be measured are called Physical Quantities.For example; Distance, Speed, Mass, Force etc.
Physical Quantity $=$ Numerical value $\times$ unit
Q = Physical Quantity
$\mathrm{n}=$ Numerical value
u = Standard unit
e.g. Mass of stool $=15 \mathrm{~kg}$

Mass = Physical quantity
$15=$ Numerical value
$\mathrm{Kg}=$ Standard unit
Means mass of stool is 15 times of known quantity i.e. Kg.
Characteristics of Standard Unit: A unit selected for measuring a physical quantity should have the following properties
(i) It should be well defined i.e. its concept should be clear.
(ii) It should not change with change in physical coniditions like temperature, pressure, stress etc..
(iii) It should be suitable in size; neither too large nór too small.
(iv) It should not change with place or time.
(v) It should be reproducible.
(vi) It should be internationally accepted

\section*{SYSTEMS OF UNITS: CGS, FPS, MKS, SI}

For measurement of physical quantities, the following systems are commonly used:-
(i) C.G.S system: In this system, the unit of length is centimetre, the unit of mass is gram and the unit of time is second.
(ii) F.P.S system: In this system, the unit of length is foot, the unit of mass is pound and the unit of time is second.
(iii) M.K.S: In this system, the unit of length is metre, unit of mass is kg and the unit of time is second.
(iv) S.I System: This system is an improved and extended version of M.K.S system of units. It is called international system of unit.
v) The Electromagnetic System of Units (EMU): The electromagnetic system of units (EMU) has the centimeter, gram, second, and biot as its base units, where the biot is energy-equivalent to the unit square root dyne ( $\sqrt{\mathrm{cm}} \sqrt{\mathrm{g}} / \mathrm{s}$ ). For naming consistency, the biot is called the abampere.
vi) The Electrostatic System of Units (ESU): The electrostatic system of units (ESU) has the centimeter, gram, second, and franklin as its base units, where the franklin is energy-equivalent to the unit square root dyne centimeter ( $\mathrm{cm}^{3 / 2} \sqrt{ } / \mathrm{s}$ ). For naming consistency, the franklin is called the abcoulomb.

The C.G.S. system suffers from the following disadvantages :
(i) There are two systems of units (e.m.u. and e.s.u.) for fundamental 'theoretical work and a third (practical units) for practical engineering work. • .
(ii) There are two sets of dimensional equations for the same quantity.
(iii) If we use C.G.S. system factor 4 n occ4rs in formulae where its presence seems unwarranted specially in formulae which are widely med. .

\section*{ADVANTAGES OF M.K.S SYSTEM}
1. The system connects practical units directly with fundamental laws of electricity and magnetism.
2. The formulae for expressions of electromagnetism are specified involving practical units.
3. In C.G.S. system, $\mu$ is not existing in many expressions as its value is unity for the air. Hence it creates the confusion that the formula wrongly indicates that there is no effect of permeability of medium on the quantity to be measured, due to absence of $\mu$. In M.K.S. system, there is presence of $\mu$ in all the expressions in which it is required to be present, to consider the effect of permeability of medium.

\section*{Advantage of S.I. system:}
(i) It is coherent system of unit i.e. the derived units of a physical quantities are easily obtained by multiplication or division of fundamental units.
(ii) It is a rational system of units i.e. it uses only one unit fory one physical quantity. e.g. It uses Joule (J) as unit for all types of energies (heat, light, mechanical).
(iii) It is metric system of units i.e. it's multiples \& submultiples can be expressed in power of 10.

\section*{Calculations with submultiple and multiple units}

When doing calculations with mixed quantities (any combination of base, multiple or submutliple), all of the quantities should be converted to the base unit.
The conversion is done by moving the decimal point either left or right, based on the factor, as shown in the table above.
To convert 33nV to volts:
- 33 is multiplied by $0.000,000,001$ to get 0.000000033 V (decimal point moved nine places to the left on the number 33.0).
To convert $\mathbf{3 3 m V}$ to volts:
- 33 is multiplied by 0.001 to get 0.033 V (decimal point moved three places to the left on the number 33.0).

To convert 33GV to volts:
- 33 is multiplied by $1,000,000,000$ to get $33,000,000,000 \mathrm{~V}$ (decimal point moved nine places to the right on the number 33.0).

\section*{Basic Units and Derived Units}

Fundamental quantities are those physical quantities that cannot be expressed in terms other quantities. It is an independent quantities. For example: Length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, amount of substance. Derived Quantities - Derived quantities are those physical quantities that are derived from the combination of fundamental quantities. It is a dependent quantity. For example : force, density, volume, momentum etc.

\section*{Similarities between fundamental unit and derived unit}
- Both fundamental unit and derived unit are used to express physical quantities.
- Both are parts of International System of Units (SI) and are standardized.

\section*{Differences between fundamental unit and derived unit}

\section*{Fundamental Unit}

Fundamental units are all those units which are independent of any other unit (including themselves).

Fundamental units cannot be broken down into elementary level; in fact, these are elementary unites.
Fundamental units cannot be expressed in terms of derived units.

\section*{Derived Unit}

Derived units are all those units which are obtained by multiplying and/or dividing one or more fundamental units with or without introducing any other numerical factor.
Derived units can be broken down to its elementary level (composed of fundamental units).
Derived units can be expressed in terms of fundamental units.
A large number of derived units are available. Examplesof derived units:
$\hat{i}^{3}$ Velocity $(\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s})$
-
-
- Momentum $(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s})$
- Force (N)
- Density $\left(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}\right)$
- Heat (J)
- Energy (J)
- Power (W), etc.

\section*{PRACTICAL UNITS}

As the sizes of these e.m. and e.s. units were very inconvenient for practical purposes, an absolute system of practical units is introduced for electrical measurements. The practical units are the joule, watt, coulomb, ampere, volt, ohm, farad and henry.

Thus there are three entirely separate systems based on C.G.S. units and are related by number of conversion factors.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { For example, } 1 \text { Volt } & =10^{8} \text { electromagnetic units } \\
& =\frac{1}{300} \text { electrostatic units } \\
\text { While } 1 \text { Ampere } & =10^{-1} \text { electromagnetic units } \\
& =3 \times 10^{9} \text { electrostatic units } \\
\therefore \quad 1 \mathrm{Ohm} & =\frac{\text { Volt }}{\text { Ampere }}=\frac{10^{8}}{10^{-1}}=10^{9} \text { electromagnetic units } \\
& =\frac{\frac{1}{300}}{3 \times 10^{9}}=1.11 \times 10^{-12} \text { electrostatic units }
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Absolute units}

A system in which the various units of measurement are all expressed in terms of fundamental units is called absolute units. An absolute measurement does not compare the measured quantity with arbitrary units of same kind, but is made in terms of some fundamental units.

\section*{Auxiliary fundamental units.}

There are certain fundamental measures which relates to other disciplines such as thermal, electrical, illuminations etc. The units of measure for certain physical quantities related only to such fields are called auxiliary fundamental units. Thus units such as ampere to measure current in electric field, unit Kelvin used to measure temperature in thermal discipline are auxiliary fundamental units.

\section*{Two supplementary SI units}
1) Plane angle, radian, rad
2) Solid angle, steradian sr

\section*{Dimensional Equations and Formulas of Physical Quantities}

The dimension of a physical quantity is defined as the power to which the fundamental quantities are raised to express the physical quantity. The dimension of mass, dength and time are represented as [ $\mathbf{M} \mathbf{3},[\mathbf{L}]$ and $[\mathbf{T}]$ respectively. For example:
$$\text { Velocity }=\frac{\text { displacement }}{\text { time }}=\frac{[\mathrm{L}]}{[\mathrm{T}]}=[\mathrm{L}][\mathrm{T}-1]=[\mathrm{MOL} \mathrm{~T}-1]$$

We say that dimension of velocity are, zero in mass, 1 in length
and -1 in time.
An advantage of the SI is the ease with which dimensional calculations can be performed. A derived unit is recognized by its dimensions, which can be defined as the complete algebraic formula for the derived unit. If we define the dimensions of length, mass, and time as [L], [M], and [T], respectively, then physical quantities may be expressed as [L] ${ }^{\mathrm{X}}[\mathrm{M}]^{\mathrm{y}}[\mathrm{T}]^{\mathrm{Z}}$. For instance, the dimension of acceleration is $[\mathrm{L}][\mathrm{T}]^{-2}$ and that of force is $[L][M][T]^{-2}$. In the mks system of units, the systematic unit of acceleration is therefore $1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ and that of force is $1 \mathrm{kgm} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$.

The dimensional symbol for the derived unit of area is $L^{2}$ and that for volume is $L^{3}$. For convenience, some derived units have been given new names. For example, the derived unit of force in the SI system is called the newton ( N ), instead of the dimensionally correct $\mathrm{kg}-\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s} 2$.
Example: The volume , $\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{l}$ * $\mathrm{b}^{*} \mathrm{~h}$ where the dimension of each $\mathrm{l}, \mathrm{b}$ and h is [L]. Hence the equation is dimensional form becomes,
$\mathrm{V}=[\mathrm{L}][\mathrm{L}][\mathrm{L}]$
$\mathrm{V}=\left[\mathrm{L}^{3}\right]$

\section*{Dimensional formula of a Physical Quantity}

The dimensional formula is defined as the expression of the physical quantity in terms of its basic unit with proper dimensions. For example, dimensional force is
$\mathbf{F}=\left[\mathbf{M ~ L ~ T}{ }^{-2}\right]$
It's because the unit of Force is Netwon or $\mathbf{k g} \mathbf{m}^{\mathbf{m}} / \mathbf{s}^{2}$

\section*{Dimensional Equations}

The equation obtained by replacing each quantity in the mathematical equation by respective dimensions is called dimensional equations.

\section*{Advantages of Dimensional equations}
- In conversion from one system of units to another system of units
- In derivation of equations for physical quantities
- In checking the accuracy of an equation

\section*{Uses of Dimensional Equations:}
i. To check the correctness of a physical relation.
ii. To derive the relation between various physical quantities.
iii. To convert value of physical quantity from one system of unit to another system.
iv. To find the dimension of constants in a given relation.

\section*{Limitation of Dimensional analysis}
i. It does not give information about the dimensional constant.
ii. if a quantity depends on more than three factors having dimension, the formula cannot be derived.
iii. We cannot derive the formulae containing trigonometric function, exponential functions, logarithmic function, etc.
iv. The exact form of relation cannot be developed when there are more than one part in any relation.
v. It gives no information whether a physical quanfity is scalar or vector.

Momentum and impulse have the same dimension.

\section*{PRINCIPLE OF HOMOGENEITY OF DIMENSIONS}

It states that the dimensions of all the terms on both sides of an equation must be the
same. According to the principle of homogeneity, the comparison, addition \& subtraction of all physical quantities is possible only if they are of the same nature i.e., they have the same dimensions. If the power of M , L and T on two sides of the given equation are same, then the physical equation is correct otherwise not. Therefore, this principle is very helpful to check the correctness of a physical equation.

Example: A physical relation must be dimensionally homogeneous, i.e., all the terms on both sides of the equation must have the same dimensions. In the equation, $S=u t+1 / 2 \mathrm{at}^{2}$
The length $(\mathrm{S})$ has been equated to velocity $(\mathrm{u}) \&$ time $(\mathrm{t})$, which at first seems to be meaningless, But if this equation is dimensionally homogeneous, i.e., the dimensions of all the terms on both sides are the same, then it has physical meaning.
Now, dimensions of various quantities in the equation are:
Distance, $\mathrm{S}=\left[\mathrm{L}^{1}\right]$
Velocity, $\mathrm{u}=\left[\mathrm{L}^{1} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]$
Time, $\mathrm{t}=\left[\mathrm{T}^{1}\right]$
Acceleration,
$$\mathrm{a}=\left[\mathrm{L}^{1} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]$$
$1 / 2$ is a constant and has no dimensions.
Thus, the dimensions of the term on L.H.S. is $\mathrm{S}=\left[\mathrm{L}_{3}^{\mathrm{A}}\right]$ and
Dimensions of terms on R.H.S.
$$\mathrm{ut}+1 / 2 \mathrm{at}^{2}=\left[\mathrm{L}^{1} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]\left[\mathrm{T}^{1}\right]+\left[\mathrm{L}^{1} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]\left[\widehat{\mathrm{T}}^{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{L}^{1}\right]+\left[\mathrm{L}^{1}\right]$$

Here, the dimensions of all the termis on both sides of the equation are the same.
Therefore, the equation is dimensionally homogeneous.
Example 3. Check the correctness of the following formulae by dimensional analysis.
(i) $F=m \mathrm{v} 2 / \mathrm{r} \quad$ (ii) $=2 \pi \sqrt{ } l / g$

Where all the letters have their usual meanings
Sol.
$$F=m v^{2} / \mathbf{r}$$

Dimensions of the term on L.H.S
Force,
$$\mathrm{F}=\left[\mathrm{M}^{1} \mathrm{~L}^{1} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]$$

Dimensions of the term on R.H.S
$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{m} \boldsymbol{v}^{2} / \mathbf{r} & =\left[\mathrm{M}^{1}\right]\left[\mathrm{L}^{1} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]^{2} /[\mathrm{L}] \\
& =\left[\mathrm{M}^{1} \mathrm{~L}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right] /[\mathrm{L}] \\
& =\left[\mathrm{M}^{1} \mathrm{~L}^{1} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]
\end{aligned}$$

The dimensions of the term on the L.H.S are equal to the dimensions of the term on R.H.S. Therefore, the relation is correct.
(ii) $t=2 \pi \sqrt{l} / g$

Here, Dimensions of L.H.S, $t=\left[\mathrm{T}^{1}\right]=\left[\mathrm{M}^{0} \mathrm{~L}^{0} \mathrm{~T}^{1}\right]$
Dimensions of the terms on R.H.S
Dimensions of (length) $=\left[\mathrm{L}^{1}\right]$
Dimensions of $g$ (acc due to gravity) $=\left[\mathrm{L}^{1} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]$
$2 \pi$ being constant have no dimensions.
Hence, the dimensions of terms $2 \pi \sqrt{l} / g$ on R.H.S
$$\left.=\left(\mathrm{L}^{1} / \mathrm{L}^{1} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]\right)^{1 / 2}=\left[\mathrm{T}^{1}\right]=\left[\mathrm{M}^{0} \mathrm{~L}^{0} \mathrm{~T}^{1}\right]$$

Thus, the dimensions of the terms on both sides of the relation are the same i.e., [ $\mathrm{M}^{0} \mathrm{~L}^{0} \mathrm{~T}^{1}$ ].Therefore, the relation is correct.

Example 4. Check the accuracy of the following relations:
(i) $\mathrm{E}=\mathrm{mgh}+1 / 2 \mathrm{mv}^{2}$;
(ii) $v^{3}-u^{2}=2 a s^{2}$.

Sol. (i) $\quad E=m g h+1 / 2 \mathrm{mv}^{2}$
Here, dimensions of the term on L.H.S.
$$\text { Energy, } \mathrm{E}=\left[\mathrm{M}^{1} \mathrm{~L}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]$$

Dimensions of the terms on R.H.S,
Dimensions of the term, mgh $\left.=[\mathrm{M}] \times \mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{E} \mathrm{T}^{-2}}\right] \times[\mathrm{L}]=\left[\mathrm{M}^{1} \mathrm{~L}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]$
Dimensions of the term, $1 / 2 \mathrm{mv}^{2}=[\mathrm{M}] \times\left[\mathrm{LT}^{-1}\right]^{2}=\left[\mathrm{M}^{1} \mathrm{~L}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]$
Thus, dimensions of all the terms on both sides of, the relation are the same, therefore, the relation is correct.
(ii) The given relation is,
$$\mathrm{v}^{3}-\mathrm{u}^{2}=2 \mathrm{as}^{2}$$

Dimensions of the terms on L.H.S
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}^{3}=\left[\mathrm{M}^{0}\right] \times\left[\mathrm{LT}^{-1}\right]^{3}=\left[\mathrm{M}^{0} \mathrm{~L}^{3} \mathrm{~T}^{-3}\right] \\
& \mathrm{u}^{2}=\left[\mathrm{M}^{0}\right] \times\left[\mathrm{LT}^{-1}\right]^{2}=\left[\mathrm{M}^{0} \mathrm{~L}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]
\end{aligned}$$

Dimensions of the terms on R.H.S
$$2 \mathrm{as}^{2}=\left[\mathrm{M}^{0}\right] \times\left[\mathrm{LT}^{-2}\right] \times[\mathrm{L}]^{2}=\left[\mathrm{M}^{0} \mathrm{~L}^{3} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]$$

Substituting the dimensions in the relations, $\quad v^{3}-u^{2}=2 \mathrm{as}^{2}$
We get,
$$\left[\mathrm{M}^{0} \mathrm{~L}^{3} \mathrm{~T}^{-3}\right]-\left[\mathrm{M}^{0} \mathrm{~L}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{M}^{0} \mathrm{~L}^{3} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]$$

The dimensions of all the terms on both sides are not same; therefore, the relation is not correct.

\section*{DIMENSIONS IN ELECTROSTATIC SYSTEM}

Let us derive the dimensions of some practical units in electrostatic system of units interms of $\mathrm{L}, \mathrm{M}, \mathrm{T}$ and $\varepsilon$.
1. Charge (Q) : According to coulomb's law force between two charges $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ is given by,
$$\mathrm{F}=\frac{\mathrm{Q}_{1} \mathrm{Q}_{2}}{\varepsilon \mathrm{~d}^{2}}$$
where
$$\mathrm{d}=\text { Distance between the two charges }$$
$$\begin{array}{rlrl}
\therefore & {\left[\mathrm{MLT}^{-2}\right]} & =\frac{\left[\mathrm{Q}^{2}\right]}{[\varepsilon][\mathrm{L}]^{2}} \\
& & {[\mathrm{Q}]^{2}} & =\left[\mathrm{ML}^{3} \mathrm{~T}^{-2} \varepsilon\right] \\
& \therefore & {[\mathrm{Q}]} & =\left[\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{3}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]
\end{array}$$
where $\varepsilon$ is the permitivity of a free space.
And vacuum is assume to be unity in such systems
2. Current (I) : It is the rate of flow of charge.
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & \mathrm{I}=\frac{\mathrm{Q}}{\mathrm{t}} \\
\therefore & {[\mathrm{I}]=\frac{\left[\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{3}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]}{[\mathrm{T}] \mathrm{S}^{\frac{0}{0}}}=\left[\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{3}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]}
\end{array}$$
3. Potential difference or e.m.f. (E) : It is the work done per unit charge.
$$\begin{aligned}
E & =\frac{W}{Q} \\
\therefore \quad[E] & =\frac{M L^{2} T^{-2}}{\left[\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}} M^{\frac{1}{2}} L^{\frac{3}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]}=\left[\varepsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]
\end{aligned}$$
4. Capacitance (C) : It is the ratio of charge and the e.m.f.
$$\begin{aligned}
& C=\frac{Q}{E} \\
\therefore & {[C] }
\end{aligned}$$
5. Resistance ( R ) : It is ratio of e.m.f. and the current.
$$\begin{aligned}
R & =\frac{E}{I} \\
\therefore \quad[R] & =\frac{\left[\varepsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]}{\left[\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{3}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]}=\left[\varepsilon^{-1} \mathrm{~L}^{-1} \mathrm{~T}\right]
\end{aligned}$$
6. Inductance (L) : It is the ratio of e.m.f. and the corresponding rate of change of current.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{L}=\frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{dI} / \mathrm{dt}} \\
& \therefore \quad \mathrm{~L}=\frac{[\mathrm{E}]}{\left\{\frac{[\mathrm{I}]}{[\mathrm{T}]}\right\}}=\frac{\left[\varepsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]}{\left[\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{3}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]} \\
& {[\mathrm{T}] }
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{DIMENSIONS IN ELECTROMAGNETIC SYSTEMS}

Instead of using $\varepsilon$ as a fourth unit, $\mu$ is used as a fourth unit in electromagnetic system of units. Let us derive the dimensions of some electromagnetic units interms of L, M, T and $\mu$.
1. Pole strength (m) : The force between the two magnetic poles is given by Coulomb's law as,
$$\mathrm{F}=\frac{\mathrm{m}_{1} \mathrm{~m}_{2}}{\mu \mathrm{~d}^{2}}$$
where $\quad d=$ Distance between the two poles
$$\begin{aligned}
\therefore & {\left[\mathrm{MLT}^{-2}\right] } & =\frac{\left[\mathrm{m}^{2}\right]}{[\mu]\left[\mathrm{L}^{2}\right]} \\
\therefore & {\left[\mathrm{m}^{2}\right] } & =\left[\mu \mathrm{M}^{3} \mathrm{~T}^{2}\right] \\
\therefore & {[\mathrm{m}] } & =\left[\mu^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{3}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]
\end{aligned}$$
2. Magnetic field strength $(\mathbf{H})$ : It is the force exerted of a unit pole.
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & H=\frac{F}{m} \\
\therefore & {[H]=\frac{\left[M \mathrm{M}^{-2}\right]}{\left[\mu^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{3}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]}=\left[\mu^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]}
\end{array}$$
3. Current (I) : The magnetising force at the centre of a loop having radius $r$ is given by,
$$\begin{array}{ll} 
& H=\frac{2 \pi I}{r} \text { where } I \text { is in e.m. system of units. } \\
\therefore & {[\mathrm{I}]=[\mathrm{H}][\mathrm{r}]=[\mathrm{H}][\mathrm{L}]}
\end{array}$$
$$=\left[\mu^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]$$
4. Charge (Q) : The charge is product of current and time.
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & Q=I t \\
\therefore & {[Q]=[I][T]=\left[\mu^{-\frac{1}{2}} M^{\frac{1}{2}} L^{\frac{1}{2}}\right]}
\end{array}$$
5. Potential difference (E): It is the work done per unit charge.
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & E=\frac{W}{Q} \\
\therefore & {[E]=\frac{\left[M^{2} T^{-2}\right]}{\left[\mu^{-\frac{1}{2}} M^{\frac{1}{2}} L^{\frac{1}{2}}\right]}=\left[\mu^{\frac{1}{2}} M^{\frac{1}{2}} L^{\frac{3}{2}} T^{-2}\right]}
\end{array}$$
6. Capacitance (C) : It is the ratio of charge to the potential difference.
$$\begin{array}{rlrl}
C & =\frac{Q}{E} \\
\therefore & {[C]} & \left.=\frac{\left[\mu^{-\frac{1}{2}} M^{\frac{1}{2}} L^{\frac{1}{2}}\right]}{\left[\mu^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} L^{\frac{3}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]}=\partial^{\gamma^{-1}} \mathrm{~L}^{-1} \mathrm{~T}^{2}\right]
\end{array}$$
7. Resistance ( R ) : It is the ratio of e.m.f. to the current.
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{R} & =\frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{I}} \\
\therefore \quad[\mathrm{R}] & =\frac{\left[\mu^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{3}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]}{\left[\mu^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{M}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~L}^{\frac{1}{2}} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]}=\left[\mu \mathrm{LT}^{-1}\right]
\end{aligned}$$
8. Inductance (L) : It is the ratio of e.m.f. and the corresponding rate of change of current.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{L} & =\frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{dI} / \mathrm{dt}} \\
\therefore & {[\mathrm{~L}] } & =\frac{[\mathrm{E}]}{\frac{[\mathrm{I}]}{[\mathrm{T}]}} \text { but } \frac{[\mathrm{E}]}{[\mathrm{I}]}=[\mathrm{R}] \text { dimensionally } \\
\therefore & {[\mathrm{L}] } & =[\mathrm{R}][\mathrm{T}]=\left[\mu \mathrm{LT}^{-1}\right][\mathrm{T}]=[\mu \mathrm{L}]
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{EXAMPLES}

\section*{Magnetic flux}

To obtain the dimensions of flux, use can be made of Faraday's law which states that EMF (induced in any circuit) = rate of change of flux
or the EMF $=\frac{\text { flux }}{\text { time }}$
or
$$\text { flux }=\text { EMF } \times \text { time }$$
$\therefore$ dimensionally
$$\begin{aligned}
{[\varnothing] } & =\left[\varepsilon^{-1 / 2} \mathrm{~L}^{1 / 2} \mathrm{M}^{1 / 2} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right] \times[\mathrm{T}] & & \\
& =\left[\varepsilon^{-1 / 2} \mathrm{~L}^{1 / 2} \mathrm{M}^{1 / 2}\right], & & \text { in the ES system } \\
\text { Likewise } \quad[\varnothing] & =\left[\mu^{1 / 2} \mathrm{~L}^{3 / 2} \mathrm{M}^{1 / 2} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right], & & \text { in the EM system }
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Flux density}

Since by definition flux density is flux per unit area
$$\begin{array}{ll}
{[\mathrm{B}]=\frac{[\varnothing]}{\left[\mathrm{L}^{2}\right]}=\left[\varepsilon^{-1 / 2} \mathrm{~L}^{-3 / 2} \mathrm{M}^{1 / 2}\right],} & \text { in the ES system } \\
{[\mathrm{B}]=\left[\mu^{1 / 2} \mathrm{~L}^{-1 / 2} \mathrm{M}^{1 / 2} \mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right],} & \text { in the EM system }
\end{array}$$

Consider the measurement of inductance of a coil using Hay's bridge ,the expression for the inductance being obtained as
$$L=\frac{R_{2} R_{3} C}{1+\omega^{2} R_{4}^{2} C^{2}}$$
proof that it is dimensionally correct
where R2, R3, R4 and C denote the various branch components of the bridge and $\omega$ the angular frequency of the supply.
Here, if R2, R3, and R4 are in ohm, $\omega$ in rad/s, and C is in farad, the inductance must be obtained in henry if the derivation of the above expression is correct. However, whillst the magnitude of L will be obtained in terms of the values of resistances etc. in the expression, it is essential that the expression must be dimensionally balanced to yield the true value of the inductance. Thus, in the above expression, after some simplification,

Or
$$\begin{aligned}
{[\mathrm{L}] } & =\left[\frac{1}{\left[\omega^{2}\right]\left[G^{9}\right]} 0^{\hat{N}^{6}}\right. \\
& =\left[\frac{1}{\mathrm{~T}^{-2} \mathrm{~L}^{-1} \mathrm{~T}^{2} \mu^{-1}}\right]
\end{aligned}$$
note 1 is dimensionless
by substituting the dimensions of $f\left[\omega^{2}\right]$ and $[\mathrm{C}]$ in EM system.
or $\quad[\mathrm{L}]=[\mathrm{L} \mu]=[\mathrm{L}]$, in the EM system.
Hence, the expression provides the correct value of the inductance.

\section*{Dimensions of Electrical and Magnetic Quantities in Rationalised MKS System(LMTI)}

The dimensions of the various quantities in the Rationalised System are based on FOUR fundamental quantities and their dimensions. These are: metre [M], kilogramme [K], second [S] (or time [T]), and ampere (or current) [I]. The use of ampere as the fourth fundamental unit was recommended by the IEC in July, 1950 and was subsequently adopted
universally. The main feature of the system is that it does away with the use of either permittivity or permeability which do not appear in any of the dimensions.
The current itself being the rate of electric charge (charge per unit time), can be dimensionally expressed as
$$[\mathrm{I}]=\frac{[\mathrm{Q}]}{[\mathrm{T}]} \quad \text { or } \quad[\mathrm{Q}]=[\mathrm{I}][\mathrm{T}]$$

\section*{Electromotive force or potential difference in MKS}

Since potential difference = work per unit charge
$$\begin{aligned}
{[\mathrm{PD}] } & =[\mathrm{V}]=\frac{[\mathrm{W}]}{[\mathrm{Q}]} \\
& =\frac{\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]}{[\mathrm{Q}]} \\
& =\left\lceil\mathrm{M}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right\rceil
\end{aligned}$$
substituting for the dimensions of [Q].

\section*{Electric flux}

This is dimensionally equal to the charge producing it, _
or
$$[\psi]=[\mathrm{Q}]=[\mathrm{I}][\mathrm{T}]=[\mathrm{I} \mathrm{~T}]$$

Then, the permeability and permittivity are associated with the field quantities as follows:
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{B}=\mu \mathrm{H}, & \text { where } \mu=\mu_{0} \mu_{\mathrm{r}} ; \quad \mu_{0}=4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \\
\mathrm{D}=\varepsilon \mathrm{C}, & \text { where } \varepsilon=\varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}} ; \quad \varepsilon_{0}=8.854 \times 10^{-12}
\end{array}$$
$\Rightarrow$ Example 2.1 : Prove that the following equation is dimensionally correct :
```
$e=B l v$
where $e=e . m . f$. in volts, $B=$ flux density
    $l=$ length,$\quad v=$ velocity
```

Solution : On right hand side,
$$\begin{aligned}
& {[\mathrm{B}]=\frac{[\phi]}{[\mathrm{A}]}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{L}^{2}\right]}=\left[\mathrm{MT}^{-2} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right]} \\
& {[l]=[\mathrm{L}] \quad \text { and }[\mathrm{v}]=\frac{[\mathrm{L}]}{[\mathrm{T}]}=\left[\mathrm{LT}^{-1}\right]}
\end{aligned}$$
$\therefore \quad[\mathrm{B}][\mathrm{ll}][\mathrm{v}]=\left[\mathrm{MT}^{-2} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right][\mathrm{L}]\left[\mathrm{LT}^{-1}\right]=\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right]$
These are dimensions of right hand side.
$$\begin{aligned}
{[\mathrm{e}] } & =\frac{[\mathrm{W}]}{[\mathrm{Q}]}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]}{[\mathrm{TI}]} \\
& =\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right]
\end{aligned}$$

These are dimensions of left hand side, same as that of right hand side.
This proves that the equation is dimensionally correct.
mm Example 2.2: The expression for the mean torque of an electrodynamometer type wattmeter may be written as,
$T \propto M^{p} E^{q} Z^{t}$
where $M=$ Mutual inductance between fixed and moving coils
$E=$ Applied voltage, $\quad Z=$ Impedance of load circuit
Determine the values of $p, q$, and $t$ performing the dimensional analysis.
Solution : Let $K$ is the constant of proportionality in the given equation which is dimensionless.
$$\therefore \quad T=K M^{P} E^{q} Z^{t}$$

Dimensions of L.H.S. are,
$$[\mathrm{T}]=[\text { Force }] \times[\text { Distance }]=\left[M L T^{-2}\right][\mathrm{L}]=\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]$$

On R.H.S. using LMTI system of units,
$$\begin{aligned}
{[\mathrm{M}] } & =[\mathrm{L}] \\
& =\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right] \\
{[\mathrm{E}] } & =\frac{[\mathrm{W}]}{[\mathrm{Q}]}=\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right] \\
{[\mathrm{Z}] } & =[\mathrm{R}]=\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]
\end{aligned}$$
... as both are inductances

The impedance is measured in ohms hence having same dimensions as that of resistance.
$$\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \text { R.H.S. } & =\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]^{p}\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right]^{q}\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]^{t} \\
& =\left[\mathrm{M}^{p+q+t} \mathrm{~L}^{2 p+2 q+2 t} \mathrm{~T}^{-2 p-3 q-3 t} \mathrm{I}^{-2 p-q-2 t}\right]
\end{aligned}$$

Equating the dimensions of L.H.S. and R.H.S. and hence the power of M, L, T and I on both sides, we get
$$\begin{aligned}
p+q+t & =1 \\
2 p+2 q+2 t & =2 \\
-2 p-3 q-3 t & =-2
\end{aligned}$$
$$-2 p-q-2 t=0$$

Adding equation (2) and (3), $-\mathrm{q}-\mathrm{t}=0$ i.e. $\mathrm{t}=-\mathrm{q}$
Adding equation (2) and (4), $\mathrm{q}=2$ so $\mathrm{t}=-2$
Using in equation (1), $p=1$
Thus
$$p=1, q=2, t=-2$$

Hence the expression can be written as,
$$\mathrm{T} \propto \mathrm{ME}^{2} Z^{2} \propto \frac{\mathrm{ME}^{2}}{\mathrm{Z}^{2}}$$
$m$ Example 2.4 : In deriving equation for resistance in Hay's bridge, the following expression is obtained,
$$R=\frac{\omega^{2} R_{1} R_{2} R_{3} C^{2}}{1+\omega^{2} R_{2}^{2} C}$$

Find whether the equation is dimensionally correct or not. In case there is an error, find the error and correct the equation accordingly.
Solution : In M.K.S.A. rationalised system,
$$\begin{aligned}
{[\mathrm{R}] } & =\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{2}\right] \\
{[\mathrm{C}] } & =\left[\mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~L}^{-2} \mathrm{~T}^{4} \mathrm{I}^{2}\right] \\
{[\omega] } & =\text { cycles second }=\left[\mathrm{T}^{-1}\right]
\end{aligned}$$
... as cycles is dimensionless
Hence substituting in the right hand side,
$$\text { R.H.S. }=\frac{\left.\left[\mathrm{T}^{-1}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]^{3} \mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~L}^{-2} \mathrm{~T}^{4} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]^{2}}{1+\left[\mathrm{T}^{-1}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{~K}^{-2} \mathrm{~S}^{2}\left[\mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~L}^{-2} \mathrm{~T}^{4} \mathrm{I}^{2}\right]\right.}$$

Note that dimensions of $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ are same hence dimensionally $R_{1} R_{2} R_{3}$ becomes $[R]^{3}$.
$$\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & \text { R.H.S. }=\frac{\left[\mathrm{T}^{-2}\right]\left[\mathrm{M}^{3} \mathrm{~L}^{6} \mathrm{~T}^{-9} \mathrm{I}^{-6}\right]\left[\mathrm{M}^{-2} \mathrm{~L}^{-4} \mathrm{~T}^{8} \mathrm{I}^{4} \mathrm{D}\right.}{1+\left[\mathrm{T}^{-2}\right]\left[\mathrm{M}^{2} \mathrm{~L}^{-} \mathrm{T}^{-6} \mathrm{I}^{-4}\right]\left[\mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~L}^{-2} \mathrm{~T}^{4} \mathrm{I}^{2}\right]}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]}{1+\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-4} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]} \\
\text { While } \quad \text { L.H.S. }=[\mathrm{R}]=\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]
\end{array}$$

Thus dimensionally equation is not correct. It can be seen that numerator dimensions of R.H.S. are same as the dimensions of L.H.S. Hence to satisfy the equation dimensionally, denominator of R.H.S. must be dimensionless. The term ' 1 ' is dimensionless. So to have other term in the denominator of R.H.S. dimensionless, it must be multiplied by $\left[\mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~L}^{-2} \mathrm{~T}^{4} \mathrm{I}^{2}\right]$. These are the dimensions of capacitor C . This indicates that the term $\omega^{2}$ $\mathrm{R}_{2}^{2} \mathrm{C}$ must be multiplied by one more C to satisfy the equation dimensionally,
$$R=\frac{\omega^{2} R_{1} R_{2} R_{3} C^{2}}{1+\omega^{2} C^{2} R_{2}^{2}}$$
$m$ Example 2.5 : The expression for the eddy currents produced in a metallic former moving in the field of a permanent magnet is found as,
$$I_{e}=K \frac{\mathrm{~B} l \mathrm{bA}}{(2 \mathrm{~b}+l) \rho}$$
where
$$\begin{array}{ll}
B=\text { Flux density }, & l=\text { Length of former } \\
b=\text { Width of former }, & A=\text { Area of former } \\
\rho=\text { Resistivity of former, } & K=\text { Constant }
\end{array}$$

It is suspected that the term angular frequency $\omega$ is missing in the equation. Using LMIT system, for the dimensional analysis, detect the error.
Solution : Let us obtain the dimensions of each quantity on R.H.S. of the equation,
$$\begin{array}{rlrl}
{[\mathrm{B}]} & =\frac{[\phi]}{[\mathrm{A}]}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{M} \mathrm{~L}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{L}^{2}\right]}=\left[\mathrm{MT}^{-2} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right] \\
{[l]} & =[\mathrm{L}],[\mathrm{b}]=[\mathrm{L}], \mathrm{A}=\left[\mathrm{L}^{2}\right] \\
\therefore \quad & & {[2 \mathrm{~b}+l]} & =\text { Length }=[\mathrm{L}] \\
\therefore \quad[\rho] & =\text { resistivity }=\frac{\mathrm{RA}}{l} \\
\therefore \quad & & {[\rho]} & =\frac{[\mathrm{R}][\mathrm{A}]}{[l]}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{M} \mathrm{~L}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]\left[\mathrm{L}^{2}\right]}{[\mathrm{L}]} \\
& =\left[\mathrm{M} \mathrm{~L}^{3} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right] \\
\therefore \quad & & & =[\mathrm{TI}]
\end{array}$$

And $\quad$ L.H.S. $=[I]$
To satisfy the equation dimensionally, R.H.S. must be divided by [T] i.e. multiplied by $\left[\mathrm{T}^{-1}\right.$ ]. The dimensions of $\omega$ are cycles $/ \mathrm{sec}$. i.e. $\left[\mathrm{T}^{-1}\right.$ Hence there must be presence of $\omega$ in the numerator of R.H.S. Hence the correct expression for $\mathrm{I}_{e}$ can be written as,
$$\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{\mathrm{K} \omega \mathrm{~B} l \mathrm{~b} \mathrm{~A}}{(2 \mathrm{~b}+l) \rho}$$
$m$ Example 2.13: Derive the dimensions of resistance, inductance, capacitance and permeability in LMTI system.
Solution : 1) $\quad \mathrm{R}=\frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{I}} \quad$ and $\quad \mathrm{E}=\frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{Q}}, \quad \mathrm{Q}=\mathrm{I}$ t
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{W} \\
\therefore \quad & =\text { Force } \times \text { Distance }=\text { Mass } \times \text { Acceleration } \times \text { Distance } \\

$$\begin{aligned}

& \text { 3) } \quad \mathrm{C}=\frac{\mathrm{Q}}{\mathrm{E}} \\
& \therefore \quad[\mathrm{C}]=\frac{[\mathrm{TI}]}{\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right]}=\left[\mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~L}^{-2} \mathrm{~T}^{4} \mathrm{I}^{2}\right] \\
& \text { 4) } \quad \mu=\frac{\mathrm{B}}{\mathrm{H}}=\frac{\phi}{\mathrm{AH}} \text { and } \mathrm{H}=\frac{\mathrm{NI}}{l} \\
& \text { Now } \quad E=N \frac{d \phi}{d t} \quad \ldots \mathrm{~N} \text { is dimensionless } \\
& \therefore \quad[\mathrm{E}]=\frac{[\phi]}{[\mathrm{T}]} \text { i.e. }[\phi]=\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2} \mathrm{I}^{-1}\right] \\
& {[\mathrm{A}]=\left[\mathrm{L}^{2}\right] \text { and }[\mathrm{H}]=\frac{[\mathrm{I}]}{[\mathrm{L}]}=\left[\mathrm{L}^{-1} \mathrm{I}\right]} \\

mam Example 2.14 : Use dimensional analysis to find whether the following equation is dimensionally correct or not.
$$R_{4}=\frac{R_{2}\left(1+\omega^{2} R_{3}^{2} C_{3}^{2}\right)}{\omega^{2} R_{1} R_{3} C_{3}}$$
where $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ are resistances, $C_{3}$ is capacitance while $\omega$ is angular frequency. If the equation is not correct, find the error and correctiti.
[GU : Dec.-2005]
Solution : Let us find the dimensions of R.H.S.
$$\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{R}_{1}\right] } & =\left[\mathrm{R}_{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{R}_{3}\right]=\frac{[\mathrm{E}]}{[\mathrm{I}]}=\frac{[\mathrm{W}] /[\mathrm{Q}]}{[\mathrm{I}]} \\
& =\frac{\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right] /[\mathrm{TI}]}{[\mathrm{I}]}=\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]
\end{aligned}$$

The dimension of all resistances is same.
$$\begin{aligned}
{[\omega] } & =\text { cycles/second }=\frac{1}{[\mathrm{~T}]}=\left[\mathrm{T}^{-1}\right] \quad \ldots \text { cycles are dimensionless } \\
{[\mathrm{C}] } & =\frac{[\mathrm{Q}]}{[\mathrm{E}]}=\frac{[\mathrm{TI}]}{\frac{[\mathrm{W}]}{[\mathrm{Q}]}}=\frac{[\mathrm{TI}]}{\frac{\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-2}\right]}{[\mathrm{TI}]}} \\
& =\left[\mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~L}^{-2} \mathrm{~T}^{4} \mathrm{I}^{2}\right] \\
\therefore \quad[\mathrm{R} . \mathrm{H} . \mathrm{S}] & =\frac{[\mathrm{R}]\left\{1+[\omega]^{2}\left[\mathrm{R}_{3}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{C}_{3}\right]^{2}\right]}{[\omega]^{2}[\mathrm{R}]^{2}\left[\mathrm{C}_{3}\right]} \text { where }[\mathrm{R}]^{2}=\left[\mathrm{R}_{1}\right]\left[\mathrm{R}_{3}\right]
\end{aligned}$$

Now as 1 is dimensionless, the dimensions of $1+\omega^{2} R_{3}^{2} C_{3}^{2}$ is same as the dimensions of $\omega^{2} R_{3}^{2} C_{3}^{2}$.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad \begin{aligned}
{[\text { R.H.S }] } & =\frac{\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]\left[\mathrm{T}^{-1}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~L}^{-2} \mathrm{~T}^{4} \mathrm{I}^{2}\right]^{2}}{\left[\mathrm{~T}^{-1}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~L}^{-2} \mathrm{~T}^{4} \mathrm{I}^{2}\right]} \\
& =[\mathrm{T}] \\
\text { While } \quad[\text { L.H.S. }] & =[\mathrm{R}]=\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$

So dimensionally equation is not correct.

So on R.H.S., a quantity must be present to make the dimensions of R.H.S. same as L.H.S.
$$\begin{aligned}
\therefore & {[\mathrm{T}][\mathrm{x}] } & =\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-3} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right] \\
\therefore & {[\mathrm{x}] } & =\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-4} \mathrm{I}^{-2}\right]
\end{aligned}$$

Thus R.H.S. must be multiplied by $x$, i.e. divided by $x^{-1}$.
$$\mathrm{x}^{-1}=\left[\mathrm{ML}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{-4} \mathrm{I}^{-2} \mathrm{~J}^{-1}=\left[\mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~L}^{-2} \mathrm{~T}^{4} \mathrm{I}^{2}\right]\right.$$

But these are the dimensions of capacitor $\mathrm{C}_{3}$ in the given equation. Hence for having dimensional correctness of the equation, R.H.S. must be divided by one more $\mathrm{C}_{3}$. Hence the equation becomes,
$$R_{4}=\frac{R_{2}\left(1+\omega^{2} R_{3}^{2} C_{3}^{2}\right)}{\omega^{2} R_{1} R_{3} C_{3}^{2}}$$

\section*{STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENTS}

A standard is a physical representation of a unit of measurement. The term standard is applied to a piece of equipment having a known measure of physical quantity. Types of Standards are
- International Standards
- Primary Standards
- Secondary Standards
- Working Standards

International Standards (defined based on international agreement ) They represent certain units of measurements to the closest possible accuracy that production and measurement technology allow. These standards are maintained at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in America and not available to the ordinary user of measuring instruments.

Primary Standards (maintained by national standards laboratories) The primary (basic) standards are maintained by national standards laboratories in different parts of the world. The National Bureau of standards (NBS) in America, National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Britain, and Physikalisch Technische in Germany. The primary standards represent the fundamental units and some of the derived mechanical and electrical units. Primary standards are not available for use outside the national laboratories. One of the main functions of primary standards is the verification and calibration of secondary standards.

Secondary Standards ( used by industrial measurement laboratories). Secondary standards are the basic reference standards used in industrial measurement
laboratories. These standards are maintained by the particular involved industry and are generally sent to the national standards laboratories (primary) on a periodic basis for calibration and comparison.

Working Standards ( used in general laboratory). Working standards are the principal tools of a measurement laboratory. They are used to check and calibrate general laboratory instrument for accuracy and performance or to perform comparison measurements in industrial applications. A manufacturer of precision resistances, for example, may use a standard resistor (a working standard) in the quality control department of his plant to check his testing equipment.

\section*{Calibration:}

Calibration is defined as the process by which comparing the instrument with a standard to correct the accuracy. Why must instruments be calibrated?
Calibration of all instruments is important since it affords the opportunity to check the instruments against a known standard and subsequently to find errors and accuracy. Calibration Procedure involve a comparison of the particular instrument with either :a primary standard, a secondary standard with a higher accuracy than the instrument to be calibrated or an instrument of known accuracy

\section*{Factors Effecting Instrument selection}

\section*{DEFINITIONS OF SOME STATIC CHARACTERISTICS}
1. Accuracy closeness with which an instrument reading approaches the true value of the variable being measured.
2. Stability: It is the ability of an instrument to retain its performance throughout is specified operating life.
3. Precision a measure of the reproducibility of the measurements; i.e., given a fixed value of a variable, precision is a measure of the degree to which successive measurements differ from one another.
4. Sensitivity the ratio of output signal or response of the instrument 50 a change of input or measured variable.
5. Resolution the smallest change in measured value to which the instrument will respond.
6. Error deviation from true value of the measured value.
7. Expected value: The design value se, the most proble value that calculations indicate one should expect to measure.

\section*{8. Threshold:}

If the instrument input is increased very gradually from zero there will be some minimum value below which no output change can be detected. This
minimum value defines the threshold of the instrument.
9. Tolerance: The maximum allowable error in the measurement is specified in terms of some value which is called tolerance.

\section*{10. Range}

It is defined as that region enclosed by the limits within which a particular quantity is measured.

\section*{11- Span}

It is algebraic difference of the upper and lower limits of the range.

\section*{Example:}

The span of ( 0 to10) voltmeter is Span= $10-0=10$ state
But the span for $(-10$ to +10$)$ voltmeter is Span= $10-(-10)=20$ state
12. Repeatability - variation due to the measuring device, or the variation observed when the same operator measures the same part repeatedly with the same device

\section*{13- Loading effect}

It's the change of circuit parameter, characteristic, or behaves due to instrument operation with out maintains.

\section*{Dynamic characteristics:}

The set of criteria defined for the instruments, which are changes rapidly with time, is called 'dynamic characteristics'.
The various dynamic characteristics are:
i) Speed of response ii) Measuring lag
iii) Fidelity
iv) Dynamic error

\section*{Speed of response:}

It is defined as the rapidity with which a measurement system responds to changes in the measured quantity.

\section*{Measuring lag:}

It is the retardation or delay in the response of a measurement system to changes in the measured quantity. The measuring lags are of two types:

\section*{a) Retardation type:}

In this case the response of the measurement system begins immediately after the change in measured quantity has occurred.
b) Time delay lag:

In this case the response of the measurement system begins after a dead time after the application of the input.
Fidelity: It is defined as the degree to which a measurement system indicates changes in the measurand quantity without dynamic error.
Dynamic error: It is the difference between the true value of the quantity changing with time \& the value indicated by the measurement system if no static error is assumed. It is also called measurement error.

\section*{EXAMPLE}

A moving coil ammeter has a uniform scale with 50 divisions and gives a full-scale reading of 5 A . The instrument can read up to $V$ th of a scale division with a fair degree of certainty. Determine the resolution of the instrument in $m A$.

Solution Full-scale reading = 5 A
Number of divisions on scale $=50$
$$1 \text { scale division }=\frac{5}{50} \times 1000=100 \mathrm{~mA}$$

Resolution $=1 / 4$ th of a scale division $=\frac{100}{4}=25 \mathrm{~mA}$

\section*{Speed of Response}

The quickness of an instrument to read the measured variable is called the speed of response. Alternately, speed of response is defined as the time elapsed between the start of the measurement to the reading taken.

\section*{Errors in Measurement}

In order to understand the concept of errors in measurement, we should know the two terms that defines the error and these two terms are written below:

\section*{True Value}

It is not possible to determine the true value of quantity by experiment means. True value may be defined as the average value of an infinite number of measured values when average deviation due to various contributing factor will approach to zero.

\section*{Measured Value}

It may be defined as the approximated value of true value. It can be found out by taking means of several measured readings during an experiment, by applying suitable approximations on physical conditions.. Static error is defined as the difference of the measured value and the true value of the quantity

Static error = measured value - true value. defined as the difference btn the measured value and true value of quantity i.e $\delta A=A_{m}-A_{t}$
Where,
$$\delta \mathrm{A}=\text { error }$$
$$\begin{aligned}
A_{m} & =\text { measured value } \\
A_{t} & =\text { true value }
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{$\delta \mathrm{A}$ - static error of quantity $A$ under measurement}

Sometimes, $\delta \mathrm{A}$ is denoted by $\varepsilon 0$.(absolute error $=u p$ or down value)
The relative error is the ratio of absolute error to the true value of the unknown quantity to be measured,
i.e relative error $=\varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}=\delta \mathrm{A} / \mathrm{At}=\varepsilon 0 / \mathrm{At}=$ Absolute value /true value

Quantity of measurement is provided by relative static error
When the absolute error $\varepsilon 0(=\delta \mathrm{A})$ is negligible, i.e., when the difference between the true value At and the measured value $A m$ of the unknown quantity is very small or negligible then the relative error may be expressed as,
$$\varepsilon_{r}=\frac{\delta A}{A_{m}}=\frac{\varepsilon_{0}}{A_{m}}$$

The relative error is generally expressed as a fraction, i.e., 5 parts in 1000 or in percentage value,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { i.e., percentage error }=\varepsilon_{r} \times 100=\frac{\varepsilon_{0}}{A_{m}} \times 100 \\
& \boldsymbol{\delta} \boldsymbol{A}=\boldsymbol{A}_{\boldsymbol{m}}-\boldsymbol{A}_{\boldsymbol{t}} \\
& \boldsymbol{A}_{\boldsymbol{t}}=\boldsymbol{A}_{\boldsymbol{m}}-\boldsymbol{\delta} \boldsymbol{A} \\
& \quad=\boldsymbol{A}_{\boldsymbol{m}}-\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\mathbf{o}} \\
& \quad=\boldsymbol{A}_{\boldsymbol{m}}-\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{r}} \cdot \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{t}} \\
& \boldsymbol{A}_{m}=\boldsymbol{A}_{t} /\left(\mathbf{1}+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{\mathbf{r}}\right) \\
& \text { So, } \mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{t}}=\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{m}} / \mathbf{( 1 - \varepsilon _ { r } )}
\end{aligned}$$

The magnitude of a given quantity having a specifiea magnitude $A m$ and a maximum or a limiting error $\pm \delta \mathrm{A}$ must have a magnitude between the limits
$$\begin{array}{cc} 
& A_{m}-\delta A \text { and } A_{m}+\delta A \\
\text { or } & A=A_{m} \pm \delta A
\end{array}$$

Static correction ( $\delta C$ )
$$\begin{aligned}
& \delta C=\mathbf{A}_{t}-\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{m}} \\
& \mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{t}}=\text { true value } \\
& \mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{m}}=\text { measured value }
\end{aligned}$$

For example, the measured value of a resistance of $100 \Omega$ has a limiting error of $\pm 0.5 \Omega$. Then the true value of the resistance is between the limits $100 \pm 0.5$, i.e., 100.5 and $99.5 \Omega$.

\section*{EXAMPLE}

A voltage has a true value of 1.5 V on an analog indicating meter with a range 0 to 2.5 V shows a voltage of 1.46 V . Determine the value of absolute error and correction. Express the error as a fraction of true value \& full scale defection
Ans : Abs. Error $=-0.04$, correction $=0.04$
relative error for true value $=2.67 \%$
relative error for full scale deflection $=1.6 \%$

\section*{EXAMPLE}

A 0-25 A ammeter has a guaranteed accuracy of 1 percent of full scale reading. The current measured by this instrument is 10 A . Determine the limiting error in percentage.

Solution The magnitude of limiting error of the instrument is $\delta A=\varepsilon r \times A=0.01 \times 25=0.25 \mathrm{~A}$
The magnitude of the current being measured is 10 A . The relative error at this current is
$$\varepsilon_{r}=\frac{\delta A}{A}=\frac{0.25}{10}=0.025$$

Therefore, the current being measured is between the limit of
$$A=A_{m}\left(1 \pm \varepsilon_{r}\right)=10(1 \pm 0.025)=10 \pm 0.25 \mathrm{~A}$$

The limiting error $=\frac{0.25}{10} \times 100=2.5 \%$

\section*{EXAMPLE}

The inductance of an inductor is specified as $20 \mathrm{H} \pm 5$ percent b by a manufacturer. Determine the limits of inductance between which it is guaranteed.

\section*{Solution}

Relativc crror, $\boldsymbol{e}_{r}=\frac{\text { Percentage error }}{100}=\frac{5}{100}=0.05$
Limiting value of inductance, $A=A_{m} \pm \delta \mathrm{A}$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =A_{m} \pm \varepsilon_{r} A_{m}=A_{m}\left(1 \pm \varepsilon_{r}\right) \\
& =20(1 \pm 0.05)=20 \pm 1 \mathrm{H}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{EXAMPLE}

A $0-250 \mathrm{~V}$ voltmeter has a guaranteed accuraĉy of $2 \%$ of full-scale reading. The voltage measured by the voltmeter is 150 volts. Determine the limiting error in percentage.
Solution The magnitude of the limiting error of the instrument
$$\delta A=\varepsilon_{r} V=0.02 \times 250=5.0 \mathrm{~V}$$

The magnitude of the voltage being measured is 150 V .
The percentage limiting error at this voltage
$$=\frac{5.0}{1.50} \times 100 \%=3.33 \%$$

\section*{EXAMPLE}

The measurand value of a resistance is $10.25 \Omega$, whereas its value is $10.22 \Omega$. Determine the absolute error of the measurement.

\section*{Solution}

Measurand value $A_{m}=10.25 \Omega$
True value $A_{m}=10.22 \Omega$
Absolute error, $\delta A=A_{m}-A=10.25-10.22=0.03 \Omega$

\section*{EXAMPLE}

The measured value of a capacitor is $205.3 \mu \mathrm{~F}$, whereas its true value is $201.4 \mu \mathrm{~F}$. Determine the relative error.

\section*{Solution}

Measured value $A_{m}=205.3 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~F}$
True value, $\mathrm{A}=201.4 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~F}$
Absolute error, $\varepsilon_{0}=A_{m}-A$
$$\begin{aligned}
& =205.3 \times 10^{-6}-201.4 \times 10^{-6} \\
& =3.9 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~F} \\
& =3.9 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~F}
\end{aligned}$$

Relative error, $\varepsilon_{r}=\frac{\varepsilon_{0}}{A}=\frac{3.9 \times 10^{-6}}{201.4 \times 10^{-6}}=0.0194$ or $1.94 \%$

\section*{EXAMPLE}

A wattmeter reads 25.34 watts. The absolute error in the measurement is -0.11 watt. Determine the true value of power.

\section*{Solution}

Measured value $A_{m}=25.34 \mathrm{~W}$
Absolute error $\delta \mathrm{A}=-0.11 \mathrm{~W}$
True value $A=$ Measured value - Absolute errgr
$$\begin{aligned}
& =25.34-(-0.11), \\
& =25.45 \mathrm{~W}
\end{aligned}$$
$m$ Example 1.5 : A $0-50 \mathrm{~V}$ voltmeter is specified to be accurate within $\pm 1 \%$ of full scale. Calculate the limiting error when the instrument reading is 15 V .

Solution : The limiting error at full scale is,
$$\begin{aligned}
\delta \mathrm{A} & = \pm 1 \% \text { of } 50 \\
& = \pm \frac{1}{100} \times 50 \\
& = \pm 0.5 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}$$

For a reading of 15 V , it is
$$\% e=\frac{0.5}{15} \times 100=3.33 \%$$

Thus as reading is less than full scale, the limiting error is more.
$m$ Example $1.8:$ An ammeter reads 8.3 A and the true value of the current is 8.5 A . Determine the absolute error and relative percentage error.

\section*{Solution :}
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}} & =\text { true value }=8.5 \mathrm{~A} \\
\mathrm{~A}_{\mathrm{m}} & =\text { measured value }=8.3 \mathrm{~A} \\
\text { Absolute error } & =\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}}-\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{m}}=8.5-8.3=0.2 \mathrm{~A} \\
\% \mathrm{e} & =\frac{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}}-\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\mathrm{~A}_{\mathrm{t}}} \times 100=\frac{0.2}{8.5} \times 100=2.35 \%
\end{aligned}$$
$m$ Example 1.9 : A voltmeter reads 111.5 V . The error taken from an error curve is $5.3 \%$. Find the true value of the voltage.
$$\text { Solution : } \begin{array}{rlrl} 
& \mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{m}} & =111.5 \mathrm{~V} \\
\% \mathrm{e} & =5.3 \% \\
\text { Now } & \% \mathrm{e} & =\frac{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}}-\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\mathrm{~A}_{\mathrm{t}}} \times 100 \\
\therefore & 5.3 & =\frac{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}}-111.5}{\mathrm{~A}_{\mathrm{t}}} \times 100 \\
\therefore & 0.053 \mathrm{~A}_{\mathrm{t}} & =\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}}-111.5 \\
\therefore \quad & \mathrm{~A}_{\mathrm{t}} & =117.74 \mathrm{~V}
\end{array}$$
$m$ Example 1.10: A $0-100 \mathrm{~V}$ voltmeter has 200 scale divisions which can be read to $1 / 2$ division. Determine the resolution of the meter in volt.

\section*{Solution :}

1 scale division $=\frac{\text { full scale division }}{\text { number of divisions }}=\frac{100}{200}=0.5 \mathrm{~V}$
$\therefore \quad$ Resolution $=\frac{1}{2} \times$ scale division $=\frac{1}{2} \times 0.5$
$$=0.25 \mathrm{~V}$$
$m$ Example 1.11: A $0-10$ A ammeter has an accuracy of $1.5 \%$ of full scale reading. The current indicated by the ammeter isp,2.5 A. Calculate the limiting values of current and percentage limiting error.
Solution : $\quad \delta_{\mathrm{A}}= \pm 1.5 \%$ of fîll scale reading
$$\begin{aligned}
& = \pm \frac{1.5}{100} \times 10 \\
& = \pm 0.15 \mathrm{~A}
\end{aligned}$$

Hence the limiting values of current are,
$$I=2.5 \pm 0.15 \mathrm{~A}=2.35 \mathrm{~A}, 2.65 \mathrm{~A}$$

The percentage limiting error is,
$$\begin{aligned}
\% \mathrm{e} & =\frac{\delta_{\mathrm{A}}}{\mathrm{~A}_{\mathrm{S}}} \times 100=\frac{0.15}{2.5} \times 100 \\
& =6 \%
\end{aligned}$$
$m$ Example 1.12 : Three resistances are specified as :
$$R_{1}=200 \Omega \pm 5 \%, \quad R_{2}=100 \Omega \pm 5 \%, R_{3}=50 \Omega \pm 5 \%$$

Determine the magnitude of the resultant resistance and the limiting error in percentage and in ohms if the resistances are connected in series.

Solution : The resistances are in series,
$$\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}} & =\mathrm{R}_{1}+\mathrm{R}_{2}+\mathrm{R}_{3}=200+100+50 \\
& =350 \Omega \\
\mathrm{e}_{1} & =\mathrm{e}_{2}=\mathrm{e}_{3}=5 \% \\
\mathrm{a}_{1} & =\mathrm{R}_{1}=200 \Omega \\
\mathrm{a}_{2} & =\mathrm{R}_{2}=100 \Omega \\
\mathrm{a}_{3} & =\mathrm{R}_{3}=50 \Omega \\
\% \quad \mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{T}} & =\left[\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}} \cdot \mathrm{e}_{1}+\frac{\mathrm{R}_{2}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}} \cdot \mathrm{e}_{2}+\frac{\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}} \cdot \mathrm{e}_{3}\right]=\left[\frac{200}{350} \cdot 5 \%+\frac{100}{350} \cdot 5 \%+\frac{50}{350} \cdot 5 \%\right] \\
& =5 \% \times\left[\frac{350}{350}\right]=5 \%
\end{aligned}$$

Thus the limiting error in percentage is,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{e}_{1} & =\mathrm{e}_{2}=\mathrm{e}_{3}=5 \% \\
\mathrm{a}_{1} & =\mathrm{R}_{1}=200 \Omega \\
\mathrm{a}_{2} & =\mathrm{R}_{2}=100 \Omega \\
\mathrm{a}_{3} & =\mathrm{R}_{3}=50 \Omega \\
\therefore \quad \% \mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{T}} & =\left[\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}} \cdot \mathrm{e}_{1}+\frac{\mathrm{R}_{2}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}} \cdot \mathrm{e}_{2}+\frac{\mathrm{R}_{3}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}} \cdot \mathrm{e}_{3}\right]=\left[\frac{200}{350} \cdot 5 \%+\frac{100}{350} \cdot 5 \%+\frac{50}{350} \cdot 5 \%\right] \\
& =5 \% \times\left[\frac{350}{350}\right]=5 \%
\end{aligned}$$

Thus the limiting error in percentage is,
$$\begin{array}{rlrl}
\mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{T}} & = \pm \mathbf{5 \%} \\
\text { Now } & \% \mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{T}} & =\frac{\delta \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}} \times 100 \\
\therefore & 5 & =\frac{\delta \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}}{350} \times 100 \\
\therefore \quad & \quad \delta \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}} & =\frac{5 \times 350}{100}= \pm 17.5 \Omega
\end{array}$$

Thus $\pm 17.5 \Omega$ is the limiting error in ohms.
$m$ Example 1.14: The two resistances are specified as,
$R_{l}=36 \Omega \pm 5 \%$ and $R_{2}=75 \Omega \pm 5 \%$
Calculate the magnitude of limiting error in ohms and in percent if the two resistors are connected in parallel.

Solution : When the two resistances are in parallel,
$$\begin{aligned}
R_{T} & =\frac{R_{1} R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}=\frac{36 \times 75}{36+75} \\
& =24.324 \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

Now to calculate the limiting error, consider
$$\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1} \mathrm{R}_{2}}{\left(\mathrm{R}_{1}+\mathrm{R}_{2}\right)}$$

For the product, the limiting errors get added.
$$\text { For } \begin{aligned}
R_{1} R_{2} \text { the } e_{1} & =5 \%+5 \% \\
& =10 \%
\end{aligned}$$

For the summation $R_{1}+R_{2}$ the error is,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{e}_{2} & =\left[\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\mathrm{R}_{1}+\mathrm{R}_{2}} \cdot(\text { error of } 1)+\frac{\mathrm{R}_{2}}{\mathrm{R}_{1}+\mathrm{R}_{2}} \cdot(\text { error of } 2)\right. \\
& =\frac{36}{111} \times 5 \%+\frac{75}{111} \times 5 \% \\
& =5 \%
\end{aligned}$$

Now $R_{T}$ which is the quotient of $\left(R_{1} R_{2}\right)$ and $\left(R_{1}+R_{2}\right)$ the resultant error is addition of two errors.
$$\therefore \quad \mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{T}}=10 \%+5 \%=15 \text { 政 }$$

Thus the resultant limiting error is $\pm 15 \%$.
The magnitude of the limiting error can be obtained as,
$$\begin{array}{rlrl}
\mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{T}} & =\frac{\delta \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}} \\
\therefore & 0.15 & =\frac{\delta \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}}{24.324} \\
\therefore & \delta \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}} & =0.15 \times 24.324 \\
& & = \pm 3.65 \Omega
\end{array}$$

It is the product of two measurements $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$, hence the resultant error is,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{T}} & = \pm\left[\mathrm{e}_{1}+\mathrm{e}_{2}\right]= \pm\left[\frac{1}{40}+\frac{2.5}{125}\right]= \pm 0.045 \\
\therefore \quad \mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{T}} & = \pm 4.5 \%
\end{aligned}$$
$m$ Example 1.15 : A voltmeter reads 40 V on its 50 V range while an ammeter reads 50 mA on its 125 mA range, while used in a circuit. Both the instruments are guaranteed to be accurate within $\pm 2 \%$ at full scale deflection. Determine the limiting error of the power calculated.
Solution : For a voltmeter the limiting error is $2 \%$ at full scale i.e. 50 V
$$\therefore \quad \delta a_{1}=\frac{2}{100} \times 50=1 \mathrm{~V}$$

For an ammeter, the limiting error is $2 \%$ at full scale i.e. 125 mA
$$\therefore \quad \delta a_{2}=\frac{2}{100} \times 125=2.5 \mathrm{~mA}$$

Hence the relative limiting error in voltmeter reading is,
$$e_{1}=\frac{\delta a_{1}}{A_{1}}=\frac{1}{40}$$

While the relative limiting error in ammeter reading is,
$$\mathrm{e}_{2}=\frac{\delta \mathrm{a}_{2}}{\mathrm{~A}_{2}}=\frac{2.5}{125}$$

Now $\quad \mathrm{P}=\mathrm{V}$ I

It is the product of two measurements $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$, hence the resultant error is,
$$\begin{aligned}
& e_{T}= \pm\left[e_{1}+e_{2}\right]= \pm\left[\frac{1}{40}+\frac{2.5}{125}\right]= \pm 0.045 \\
& \therefore \quad \mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{T}}= \pm 4.5 \%
\end{aligned}$$
$m$ Example 1.16 : A particular bridge gives the value of the unknown resistance as,
$$R_{x}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3}}{R_{I}}$$

The values of the known resistances are,
$$\begin{aligned}
& R_{1}=120 \pm 0.1 \% \quad \Omega \\
& R_{2}=2700 \pm 0.5 \% \Omega \\
& R_{3}=470 \pm 0.5 \% \quad \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

Determine the magnitude of the unknown resistance and the limiting error in percent and in ohms for the unknown resistance $R_{x}$.
Solution : The unknown resistance is,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}} & =\frac{\mathrm{R}_{2} \mathrm{R}_{3}}{\mathrm{R}_{1}}=\frac{2700 \times 470}{120} \\
& =10575 \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

Now the relative limiting error in $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}$ is,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{T}} & = \pm\left[\mathrm{e}_{1}+\mathrm{e}_{2}+\mathrm{e}_{3}\right]= \pm[0.1+05+05] \\
& = \pm 1.1 \%
\end{aligned}$$

Now $\quad \mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{T}}= \pm \frac{\delta \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}} \times 100$
$$\begin{array}{rlrl} 
& \therefore & 1.1 & = \pm \frac{\delta \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}}{10575} \times 100 \\
\therefore & \delta \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}} & = \pm \mathbf{1 1 6 . 3 2 5} \Omega
\end{array}$$

Hence the guaranteed values of the resistance is between,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}-\delta \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}<\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}<\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}+\delta \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}} \\
& \therefore 10575-116.325<\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}<10575+116.325 \\
& \therefore \quad 10458.675<\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}<10691.325
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{EXAMPLE}

A voltmeter, having a sensitivity of $1,000 / \mathrm{V}$, reads 100 V on its $150-\mathrm{V}$ scale when connected across an unknown resistor in series with a milliammeter. When the milliammeter reads 5 mA , calculate
1. apparent resistance of the unknown resistor,
2. actual resistance of the unknown resistor,
3. error due to the loading effect of the voltmeter.
1. The total circuit resistance equals
$$R_{T}=\frac{V_{T}}{I_{T}}=\frac{100 \mathrm{~V}}{5 \mathrm{~mA}}=20 \mathrm{k} \Omega$$

Neglecting the resistance of the milliammeter, the value of the unknown resistor is $R_{X}=20 \mathrm{k} \Omega$
2. The voltmeter resistance equals
$$R_{V}=1000 \frac{\Omega}{\mathrm{~V}} \times 150 \mathrm{~V}=150 \mathrm{k} \Omega$$

Since the voltmeter is in parallel with the unknown resistance, we can write
$$R_{X}=\frac{R_{T} R_{V}}{R_{V}-R_{T}}=\frac{20 \times 150}{130}=23.05 \mathrm{k} \Omega$$
3. Error
$$\% \text { Error }=\frac{\text { actual }- \text { apparent }}{\text { actual }} \times 100 \%=\frac{23.05-20}{23.05} \times 100 \%=13.23 \%$$

Repeat the above Example if the milliammeter reads 800 mA and the voltmeter reads 40 V on its $150-\mathrm{V}$ scale.
1. The total circuit resistance equals
$$R_{T}=\frac{V_{T}}{I_{T}}=\frac{40(\mathrm{~d}}{0.8 \mathrm{~A}}=50 \Omega$$
2. The voltmeter resistance equals
$$R_{V}=1 \odot 000 \frac{\partial}{\gamma} \times 150 \mathrm{~V}=159 \mathrm{k} \Omega$$

Since the voltmeter is in parallel with the unknown resigtance, we can write
$$R_{X}=\frac{R_{T} R_{V}}{R_{V}-R_{T}}=\frac{50 \times 150}{149.95}=50.1 \Omega$$
3. Error
$$\% \text { Error }=\frac{\text { actual }- \text { apparent }}{\text { actual }} \times 100 \%=\frac{50.1-50}{50.1} \times 100 \%=0.2 \%$$

\section*{ERRORS IN MEASUREMENT}

The types (classification) of errors are follows
i) Gross errors
ii) Systematic errors
iii) Random errors

\section*{Gross Errors:}

The gross errors mainly occur due to carelessness or lack of experience of a human begin. These errors also occur due to incorrect adjustments of instruments.These errors cannot be treated mathematically These errors are also called personal errors'.

\section*{Ways to minimize gross errors:}

The complete elimination of gross errors is not possible but one can minimize them by the following ways: Taking great care while taking the reading, recording the reading \& calculating the result Without depending on only one reading, at least three or more readings must be taken * preferably by different persons.

\section*{Systematic errors:}

A constant uniform deviation of the operation of an instrument is known as a Systematic error. The Systematic errors are mainly due to the short comings of the instrument \& the characteristics of the material use d in the instrument, such a s defective or worn parts, ageing effects, environmental effects, etc. The systematic errors can be subdivided as static and dynamic errors. The static errors are caused by the limitations of the measuring device while the dynamic errors are caused by the instrument not responding fast enough to follow the changes in the variable to be measured.

\section*{Types of Systematic errors:}

There are three types of Systematic errors
i) Instrumental errors
ii) Environmental errors
iii) Observational errors

\section*{Instrumental errors:}

These errors can be mainly due to the following three reasons:
a) Short comings of instruments:

These are because of the mechanical structure of the instruments. For example friction in the bearings of various moving parts; irregular spring tensions, reductions in due to improper handling , hysteresis, gear backlash, stretching of spring, variations in air gap, etc .,

\section*{Ways to minimize this error:}

These errors can be avoided by the following methods:
(a) Selecting a suitable instrument for the particular measurement applications.
(b) Applying correction factors after determining the amount of instrumental error.
(c) Calibrating the instrument against a standard.
b) Misuse of instruments:

A good instrument if used in abnormal way gives misleading results. Poor initial adjustment, Improper zero setting, using leads of high resistance etc., are the examples of misusing a good instrument. Such things do not cause the permanent damage to the instruments but definitely cause the serious errors.
Instrumental errors can be avoided by

\section*{C) Loading effects}

Loading effects due to im proper way of using the instrument cause the serious errors. The best ex ample of such loading effect error is connecting a w ell calibrated volt meter across the two points of high resistance circuit. The same volt meter connected in a low resistance circuit gives accurate reading.

\section*{Ways to minimize this error:}

Thus the err ors due to the loading effect can be avoided by using an instrument intelligently and correctly.

\section*{Environmental errors:}

These errors are due to the conditions external to the measuring instrument. The various factors resulting these environmental errors are temperature changes, pressure changes, thermal emf, ageing of equipment and frequency sensitivity of an instrument.

\section*{Ways to minimize this error:}
i) Using the proper correction factors and using the information supplied by the manufacturer of the instrument
ii) Using the arrangement which will keep the surrounding conditions Constant
iii) Reducing the effect of dust ,humidity on the components by hermetically sealing the components in the instruments
iv) The effects of external fields can be minimized by using the magnetic or electro static shields or screens
v) Using the equipment which is immune to such environmental effects.

\section*{Observational errors:}

These are the errors introduced by the observer.
These are many sources of observational errors such as parallax error while reading a meter, wrong scale selection, etc.
Following are some of the reasons for observational errors
(a) Construction of the Scale : There is a possibility of error due to the division of the scale not being uniform and clear.
(b) Fitness and Straightness of the Pointer : If the pointer is not fine and straight, then it always gives the error in the reading.
(c) Parallax : Without a mirror under the pointer there may parallax error in reading.
(d) Efficiency or Skillness of the Observer : Error in the reading is largely dependent upon the skillness of the observer by which reading is noted accurately.

\section*{Ways to minimize this error}

To eliminate such errors one should use the instruments with mirrors, knife edged pointers, etc.,

\section*{Random errors:}

Some errors still result, though the systematic and instrumental errors are reduced or at least accounted for. The causes of such errors are unknown and hence the errors are called random errors.

\section*{Ways to minimize this error}

The only way to reduce these errors is by increasing the number of observations and using the statistical methods to obtain the best approximation of the reading.

NOTE:
In general, systematic errors can be subdivided into static and dynamic errors.
Static error - caused by limitations of the measuring device or the physical laws governing its behavior.
Dynamic error - caused by the instrument not responding very fast enough to follow the changes in a measured variable.

\section*{Error due to Other Factors}

\section*{Temperature Variation}

Variation in temperature not only changes the values of the parameters but also brings changes in the reading of the instrument. For a consistent error, the temperature must be constant.
Effect of the Time on Instruments

There is a possibility of change in calibration error in the instrument with time. This may be called ageing of the instrument.

\section*{Effect of External Electrostatic and Magnetic Fields}

These electrostatic and magnetic fields influence the readings of instruments. These effects can be minimized by proper shielding.

\section*{Mechanical Error}

Friction between stationary and rotating parts and residual torsion in suspension wire cause errors in instruments. So, checking should be applied. Generally, these errors may be checked from time to time.

\section*{DC VOLTAGE AND CURRENT MEASUREMENT.}

\section*{Principle And Types Of Analog And Digital Voltmeters}

Ø Basically an electrical indicating instrument is divided into two types. They are i) Analog instruments
ii) Digital Instruments.

Ø Analog instruments are nothing but its output is the deflection of pointer, which is proportional to its input.
Ø Digital Instruments are its output is in decimal form.
Ø The action of all ammeters and voltmeters, with the exception of electrostatic type of instruments, depends upon a deflecting torque produced by an electric current.
Ø Thus all analog voltmeters and ammeters are essentially curfent measuring devices.

\section*{The essential requirements of a measuring instrument are}
(i) That its introduction into the circuit, where measurements are to be made, does not alter the circuit conditions ;
(ii) The power consumed by them for their operation is small.

\section*{Advantages of digital meters over analoghéters.}
1. They are more accurate than anal®g multimeters.
2. They reduce reading and interpolation errors.
3. The 'auto-polarity' function can prevent problenfs from connecting the meter to a test circuit with the wrong polarity.
4. Parallax errors are eliminated. If the pointer of an analog multimeter is viewed from a different angle, you will see a different value. This is farallax error. A digital multimeter's numerical display solves this problem
5. Digital multimeter displays have no moving parts. This makes them free from wear and shock failures.
6. The reading speed is increased as it is easier to read.
7. Unlike analog multimeters, zero adjustment is not required.
8. Digital output is suitable for further processing or recording and can be useful in a rapidly increasing range of computer controlled applications.
9. With the advent of Integrated circuits, the size, cost and power requirements of digital multimeters has been drastically reduced.
10. Accuracy is increased due to digital readout. You can make mistake in reading the scale in analog multimeter, but digital multimeters have a LCD display to show accurate reading.
11. DMMs can be used in testing continuity, capacitors, diodes and transistors. More advanced digital multimeters can also measure frequency.
12. The 'auto-ranging' feature of a digital multimeter helps in selecting different measurement ranges, which can prevent damage to the meter if the wrong range is selected.
13. Portable size makes it easy to carry anywhere.
14. They cause less meter loading effects on the circuits being tested.
15. Some advanced digital multimeters have microprocessors and can store the readings for further processing. 16. They have very high input impedance.
17.

\section*{Disadvantages of Digital Multimeters(DMM)}
1. The LCD display depends on a battery or external power source. When the battery is low, the display will be dim, making it difficult to read.
2. In case of fluctuations or transients, it can record an error.
3. Warming of the meter during its use can change its properties leading to errors in measured value.
4. The A/D converter has a limitation on word length which can cause quantization noise giving rise to error in measured value.
5. There is a voltage limitation. If it is increased beyond the limit, the meter will be damaged.
6. The digital nature makes it unsuitable for adjusting tuning circuits or peaking tunable responses.
7. They are expensive due to high manufacturing cost.

In spite of above mentioned disadvantages, the digital multimeters are gaining popularity and are most widely used

\section*{Advantage of PMMC instrument}
1. Uniform scale.
2. Very effective eddy current damping
3. Power consumption is low.
4. No hysteresis loss.
5. They are not affected by stray field.
6. Require small operating current.
7. Accurate and reliable.

\section*{Disadvantage of PMMC instrument}
1. Only used for D.C measurement.
2. Costlier compared to moving iron instrubfeent.
3. Some errors are caused due to the agiag of the control springs and the permanent magnets.

\section*{Errors in moving iron instrument}
1) Hysteresis error: Due to hysteresis effect, the tux density for the same current while ascending and descending values is different. While descending, the flux density is higher and while ascending it is lesser. So frneter reads higher for descending values of current or voltage. So remedy for this is to use smaller iron parts which can demagnetise quickly or to work with lower flux densities.
2) Temperature error : The temperature error arises due to the effect of temperature on the temperature coefficient of the spring. This error is of the order of $0.02 \%$ per oC change in temperature. Errors can cause due to self heating of the coil and due to which change in resistance of the coil. So coil and series resistance must have low temperature coefficient. Hence mangnin is generally used for the series resistance.
3) Stray magnetic Field Error : The operating magnetic field in case of moving iron instruments is very low. Hence effect of external i.e. stray magnetic field can cause error. This effect depends on the direction of the stray magnetic field with respect to the operating field of the instrument.
4) Frequency Error : These are related to a.c. operation of the instrument. The change in frequency affects the reactance of the working coil and also affects the magnitude of the eddy currents. This cause error in the instrument.
5) Eddy Current Error : When instrument is used for a.c. measurements the eddy currents are produced in the iron parts of the instrument. The eddy current affects the instrument current causing the change in the deflection torque. This produce the error in the meter reading. As eddy current are frequency dependent, frequency changes cause eddy current error.

\section*{Analog Meters: Galvanometers}

Analog meters have a needle that swivels to point at numbers on a scale, as opposed to digital meters, which have numerical readouts similar to a hand-held calculator. The heart of most analog meters is a device called a galvanometer, denoted by G. Current flow through a galvanometer, IG , produces a proportional needle deflection. (This deflection is due to the force of a magnetic field upon a current-carrying wire.) This movement of coil is called D'Arsonval movement and basic meter is called D'Arsonval galvanometer.

The two crucial characteristics of a given galvanometer are its resistance and current sensitivity. Current sensitivity is the current that gives a full-scale deflection of the galvanometer's needle, the maximum current that the instrument can measure. For example, a galvanometer with a current sensitivity of $50 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ has a maximum deflection of its needle when $50 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ flows through it, reads half-scale when $25 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ flows through it, and so on. If such a galvanometer has a $25-\Omega$ resistance, then a voltage of only $V=I R=(50 \mu \mathrm{~A})(25 \Omega)=1.25 \mathrm{mV}$ produces a full-scale reading. By connecting resistors to this galvanometer in different ways, you can use it as either a voltmeter or ammeter that can measure a broad rangeeof voltages or currents.

\section*{Galvanometer as an Ammeter}

The same galvanometer can also be made into ag ammeter by placing it in parallel with a small resistance $R$, often called the shunt resistance, Since the shunt resistance is small, most of the current passes through it, allowing an ammeter to measure currents mish greater than thase producing a full-scale deflection of the galvanometer.

- Current I gets split into $\mathrm{I}_{\text {shunt }}$ and $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{G}}$. Shunt also reduces resistance of the ammeter:
$$\frac{1}{R_{A}}=\frac{1}{R_{G}}+\frac{1}{R_{\text {SHUNT }}} \quad R_{A}=\frac{R_{G} R_{\text {SHUNT }}}{R_{G}+R_{\text {SHUNT }}}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-039.jpg?height=274&width=619&top_left_y=2053&top_left_x=262)

The shunt resistance can be calculated as :
Let $\quad$\begin{tabular}{rl}
$\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}$ & $=$ Internal resistance of coil \\
$\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{sh}}$ & $=$ Shunt resistance \\
$\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}$ & $=$ Full scale deflection current \\
$\mathrm{I}_{\text {sh }}$ & $=$ Shunt current \\
Now $\quad I$ & $=$ Total current \\
I & $=\mathrm{I}_{\text {sh }}+\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}$
\end{tabular}

As the two resistances $R_{\text {sh }}$ and $R_{m}$ are in parallel, the voltage drop across them is same.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad \mathrm{I}_{\text {sh }} \mathrm{R}_{\text {sh }}=\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}} \\
& \therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\text {sh }}=\frac{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\mathrm{I}_{\text {sh }}} \\
& \text { but } \quad I_{\text {sh }}=I-I_{m} \\
& \therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\text {sh }}=\frac{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\left(\mathrm{I}-\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\text {sh }}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\mathrm{~m}-1} \quad \text { where } \quad \mathrm{m}=\frac{\mathrm{I}}{\mathrm{Im}} 3$$

The $m$ is called multiplying power of $\backslash$ the shunt and defingd as the ratio of total current to the current through the coil. It can be expressed as,
$$m=\frac{I}{I_{m}}=1+\frac{R_{m}}{R_{s h i}} S$$

Example: what shunt resistance is required for an ammeter to have a resistance of $10 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$, if the galvanometer resistance is $60 \Omega$ ?
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{R_{A}}=\frac{1}{R_{G}}+\frac{1}{R_{S}} \\
& \frac{1}{R_{S}}=\frac{1}{R_{A}}-\frac{1}{R_{G}}
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-040.jpg?height=283&width=606&top_left_y=1542&top_left_x=548)
$$R_{S}=\frac{R_{G} R_{A}}{R_{G}-R_{A}}=\frac{(60)(.01)}{60-.01}=\underset{\text { (actualy } 0.010002 \Omega \text { ) }}{0.010 \Omega}$$

Example: an ammeter is needed that gives a full-scale deflection for 1.0 A , and contains the same $25-\Omega$ galvanometer with its $50-\mu \mathrm{A}$ sensitivity. Since $R_{s}$ and $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{G}}$ are in parallel, the voltage across them is the same. These $I R_{s}$ drops are $I R_{s}=I G R_{G}$ so that $I R_{s}=I G I=R_{s} R_{G}$. Solving for $R_{s}$, and noting that $I G$ is $50 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and $I$ is 0.999950 A, we have $R_{S}=R_{G} I G I=(25 \Omega) 50 \mu \mathrm{~A} 0.999950 \mathrm{~A}=1.25 \times 10-3 \Omega$.
$\omega$ Example 4.3 : A 2 mA meter with an internal resistance of $100 \Omega$ is to be converted to 0-150 mA ammeter. Calculate the value of the shunt resistance required.
Solution : Given values are,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}} & =100 \Omega, \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}=2 \mathrm{~mA}, \mathrm{I}=150 \mathrm{~mA} \\
\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{sh}} & =\frac{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\mathrm{I}-\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}} \\
\therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\text {sh }} & =\frac{2 \times 10^{-3} \times 100}{\left[150 \times 10^{-3}-2 \times 10^{-3}\right]} \\
& =1.351 \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Loading Effect of ammeter on circuit}

To measure current, connect ammeter in series
- any ammeter has some resistance $r$.
- current in presence of ammeter is $\frac{\Phi}{\Phi}=\frac{\mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{r}}$.
- current without the ammeter would be $I=\frac{V}{R}$.

To minimize error, ammeter resistance r must be very small. (ideal ammeter would have zero resistance)
Example: an ammeter of resistance $10 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$ is used to measure the current through a $10 \Omega$ resistor in series with a 3 V battery that has an internal resistance of $0.5 \Omega$. What is the relative (percent) error caused by the ammeter?

Actual current without ammeter:
$$\begin{gathered}
I=\frac{V}{R+r} \\
I=\frac{3}{10+0.5} \mathrm{~A} \\
I=0.2857 \mathrm{~A}=285.7 \mathrm{~mA}

You might see the symbol $\varepsilon$ used instead of $V$.

\section*{Galvanometer as a Voltmeter}
voltmeter can be made from galvanometer in series with a large resistance
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-042.jpg?height=634&width=1080&top_left_y=902&top_left_x=117)

The multiplier resistance can be calculated as :
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{m}} & =\text { Internal resistance of coil i.e. meter } \\
\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{s}} & =\text { Series multiplier resistance } \\
\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} & =\text { Full scale deflection current } \\
\mathrm{V} & =\text { Full range voltage to be measured }
\end{aligned}$$
.17, $\quad \therefore \mathrm{V}=\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}\left(\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}+\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{s}}\right)$
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{V} & =\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}+\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{s}} \\
\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{s}} & =\mathrm{V}-\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{s}}=\frac{\mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}}-\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}$$
$\Rightarrow$ Example 4.5: A moving coil instrument gives a full scale deflection with a current of $40 \mu A$, while the internal resistance of the meter is $500 \Omega$. It is to be used as a voltmeter to measure a voltage range of 0-10 V. Calculate the multiplier resistance needed.
Solution : Given values are, $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}=500 \Omega, \quad \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}=40 \mu \mathrm{~A}$ and $\quad \mathrm{V}=10 \mathrm{~V}$
Now
$$R_{s}=\frac{V}{I_{m}}-R_{m}=\frac{10}{40 \times 10^{-6}}-500=249.5 \mathrm{k} \Omega$$

This is the required multiplier resistance.

\section*{LOADING EFFECTS OF VOLTMETER ON CIRCUIT}

When a voltmeter is used to measure the voltage across a circuit component the voltmeter circuit itself is in parallel with the circuit component. Since the parallel combination of two resistors is less than either resistor alone. The resistance seen by the source is less with the voltmeter connected than without. Therefore, the voltage across the component is less whenever the voltmeter is connected. The decrease in voltage may be negligible or it may be appreciable. depending on the sensitivity of the voltmeter being used. This effect is called voltmeter loading. The resulting error is called a loading error.

To measure voltage in a circuit connect voltmeter in parallel
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-043.jpg?height=497&width=442&top_left_y=559&top_left_x=145)
$\varepsilon=3 \mathrm{~V}$
- voltmeter has some resistance $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{V}}$
- current $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{V}}$ flows through voltmeter
- extra current changes voltage drop across r and thus $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{ab}} \mathrm{O}^{\circ}$

Example: a galvanometer of resistance $60 \Omega$ is used to meas ${ }^{6}$. series with an ideal 6 V battery and $a \hat{5} \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor. What is the relative error caused by the nonzero resistance of the galvanometer?

Actual voltage drop without instrument:
$$\begin{aligned}
& R_{\text {eq }}=R_{1}+R_{2}=15 \times 10^{3} \Omega \\
& I=\frac{V}{R_{\text {eq }}}=\frac{6 \mathrm{~V}}{15 \times 10^{3} \Omega}=0.4 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~A} \\
& V_{a b}=I R=\left(0.4 \times 10^{-3}\right)\left(10 \times 10^{3} \Omega\right)=4 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-043.jpg?height=372&width=442&top_left_y=1489&top_left_x=912)

The measurement is made with the galvanometer.
$60 \Omega$ and $10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistors in parallel are equivalent to $59.6 \Omega$ resistor.

Total equivalent resistance: $5059.6 \Omega$
Total current: $\mathrm{I}=1.186 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~A}$
$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{ab}}=6 \mathrm{~V}-\mathrm{IR}_{2}=0.07 \mathrm{~V}$.

The relative error is:
$\%$ Error $=\frac{4-.07}{4} \times 100=98 \%$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-044.jpg?height=535&width=443&top_left_y=231&top_left_x=890)

Example: a voltmeter of resistance $100 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ is used to measurre the voltage drop across a $10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor in series with an ideal 6 V battery and a $5 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistor. Whất is the percent error caused by the nonzero resistance of the voltmeter?

We already calculated the actual voltage drop (2 slides back).
$V_{a b}=I R=\left(0.4 \times 10^{-3}\right)\left(10 \times 10^{3} \Omega\right)=4 \mathrm{~V}$
$\mathrm{I}=1.19 \mathrm{~mA} \mathrm{~V}=6 \mathrm{~V}$
$=1.19 \mathrm{~mA}$ V $=6 \mathrm{~V}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-044.jpg?height=321&width=454&top_left_y=1176&top_left_x=906)

The measurement is now made with the "better" voltmeter.
$100 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ resistors in parallel are equivalent to an $9090 \Omega$ resistor.
Total equivalent resistance: $14090 \Omega$
Total current: $\mathrm{I}=4.26 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~A}$
The voltage drop from a to b : $6-\left(4.26 \times 10^{-4}\right)(5000)=3.87 \mathrm{~V}$.

The percent error is.
$\%$ Error $=\frac{4-3.87}{4} \times 100=3.25 \%$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-044.jpg?height=575&width=494&top_left_y=1683&top_left_x=978)
$\mathrm{I}=.426 \mathrm{~mA} \mathrm{~V}=6 \mathrm{~V}$
$m$ Example 1.13: A voltmeter having a sensitivity of $1.5 \mathrm{k} \Omega / v o l t$ reads 80 V on its 150 V range, when connected across an unknown resistor in series with a milliammeter. The ammeter reads 15 mA . Calculate
i) Apparent resistance
ii) Actual resistance of unknown resistor
iii) Error due to loading effect of voltmeter
iv) Percentage relative accuracy.
[JNTU, Dec.-2005]
Solution : The circuit diagram is shown in the Fig. 1.23.

The total circuit resistance, neglecting resistance of milliammeter is
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}} & =\frac{\mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{I}}=\frac{80}{15 \times 10^{-3}} \\
& =5.333 \mathrm{k} \Omega
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-045.jpg?height=321&width=559&top_left_y=574&top_left_x=962)
i) Thus the apparent value of the resistance is
$$\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{app}}=5.333 \mathrm{k} \Omega$$
ii) Let us calculate the actual $R_{x}$.

The resistance of the voltmeter be $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{v}}$.
$$\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{v}} & =1.5 \mathrm{k} \Omega / \text { volt } \times 150 \text { as } 150 \mathrm{~V} \text { is full scale reading. } \\
& =225 \mathrm{k} \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

Thus $\quad R_{T}=R_{x} \| R_{v}$
$\therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{T}}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{v}}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}+\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{v}}}$
$\therefore \quad 5.333=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}} \times 225}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}+225}$
$\therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}+225=42.19 \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}$
$\therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}=5.462 \mathrm{k} \Omega$
This is the actual value of the unknown resistance.
iii) $\%$ error $=\frac{A_{t}-A_{m}}{A_{t}} \times 100=\frac{5.462-5.333}{5.462} \times 100$
$$=2.36 \%$$
iv) The relative accuracy,
$$\begin{aligned}
\% A & =(1-\mid \text { Error } \mid) \times 100=(1-0.0236) \times 100 \\
& =97.63 \%
\end{aligned}$$
$m$ Example 1.11: A 0-100 V voltmeter has 200 scale divisions which can be read to $1 / 2$ division. Determine the resolution of the meter in volt.

Solution :
$$\begin{aligned}
1 \text { scale division } & =\frac{\text { Full scale division }}{\text { Number of divisions }}=\frac{100}{200}=0.5 \mathrm{~V} \\
\therefore \quad \text { Resolution } & =\frac{1}{2} \times \text { Scale division }=\frac{1}{2} \times 0.5 \\
& =0.25 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}$$
$m$ Example 1.9 : An ammeter reads 8.3 A and the true value of the current is 8.5 A . Determine the absolute error and relative percentage error.

Solution :
$$\begin{aligned}
A_{t} & =\text { True value }=8.5 \mathrm{~A} \\
A_{m} & =\text { Measured value }=8.3 \mathrm{~A}
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Absolute error } & =A_{t}-A_{m}=8.5-8.3=0.2 \mathrm{~A} \\
\% \mathrm{e} & =\frac{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}}-\mathrm{A}_{m}}{\mathrm{~A}_{t}} \times 100=\frac{0.2}{8.5} \times 100=2.35 \%
\end{aligned}$$
$\Rightarrow$ Example 1.10 : A voltmeter reads 111.5 V . The error taken from an error curve is $5.3 \%$. Find the true value of the voltage.

Solution : $\quad A_{m}=111.5 \mathrm{~V}$
$$\begin{array}{rlrl} 
& \% \mathrm{e} & =5.3 \% \\
\text { Now } & \% \mathrm{e} & =\frac{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}}-A_{m}}{A_{t}} \times 100 \\
& \therefore & 5.3 & =\frac{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}}-111.5}{A_{t}} \times 100 \\
& \therefore & 0.053 \mathrm{~A}_{\mathrm{t}} & =\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}}-111.5 \\
& \therefore & A_{t} & =117.74 \mathrm{~V}
\end{array}$$
$m$ Example 1.6 : A $0-50 \mathrm{~V}$ voltmeter is specified to be accurate within $\pm 1 \%$ of full scale. Calculate the limiting error when the instrument reading is 15 V .
Solution : The limiting error at full scale is,
$$\begin{aligned}
\delta \mathrm{A} & = \pm 1 \% \text { of } 50 \\
& = \pm \frac{1}{100} \times 50 \\
& = \pm 0.5 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}$$

For a reading of 15 V , it is
$$\% \mathrm{e}=\frac{0.5}{15} \times 100=3.33 \%$$

Thus as reading is less than full scale, the limiting error is more.

\section*{multirange ammeter}

The range of the basic d.c. ammeter can be extended by using number of shunts and a selector switch. Such ammeter is called multirange ammeter. The aryton shunt is used
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-047.jpg?height=473&width=916&top_left_y=346&top_left_x=155)
$m$ Example : Design a multirange d.c. milliammeter with a basic meter having a resistance $75 \Omega$ and full scale deflection for the current of 2 mA . The required ranges are $0-10 m A, 0-50 m A$ and $0-100 m A$.
Solution : The first range is $0-10 \mathrm{~mA}$,

While
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{I}_{1} & =10 \mathrm{~mA} \\
\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} & =2 \mathrm{~mA} \quad \text { and } \quad \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}} \hat{2}^{6} 75 \Omega
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{R}_{1} & =\frac{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\left(\mathrm{I}_{1}-\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}=\frac{2 \times 75}{(10 \times 2)} \\
& =18.75 \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

The second range is $0-50 \mathrm{~mA}$,
$$\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \mathrm{I}_{2} & =50 \mathrm{~mA} \\
\mathrm{R}_{2} & =\frac{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\left(\mathrm{I}_{2}-\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}=\frac{2 \times 75}{(50-2)} \\
& =3.125 \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

The third range is $0-100 \mathrm{~mA}$,
$$\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \mathrm{I}_{3} & =100 \mathrm{~mA} \\
& \mathrm{R}_{3}
\end{aligned}=\frac{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}}{\left(\mathrm{I}_{3}-\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}=\frac{2 \times 75}{(100-2)}=1.53 \Omega$$

The designed multirange ammeter with a selector switch is shown in the Fig. 2.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-047.jpg?height=364&width=665&top_left_y=2008&top_left_x=497)

\section*{Multirange voltmeters:}

The range of the basic d.c. voltmeter can be extended by using number of multipliers clnd a selector switch. Such a meter is called multirange voltmeter
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-048.jpg?height=516&width=1061&top_left_y=311&top_left_x=120)

The $\mathrm{R}_{1}, \mathrm{R}_{2}, \mathrm{R}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{R}_{4}$ are the four series multipliers. When connected in series with the meter, they can give four different voltage ranges as $V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{3}$ and $V_{4}$. The selector switch $S$ is multiposition switch by which the required multiplier can be selected in the circuit.

The mathematical analysis of basic d.c. voltmeter is equally applicable for such multirange voltmeter. Thus,
$$R_{1}=\frac{V_{1}}{I_{m}}-R_{m} \wedge^{\left\langle B_{2}=\right.} \frac{V_{2}}{I_{m}}-R_{m} \quad \text { and so on. }$$

A basic D'Arsonoval movement with an infernal resistance of $50 \Omega$ and a full scale deflection current of $2 m A$ is to bexused as a multirange voltmeter. Design the series string of multipliers to obtgin the voltage ranges of $0-10 \mathrm{~V}, 0-50 \mathrm{~V}$, $0-100 \mathrm{~V}, 0-500 \mathrm{~V}$.

Fig. 3.17
For a meter, $\quad R_{m}=50 \Omega$ and $I_{m}=2 \mathrm{~mA}$
For position $V_{4}=10 \mathrm{~V}$, Series multiplier is $\mathrm{R}_{4}$.
$$\begin{aligned}
\therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{4} & =\frac{\mathrm{V}_{4}}{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}}-\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}}=\frac{10}{2 \times 10^{-3}}-50 \quad \ldots . \text { as } \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{s}}=\frac{\mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}}-\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}} \\
& =4.95 \mathrm{k} \Omega \\
\text { For position } \mathrm{V}_{3} & =50 \mathrm{~V} \text {, series multiplier is }\left(\mathrm{R}_{4}+\mathrm{R}_{3}\right) . \\
\therefore \quad\left(\mathrm{R}_{4}+\mathrm{R}_{3}\right) & =\frac{\mathrm{V}_{3}}{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}}-\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}} \\
\mathrm{R}_{3} & =\frac{50}{2 \times 10^{-3}}-50-4950 \\
& =20 \mathrm{k} \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

For position $V_{2}=100 \mathrm{~V}$, series multiplier is $\left(R_{2}+R_{3}+R_{4}\right)$.
$$\begin{aligned}
\therefore & \left(\mathrm{R}_{2}+\mathrm{R}_{3}+\mathrm{R}_{4}\right) & =\frac{\mathrm{V}_{2}}{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}}-\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}} \\
\therefore & \mathrm{R}_{2} & =\frac{100}{2 \times 10^{-3}}-50-4950-20000 \\
& & =25 \mathrm{k} \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

For position $V_{1}=500 \mathrm{~V}$, multiplier is $\left(R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}+R_{4}\right)$.
$$\begin{array}{lll}
\therefore & \left(\mathrm{R}_{1}+\mathrm{R}_{2}+\mathrm{R}_{3}+\mathrm{R}_{4}\right) & =\frac{\mathrm{V}_{1}}{\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{m}}}-\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{m}} \\
\therefore & \mathrm{R}_{1} & =\frac{500}{2 \times 10^{-3}}-50-4950-25000-20000 \\
& \therefore & \mathrm{R}_{1}
\end{array}=200 \mathrm{k} \Omega \mathrm{l}$$

Thus $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ forms a series string of multipliers.

\section*{Key Points}
- A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuringefectrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit.
- An ammeter is a measuring device used to measure the electrie current in a circuit.
- A voltmeter is connected in parallel witha device to measure its voltage, while an ammeter is connected in series with a device to measure its surrent.
- At the heart of most analog meters $\dot{\alpha}$ a galvanometer, an instrument that measures current flow using the movement, or deflection, of a needle. The needle defíection is produced by a magnetic force acting on a current-carrying wire.
- shunt resistance: a small resistance R placed in parallel with a galvanometer G to produce an ammeter; the larger the current to be measured, the smaller R must be; most of the current flowing through the meter is shunted through R to protect the galvanometer
- galvanometer: An analog measuring device, denoted by G, that measures current flow using a needle deflection caused by a magnetic field force acting upon a current-carrying wire.

\section*{OHMMETER}

The PMMC (Permanent-Magnetic Moving-Coil Movement) can change to be ohmmeter with connected voltage source and limited current resistor in series. The type of Ohmmeter is series ohmmeter and parallel ohmmeter. The purpose of an ohmmeter is to measure the resistance placed between its leads. This resistance reading is indicated through a mechanical meter movement which operates on electric current.

\section*{SERIES OHMMETER}

\section*{Operation of Series Ohmmeter}

When $\mathrm{Rx}=0$ ( AB terminal short), the current in circuit is maximum and the pointer shown the full reading. Adjust the R2 until the full scale, IM. The pointer at full scale is mark as 0 ohm. When $\mathrm{Rx}=$ infinity ( AB

\section*{THE POINTER LOCATION}

EXAMPLE

Solution
$$\begin{aligned}
& R_{X}=\frac{V}{l}-\left(R_{1}+R_{M}+R_{2}\right) \\
& R_{X}=\frac{10 \mathrm{~V}}{0.5 \mathrm{~m}}-(500+100+400) \\
& R_{X}=19 \mathrm{~K} \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Null Measurements}

Null measurements balance voltages so there is no current flowing through the measuring devices that would interfere with the measurement. Standard measurements of voltage and current alter circuits, introducing numerical uncertainties. Voltmeters draw some extra current, whereas ammeters reduce current flow. Null measurements balance voltages, so there is no current flowing through the measuring device and the circuit is unaltered. Null measurements are generally more accurate but more complex than standard voltmeters and ammeters. Their precision is still limited.

\section*{Resistance Measurement Methods}

\section*{Types of Resistance:}
- The opposition to a steady current in a circuit is called as resistance.
- In electrical and electronic circuits, wide range of resistance values ( fractional ohm to several mega ohms) are used.
- There is no single method of measuring the entire range in one apparatus.

For the convenience of measurement, the resistances are classified as
1. Low Resistance of value less than 1 Ohm

Example The resistance of series filed windings ammeter shunts, cable resistance, machine armatures.
2. Medium Resistances of values 1 ohm to 10 Kohm

Example - Multiplier resistance, wire and cable resistance etc.
3. High resistances above 10 KOhm

Example - Cable porcelain insulators, Insulation resistance of machines etc,

\section*{Resistance Measurement Methods}

Several methods are available to measure the resistance in each class. Some basic methods are suitable for low as well as medium resistances. The methods are listed below.
(1) Measurement of Low Resistance
1. Ammeter- voltmeter method
2. Potentiometer method
3. Kelvin double bridge method
4. Ohm-meter method
(2) Measurement of Medium resistance
1. Ammeter- voltmeter method
2. Whetstone bridge method
3. Carey-Foster bridge method
(3) Measurement of high resistance

In electrical systems, the measurements of insulation resistance are very important among all high-resistance measurements. Some of the methods are
1. Megger Method
2. Direct deflection method with the use of high sensitivity galvanometer
3. Loss of charge method

\section*{Difficulties in measuring high resistances}
- Due to high resistance, very small current flows through measuring circuit which is difficult to sense.
- Presence of leakage currents.
- The stray charges appearing due to electrostatic effects.
- The delay time is required in the measurement so that charging and absorbing currents get stabilize. This time may be very long in some cases.
- The very high voltage is required to raise the magnitude of current. This may damage the galvanometer if proper case is not taken.

\section*{Measurement of Low Resistance by Ohmmeter Method:}

\section*{CONTINUITY TESTER}

A continuity tester is a simple device consisting of two testing probes and a light (LED) or buzzer indicator. It is used to detect the presence of continuity or a break in between the two ends of a conductor which is connected to its testing probes. A continuity tester consists of a battery in a housing, with a test probe connected to one end of the battery housing and a test wire with an alligator clip connected to the other end. It is used with the current turned off to determine whether a particular electrical component is carrying electricity and to pinpoint the cause of a problem.
To use a continuity tester, unplug the appliance and disassemble it to get at the component you want to test. Fasten the clip of the tester to one wire or connection of the component, and touch the probe to the other wire or connection. If the component is receiving electricity and transmitting it, the tester will light or buzz; this indicates that the circuit is continuous. If the tester doesn't light or buzz or it reacts only slightly, the component is faulty.

\section*{Ohmmeter Method for Measuring Resistance}

Ohmmeter is an electrical apparatus used to measure ©lectrical resistance. Ohmmeter is used to measure the value of resistance between any two points of an electric عiícuit. The PMMC (Permanent-Magnetic Moving-Coil Movement) can change to be ohmmeter with connected voltage source and limited current resistor in series. The type of Ohmmeter is series ohmmeter and parallel ohmmeter. The purpose of an ohmmeter is to measure the resistance placed between its leads. This resistance reading is indicated through a mechanical meter movement which operates on electric current.

There are two types of ohmmeters: series ohmmeter, and shunt ohmmeter.
In series type ohmmeter, the resistor whose value is unknown and to be measured should be connected in series with the ohmmeter. It is useful for measuring high values of resistances.
In shunt type ohmmeter, the resistor whose value is unknown and to be measured should be connected in parallel (shunt) with the ohmmeter. It is useful for measuring low values of resistances.
SERIES OHMMETER
$\mathrm{R}_{1}=$ Limited Current Resistor

When $\mathrm{Rx}=0$ ( AB terminal short), the current in circuit is maximum and the pointer shown the full reading. Adjust the R2 until the full scale, IM. The pointer at full scale is mark as 0 ohm. When $\mathrm{Rx}=$ infinity ( AB terminal open), the current in circuit is 0 . The unknown resistance must connect series with basic meter movement. This circuit use to measure higher resistance and the pointer is mark as infinity.

$$\begin{aligned}

\section*{Voltmeter-Ammeter Method for Measuring Resistance}

The voltmeter-ammeter method is a direct application'of ohm's law in which the unknown resistance is estimated by measurement of current (I) flowing through it and the voltage drop (V) across it. Then measured value of the resistance is
$$R_{m}=\frac{\text { Voltmeter reading }}{\text { Ammeter reading }}=\frac{V}{l}$$

This method is very simple and popular since the instruments required for measurement are usually easily available in the laboratory.
Two types of connections are employed for voltmeter-ammeter method as shown below
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-053.jpg?height=478&width=1257&top_left_y=1837&top_left_x=119)
$R x=$ true value of unknown resistance
$R m=$ measured value of unknown resistance
$R a=$ internal resistance of ammeter
$R V=$ internal resistance of voltmeter

\section*{Example}

A voltmeter of $600 \Omega$ resistance and a milliammeter of $0.8 \Omega$ resistance are used to measure two unknown resistances by voltmeter-ammeter method. If the voltmeter reads 40 V and milliammeter reads 120 mA in both the cases, calculate the percentage error in the values of measured resistances if (a) in the first case, the voltmeter is put across the resistance and the milliammeter connected in series with the supply, and (b) in the second case, the voltmeter is connected in the supply side and milliammeter connected directly in series with the resistance.
Solution The connections are shown in the following figure.
Voltmeter reading $V=40 \mathrm{~V}$
Ammeter reading $I=120 \mathrm{~mA}$ measured resistance from voltmeter and $I$ ammeter readings is given by
$$=R_{m}=\frac{V}{l}=\frac{40}{120 \times 10^{-3}}=333 \Omega$$

The ammeter reads the current flowing $I_{R}$ through the resistance $R_{x}$ and also the curren $I_{V}$ through the voltmeter resistance $R_{V}$.

Thus,
$$I=I_{V}+I_{R}$$

Now, the voltmeter and the resistance $R_{x}$ being parallel, the voltmeter reading is given by
$$V=I_{R} \times R_{X}=I_{V} \times R_{V}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-054.jpg?height=478&width=703&top_left_y=1184&top_left_x=570)

Current through voltmeter
$$I_{V}=\frac{V}{R_{V}}=\frac{40}{600}=66.67 \mathrm{~mA}$$
$\therefore$ true current throught resistance $I_{R}=I-I_{V}=120-66.67=55.33 \mathrm{~mA}$
$\therefore$ true value of resistance $=R_{x}=\frac{V}{I_{R}}=\frac{40}{53.33 \times 10^{-3}}=750 \Omega$
Thus, percentage error $\varepsilon=\frac{R_{m}-R_{x}}{R_{x}}=\frac{333-750}{750} \times 100 \%=55.5 \%$
The connections are shown in the following fi gure.
Voltmeter reading $\mathrm{V}=40 \mathrm{~V}$
Ammeter reading $\mathrm{I}=120 \mathrm{~mA}$
$\therefore$ measured resistance from voltmeter and ammeter readings is given by
$$=R_{m}=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{40}{120 \times 10^{-3}}=333 \Omega$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-055.jpg?height=481&width=701&top_left_y=323&top_left_x=571)

Voltmeter reads the voltage drop $V_{r}$ across the resistance $R_{x}$ and also the voltage drop $V_{a}$ across the ammeter resistance $R_{a}$.

Thus,
$$V=V_{a}+V_{r}$$

Voltage drop across ammeter
$$V_{a}=I \times R_{a}=120 \times 10^{-3} \times 0.8=0.096$$
$\therefore$ true voltage drop across the resistance
$$V_{r}=V-V_{a}=40-0.096 \times 39904 \mathrm{~V}$$
$\therefore$ true value of resistance $=R_{x}=\frac{V_{i}}{I} \frac{\partial^{2} 39.904}{120 \times 10^{-3}}=332.53$ I
Percentage error in measurement is $\varepsilon=\frac{333-33258}{332.53} \times 100 \%=0.14 \%$

\section*{d.c. potentiometer}

The d.c. potentiometer is a null-balance instrument used for determining values of e.m.f.'s and p.d.s. by comparison with a known e.m.f. or p.d. In Figure (a), using a standard cell of known e.m.f. E1, the slider S is moved along the slide wire until balance is obtained (i.e. the galvanometer deflection is zero), shown as length 11.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-055.jpg?height=386&width=389&top_left_y=1867&top_left_x=147)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-055.jpg?height=378&width=370&top_left_y=1817&top_left_x=623)
(b)

The standard cell is now replaced by a cell of unknown e.m.f. E2 in Figure (b) and again balance is obtained (shown as l2).

Since $E_{1} \alpha l_{1}$ and $E_{2} \alpha l_{2}$ then $\frac{E_{1}}{E_{2}}=\frac{l_{1}}{l_{2}}$ and $E_{2}=E_{1}\left(\frac{l_{2}}{l_{1}}\right)$ volts

For the purpose of measuring resistance, if L1 is of known resistance R1 and L2 is of unknown resistance and both E1 and E2 are known, then it follows that E1/E2 = R1/R2, thus R2 = (R1 x E2)/E1

\section*{BRIDGE METHOD OF MEASURING RESISTANCE.}

\section*{DC-bridges}

Bridge's usually consists of four arms, balance detector and source. Abridge circuit in its simplest form consists of network of four resistance arms forming a closed circuit. A source of current is applied to two opposite junctions. The current detector is connected to other two junctions. DC bridges use DC source.
So called bridges are based on comparison to precision resistors; they are versatile and yield very good accuracy. For DC-bridges you need naturally a DC-power source. The bridges are used not only for the measurement of resistances, but also used for the measurement of various component values like capacitor, inductor etc.

\section*{Uses of D.C. bridges.}

The D.C. bridges are used for the measurement of very high and very low value resistances. In practice, the variety of D.C. bridges are available. The commonly used D. bridges are (i) wheatstone bridge (ii) Kelvin bridge

\section*{Advantages of bridge circuits.}

The advantages of bridge circuits include
- The measurement accuracy is high as the measurement is done by comparing the unknown value with the standard value.
- The balance equation is independent of the sensitivity of the null detector, the impedance of the detector or any impedance shunting the detecfor.
- The balance condition remains unchanged if the source and detector are interchanged.
- The accuracy is independent of the sensitivity of the null detector, the impedance of the detector or any impedance shunting the detector.

\section*{Wheatstone bridge}

The Wheatstone bridge is an instrument for making comparison measurements and operates upon a null indication principal.
A Wheatstone bridge circuit is shown in its most common "diamond" configuration. It consists of four resistors, and voltage source connected across the top and bottom point of the "diamond". The output voltage is taken across the left and right points of the "diamond" between A and B. The arms consisting the resistances R1 and R2 are called ratio arms. The arm consisting the standard known resistance R3 is called standard arm. The resistance R4 is the unknown resistance to be measured. The bridge is brought to balance by adjusting one of the resistors.

The Wheatstone bridge is in the balanced bridge condition when the output voltage ( V out) between terminals $A$ and $B$ is equal to zero. No potential difference across the galvanometer (there is no current through the galvanometer)

V out $=0 \mathrm{~V}$ Thus,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-057.jpg?height=606&width=1422&top_left_y=109&top_left_x=113)

When the bridge is balanced, the voltages across $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are equal $\left(V_{1}=V_{2}\right)$ and the voltages across $R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ are equal ( $V_{3}=V_{4}$ ). Therefore, the voltage ratios can be written as:
$\frac{V_{1}}{V_{3}}=\frac{V_{2}}{V_{4}}$
Substituiting IR for V by ohm's law gives
$\frac{I_{1} R_{1}}{I_{3} R_{3}}=\frac{I_{2} R_{2}}{I_{4} R_{4}}$
Since $I_{1}=I_{3}$ and $I_{2}={ }_{4}$, all thye curent terms cancel,leaving the resistor ratios.
$\frac{R_{1}}{R_{3}}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{4}}$
Solving for $\mathrm{R}_{1}$ results in the following formula:
$\mathrm{R}_{1}=\mathrm{R}_{3}\left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{4}}\right)$
$$\mathrm{R}_{4}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{2}}{\mathrm{R}_{1}} \mathrm{R}_{3}$$

R 4 is the unknown resistance.
NOTE: Null point:
It can be defined as the point at which the null measurement occurs when the reading of ammeter or voltmeter is zero.

\section*{Example 1}

For the Wheatstone bridge circuit below If $R 1=1 \mathrm{~W}, R 2=2 \mathrm{~W}$, and $R x=3 \mathrm{~W}$, to what value should $R 3$ be adjusted so as to achieve a balanced condition?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-058.jpg?height=690&width=928&top_left_y=162&top_left_x=162)
$\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}=\frac{R_{X}}{R_{2}}, \quad R_{3}=\frac{R_{1} R_{x}}{R_{2}}=\frac{1 \times 3}{2}=1.5 \Omega$.

\section*{Example 2}

A Wheatstone bridge shown below has a ratio arm of 1/100 (R2/R1). At first balance, R3 is adjusted to 1000.3 $\Omega$. The value of Rx is then changed by the emperature change, the new value of R3 to achieve the balance condition again is $1002.1 \Omega$. Find the erhange of Rx due to ${ }^{\circ}$ the temperature change.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-058.jpg?height=495&width=540&top_left_y=1433&top_left_x=161)

SOLUTION At first balance: $\quad R_{x}$ old $=R_{3} \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}=1000.3 \times \frac{1}{100}=10.003 \Omega$
After the temperature change: $R_{x}$ new $=R_{3} \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}=1002.1 \times \frac{1}{100}=10.021 \Omega$
Therefore, the change of $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}$ due to the temperature change is $0.018 \Omega$

\section*{Example}

Find the value of $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}$ if the Wheatstone-bridge is balanced. $\mathrm{R}_{1}=5$ ohm, $\mathrm{R}_{2}=8$ ohm, $\mathrm{R}_{3}=10 \mathrm{ohm}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-059.jpg?height=467&width=367&top_left_y=165&top_left_x=879)

The rule for $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}$
$R_{x}=\frac{R_{2}{ }^{*} R_{3}}{R_{1}}=\frac{8^{*} 10}{5}=16 \Omega$

Example 2.1 : The Wheatstone bridge is shown in the Fig. 2.6. Calculate the value of unknown resistance, assuming the bridge to be in balanced condition.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-059.jpg?height=362&width=833&top_left_y=1017&top_left_x=481)

Solution : As per the bridge shown in the Fig. 2. Dearlier,
$\mathrm{R}_{1}=10 \mathrm{k} \Omega, \mathrm{R}_{2}=2 \mathrm{k} \Omega, \mathrm{R}_{3}=5 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $\mathrm{R}_{4}=\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}$
Under balanced condition,
$$\mathrm{R}_{4}=\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\mathrm{R}_{2}} \mathrm{R}_{3}=\frac{10}{2} \times 5=5 \times 5=25 \mathrm{k} \Omega$$

Thus unknown resistance is $25 \mathrm{k} \Omega$.

\section*{Errors in Wheatstone Bridge}

The following are the errors in the Wheatstone bridge.
1. The difference between the true and the mark value of the three resistances can cause the error in measurement.
2. The galvanometer is less sensitive. Thus, inaccuracy occurs in the balance point.
3. The resistance of the bridge changes because of the self-heating which generates an error.
4. The thermal emf cause serious trouble in the measurement of low-value resistance.
5. The personal error occurs in the galvanometer by taking the reading or by finding the null point.

The above mention error can be reduced by using the best qualities resistor and galvanometer. The error because of self-heating of resistance can minimise by measuring the resistance within the short time. The thermal effect can also be reduced by connecting the reversing switch between the battery and the bridge.

Limitations: of Wheatstone bridge
- Use is limited to the measurement of resistances ranging from a few ohms to several mega ohms.
- When high resistance is required to measured ,sensitivity decreases
- Upper limit is extended by increasing emf applied.
- Care to be taken to avoid overheating.
- Inaccuracy arises during measurement of high resistance.

Remedy:
- For high resistance, use mega Ohm Bridge.
- For lower resistance measurement, resistance of connecting leads and contact resistance comes into account
- Lower limit is 1 to 5 ohm.
- For further lower resistance, Kelvin double bridge is suitable.

\section*{Sensitivity of the Wheatstone Bridge}

The Wheatstone bridge is more sensitive when all their resistances are equal, or their ratio is unity. Their sensitivity decreases when their ratio is less than unity. The reduction in sensitivity reduces the accuracy of the bridge.

\section*{Application of Wheatstone Bridge}

One of the application of the Wheatstone bridge is a light détector circuit using a Wheatstone bridge circuit. The applications of the balanced bridge circuits mainly thvolve in various electronic applications to measure variations in light intensity, pressure or strain. The yarious kinds of resistive sensors are used in a Wheatstone bridge circuit are light dependent resistors, Thermistors, potentiometers and strain gauges, etc.

\section*{Kelvin Bridge Circuit}

Definition: The Kelvin bridge or Thompson bridge is used for measuring the unknown resistances having a value less than $1 \Omega$. It is the modified form of the Wheatstone Bridge.

One of the major drawbacks of the Wheatstone bridge is that although it can measure the resistance from few ohm to several mega ohm - it gives significant errors when measuring low resistances. Kelvin Bridge provides high accuracy especially in the measurement of low resistance. The measurement range would typically be $1 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$ to $1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ with the smallest resolution of $1 \mu \Omega$.
The limitations of the Kelvin bridge are:-
1. requires manual balancing
2. sensitive null detector or galvanometer is required to detect balance condition
3. measurement current needs to be reasonably high to achieve sufficient sensitivity

The Kelvin Double Bridge has generally been replaced by digital ohmmeters.
In Wheatstone Bridge, while measuring the low-value resistance, the resistance of their lead and contacts increases the resistance of their total measured value. This can easily be understood with the help of the circuit diagram
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-061.jpg?height=581&width=535&top_left_y=138&top_left_x=134)
$$\begin{array}{lll}
\text { But } & \frac{a}{b}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}} & \text { thus } \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}-\frac{a}{b}=0 \\
\therefore & R_{x}=\frac{R_{1} R_{3}}{R_{2}} &
\end{array}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-061.jpg?height=955&width=1183&top_left_y=813&top_left_x=135)

The resistor Rıcshown in Figure above represents the lead and contact resistance present in the Wheatstone bridge. The second set of ratio arms ( $\mathrm{Ra}_{\mathrm{a}}$ and Rb ) compensates for this relatively low lead contact resistance. At balance the ratio of Rato $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{b}}$ must be equal to the ratio of $\mathrm{R}_{1}$ to $\mathrm{R}_{3}$. It can be shown that, when a null exists, the value for $R_{x}$ is the same as that for the Wheatstone bridge, which is
$$R_{x}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3}}{R_{1}}$$

This can be written as
$$\frac{R_{x}}{R_{2}}=\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}$$

Therefore when a Kelvin Bridge is balanced, we can say
$$\frac{R_{x}}{R_{2}}=\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}=\frac{R_{b}}{R_{a}}$$

\section*{Kelvin double bridge method}

Principle: It is a modification of Wheatstone bridge taking into account the resistance of leads and contact resistance while measuring low resistance.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-062.jpg?height=532&width=483&top_left_y=566&top_left_x=154)

Kelvin Double Bridge The term double bridgeqis used because the circuit contains a second set of ratio arms. The unknown resistance Rx can be calculatêed as follows:
$$\text { But } \quad \frac{a}{b}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}} \quad \text { thus } \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}-\frac{a}{b}=0$$
$$\therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1} \mathrm{R}_{3}}{\mathrm{R}_{2}}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-062.jpg?height=535&width=484&top_left_y=1619&top_left_x=151)
$$\begin{array}{llll}
\text { But } & \frac{a}{b}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}} & \text { thus } & \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}-\frac{a}{b}=0 \\
\therefore & R_{x}=\frac{R_{1} R_{3}}{R_{2}} &
\end{array}$$
$m$ Example 2.3 : In a Kelvin's double bridge, there is error due to mismatch between the ratios of outer and inner arm resistances. The bridge uses,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Standard resistance } & =100.03 \mu \Omega \\
\text { Inner ratio arms } & =100.31 \Omega \text { and } 200 \Omega \\
\text { Outer ratio arms } & =100.24 \Omega \text { and } 200 \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

The resistance of the connecting leads from standard to unknown resistance is $700 \mu \Omega$. Calculate the unknown resistance under this condition.
Solution : From the given data,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{R}_{3} & =100.03 \mu \Omega, \mathrm{R}_{2}=100.24 \Omega, \mathrm{R}_{1}=200 \Omega \\
\mathrm{~b} & =100.31 \Omega, \mathrm{a}=200 \Omega, \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{y}}=700 \mu \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

Thus unknown resistance is,
$$\begin{aligned}
R_{x} & =\frac{R_{1} R_{3}}{R_{2}}+\frac{b R_{y}}{\left[R_{y}+a+b\right]}\left\{\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}-\frac{a}{b}\right\} \\
& =\frac{200 \times 100.03 \times 10^{-6}}{100.24}+\frac{100.31 \times 700 \times 10^{-6}}{\left[700 \times 10^{-6}+200+100.31\right]}\left\{\frac{200}{100.24}-\frac{200}{100.31}\right\} \\
& =1.9958 \times 10^{-4}+\left(2.3381 \times 10^{-4}\right)\left(1.29923 \times 10^{-3}\right) \\
& =1.999 \times 10^{-4} \Omega=199.905 \mu \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

The differences between a DC bridge andân AC bridge ares ${ }^{\circ}$
DC bridge
1. DC supply is used.
2. A DC current detector is used.
3. Only resistive components are used.
4. There is no need for Wegner's earthing device.

5 . Balancing time is relatively less.
AC bridge
1. AC supply is used.
2. AC current detector is used.
3. Resistive and reactive components are used.
4. Wagner's earthing device is required.
5. Balancing time is high because AC supply is used.

\section*{AC BRIDGES}

In the AC bridge the bridge circuit consists of four impedances and an ac voltage source.
AC - Bridges enable us to perform precise measurements for the following :
- Reactance (capacitance and inductance) measurements.
- Determining the ( $Q$-factor OR $D$-factor).
- Frequency measurements.
- Testing and analyzing of antenna and transmission line performance
- Other than measurement of unknown impedance, AC bridge are commonly used for shifting phase.

\section*{Types of Sources in AC Bridges :}
- For Low frequency measurement the power line supply can serve as the source of excitation.
- For High frequency measurement the electronic oscillator is used as excitation voltage.

\section*{Types of detectors in AC Bridges :}

\section*{Head phones}
- It is used at frequencies of 250 Hz and over upto 3 to 4 KHz .
- Most sensitive detector for this ranges of frequency.

- They are extremely useful for power and low AF ranges.

\section*{Tuneable Amplifier Detector (TAD)}
- It can be used at 10 Hz to 100 KHz .

\section*{Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO)}

1.Maxwell's inductance bridge
2. Maxwell's inductance-capacitance bridge
3. Hay's bridge
4. Anderson's bridge
5. Owen's bridge

\section*{construction}

The basic circuit of an ac bridge is exactly the same as the Wheaistone bridge circuit except that impedances are used instead of resistances, and the supply is an ac-source. Also, the null detector must be an $a c$ instrument.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-064.jpg?height=877&width=1821&top_left_y=1402&top_left_x=130)

\section*{PRINCIPLE}

When the specific circuit conditions apply, the detector current becomes zero, which is known as null or balance condition. Since zero current, it means that there is no voltage difference across the detector,
Voltage at point $\boldsymbol{b}$ and $\boldsymbol{c}$ are equal. $I_{1} Z_{1}=I_{2} Z_{2}$

The same thing at point d. $I_{1} Z_{3}=I_{2} Z_{4}$
From two above equation yield general bridge equation;
$$\frac{\mathrm{Z}_{1}}{\mathrm{Z}_{2}}=\frac{\mathrm{Z}_{3}}{\mathrm{Z}_{4}}$$

Therefore, Z1.Z4 = Z2.Z3
For AC-bridges, the null-condition is only valid if $V a$ and $V b$ are equal in amplitude and also same in-phase. In the polar form the impedance $Z$ can be written as
$$Z=Z \angle \theta$$
where $Z$ represents the impedance and $\theta$ represents the phase angle of complex impedance $Z$.Hence, the bridge arm impedances in polar form can be expressed as
$$\begin{aligned}
& Z_{1}=Z_{1} \angle \theta_{1} \\
& Z_{2}=Z_{2} \angle \theta_{2} \\
& Z_{3}=Z_{3} \angle \theta_{3} \\
& Z_{4}=Z_{4} \angle \theta_{4}
\end{aligned}$$
where $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$ and $Z_{4}$ are the magnitudes and $\theta_{1}, \theta_{2}, \theta_{3}$, and $\theta_{4}$ are the phase angles. Hence, the balance equation in polar form representation will be
$$\left(Z_{1} \angle \theta_{1}\right) \cdot\left(Z_{4} \angle \theta_{4}\right)=\left(Z_{2} \angle \theta_{2}\right)\left(Z_{3} \angle \theta_{3}\right)$$

Since, in complex number multiplication the magnitudes are multiplied and the phase angles are added, the balance equation can be written as
$$Z_{1} Z_{4}\left(\angle \theta_{1}+\theta_{4}\right)=Z_{2} Z_{3}\left(\angle \theta_{2}+\theta_{3}\right)$$
i.e. $\Rightarrow$
$$Z_{1} Z_{4}=Z_{2} Z_{2}$$
and
$$\angle \theta_{1}+\angle \theta_{4}=\angle \theta_{2}+\angle \theta_{3}$$

\section*{Example}

The impedances of the AC bridge in Figure below are given as follows
$Z_{1}=200 \angle 30^{\circ} \Omega$
$Z_{2}=150 \angle 0^{0} \Omega$
$Z_{3}=250 \angle-40^{\circ} \Omega$
$Z_{x}=Z_{4}=$ unknown
Determine the constants of the unknown arm.
$\mathrm{Z}_{1} \mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{x}}=\mathrm{Z}_{2} \mathrm{Z}_{3}, \quad \mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{x}}=\left(\mathrm{Z}_{2} \mathrm{Z}_{3} / \mathrm{Z}_{1}\right), \quad=[(150 * 250) / \mathbf{2 0 0}]=187.5 \Omega$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-065.jpg?height=581&width=700&top_left_y=1864&top_left_x=1290)

The second condition for balance requires that the sums of the phase angles of opposite arms be equal, $\theta_{1}+\theta_{\mathrm{x}}=\theta_{2}+\theta_{3}$
$\theta_{\mathrm{x}}=\theta_{2}+\theta_{3}-\theta_{1}=0+\left(-40^{\circ}\right)-30^{\circ}=-70^{\circ}$

\section*{ALTERNATING CURRENT AND VOLTAGE MEASUREMENT}

\section*{Rectifier instrument method.}

A rectifier type of instrument use a full-wave rectifier circuit is as shown below. If this instrument is used for measuring ac quantity then first the ac signal is converted to dc with the help of the rectifier. Then this dc signal is measured by the PMMC meter. The multiplier resistance $R s$, is used to limit the value of the current in order that it does not exceed the current rating of the PMMC meter. These types of instruments are used for light current work where the voltage is low and resistances high.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-067.jpg?height=1012&width=1231&top_left_y=611&top_left_x=119)

The rms value of sinusoidal (AC) input voltage signal is
$$\begin{aligned}
& V_{r m s}=\frac{V_{m}}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\Rightarrow & V_{m}=\sqrt{2} V_{r m s} \\
\Rightarrow & V_{m}=1.414 V_{r m s}
\end{aligned}$$

Where,
$V_{m}$ is the maximum value of sinusoidal (AC) input voltage signal.
The DC or average value of the Full wave rectifier's output signal is
$$V_{d c}=\frac{2 V_{m}}{\pi}$$

Substitute, the value of $V_{m}$ in above equation
$$\begin{gathered}
V_{d c}=\frac{2 \times 1.414 V_{r m s}}{\pi} \\
V_{d c}=0.9 V_{r m s}
\end{gathered}$$

Therefore, the AC voltmeter produces an output voltage, which is equal to 0.9 times the rms value of the sinusidal (AC) input

\section*{For Half wave rectification}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-068.jpg?height=519&width=1042&top_left_y=1394&top_left_x=124)

The rms value of sinusoidal (AC) input voltage signal is
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-069.jpg?height=437&width=915&top_left_y=134&top_left_x=136)

The rms value of sinusoidal (AC) input voltage signal is
$$\begin{gathered}
V_{r m s}=\frac{V_{m}}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\Rightarrow V_{m}=\sqrt{2} V_{r m s} \\
\Rightarrow V_{m}=1.414 V_{r m s}
\end{gathered}$$

Where,
$V_{m}$ is the maximum value of sinusoidal (AC) input voltage signal.
The DC or average value of the Half wave rectifier's output signal is
$$V_{d c}=\frac{V_{m}}{\pi}$$

Substitute, the value of $V_{m}$ in above equation.
$$\begin{gathered}
V_{d c}=\frac{1.414 V_{r m s}}{\pi} \\
V_{d c}=0.45 V_{r m s}
\end{gathered}$$

Therefore, the AC voltmeter produces an output voltage, which is equal to $\mathbf{0 . 4 5}$ times the rms value of the sinusoidal (AC) input voltage signal

\section*{ELECTROSTATIC VOLTMETER}

Capacitors may be used instead of resistors, though, to make voltneter divider circuits. This strategy has the advantage of being non-dissipative (no truecrower consumed and no heat produced)

\section*{Voltage to be measured}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-069.jpg?height=483&width=1080&top_left_y=1282&top_left_x=341)

\section*{divider}

If the meter movement is electrostatic, and thus inherently capacitive in nature, a single "multiplier" capacitor may be connected in series to give it a greater voltage measuring range, just as a series-connected multiplier resistor gives a moving-coil (inherently resistive) meter movement a greater voltage range:

> Voltage to be measured

\section*{Thermal Voltmeter.}

A thermal converter is used together with a galvanometer. The effective heating value of an AC voltage/current as it powers a resistive load is measured.. Suppose that the AC source to be measured is connected across a resistor of known value, and the heat output of that resistor is measured with a device like a thermocouple. This would provide a far more direct measurement means of RMS than any conversion factor could, for it will work with ANY waveform shape whatsoever.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-070.jpg?height=549&width=1134&top_left_y=422&top_left_x=130)

\section*{Advantages of Thermocouple-type Instruments}
1. These are not affected by stray magnetic fields.
2. They have very high sensitivity.
3. The indication of these instruments are practically unaffected by the frequency and waveform of the measuring
quantity. Hence these instruments can be usedfor measurement of currents upto frequencies of 50 MHz and give
accuracy as high as $1 \%$.
4. These instruments are very useful as transfer instruments for calibration of dc instruments by potentiometer and a
standard cell.

\section*{Disadvantages of Thermocouple-Type Instruments}
1. Considerable power losses due to poor efficiency of thermal conversion.
2. Low accuracy of measurement and sensitivity to overloads, as the heater operates at temperatures close to the limit values. Thus, the overload capacity of such instrument is approximately 1.5 times of full-scale current.
3. The multi-voltmeters used with thermo-elements must be necessarily more sensitive and delicate than those used
with shunts, and therefore, requires careful handling.

\section*{Hot-wire Instrument}

The hot-wire meter movement deflection depends on the expansion of a high resistance wire caused by the heating effect of the wire itself as current flows through it. A resistance wire is stretched between the two meter terminals, with a thread attached at a right angles to the centre of the wire. A spring connected to the opposite end of the thread exerts a constant tension on the resistance wire. Current flow heats the wire, causing it to expand. This motion is transferred to the meter pointer through the thread and a pivot.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-071.jpg?height=554&width=873&top_left_y=135&top_left_x=130)

\section*{Advantages of Hot-wire-type Instruments}
1. The deflection depends upon only the rms value of the current flowing through the wire, irrespective if its waveform and frequency. Hence, the instrument can used for ac as well as dc system.
2. The calibration is same for ac as well as dc measurement. So it is a transfer-type instrument.
3. They are free from stray magnetic fields because no magnetic field is used to cause their operation.
4. It is cheap in cost and simple in construction.
5. With suitable adjustments, error due to temperature variation can be made negligible.
6. This type of instruments are quite suitable for very high frequency measurement.

\section*{Disadvantages of Hot-wire-type Instruments}
1. Power consumption is relatively high.
2. Nonuniform scale.
3. These are very sluggish in action as time ispaken in heating upthe wire.
4. The deflection of the instrument is not the same for ascending and descending values.
5. The reading depends upon the atmospheric temperature

\section*{MEASUREMENT OF INDUCTANCE AND CAPACITANCE}

\section*{Capacitance in AC Circuits}

Capacitive Reactance in a purely capacitive circuit is the opposition to current flow in AC circuits only. Like resistance, reactance is also measured in Ohm's but is given the symbol X to distinguish it from a purely resistive value.
$$\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{C}}=\frac{1}{2 \pi f \mathrm{C}}=$$
$1 / \omega \mathrm{C}$

Find the rms current flowing in an AC capacitive circuit when a $4 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ capacitor is connected across a 880 V , 60 Hz supply.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{C}}=\frac{1}{2 \pi f \mathrm{C}}=\frac{1}{2 \pi \times 60 \times\left(4 \times 10^{-6}\right)}=663 \Omega \\
& \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{RMS}}=\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{RMS}}}{\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{C}}}=\frac{880 \mathrm{~V}}{663 \Omega}=1.33 \mathrm{Amperes}
\end{aligned}$$

When a parallel plate capacitor was connected to a 60 Hz AC supply, it was found to have a reactance of 390 ohms. Calculate the value of the capacitor in micro-farads.
$$\begin{aligned}
& X_{C}=\frac{1}{2 \pi f C} \quad \therefore C=\frac{1}{2 \pi f X_{C}} \\
& C=\frac{1}{2 \pi \times 60 \times 390}=6.8 \mathrm{uF}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Electrostatic instrument}

In multi cellular construction several vans and quadrants are provided. The voltage is to be measured is applied between the vanes and quadrant. The force of attraction between the vanes and quadrant produces a deflecting torque. Controlling torque is produced by spring control. Air friection damping is used.
The instrument is generally used for measuring medium and high voltage. The voltage is reduced to low value by using capacitor potential divider. The force of attraction is proportional to the square of the voltage. and quadrant produces a deflecting torque. Controllingtorque is produced by spring control. Air friction damping is used. The instrument is generally used for measuring medium and high voltage. The voltage is reduced to low value by using capacitor potenfial divider. The force of attraction is proportional to the square of the voltage.

\section*{Advantages}
_ It is used in both AC and DC.

_ There is no hysteresis error.
_ There is no stray magnetic field error. Because the instrument works on electrostatic principle.
_ It is used for high voltage
_ Power consumption is negligible.

\section*{Disadvantages}

\section*{Electrostatic Voltmeters}

The action of electrostatic instruments is based on the force exerted between two charged conductors. The conductors behave as a variable plate air capacitor, as shown in Figure 1.6. The moving plate, when charged, tends to move so as to increase the capacitance between the plates. The energy stored in the capacitor, when the applied voltage is $U$ and the capacitance is ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, is given by:
$$W=\frac{1}{2} C U^{2}$$

This relationship is valid both undérdc and ac conditions, provided that the voltage rms value
$U$ is
considered for ac voltage.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-073.jpg?height=955&width=1074&top_left_y=1208&top_left_x=241)
. 6 Basic structure of an electrostatic voltmeter.
When the moving plate is displaced horizontally by ds, while the voltage is held constant, the capacitor energy changes in order to equal the work done in moving the plate. The resulting force is:
$$F=\frac{\mathrm{d} W}{\mathrm{~d} s}=\frac{U^{2}}{2} \frac{\mathrm{~d} C}{\mathrm{~d} s}$$

For a rotable system, Equation $W=\frac{1}{2} C U^{2}$
above leads similarly to a resulting torque:
$$T=\frac{\mathrm{d} W}{\mathrm{~d} \vartheta}=\frac{U^{2}}{2} \frac{\mathrm{~d} C}{\mathrm{~d} \vartheta}$$

If the action of a control spring is also considered, both Equations 1.22 and 1.23 show that the balance position of the moving plate is proportional to the square of the applied voltage, and hence electrostatic voltmeters have a square-law scale. These equations, along with Equation 1.21, show that these instruments can be used for the measurement of both dc and ac rms voltages. However, the force (or torque) supplied by the instrument schematically represented in Figure 1.6 is generally very weak [2], so that its use is very impractical. A more useful configuration is the quadrant electrometer,

\section*{Megger}

Purpose: Measures high resistance (insulation resistance)
Construction:
Hand cranked generator $G$ which generates voltage of $500 \mathrm{~V}, 1000 \mathrm{~V}, 2500 \mathrm{~V}$.
A centrifugal clutch is incorporated which slips at predeternined speed so that a constant voltage is applied to insulation under test. Current coli similar to PMMMC

\section*{Working Principle of Megger}
- Voltage for testing produced by hand operated Megger by retation of crank in case of hand operated type, a battery is used for electronic tester.
- 500 Volt DC is sufficient for performing test on equipmoent range up to 440 Volts.
- 1000 V to 5000 V is used for testing for high voltage electrical systems.
- Deflecting coil or current coil connected in series and allows flowing the electric current taken by the circuit being tested.
- The control coil also known as pressure coitis connected across the circuit. Current limiting resistor (CCR \& PCR ) connected in series with control \& deflecting coil to protect damage in case of very low resistance in external circuit.
- In hand operated megger electromagnetic induction effect is used to produce the test voltage i.e. armature arranges to move in permanent magnetic field or vice versa.
- Where as in electronic type megger battery areessed to produce the testing voltage.
- As the voltage increases in external circuit the deflection of pointer increases and deflection of pointer decreases with a increases of current.
- Hence, resultant torque is directly proportional to voltage \& inversely proportional to current.
- When electrical circuit being tested is open, torque due to voltage coil will be maximum \& pointer shows
'infinity' means no shorting throughout the circuit and has maximum resistance within the circuit under test.
- If there is short circuit pointer shows 'zero', which means 'NO' resistance within circuit being tested.
Work philosophy based on ohm-meter or ratio-meter. The deflection torque is produced with megger tester due to the magnetic field produced by voltage \& current, similarly like 'Ohm's Law' Torque of the megger varies in ration with V/I, (Ohm's Law :- V=IR or R=V/I). Electrical resistance to be measured is connected across the generator \& in series with deflecting coil. Produced torque shall be in opposite direction if current supplied to the coil.
1. High resistance = No current :- No current shall flow through deflecting coil, if resistance is very high i.e. infinity position of pointer
2. Small resistance = High current :- If circuit measures small resistance allows a high electric current to pass through deflecting coil, i.e. produced torque make the pointer to set at 'ZERO'.
3. Intermediate resistance = varied current :- If measured resistance is intermediate, produced torque align or set the pointer between the range of 'ZERO to INIFINITY'

\section*{Advantages of Hand operated Megger}
- Cheaper
- No external source required to operate
-

\section*{Disadvantages of Hand operated Megger}
- Less accuracy
- Require very stable placement for operation
- Provides an analog display result
- Require very high care and safety during use

\section*{CRT Display}

The device which allows, the amplitude of such signals, to be displayed primarily as a function of time, is called cathode ray oscilloscope. The cathode ray tube (CRT) is the heart of the C.R.O. The CRT generates the electron beam, accelerates the beam, deflects the beam and also has a screen where beam becomes visible as a spot. The main parts of the CRT are
i) Electron gun
ii) Deflection system
iii) Fluorescent screen
iv) Glass tube or envelope
v) Bas
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-076.jpg?height=1362&width=1492&top_left_y=932&top_left_x=224)

\section*{Electron gun}

Ø The electron gun section of the cathode ray tube provides a sharply focused, electron beam directed towards the fluorescent-coated screen.
Ø This section starts from thermally heated cathode, emitting the electrons.
Ø The control grid is given negative potential with respect to cathode.
Ø This grid controls the number of electrons in $t$ beam, going to the screen.

Ø The momentum of the electrons (their number x their speed) determines the intensity, or brightness, of the light emitted from the fluorescent screen due to the electron bombardment.
Ø The light emitted is usually of the green colour.

\section*{Deflection System}

Ø When the electron beam is accelerated it passes through the deflection system, with which beam can be positioned anywhere on the screen.

\section*{Fluorescent Screen}

Ø The light produced by the screen does not disappear immediately when bombardment by electrons ceases, i.e., when the signal becomes zero.

Ø The time period for which the trace remains on the screen after the signal becomes zero is known as "persistence or fluorescence".
Ø The persistence may be as short as a few microsecond, or as long as tens of seconds or even minutes.
Ø Medium persistence traces are mostly used for general purpose applications.
Ø Long persistence traces are used in the study of transients.
Ø Long persistence helps in the study of transients since the trace is still seen on the screen after the transient has disappeared.

\section*{Glass Tube}

Ø All the components of a CRT are enclosed in an evacuated glass tube called envelope.
$\varnothing$ This allows the emitted electrons to move aboitt freely from one end of the tube to the other end.

\section*{Base}

Ø The base is provided to the CRT througf which the connestions are made to the various parts.

1) Cathode Ray Tube (CRT):

A cathode ray oscilloscope consists of a cathode ray tube (CRT) which is the heart of the oscilloscope, and some additional circuitry to operate the CRT. The main parts of a CRT are:
a)Electron gun assembly.
b)Deflection plate assembly
c) Fluorescent screen
d)Glass envelope

\section*{1)Electron gun assembly.}

The electron gun assembly produces a sharply focussed beam of electrons which are accelerated to high velocity. This focussed beam of electrons strikes the fluorescent screen with sufficient energy to cause a luminous spot on the screen After leaving the electron gun, the electron beam passes through two pairs of "electrostatic deflection plates". Voltages applied to these plates deflect the beam. Voltages applied to one pair of plates move the beam vertically up and down and the voltages applied to the other pair of plates move the beam horizontally from one side to another. Focusing anode is used to focus the beam on the screen, and the accelerating anode makes the electron beam to move with high velocity.

\section*{2)Vertical Amplifier:}

This is a wide band amplifier used to amplify signals in the vertical section.

\section*{3)Delay Line:}

It is used to delay the signal from some time in the vertical section.

\section*{4) Horizontal Amplifier:}

The horizontal basically serves two purposes:
a)When the oscilloscope is being in the X-Y node, the signal applied to the horizontal input terminal will be amplified by the horizontal amplifier.
b) When the oscilloscope is being used in the ordinary mode of operation to display a signal applied to the vertical input, the horizontal amplifier will amplify the $s$ weep generator output.
5) Time base generator:

It is used to generate the saw tooth voltage required'to deflect the beain in the horizontal section.
6) Trigger circuit:

This is used to convert the incoming signal ightô trigger pulses that the input signal and the sweep frequency can be synchronised.
7) Power supply:

There are two power supplies, a negative high voltage (HV) supply and a positive low voltage (LV) supply. Two voltages are generated in the CRO. The positive volt supply is from -100 V to +1500 V . This voltage is passed through a bleeder resistor at a few mA. The intermediate voltages are obtained from the bleeder resistor for intensity, focus and positioning controls.
Screens for CRT's:
When the electron beam strikes the screen of the CRT, a spot light is produced. The screen material on the inner surface of the CRT that produces this effect is the phosphor. The phosphor absorbs the kinetic energy of the bombarding electrons and remits energy at the lower frequency in the visible spectrum. The property of some crystalline materials such as phosphor or zinc oxide to emit light when simulated by radiation is called flourescence. Fluorescent materials have a second characteristic called as phosphorescence which refers to the property of the material to continue light emission even after the source of excitation is cut off. The length of time during which phosphorescence or afterglow occurs is called as the persistence of phosphor.

\section*{CRO Operation:}

A simplified block diagram of a typical oscilloscope is shown in Fig. The signal to be displayed is amplified by the vertical amplifier and applied to the vertical deflection plates of the CRT. A portion of the signal in the vertical amplifier is applied to the sweep trigger as a triggering signal.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-079.jpg?height=641&width=1370&top_left_y=108&top_left_x=155)

\section*{Block Diagram of a General Purpose CRO}

The sweep trigger then generates a pulse coincident with a selected point in the cycle of the triggering signal. This pulse turns on the sweep generator, initiating the sawtooth wave form. The sawtooth wave is amplified by the horizontal amplifier and applied to the horizontal deflection plates, Usually, additional provisions signal are made for applying an external triggering signal or utilizing the 60 Hzsliline for triggering. Also the sweep generator may be bypassed and an external signal applied directly to the horizontal amplifier.

\section*{CATHODE-RAY TUBE Controls}

Power and Scale Illumination: Turns instrument onand controls illumifition of the graticule.
Focus: Focus the spot or trace on the screen.
Intensity: Regulates the brightness of the spotcor trace.

\section*{VERTICAL AMPLIFIER SECTION Gơntrols}

Position: Controls vertical positioning oscilloscope display.
Sensitivity: Selects the sensitivity of the vertical amplifier in calibrated steps.
Variable Sensitivity: Provides a continuous range of sensitivities between the calibrated steps. Normally the sensitivity is calibrated only when the variable $\mathrm{knoW}_{\mathrm{b}}$ is in the fully clockwise position.
AC-DC-GND:
Selects desired coupling (ac or dc) for incomining signal applied to vertical amplifier, or grounds the amplifier input.
Selecting dc couples the input directly to the amplifier; selecting ac send the signal through a capacitor before going to the amplifier thus blocking any constant component.

\section*{HORIZONTAL-SWEEP SECTION Controls}

Sweep time/cm: Selects desired sweep rate from calibrated steps or admits external signal to horizontal amplifier.
Sweep time/cm Variable: Provides continuously variable sweep rates.
Position: Controls horizontal position of trace on screen.
Horizontal Variable: Controls the attenuation (reduction) of signal applied to horizontal amplifier through Ext.
Horiz. connector

\section*{TRIGGER Controls}

The trigger selects the timing of the beginning of the horizontal sweep.
Slope: Selects whether triggering occurs on an increasing ( + ) or decreasing (-)
portion of trigger signal.
Coupling: Selects whether triggering occurs at a specific dc or ac level.
Source: Selects the source of the triggering signal.
INT - (internal) - from signal on vertical amplifier
EXT - (external) - from an external signal inserted at the EXT. TRIG.

\section*{INPUT.}

LINE - 60 cycle trigger
Level: Selects the voltage point on the triggering signal at which sweep is triggered. It also allows automatic (auto) triggering of allows sweep to run free (free run).

\section*{Measurements of Voltage using CRO:}

\section*{Consider the circuit in Fig. below}

The signal generator is used to produce a 1000 hertz sine wave.
To determine the size of the voltage signal appearing at the output of terminals of the signal generator, an AC (Alternating Current) voltmeter is connected in parallel across these terminals (Fig. a). The AC voltmeter is designed to read the dc "effective value" of the voltage.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-080.jpg?height=646&width=1307&top_left_y=436&top_left_x=154)

This effective value is also known as the "Root Mean Square value" (RMS) value of the voltage. The peak or maximum voltage seen on the scope face (Fig. b) is Vin volts and is represented by the distance from the symmetry line CD to the maximum deflection. The relationship between the magnitude of the peak voltage displayed on the scope and the effective or RMS voltage (VRMS®,read on the AC voitmeter is Vrms = $\mathbf{0 . 7 0 7} \mathbf{~ V m}$ (for a sine or cosine wave).
The voltage of a waveform is measured bxultiplying the VOLTS/DIV setting by the peak-to-peak vertical divisions occupied by the waveform. Thé time period is deéermined by multiplying the horizontal divisions for one cycle by the TIME/DIV Setting.

\section*{Applications of Oscilloscope:}

Because the oscilloscope is an extremely flexible and versatie instrument, it can be used to measure a number of parameters associated with DC and $\AA$ AC signals. Using a single channel oscilloscope, it is capable of making measurements of voltage, current, time, frequency and rise/fall time. If a dual trace oscilloscope is used, the phase shift between two synchronous signals can be measured.

\section*{a)Power Analysis:}

Oscilloscopes can be used to measure and anatyse the operating characteristics of power conversion devices, circuits and line power harmonics. Differetitial amplifier probes are needed to this and special software is also offered to make analysis of data easier.
b)Serial data analysis:

Digital data signals are moving to ever-increasing serial data formats. Oscilloscopes are used to analyse and characterize such data formats as USB, SCSI, Ethernet, Serial ATA, Fibre channel, firewire, Rapid I/O, Infiniband, bluetooth and CAN Bus (for automotive industry)
c)Jitter analysis:

Today high bandwidth circuits have extremely fast clocks and signals. Oscilloscopes are used to characterise and debug signal jitter as well as timing for clocks, clock-to-data and data stream analysis.
d)Data storage device testing:

Oscilloscopes are used to test CD/DVD and disk drive designs by measuring disk performance, media noise and optical recording characteristics.
e)Time-domain reflectometry:

Time Domain reflectometry (TDR) is a way to measure impedance values and variations (such as faults) along transmission cables, cable connectors or microstrips on a circuit board

\section*{FREQUENCY MEASUREMENTS}

Lissajous patterns are used for accurate measurement of frequency.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-084.jpg?height=1343&width=1576&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=150)

Fig: Lissajous patterns with different frequency ratios
In all the cases, the ratios of the two frequencies are:
$$\begin{gathered}
\frac{f x}{f y}=\frac{\text { Number of times tangent touc hes top or bottom }}{\text { Number of times tangent touc hes either side }} \\
=\frac{\text { number of horizontal tangencies }}{\text { number of vertical tangencies }}
\end{gathered}$$
where,
$f_{x}=$ frequency of signal applied to ' $Y$ ' plates
$f_{y}=$ frequency of signal applied to ' $X$ ' plates.

Measure the amplitude and periodic time (time of one cycle). See below.
Calculate the frequency.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-085.jpg?height=652&width=1292&top_left_y=182&top_left_x=168)
time/division
In the diagram the waveform is 4 divisions high.
The volts/ division switch is set to $50 \mathrm{mV} /$ division.
The amplitude is therefore $4 \times 50 \mathrm{mV}=200 \mathrm{mV}$.
The width of one cycle (indicated between the two red dots) is 4 divisions.
The time/division switch is set to 5 mS /division.
The periodic time is $4 \times 5 \mathrm{mS}=20 \mathrm{mS}$.
Note that one cycle is the time between the start of a waveformand the point where it starts to repeat itself.
Frequency can be calculated by dividing 1 second by the periodic time.
Note that if the periodic time is in mSthen 1 second has to be expressed as 1000 mS .
$1000 \mathrm{mS} / 20 \mathrm{mS}=50 \mathrm{~Hz}$.
The pattern of squares is called a GRATICULE
Time period measurement
For the measurement of the time period (T) of the waveform, It is displayed on the screen such that one complete cycle is visible on the screen.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Time period }=\frac{\text { Time }}{\text { Division }} \times \text { nümber of divisions occupied by one cycle. } \\
& f=\frac{1}{T}
\end{aligned}$$

Example 12.4 For the given waveform, if vertical attenuation is $3 \mathrm{mv} / \mathrm{div}$.
determine
(i) Peak-peak value
(ii) Amplitude
(iii) R.M.S value -

Solution. Vertical attenuation $=3 \mathrm{mv} / \mathrm{div}$, the screen is divided such that one part is subdivided into 5 parts.
1 subdivison $=\frac{1}{5}=0.2$ nit
(i) $V_{\text {peak }}$ (positive peak) consists of two full divisions and three subdivisions.
So it is $2+3 \times 02=2.6$, similarly -Ve peak also corresponds to 2.6 units.
$$\begin{aligned}
& V_{P-P}=2.6+2.6=5.2 \text { division. } \\
& V_{P-P}=3 \times 5.2=15.6 \mathrm{mV}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{POWER MEASUREMENT}

A special meter movement designed especially for power measurement is called the dynamometer movement, and is similar to a D'Arsonval meter. A dynamometer movement connected in a circuit looks something like this:

\section*{Electrodynamometer movement}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-086.jpg?height=413&width=1082&top_left_y=1834&top_left_x=123)

Construction of a Wattmeter(Electrodynamometer Wattmeter)
The internal construction of a wattmeter is such that it consists of two cols. One of the coil is in series and the other is connected in parallel. The coil that is connected in series with the circuit is known as the current coil and the one that is connected in parallel with the circuit is known as the voltage coil. The needle that is supposed to move on the marked scale to indicate the amount of power is also attached to the potential coil. The reason for this is that the potential coil is allowed to move whereas the current coil is kept fixed.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-087.jpg?height=2091&width=1790&top_left_y=123&top_left_x=132)

\section*{Working of a Wattmeter}

When the current passes through the current coil, it creates an electromagnetic field around the coil. The strength of this electromagnetic field is directly proportional to the amount of current passing through it.

In case of DC current, the current is also in phase with its generated electromagnetic field. The voltage is dropped across the potential coil and as a result of this complete process, the needle moves across the scale. The needle deflection is such that it is according to the product of the current passing and the voltage dropped, that is, $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{VI}$.

\section*{Applications of Wattmeter}
1. As other measuring instruments, watt meters are also used extensively in electrical circuit measurement and debugging.
2. They are also used in industries to check the power rating and consumption of electrical appliances.
3. Electromagnetic watt meters are used to measure utility frequencies.
4. They are used with refrigerators, electric heaters and other equipment to measure their power ratings.

\section*{VOLTMETER AMMETER METHOD AND AMMETER VOLTMETER METHOD}

Electrical Power dissipated by a load (L) fed by a dc power supply ( E ) is the product of the voltage across the load (VL) and the current flowing in it (IL)
$P=V L \times I L$
The power measurement in a dc circuit can be carried out using a voltmeter (V) and ammeter (A) as shown in the figure
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-088.jpg?height=372&width=730&top_left_y=1077&top_left_x=139)

\section*{THREE VOLTMETER METHOD}
$\mathrm{V} 1, \mathrm{~V} 2$ and V 3 are the three voltmeters and R is a non-inductive resistance connected in series with the load as shown in figure.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-088.jpg?height=503&width=822&top_left_y=1624&top_left_x=185)
...Since power in the inductive circuit, $P=V_{3} I \cos \phi$
Or, power,
$$P=\frac{V_{1}^{2}-V_{2}^{2}-V_{3}^{2}}{2 R}$$

\section*{MEASUREMENT OF THREE PHASE POWER BY TWO WATTMETERS METHOD}

In this method we have two types of connections
(a)Star connection of loads
(b)Delta connection of loads

When the star connected load, the diagram is shown in below-
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-089.jpg?height=1237&width=1830&top_left_y=406&top_left_x=115)

The circuit diagram for two wattmeter method of measurement of three phase real power is shown above. The current coil of the wattmeters W1 and W2 are inserted respectively in R and Y phases. The potential coils of the two wattmeters are joined together to phase B, the third phase. Thus, the voltage applied to the voltage coil of the meter, W 1 is VRB= VR-VB, while the voltage applied to the voltage coil of the meter, W2 is VYB=VYVB, where, VR, VB and VC are the phase voltage values of lines $\mathrm{R}, \mathrm{Y}$ and B respectively, as illustrated by the phasor diagram below. Thus, the reading of the two wattmeters can be obtained based on the phasor diagram as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{W}_{1} & =\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{R}} \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{RB}} \\
& =\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{L}} \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{L}} \cos (30-\emptyset) \\
\mathrm{W}_{2} & =\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{Y}} \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{YB}} \\
& =\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{L}} \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{L}} \cos (30+\emptyset)
\end{aligned}$$

Hence,
$$\mathrm{W}_{1}+\mathrm{W}_{2}=\sqrt{3} \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{L}} \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{L}} \cos \emptyset=\mathrm{P}_{3 \mathrm{ph}}$$

And
$$\mathrm{W}_{1}-\mathrm{W}_{2}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}} \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{L}} \sin \emptyset$$

So that then,
$$\text { Tan } \emptyset=\sqrt{3}\left[\mathbf{W}_{1}-\mathbf{W}_{2}\right] /\left[\mathbf{W}_{1}+\mathbf{W}_{2}\right] \quad \text { Where } \emptyset \text { is the lagging PF angle of the load. }$$

The three phase real power is given by,
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{P}_{3 \mathrm{ph}}=3 \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{ph}} \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{ph}} \cos \emptyset \\
& \mathrm{P}_{3 \mathrm{ph}}=\sqrt{ } 3 \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{L}} \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{L}} \cos \emptyset
\end{aligned}$$
$\mathrm{VR}=\mathrm{VI} \cos \varnothing$
$\mathrm{VY}=\mathrm{VI} \cos \varnothing$
$\mathrm{VB}=\mathrm{VI} \cos \varnothing$
$\mathrm{VL}=$ line voltage $\mathrm{IL}=$ line voltage, phase volate $=415 \mathrm{~V}$
Where $\varnothing$ is phase angle difference between current and voltage.

\section*{SINGLE WATTMETER}

A single wattmeter can also be used for three phase reactive power measurements. For example, the connection of a single wattmeter for 3-phase reactive power measurement in a balanced three phase circuit
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-090.jpg?height=567&width=1199&top_left_y=852&top_left_x=119)

The current coil of the wattmeter is inserted in one line and the potential coil is connected across the other two lines. Thus, the voltage applied to the voltage coil is $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{rb}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{r}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{b}}$, where, $V_{r}$ and $V_{\text {в }}$ are the phase voltage values of lines $R$ and $B$ respectively, as illustrated by the phasor diagram
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-090.jpg?height=459&width=846&top_left_y=1641&top_left_x=119)
phasor diagram
The reading of the wattmeter, $\mathbf{W}_{3 \text { ph }}$ for the connection shown in figure above can be obtained based on the phasor diagram of figure above, as follows:
Wattmeter reading,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{ph}} & =\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{y}} \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{RB}} \\
& =\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{y}} \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{L}} \cos (90+\emptyset) \\
& =-\sqrt{ } 3 \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{ph}} \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{ph}} \sin \emptyset \\
& =-\sqrt{3} \text { (Reactive power per phase) }
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, the three phase power, $\mathbf{W}_{3 \text { ph }}$ is given by,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{W}_{3 \mathrm{ph}} & =3(\mathrm{VArs} / \mathrm{phase}) \\
& =3\left[\mathrm{~W}_{\mathrm{ph}} /-\sqrt{ } 3\right] \\
& =-\sqrt{ } 3(\text { wattmeter reading })
\end{aligned}$$

When delta connected load, the diagram is shown in below
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-091.jpg?height=1255&width=1720&top_left_y=685&top_left_x=151)
line currents are equal in magnitude and differ in phase by $120^{\circ}$.
$$I_{\mathrm{R}}=2 I_{1} \cos 30^{\circ}=\sqrt{ } 3 I_{1}$$

Hence for a delta-connected system with a balanced load
Line current $=1.73 \times$ phase current

The reading of wattmeter one can be written as
$$P_{1}=-V_{3}\left(I_{1}-I_{3}\right)$$
and reading of wattmeter two is
$$P_{2}=-V_{2}\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\right)$$

Total power is $P=P_{1}+P_{2}=V_{2} I_{2}+V_{3} I_{3}-I_{1}\left(V_{2}+V_{3}\right)$
but $\mathrm{V}_{1}+\mathrm{V}_{2}+\mathrm{V}_{3}=0$, hence expression for total power will reduce to $\mathrm{V}_{1} 1_{1}+\mathrm{V}_{2} 1_{2}+\mathrm{V}_{3} l_{3}$

Limitation of this method is that it cannot be applied on unbalanced load. So under this condition we have $\mathrm{I}_{1}=\mathrm{I}_{2}=\mathrm{I}_{3}=\mathrm{I}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{1}=\mathrm{V}_{2}=\mathrm{V}_{3}=\mathrm{V}$. Diagram is shown below
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-092.jpg?height=627&width=1158&top_left_y=933&top_left_x=158)

Two switches are given which are marked as 1-3 and 1-2, by closing the switch 1-3 we get reading of wattmeter as
$$P_{1}=V_{13} I_{1} \cos (30-\phi)=\sqrt{3} \times V I \cos (30-\phi)$$

Similarly the reading of wattmeter when switch 1-2 is closed is
$$P_{2}=V_{12} I_{1} \cos (30+\phi)=\sqrt{3} \times V I \cos (30+\phi)$$

Total power is $P_{1}+P_{2}=3 V I \cos \phi$

In a three-phase four-wire system the line voltage is 400 V and non-inductive loads of $10 \mathrm{~kW}, 8 \mathrm{~kW}$ and 5 kW are connected between the three line conductors and the neutral as in Fig. below. Calculate:
(a) the current in each line;
(b) the current in the neutral conductor.

Voltage to neutral $=\frac{\text { line voltage }}{1.73}=\frac{400}{1.73}=230 \mathrm{~V}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-093.jpg?height=524&width=912&top_left_y=372&top_left_x=178)
$$\begin{aligned}
I_{\mathrm{R}} & =10 \times 1000 / 230=43.5 \mathrm{~A} \\
I_{\mathrm{Y}} & =8 \times 1000 / 230=34.8 \mathrm{~A} \\
I_{\mathrm{B}} & =5 \times 1000 / 230=21.7 \mathrm{~A}
\end{aligned}$$

(b) The current in the neutral is the phasor sum 0 ? the three line currents. In general, the most convenient method of adding such quantities is to calculate the resultant horizontal and vertical components thus: horizontal component is
$$\begin{aligned}
I_{\mathrm{H}} & =I_{\mathrm{Y}} \cos 30^{\circ}-I_{\mathrm{B}} \cos 30^{\circ} \\
& =0.866(34.8-21.7)=11.3 \mathrm{~A}
\end{aligned}$$
and vertical component is
$$\begin{aligned}
I_{\mathrm{V}} & =I_{\mathrm{R}}-I_{\mathrm{Y}} \cos 60^{\circ}-I_{\mathrm{B}} \cos 60^{\circ} \\
& =43.5-0.5(34.8+21.7)=13.0 \mathrm{~A}
\end{aligned}$$

These components are represented in Fig. 33.18.
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Current in neutral }=I_{\mathrm{N}} & =\sqrt{ }\left\{(11.3)^{2}+(13.0)^{2}\right\} \\
& =17.2 \mathrm{~A}
\end{aligned}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-093.jpg?height=335&width=462&top_left_y=1933&top_left_x=1238)

We can also measure the reactive power by appropriate connection of the wattmeters into the three-phase circuit, as shown
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-094.jpg?height=302&width=1010&top_left_y=134&top_left_x=163)

For balanced systems the indication of the first wattmeter can be calculated from the following dependence
$P_{1}=I_{1} U_{23} \cos \left(90^{\circ}-\varphi\right)=\sqrt{3} I_{1} U_{1} \sin \varphi=\sqrt{3} Q_{1}$
For three-phase three-wattmeter system the total reactive power can be determined as
$Q=\frac{P_{1}+P_{2}+P_{3}}{\sqrt{3}}$
The electrical power can be of three forms:
> Real power or simply, the power is the power consumed by the resistive loads on the system. It is expressed in watts (W). This is also referred as true power, absolute power, average power, or wattage.
> Reactive power is the power consumed by the reactive loads on the system. It is expressed in reactive volt-amperes (VAr).
$>$ Apparent power is the vector sivm of the above two power components. It is expressed in voltamperes (VA).

\subsection*{2.15 Q Meter}

The Q factor is called quality factor or the storage factor. It is defined as the ratio of power stored in the element to the power dissipated in the element. It is the magnification provided by the circuit. It is also defined as the ratio of reactance to resistance of a reactive element. Thus for inductive reactance it is the ratio of $X_{L}$ to $R$ while for capacitance reactance it is the ratio of $X_{C}$ to $R$.

The Q meter is an instrument which is designed to measure some of the electrical properties of the coils and capacitors. It is a useful laboratory instrument.

\subsection*{2.15.1 Working Principle of Q Meter,}

The working of the Q meter is based on the characteristics of a series resonant circuit. The series resonant circuit has a characteristics that the voltage across the coil or capacitor is equal to the applied voltage times the Q factor of the circuit.

Thus if a fixed voltage is applied to the circuit, the volfineter across the capacitor can be calibrated to read the $Q$ value directly.

A series resonant circuit is shown in the Fig. 2.33 (a) while the voltage and current relationships at the resonance is shown in the Fig. 2.33 (b).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-095.jpg?height=437&width=1422&top_left_y=1370&top_left_x=197)
(a)

Fig. 2.33 Series resonant circuit
(b)

At the resonance,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{C}} & =\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{L}} \\
\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{C}} & =\mathrm{I} \mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{C}}=\mathrm{I} \mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{L}} \\
\mathrm{E} & =\mathrm{IR}
\end{aligned}$$
where
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{E} & =\text { applied voltage } \\
\mathrm{I} & =\text { circuit current } \\
\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{C}} & =\text { voltage across capacitor } \\
\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{C}} & =\text { capacitive reactance }
\end{aligned}$$
$$\mathrm{R}=\text { resistance of coil }$$

The $Q$ factor is defined as,
$$\mathrm{Q}=\frac{\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{L}}}{\mathrm{R}}=\frac{\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{C}}}{\mathrm{R}}=\frac{\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{C}}}{\mathrm{E}}$$

From equation (4) we can see that if the applied voltage $E$ is maintained constant and at known level then a voltmeter across the capacitor can be calibrated directly interms of the circuit Q .
$m$ Example 2.14 : A coil with a resistance of $8 \Omega$ is connected in the direct connection mode of $Q$ meter. Resonance occurs when the oscillator frequency is 1.5 MHz and the resonating capacitor is set at 60 pF . Calculate the $\%$ error introduced in the calculated value of $Q$ by the $0.02 \Omega$ insertion resistance.

Solution : The true value of Q is,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Q}_{\text {actual }} & =\frac{1}{\omega \mathrm{CR}}=\frac{1}{2 \pi \times 15 \times 10^{6} \times 60 \times 10^{-12} \times 8} \\
& =221.05 \\

\section*{DC-bridges}

Bridge's usually consists of four arms, balance detector and source. Abridge circuit in its simplest form consists of network of four resistance arms forming a closed circuit. A source of current is applied to two opposite junctions. The current detector is connected to other two junctions. DC bridges use DC source.
So called bridges are based on comparison to precision resistors; they are versatile and yield very good accuracy. For DC-bridges you need naturally a DC-power source. The bridges are used not only for the measurement of resistances, but also used for the measurement of various component values like capacitor, inductor etc.

\section*{Uses of D.C. bridges.}

The D.C. bridges are used for the measurement of very high and very low value resistances. In practice, the variety of D.C. bridges are available. The commonly used D.C. bridges are (i) wheatstone bridge (ii) Kelvin bridge

\section*{Advantages of bridge circuits.}

The advantages of bridge circuits include
- The measurement accuracy is high as the measurement is done by comparing the unknown value with the standard value.
- The balance equation is independent of the sensitivity of the null detector, the impedance of the detector or any impedance shunting the detector.
- The balance condition remains unchanged if the source and detector are interchanged.
- The accuracy is independent of the sensitivity of the null detector, the impedance of the detector or any impedance shunting the detector.

\section*{Wheatstone bridge}

The Wheatstone bridge is an instrument for making comearison measurements and operates upon a null indication principal.
A Wheatstone bridge circuit is shown in its most common "diamond" configuration. It consists of four resistors, and voltage source connected across the top and bottom peint of the "diamond". The output voltage is taken across the left and right points of the "diamond" between A and B. The arms consisting the resistances R1 and R2 are called ratio arms. The arm consisting the standard knowin resistance R3 is called standard arm. The resistance R4 is the unknown resistance to be measured. The bridge is brought to balance by adjusting one of the resistors.

The Wheatstone bridge is in the balanced bridge condition when the output voltage ( V out) between terminals $A$ and $B$ is equal to zero. No potential difference across the galvanometer (there is no current through the galvanometer)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-098.jpg?height=632&width=1410&top_left_y=1950&top_left_x=116)

When the bridge is balanced, the voltages across $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are equal $\left(V_{1}=V_{2}\right)$ and the voltages across $R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ are equal $\left(V_{3}=V_{4}\right)$. Therefore, the voltage ratios can be written as:
$\frac{V_{1}}{V_{3}}=\frac{V_{2}}{V_{4}}$
Substituiting IR for V by ohm's law gives
$\frac{I_{1} R_{1}}{I_{3} R_{3}}=\frac{I_{2} R_{2}}{I_{4} R_{4}}$
Since $I_{1}=I_{3}$ and $I_{2}=I_{4}$, all thye curent terms cancel,leaving the resistor ratios.
$\frac{R_{1}}{R_{3}}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{4}}$
Solving for $\mathrm{R}_{1}$ results in the following formula:
$\mathrm{R}_{1}=\mathrm{R}_{3}\left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{4}}\right)$
$\mathrm{R}_{4}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{2}}{\mathrm{R}_{1}} \mathrm{R}_{3}$
R4 is the unknown resistâte.
NOTE: Null point:
It can be defined as the point at which the null measurement occurs when the reading of ammeter or voltmeter is zero.

\section*{Example 1}

For the Wheatstone bridge circuit below If $R 1=1 \mathrm{~W}, R 2=2 \mathrm{~W}$, and $R x=3 \mathrm{~W}$, to what value should $R 3$ be adjusted so as to achieve a balanced condition?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-099.jpg?height=684&width=915&top_left_y=1653&top_left_x=174)
$\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}=\frac{R_{x}}{R_{2}}, \quad R_{3}=\frac{R_{1} R_{x}}{R_{2}}=\frac{1 \times 3}{2}=1.5 \Omega$.

\section*{Example 2}

A Wheatstone bridge shown below has a ratio arm of 1/100 (R2/R1). At first balance, R3 is adjusted to 1000.3 $\Omega$. The value of Rx is then changed by the temperature change, the new value of R 3 to achieve the balance condition again is $1002.1 \Omega$. Find the change of Rx due to the temperature change.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-100.jpg?height=489&width=529&top_left_y=436&top_left_x=169)

SOLUTION At first balance: $\quad R_{x}$ old $=R_{3} \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}=1000.3 \times \frac{1}{100}=10.003 \Omega$
After the temperature change: $R_{x}$ new $=R_{3} \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}=1002.1 \times \frac{3}{100}=10.021 \Omega$
Therefore, the change of $R_{\mathrm{x}}$ due to the temperature change is $0.018 \Omega \Omega$

\section*{Example}

Find the value of $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}$ if the Wheatstone-bridge is balanced. $\mathrm{R}_{1}=5 \mathrm{ohm}, \mathrm{R}_{2}=8 \mathrm{ohm}$, $\mathrm{R}_{3}=10 \mathrm{ohm}$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-100.jpg?height=546&width=434&top_left_y=1283&top_left_x=805)

The rule for $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}$
$R_{x}=\frac{R_{2}{ }^{*} R_{3}}{R_{1}}=\frac{8^{*} 10}{5}=16 \Omega$

Example 2.1 : The Wheatstone bridge is shown in the Fig. 2.6. Calculate the value of unknown resistance, assuming the bridge to be in balanced condition.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-101.jpg?height=329&width=510&top_left_y=264&top_left_x=485)

Solution : As per the bridge shown in the Fig. 2.1 earlier,
$\mathrm{R}_{1}=10 \mathrm{k} \Omega, \mathrm{R}_{2}=2 \mathrm{k} \Omega, \mathrm{R}_{3}=5 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ and $\mathrm{R}_{4}=\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}$
Under balanced condition,
$$\mathrm{R}_{4}=\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1}}{\mathrm{R}_{2}} \mathrm{R}_{3}=\frac{10}{2} \times 5=5 \times 5=25 \mathrm{k} \Omega$$

Thus unknown resistance is $25 \mathrm{k} \Omega$.

\section*{Errors in Wheatstone Bridge}

The following are the errors in the Wheatstone byidge.
6. The difference between the true and the mark value of the three resistances can cause the error in measurement.
7. The galvanometer is less sensitive, Thus, inaccuracy oceurs in the balance point.
8. The resistance of the bridge changes because of theself-heating which generates an error.
9. The thermal emf cause serious trouble in the measurement of low-value resistance.
10. The personal error occurs in the galvanometer by taking the reading or by finding the null point.

The above mention error can be reduced by using the best qualities resistor and galvanometer. The error because of self-heating of resistance can minimise by measuring the resistance within the short time. The thermal effect can also be reduced by connecting the reversing switch between the battery and the bridge.

Limitations: of Wheatstone bridge
- Use is limited to the measurement of resistances ranging from a few ohms to several mega ohms.
- When high resistance is required to measured ,sensitivity decreases
- Upper limit is extended by increasing emf applied.
- Care to be taken to avoid overheating.
- Inaccuracy arises during measurement of high resistance.

Remedy:
- For high resistance, use mega Ohm Bridge.
- For lower resistance measurement, resistance of connecting leads and contact resistance comes into account
- Lower limit is 1 to 5 ohm.
- For further lower resistance, Kelvin double bridge is suitable.

\section*{Sensitivity of the Wheatstone Bridge}

The Wheatstone bridge is more sensitive when all their resistances are equal, or their ratio is unity. Their sensitivity decreases when their ratio is less than unity. The reduction in sensitivity reduces the accuracy of the bridge.

\section*{Application of Wheatstone Bridge}

One of the application of the Wheatstone bridge is a light detector circuit using a Wheatstone bridge circuit. The applications of the balanced bridge circuits mainly involve in various electronic applications to measure variations in light intensity, pressure or strain. The various kinds of resistive sensors are used in a Wheatstone bridge circuit are light dependent resistors, Thermistors, potentiometers and strain gauges, etc.

\section*{Kelvin Bridge Circuit}

Definition: The Kelvin bridge or Thompson bridge is used for measuring the unknown resistances having a value less than $1 \Omega$. It is the modified form of the Wheatstone Bridge.

One of the major drawbacks of the Wheatstone bridge is that although it can measure the resistance from few ohm to several mega ohm - it gives significant errors when measuring low resistances. Kelvin Bridge provides high accuracy especially in the measurement of low resistance. The measurement range would typically be $1 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$ to $1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ with the smallest resolution of $1 \mu \Omega$.
The limitations of the Kelvin bridge are:-
4. requires manual balancing
5. sensitive null detector or galvanometer is required to detect balance condition
6. measurement current needs to be reasonably hight to achieve sufficient sensitivity

The Kelvin Double Bridge has generally been replaced by digital ohifmeters.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-102.jpg?height=573&width=521&top_left_y=1383&top_left_x=154)
$$\begin{array}{lrl}
\text { But } & \frac{a}{b}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}} & \text { thus } \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}-\frac{a}{b}=0 \\
\therefore & R_{x}=\frac{R_{1} R_{3}}{R_{2}} &
\end{array}$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-103.jpg?height=982&width=1066&top_left_y=162&top_left_x=134)

The resistor Ric shown in Figure above represents the lead and contact resistance present in the Wheatstone bridge. The second set of ratio arms ( Ra and $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{b}}$ ) compensates for this relatively low lead contact resistance. At balance the ratio of $\mathrm{Ra}_{\text {a }}$ to $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{b}}$ must be equal fo the ratio of $\mathrm{R}_{1}$ क9 $\mathrm{R}_{3}$. It can be shown that, when a null exists, the value for $R_{x}$ is the same as that for theatstone bridge, which is
$$R_{x}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3}}{R_{1}}$$

This can be written as
$$\frac{R_{x}}{R_{2}}=\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}$$

Therefore when a Kelvin Bridge is balanced, we can say
$$\frac{R_{x}}{R_{2}}=\frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}}=\frac{R_{b}}{R_{a}}$$

\section*{Kelvin double bridge method}

Principle: It is a modification of Wheatstone bridge taking into account the resistance of leads and contact resistance while measuring low resistance.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-104.jpg?height=529&width=481&top_left_y=142&top_left_x=155)

Kelvin Double Bridge The term double bridge is used because the circuit contains a second set of ratio arms. The unknown resistance Rx can be calculated as follows:

But $\quad \frac{a}{b}=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}} \quad$ thus $\quad \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}-\frac{a}{b}=0$
$\therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1} \mathrm{R}_{3}}{\mathrm{R}_{2}}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-104.jpg?height=524&width=486&top_left_y=1196&top_left_x=153)

But $\quad$ thus $\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}-\frac{a}{b}=0$
$\therefore \quad \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{x}}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{1} \mathrm{R}_{3}}{\mathrm{R}_{2}}$
$m$ Example 2.3 : In a Kelvin's double bridge, there is error due to mismatch between the ratios of outer and inner arm resistances. The bridge uses,
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Standard resistance } & =100.03 \mu \Omega \\
\text { Inner ratio arms } & =100.31 \Omega \text { and } 200 \Omega \\
\text { Outer ratio arms } & =100.24 \Omega \text { and } 200 \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

The resistance of the connecting leads from standard to unknown resistance is $700 \mu \Omega$. Calculate the unknown resistance under this condition.
Solution : From the given data,
$$\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{R}_{3} & =100.03 \mu \Omega, \mathrm{R}_{2}=100.24 \Omega, \mathrm{R}_{1}=200 \Omega \\
\mathrm{~b} & =100.31 \Omega, \mathrm{a}=200 \Omega, \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{y}}=700 \mu \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

Thus unknown resistance is,
$$\begin{aligned}
R_{x} & =\frac{R_{1} R_{3}}{R_{2}}+\frac{b R_{y}}{\left[R_{y}+a+b\right]}\left\{\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}-\frac{a}{b}\right\} \\
= & \frac{200 \times 100.03 \times 10^{-6}}{100.24}+\frac{100.31 \times 700 \times 10^{-6}}{\left[700 \times 10^{-6}+200+100.31\right]}\left\{\frac{200}{100.24}-\frac{200}{100.31}\right\} \\
& =1.9958 \times 10^{-4}+\left(2.3381 \times 10^{-4}\right)\left(1.3923 \times 10^{-3}\right) \\
& =1.999 \times 10^{-4} \Omega=199.905 \mu \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

Kelvin double bridge uses:
Standard resistance $=100 \mathrm{~mW}$
Inner ratio arms $=15 \mathrm{~W}$ and 30 W
Outer ratio arms $=40 \mathrm{~W}$ and 60 W
If the resistance of the connecting leads from standard to unknown resistance is 800 mW .
Calculate the unknown resistance under this cóndition.

Solution Given
$$\begin{gathered}
R_{1}=40 \Omega, R_{2}=60 \Omega, R_{3}=100 \mu \Omega \\
r_{1}=15 \Omega, r_{2}=30 \Omega, R_{y}=800 \mu \Omega

From equation 2.30
$$\begin{aligned}

& =\frac{40 \times 100 \times 10^{-6}}{60}+\frac{30 \times 800 \times 10^{-6}}{\left(800 \times 10^{-6}+15+30\right)}\left[\frac{40}{60}-\frac{15}{30}\right] \\
& =0.66 \times 10^{-4}+5.33 \times 10^{-4}[0.16] \\
& =1.5128 \times 10^{-4} \Omega \\
& =151.28 \mu \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

The differences between a DC bridge and an AC bridge are:
DC bridge
1. DC supply is used.
2. A DC current detector is used.
3. Only resistive components are used.
4. There is no need for Wegner's earthing device.
5. Balancing time is relatively less.

AC bridge
1. AC supply is used.
2. AC current detector is used.
3. Resistive and reactive components are used.
4. Wagner's earthing device is required.
5. Balancing time is high because AC supply is used.

\section*{AC BRIDGES}

In the AC bridge the bridge circuit consists of four impedances and an ac voltage source.
AC - Bridges enable us to perform precise measurements for the following :
- Reactance (capacitance and inductance) measurements.
- Determining the ( $Q$-factor OR D-factor).
- Frequency measurements.
- Testing and analyzing of antenna and transmission line performance
- Other than measurement of unknown impedance, AC bridge are commonly used for shifting phase.

\section*{Types of Sources in AC Bridges :}
- For Low frequency measurement the power line supply can serve as the source of excitation.
- For High frequency measurement the electronic oscillator is used as excitation voltage.

- They are extremely useful for power and low AF ranges.

\section*{Tuneable Amplifier Detector (TAD)}
- It can be used at 10 Hz to 100 KHz .

\section*{Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO)}

1.Maxwell's inductance bridge
2. Maxwell's inductance-capacitance bridge
3. Hay's bridge
4. Anderson's bridge
5. Owen's bridge

\section*{construction}

The basic circuit of an ac bridge is exactly the same as the Wheatstone bridge circuit except that impedances are used instead of resistances, and the supply is an $a c$-sgurce. Also, the null detector must be an $a c$ instrument.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-107.jpg?height=968&width=1844&top_left_y=1115&top_left_x=116)

\section*{PRINCIPLE}

When the specific circuit conditions apply, the detector current becomes zero, which is known as null or balance condition. Since zero current, it means that there is no voltage difference across the detector,

Voltage at point $\boldsymbol{b}$ and $\boldsymbol{c}$ are equal. $\square$ $I_{1} Z_{1}=I_{2} Z_{2}$
The same thing at point $\boldsymbol{d}$.
$$I_{1} Z_{3}=I_{2} Z_{4}$$

From two above equation yield general bridge equation;
$$\frac{\mathrm{Z}_{1}}{\mathrm{Z}_{2}}=\frac{\mathrm{Z}_{3}}{\mathrm{Z}_{4}}$$

Therefore, Z1.Z4 = Z2.Z3
For AC-bridges, the null-condition is only valid if $V a$ and $V b$ are equal in amplitude and also same in-phase. In the polar form the impedance $Z$ can be written as
$$Z=Z \angle \theta$$
where $Z$ represents the impedance and $\theta$ represents the phase angle of complex impedance $Z$.Hence, the bridge arm impedances in polar form can be expressed as
$$\begin{aligned}
& Z_{1}=Z_{1} \angle \theta_{1} \\
& Z_{2}=Z_{2} \angle \theta_{2} \\
& Z_{3}=Z_{3} \angle \theta_{3} \\
& Z_{4}=Z_{4} \angle \theta_{4}
\end{aligned}$$
where $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$ and $Z_{4}$ are the magnitudes and $\theta_{1}, \theta_{2}, \theta_{3}$, and $\theta_{4}$ are the phase angles. Hence, the balance equation in polar form representation will be
$$\left(Z_{1} \angle \theta_{1}\right) \cdot\left(Z_{4} \angle \theta_{4}\right)=\left(Z_{2} \angle \theta_{2}\right)\left(Z_{3} \angle \theta_{3}\right)$$

Since, in complex number multiplication the magnitudes are multiplied and the phase angles are added, the balance equation can be written as
$$Z_{1} Z_{4}\left(\angle \theta_{1}+\theta_{4}\right)=Z_{2} 5_{5} z_{3}^{\varrho}\left(\angle \theta_{2}+\theta_{3}\right)$$
i.e. $\Rightarrow$
$$Z_{1} Z_{4} Z_{2} Z_{3}$$
and
$$\angle \theta_{1}+\angle \theta_{4}=\angle \theta_{2}+\angle \theta_{3}$$

\section*{Example}

The impedances of the AC bridge in Figure below are given as follows
$Z_{1}=200 \angle 30^{\circ} \Omega$
$Z_{2}=150 \angle 0^{0} \Omega$
$Z_{3}=250 \angle-40^{\circ} \Omega$
$Z_{x}=Z_{4}=$ unknown
Determine the constants of the unknown arm.
$\mathrm{Z}_{1} \mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{x}}=\mathrm{Z}_{2} \mathrm{Z}_{3}, \quad \mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{x}}=\left(\mathrm{Z}_{2} \mathrm{Z}_{3} / \mathrm{Z}_{1}\right), \quad=[(150 * 250) / 200]=187.5 \Omega$

The second condition for balance requires that the sums of the phase angles of opposite arms be equal,
$\theta_{1}+\theta_{\mathrm{x}}=\theta_{2}+\theta_{3}$
$\theta_{x}=\theta_{2}+\theta_{3}-\theta_{1}=0+\left(-40^{\circ}\right)-30^{\circ}=-70^{\circ}$
The unknown impedance $Z_{x}$, can be written as,
$$\begin{aligned}
& Z_{x}=187.5 \Omega \angle-70^{\circ} \\
& Z_{x}=(64.13-j 176.19) \Omega
\end{aligned}$$

As shown in above figure, AC bridge mainly consists of four arms, which are connected in rhombus or square shape. All these arms consist of some impedance.

The detector and AC voltage source are also required in order to find the value of unknown impedance. Hence, one of these two are placed in one diagonal of AC bridgerand the other one is placed in other diagonal of AC bridge. The balancing condition of Wheatstone's bridge as -
$$R_{4}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3}}{R_{1}}$$

We will get the balancing condition of ACobridge, just by replacing R with Z in above equation.
$$\begin{gathered}
Z_{4}=\frac{Z_{2} Z_{3}}{Z_{1}} \\
\Rightarrow Z_{1} Z_{4}=Z_{2} Z_{3}
\end{gathered}$$

Here, $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$ are fixed impedances. Whereas, $Z_{3}$ is,a standard variable impedance and $Z_{4}$ is an unknown impedafice.

$$\begin{aligned}
& Z_{1}=R_{1} \\
& Z_{2}=R_{2} \\
& Z_{3}=R_{3} \text { in series with } C_{3}=R_{3}-j / \omega C_{3} \\
& Z_{x}=R_{x} \text { in series with } C_{x}=R_{x}-j / \omega C_{x}
\end{aligned}$$

The condition for balance of the bridge is
i.e. $\quad \begin{aligned} Z_{1} Z_{x} & =Z_{2} Z_{3} \\ \left.R_{x}-\frac{j}{\omega C_{x}}\right) & =R_{2}\left(R_{3}-\frac{j}{\omega C_{3}}\right)\end{aligned}$
$\therefore \quad R_{1} R_{\mathrm{x}}-\frac{j R_{1}}{\omega C_{x}}=R_{2} R_{3}-\frac{j R_{2}}{\omega C_{3}}$
Two complex quantities are equal when both their real and their imaginary terms are equal. Therefore,
i.e. $\quad R_{1} R_{x}=R_{2} R_{3} \quad \therefore R_{x}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3}}{R_{1}}$
and $\quad \frac{R_{1}}{\omega C_{x}}=\frac{R_{2}}{\omega C_{3}} \quad C_{x}=\frac{C_{3} R_{1}}{R_{2}}$

\section*{Maxwell's bridge}

Let, $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$ and $Z_{4}$ are the impedances 80 arms $\mathrm{DA}, \mathrm{AB}, \mathrm{CD}$ and $B C$ respectively. The values of these impedances will be:
$$\begin{aligned}
Z_{1} & =\frac{R_{1}\left(\frac{1}{j \omega C_{1}}\right)}{R_{1}+\frac{1}{j \omega C_{1}}} \\
\Rightarrow Z_{1} & =\frac{R_{1}}{1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}} \\
Z_{2} & =R_{2} \\
Z_{3} & =R_{3} \\
Z_{4} & =R_{4}+j \omega L_{4}
\end{aligned}$$

Substitute these impedance values in the following balancing condition of AC bridge.
$$\begin{gathered}
Z_{4}=\frac{Z_{2} Z_{3}}{Z_{1}} \\
R_{4}+j \omega L_{4}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3}}{\left(\frac{R_{1}}{1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}}\right)} \\
\Rightarrow R_{4}+j \omega L_{4}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3}\left(1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}\right)}{R_{1}} \\
\Rightarrow R_{4}+j \omega L_{4}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3}}{R_{1}}+\frac{j \omega R_{1} C_{1} R_{2} R_{3}}{R_{1}} \\
\Rightarrow R_{4}+j \omega L_{4}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3}}{R_{1}}+j \omega C_{1} R_{2} R_{3}
\end{gathered}$$

By comparing the respective real and imaginary terms of above equation, we will get
$$\begin{array}{ll}
R_{4}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3}}{R_{1}} & \text { Equation 1 } \\
L_{4}=C_{1} R_{2} R_{3} & \text { Equation } 22
\end{array}$$

\section*{Hay's Bridge}

Hay's bridge is a modified version of Maxwell's bridge, which we geetby modifying the arm, which consists of a parallel combination of resistor and capacitor into the arm, which consists of a series combination of resistor and capacitor in Maxwell's bridge. Hay's bridge is used to measure the value of high inductance.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-112.jpg?height=757&width=963&top_left_y=1248&top_left_x=115)

Let, $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$ and $Z_{4}$ are the impedances of arms $D A, A B, C D$ and $B C$ respectively. The values of these impedances will be
$$\begin{aligned}
& Z_{1}=R_{1}+\frac{1}{j \omega C_{1}} \\
& \Rightarrow Z_{1}=\frac{1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}}{j \omega C_{1}} \\
& Z_{2}=R_{2} \\
& Z_{3}=R_{3} \\
& Z_{4}=R_{4}+j \omega L_{4}
\end{aligned}$$

Substitute these impedance values in the following balancing condition of AC bridge.
$$\begin{gathered}
Z_{4}=\frac{Z_{2} Z_{3}}{Z_{1}} \\
R_{4}+j \omega L_{4}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3}}{\left(\frac{1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}}{j \omega C_{1}}\right)} \\
R_{4}+j \omega L_{4}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3} j \omega C_{1}}{\left(1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}\right)}
\end{gathered}$$

Multiply the numerator and denominator of right handside term of above equation with $1-j \omega R_{1} C 1$.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \left.\Rightarrow R_{4}+j \omega L_{4}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3} j \omega C_{1}}{\left(1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}\right)}\right) \times \frac{\left(1\left(9-j \omega R_{1} C_{1}\right)\right.}{\left(1-j \omega R_{1} C_{1}\right)} \\
& \Rightarrow R_{4}+j \omega L_{4}=\frac{\omega^{2} C_{1}{ }^{2} R_{1} \beta_{2} R_{3}+j \omega R_{2} R_{3} C_{1}}{x^{\left(\hat{1}+\omega^{2} R_{1}^{2} C_{1}^{2}\right)}}
\end{aligned}$$

By comparing the respective real $a n d$ imaginary terms of above equation, we will get
$$\begin{aligned}
& R_{4}=\frac{\omega^{2} C_{1}^{2} R_{1} R_{2} R_{3}}{\left(1+\omega^{2} R_{1}^{2} C_{1}^{2}\right)} \\
& \text { on } 3 \\
& L_{4}=\frac{R_{2} R_{3} C_{1}}{\left(1+\omega^{2} R_{1}^{2} C_{1}^{2}\right)} \\
& \text { on } 4
\end{aligned}$$

By substituting the values of $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}, C_{1}$ and $\omega$ in Equation 3 and Equation 4, we will get the values of resistor, $R_{4}$ and inductor, $L_{4}$.

\section*{Schering Bridge}

Schering bridge is an AC bridge having four arms, which are connected in the form of a rhombus or square shape, whose one arm consists of a single resistor, one arm consists of a series combination of resistor and capacitor, one arm consists of a single capacitor $\&$ the other arm consists of a parallel combination of resistor and capacitor.

The AC detector and AC voltage source are also used to find the value of unknown impedance, hence one of them is placed in one diagonal of Schering bridge and the other one is placed in other diagonal of Schering bridge.

Schering bridge is used to measure the value of capacitance. The circuit diagram of Schering bridge is shown in the below figure.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-114.jpg?height=687&width=887&top_left_y=264&top_left_x=120)

Let, $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$ and $Z 4$ are the impedances of arms $D A, A B \geqslant D$ and $B C$ respectively. The values of these impedances will be
$$\begin{aligned}
Z_{1} & =\frac{R_{1}\left(\frac{1}{j \omega C_{1}}\right)}{R_{1}+\frac{1}{j \omega C_{1}}} \\
\Rightarrow Z_{1} & =\frac{R_{1}}{1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}} \\
Z_{2} & =R_{2} \\
Z_{3} & =\frac{1}{j \omega C_{3}} \\
Z_{4} & =R_{4}+\frac{1}{j \omega C_{4}} \\
\Rightarrow Z_{4} & =\frac{1+j \omega R_{4} C_{4}}{j \omega C_{4}}
\end{aligned}$$

Substitute these impedance values in the following balancing condition of AC bridge.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1+j \omega R_{4} C_{4}}{j \omega C_{4}}=\frac{R_{2}\left(\frac{1}{j \omega C_{3}}\right)}{\frac{R_{1}}{1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}}} \\
& \quad \Rightarrow \frac{1+j \omega R_{4} C_{4}}{j \omega C_{4}}=\frac{R_{2}\left(1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}\right)}{j \omega R_{1} C_{3}} \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{1+j \omega R_{4} C_{4}}{C_{4}}=\frac{R_{2}\left(1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}\right)}{R_{1} C_{3}} \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{1}{C_{4}}+j \omega R_{4}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} C_{3}}+\frac{j \omega C_{1} R_{2}}{C_{3}}
\end{aligned}$$

By comparing the respective real and imaginary terms of above equation, we will get
$$\begin{array}{ll}
C_{4}=\frac{R_{1} C_{3}}{R_{2}} & \text { Equation 1 } \\
R_{4}=\frac{C_{1} R_{2}}{C_{3}} & \text { Equation 2 }
\end{array}$$

The advantage of Schering bridge is that both the values of resistor, $R 4$ and capacitor, $C 4$ are independent of the value of frequency.

\section*{Wien's Bridge}

Wien's bridge is an AC bridge having four arms, which are connected in the form of a rhombus or square shape. Amongtwo arms consist of a single resistor, one arm consists of a parallel combination of resistor and capacitor \& the other arm consists of a series combination of resistor and capacitor.

The AC detector and AC voltage source are also required in order to find the value of frequency. Hence, one of these two are placed in one diagonal of Wien's bridge and the other one is placed in other diagonal of Wien's bridge.

The circuit diagram of Wien's bridge is shown in the below figure.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-115.jpg?height=728&width=1194&top_left_y=891&top_left_x=124)

Let, $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$ and $Z 4$ are the impedances of arms $D A, A B, C D$ and $B C$ respectively. The values of these impedances will be
$$\begin{gathered}
Z_{1}=R_{1}+\frac{1}{j \omega C_{1}} \\
\Rightarrow Z_{1}=\frac{1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}}{j \omega C_{1}} \\
Z_{2}=R_{2} \\
Z_{3}=\frac{R_{3}\left(\frac{1}{j \omega C_{3}}\right)}{R_{3}+\frac{1}{j \omega C_{3}}} \\
\Rightarrow Z_{3}=\frac{R_{3}}{1+j \omega R_{3} C_{3}} \\
Z_{4}=R_{4}
\end{gathered}$$

Substitute these impedance values in the following balancing condition of AC bridge.
$$\begin{gathered}
Z_{1} Z_{4}=Z_{2} Z_{3} \\
\left(\frac{1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}}{j \omega C_{1}}\right) R_{4}=R_{2}\left(\frac{R_{3}}{1+j \omega R_{3} C_{3}}\right) \\
\Rightarrow\left(1+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}\right)\left(1+j \omega R_{3} C_{3}\right) R_{4}=j \omega C_{1} R_{2} R_{3} \\
\Rightarrow\left(1+j \omega R_{3} C_{3}+j \omega R_{1} C_{1}-\omega^{2} R_{1} R_{3} C_{1} C_{3}\right) R_{4}=j \omega C_{1} R_{2} R_{3} \\
\Rightarrow R_{4}\left(\omega^{2} R_{1} R_{3} C_{1} C_{3}\right)+j \omega R_{4}\left(R_{3} C_{3}+R_{1} C_{1}\right)=j \omega C_{1} R_{2} R_{3}
\end{gathered}$$

Equate the respective real terms of above equation.
$$\begin{gathered}
R_{4}\left(1-\omega^{2} R_{1} R_{3} C_{1} C_{3}\right)=0 \\
\Rightarrow 1-\omega^{2} R_{1} R_{3} C_{1} C_{3}=0 \\
\Rightarrow 1=\omega^{2} R_{1} R_{3} C_{1} C_{3} \\
\omega=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R_{1} R_{3} C_{1} C_{3}}}
\end{gathered}$$

Substitute, $\omega=2 \pi f$ in above equation.
$$\begin{gathered}
\Rightarrow 2 \pi f=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R_{1} R_{3} C_{1} C_{3}}} \\
\quad \Rightarrow f=\frac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{R_{1} R_{3} C_{1} C_{3}}}
\end{gathered}$$

We can find the value of frequency, $f$ of $A C$ voltage source $b y$ substituting the values of $R 1, R 3, C 1$ and $C 3$ in above equation. If $R 1=R 3=R$ and $G=C 3=C$, then we can find the value of frequency, $f$ of $A C$ voltage source by using the following formula.
$$f=\frac{1}{2 \pi R C}$$

The Wein's bridge is mainly used for finding the frequency value
of AF range.

\section*{Magnetic field, field strength, and flux density}

Magnetism $\square$ Force of attraction or repulsion that acts between magnets and other magnetic materials Flux lines $\square$ Show direction and intensity of this field at all points
Flux, $\square$ : Total number of lines
The number of magnetic lines of forces set up in a magnetic circuit is called Magnetic Flux.
Symbol is Phi, ( $\Phi$ ) with the unit of flux being the Weber, ( Wb ).
But the number of lines of force within a given unit area is called the "Flux Density" and since flux ( $\Phi$ ) is measured in ( Wb ) and area ( A ) in metres squared, ( $\mathrm{m}^{2}$ ), flux density is therefore measured in Webers/Metre ${ }^{2}$ or ( $\mathrm{Wb} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ) and is given the symbol B .
Magnetic Flux Density
$$\text { Magnetic Flux Density, (tesla) }=\frac{\text { Magnetic Flux, (weber) }}{\text { Area, }(\mathrm{m} 2)}$$

The symbol for magnetic flux density is B and the unit of magnetic flux density is the Tesla, T .
$\mathrm{B}=\frac{\Phi}{\mathrm{A}} \quad$ in Teslas

\section*{Magnetism Example No1}

The amount of flux present in a round magnetic bar was measured at 0.013 webers. If the material has a diameter of 12 cm , calculate the flux density.

The cross sectional area of the magnetic material in m 2 is given as:
$$\begin{gathered}
\text { Diameter }=12 \mathrm{~cm} \\
\therefore \text { Area }=\pi \mathrm{r}^{2} \\
\mathrm{~A}=3.142 \times 0.06^{2}=0.0113 \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{gathered}$$

The magnetic flux is given as 0.013 webers, therefore the flux density can be calculated as:
$$\mathrm{B}=\frac{\Phi}{\mathrm{A}}=\frac{0.013}{0.0113}=1.15 \mathrm{~T}$$

So the flux density is calculated as 1.15 Teslas.
The magnetic field is defined as the region around the magnet where its poles and the electrical charges experience the force of attraction or repulsion,
Magnetic field intensity, H . Also called mégnetizing force . Measures mmf per unit length of a circuit.

\section*{Difference Between Magnetic Field \& Magnetic Flux}

The most significant difference between the magnetic field and the magnetic flux is that the magnetic field is the region around the magnet where the moving charge experiences a force, whereas the magnetic flux shows the quantity or strength of magnetic lines produced by the magnet.

\section*{Key Differences Between Magnetic Field and Magnetic Flux}

The following are the key differences between the magnetic field and magnetic flux.
1. The area around the magnetic field where the poles and the moving charge experience the force of attraction and repulsion is called a magnetic field. Whereas, the magnetic flux shows the quantities of the magnetic lines of force passes through it.
2. The magnetic field is expressed as the product of the magnetic strength and the direction of the moving charges. Whereas, the magnetic field is the product of the field strength and the area around the poles.
3. The SI unit of the magnetic field is Telsa whereas the SI unit of magnetic flux is Weber.
4. The magnetic field only depends on the magnet which generates it whereas the magnetic flux depends on the magnetic strength and area.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Basis For Comparison & Magnetic Field & Magnetic Flux \\
\hline Definition & The region around the magnet where its poles shows the force of attraction or repulsion. & It shows the quantity of the magnetic line of forces produced by the magnet. \\
\hline Formula & $F=q v B$ & $\emptyset=B A$ \\
\hline SI Unit & Tesla & Weber \\
\hline Dependence & Only on Magnet that produces it. & On magnet field strength and also the area between them. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Magneto Motive Force(F)}

It can be shown that the amount of flux available in any given magnetic circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it and the number of turns of wire within the coil. Magneto motive force is "the ability creates a magnetic flux in magnetic circuit". OR It is the force by which a magnetic field is produced Magneto Motive Force is expressed as a current, I flowing through a coil of N turns. The magnetic field strength of an electromagnet is therefore determined by the ampere turns of the coil with the more turns of wire in the coil the greater will be the strength of the magnetic field.
Magneto Motive Force, (m.m.f.) $=\mathrm{I} \times \mathrm{N}$ ampere tuges $F=N I$
Where, N - numbers of turns of inductiye écoil, I - current
Also $F=\emptyset R$ Where R - reluctance, $\Phi$-magnetic flux
Reluctance is the Opposition that circuit presents to flux
$$\mathfrak{R}=\frac{\ell}{\mu A} \quad(\mathrm{At} / \mathrm{Wb})$$
where $\mu=$ material permeability. Permeability measures ease of establishing magnetic flux in a material $\square$ Ferromagnetic materials have high permeability $\square$ Nonmagnetic materials have low permeability Relative Permeability
$$\mu_{\mathrm{r}}=\frac{\mu}{\mu_{\mathrm{o}}}=\frac{\text { Flux Density in the Material }}{\text { Flux Density in a Vacuum }}$$

\section*{Magnetic Field Strength (intensity) for Electromagnets}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-118.jpg?height=492&width=974&top_left_y=2047&top_left_x=142)
- Where:
- H - is the strength of the magnetic field in ampere-turns/metre, At/m
- N - is the number of turns of the coil
- I - is the current flowing through the coil in amps, A
- L - is the length of the coil in metres, m

Then to summarise, the strength or intensity of a coils magnetic field depends on the following factors.
- The number of turns of wire within the coil.
- The amount of current flowing in the coil.
- The type of core material.

\section*{Electromagnet Example No1}

The absolute permeability of a soft iron core is given as 80 milli-henries $/ \mathrm{m}\left(80.10^{-3}\right)$. Calculate the equivalent relative permeability value.
$$\mu_{\mathrm{r}}=\frac{\mu}{\mu_{\mathrm{o}}}=\frac{80 \times 10^{-3}}{4 \times \pi \times 10^{-7}}=63,654 \text { or } 64 \times 10^{3}$$

\section*{Magnetic Hysteresis}

The lag or delay of a magnetic material known commonly as Magnetic Hysteresis, relates to the magnetisation properties of a material by which it firstly bgeomes magnetised and then de-magnetised.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-119.jpg?height=373&width=283&top_left_y=1353&top_left_x=124)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-119.jpg?height=366&width=274&top_left_y=1362&top_left_x=443)

By plotting values of flux density, ( B ) against the field strength, ( H ) we can produce a set of curves called Magnetisation Curves, Magnetic Hysteresis Curves or more commonly B-H Curves for each type of core material used as shown below.

\section*{Magnetisation or B-H Curve}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-120.jpg?height=1572&width=1120&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=112)

The Magnetic Hysteresis loop above, shows the behaviour of a ferromagnetic core graphically as the relationship between B and H is non-linear. Starting with an unmagnetised core both B and H will be at zero, point 0 on the magnetisation curve.

If the magnetisation current, i is increased in a positive direction to some value the magnetic field strength H increases linearly with i and the flux density B will also increase as shown by the curve from point 0 to point a as it heads towards saturation.

Then the B-H curve follows the path of a-b-c-d-e-f-a as the magnetising current flowing through the coil alternates between a positive and negative value such as the cycle of an AC voltage. This path is called a Magnetic Hysteresis Loop.

Magnetic Hysteresis results in the dissipation of wasted energy in the form of heat with the energy wasted being in proportion to the area of the magnetic hysteresis loop. Hysteresis losses will always be a problem in AC transformers where the current is constantly changing direction and thus the magnetic poles in the core will cause losses because they constantly reverse direction.

\section*{Example}

What is the magnetizing force of a coil having 4000 turns and 10 mA current flowing through it?

\section*{Solution}

We have following formula to calculate ampere - turns (magnetizing force):
$$\mathrm{F}=A-t$$

So, putting values of current and turns into formula,
$$\mathrm{F}=4000 * 0.01=40 A-t$$

Thus, if a large amount of magnetizing force is needed and only a small amount of current is available, it is necessary to use a great number of turns on the coil.

\section*{Examples}
1. A current of 5 A is passed through a 1000-turn coil wound on a circular magnetic circuit of radius 120 mm . Calculate (a) the magnetomotive force, and (b) the magnetic field strength.

Hence, magnetic field strength, $\mathbf{H}=\frac{\mathrm{NI}}{\mathrm{l}}=\frac{(1000)(5)}{2 \pi(0.120)}=\mathbf{6 6 3 1} \mathrm{A} / \mathrm{m}$

and m.m.f. $=\mathrm{H} \times \mathrm{l}=\frac{\Phi}{\mathrm{A} \mu_{0}} \times \mathrm{l}=\frac{0.75 \times 10^{-3} \times 20 \times 10^{-3}}{5 \times 10^{-4} \times 4 \pi \times 10^{-7}}=23870 \mathrm{~A}$
. (a) Determine the flux density produced in an air-cored solenoid due to a uniform magnetic field strength of $8000 \mathrm{~A} / \mathrm{m}$.

The principal requirements in magnetic measurements are
(i) The measurement of magnetic field strength in air.
(ii) The determination of B-H curve and hysteresis loop for soft Ferro-magnetic materials.
(iii) The determination of eddy current and frysteresis losses of soft Ferro- magnetic materials subjected to alternating magnetic fields.
(iv) The testing of permanent magnets Magnetic measurements have some inherent inaccuracies due to which the measured values depart considerably from the true values. The inaccuracies are due to the following reasons
(i) The conditions in the magnetic specimen under tést are different from those assumed in calculations;
(ii) The magnetic materials are not homogeneous,
(iv)There is no uniformity between different batches of test specimens even if such are the same composition.

\section*{Types of Tests}

Many methods of testing magnetic materials have been devised wherein attempts have been made to eliminate the inaccuracies. However, attention will be confined to a few basic methods of ‘Testing Ferro-magnetic materials. They are:
(i) Ballistic Tests: These tests are generally employed for the determination of B- H curves and hysteresis loops of Ferro-magnetic materials.
(ii) A. C. Testing. These tests may be carried at power, audio or radio frequencies. They give information about eddy current and hysteresis losses in magnetic materials.
(iii) Steady State Tests. These are performed to obtain the steady value of flux density existing in the air gap of a magnetic circuit.
Ballistic Tests: These tests are used for determination of flux density in a specimen, determination of B-H curves and plotting of hysteresis loop.

\section*{Hall effect}

The Hall effect is an occurrence of a very small voltage that is generated on opposite sides of a thin currentcarrying conductor or semiconductor (the Hall element) that is in a magnetic field.

The Hall effect is widely employed by various sensors for directly measuring position or motion and can be used indirectly for other measurements.

- Hall sensors are commonly used to measure parameters associated with rotating devices (e.g. wheels and shafts)
- internal combustion engine ignition timing
- tachometers
- anti-lock braking systems
- brushless DC electric motors to deftect the position of fie permanent magnet

\section*{Fluxmeter}

Definition: The meter which is used for measuring the flux of the permanent magnet such type of meter is known as the flux meter. The fluxmeter is the advañeed form of the ballistic galvanometer which has certain advantages like the meter has low controlling toigue and heavy electromagnetic damping.

\section*{Construction of Flux Meter}

The construction of the fluxmeter is shown in the figure below. The fluxmeter has a coil which is freely suspended by the help of the spring and the single silk thread. The coil moves freely between the poles of the permanent magnet.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-125.jpg?height=817&width=990&top_left_y=117&top_left_x=112)

The current enters into the coil with the help of the helices which is very thin and made from the annealed silver strips. This current reduces the controlling torque to the ninimum value. The air friction damping of the coil is negligible.

\section*{Operation of Flux Meter}

The terminals of the fluxmeter are connected across the searoh coil as shown in the figure below. The flux linking with the coil is varied by eitherremoving it fromthe magnetic field or by reversing the field of the magnet. The change of the flux induces the electromotive force in the coil. This emf induces the current in the search coil and send it through the flux meter. Because of the current, the pointer of the fluxmeter deflects, and their deflection is directly proportional to the change in the value of flux linkages.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-125.jpg?height=607&width=912&top_left_y=1569&top_left_x=116)

\section*{Flux Meter With Search Coil}

As, the variation of the flux linkages reduces, coil stop moving because of their high electromagnetic damping. The high electromagnetic damping is because of the low resistance circuit between the fluxmeter and the search coil.

\section*{Advantages of Fluxmeter}

The following are the advantages of fluxmeter.
1. The fluxmeter is portable.
2. The scale of the fluxmeter is calibrated in Weber meters.
3. The deflection of the coil is free from the time taken by the flux to change.

\section*{Disadvantages}

The only disadvantage of the fluxmeter is that it is less sensitive and accurate as compared to the flux meter. Ballistic Galvanometer
Definition: The galvanometer which is used for estimating the quantity of charge flow through it is called the ballistic galvanometer.

\section*{Construction of Ballistic Galvanometer}

The ballistic galvanometer consists coil of copper wire which is wound on the non-conducting frame of the galvanometer. The phosphorous bronze suspends the coil between the north and south poles of a magnet. For increasing the magnetic flux the iron core places within the coil. The lower portion of the coil connects with the spring. This spring provides the restoring torque to the coil.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-126.jpg?height=795&width=1165&top_left_y=898&top_left_x=153)

\section*{The working principle of the ballistic galvanometer.}

When the charge passes through the galvanometer, their coil starts moving and gets an impulse. The impulse of the coil is proportional to the charges passes through it. The actual reading of the galvanometer achieves by using the coil having a high moment of inertia. The moment of inertia means the body oppose the angular movement. If the coil has a high moment of inertia, then their oscillations are large. Thus, accurate reading is obtained

\section*{Calibration of Galvanometer}

The calibration of the galvanometer is the process of determining its constant value by the help of the practical experiments. The following are the methods used for determining the constant of the ballistic galvanometer.

\section*{Using a Capacitor}

The charging and discharging of the capacitor gives the values of the ballistic galvanometer constant. The circuit arrangement for the calibration of a ballistic galvanometer using the capacitor is shown in the figure below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-127.jpg?height=657&width=751&top_left_y=135&top_left_x=134)

The circuit uses two pole switch S and the unknown EMF source E. When the switch S connects to terminal 2 then the capacitor becomes charged. Similarly, when the switch connects to terminal 1, then the capacitor becomes discharges through the resistor R, connected in series with the ballistic galvanometer The discharge current of the capacitor deflects the coil of ballistic galvanometer through an angle $\theta$. The formula calculates
constant of the galvanometer
$$K_{q}=Q / \theta_{1}=C E / \theta_{1}^{3} \text { columb } / \text { radian }$$

\section*{Using a Mutual Inductance}

The constant of the ballistic galvanometer defermines through the mutual inductance between the coils. The arrangement of the ballistic galvanometer requires two coilssprimary and secondary. The primary coil is energised by knowing voltage source
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-127.jpg?height=438&width=1047&top_left_y=1429&top_left_x=119)

Calibration of Ballistic Galvanometer by mutual Induction

Because of the mutual induction, the current induces in the secondary circuit. And this current is used for the calibration of the ballistic galvanometer.

\section*{DETERMINATION OF MAGNETISING CURVE}

\section*{Step-by-step Method}

For this test, the circuit diagram is shown in Figure 12.10. In this test the magnetisation winding of the ring specimen is supplied from a potential divider having few tappings. The tappings are arranged so that the magnetisation force $H$ may be increased in suitable number of steps, upto desired maximum value. Before testing the specimen, it must be demagnetised.
Keeping the switch $S 2$ on the tap 1 position, the switch $S 1$ is closed. Current flow in the magnetising winding sets up a magnetising force, $H 1$ which in turns increases the flux density in the specimen, from zero to some value B1, and corresponding throw of
galvanometer is observed. The $B 1$ value can be calculated from the throw of the galvanometer. H 1 value may be calculated from the reading of the ammetre, connected to the magnetising winding circuit. The magnetising force is then increased to some value H 2 by switching $S 2$ suddenly to the tapping 2 and the corresponding increase in flux density $\Delta B$ is determined from the throw of the galvanometer. Then the flux density $B 2$ corresponding to magnetising force H 2 is calculated as $\mathrm{B} 2=\mathrm{B} 1+\Delta B$. The process is repeated for other values of $H$ up to the maximum point and the complete $B$ - $H$ curve thus drawn as shown in Figure
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-128.jpg?height=1199&width=1055&top_left_y=639&top_left_x=261)

\section*{DETERMINATION OF HYSTERESIS LOOP}

\section*{Step-by-step Method}

The determination of the hysteresis loop by this method is carried out simply by continuing the procedure described in the previous section where the $B-H$ curve was obtained. After reaching the point of maximum $H$ with $S 2$ on the tapping 8 , the magnetising current is then reduced, in steps to zero by moving $S 2$ down through tapping points $8,7,6 \ldots 2,1$. After the reduction of the magnetising force to zero, negative values of $H$ are obtained by reversing the reversing supply to the potential divider and then moving the switch $S 2$ in steps as before.

\section*{What is HIBBERT STANDARD?}

A standard of magnetic flux linkage suitable for fluxmeter or galvanometer calibration. It comprises a stabilized magnet producing a radial field in an annular gap, through which a cylinder carrying a multiturn coil can be dropped

\subsection*{9.3.3 Determination of B.G. Constant $\boldsymbol{K}$}

3. Mutual inductor method
4. Standard condenser method.

How magnetic lux density is measured using Ballistic galvanometer
The measurement of flux density inside a specimen can be done by winding a search coil over the specimen. This search coil is known as a " B coil". This search coil is then connected to a ballistic galvanometer or to a flux meter. Let us consider that we have to measure the flux density in a ring specimen shown in Fig below The ring specimen is wound with a magnetizing winding which carries a current I. A search coil of convenient number of turns is wound on the ${ }^{3}$ specimen and connected through a resistance and calibrating coil, to a ballistic galvanometer as shown, The current through the magnetizing coil is reversed and therefore the flux linkages of the search coil change inducing an emf it. Thus emf sends a current through the ballistic galvanometer causing it to deflect.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-129.jpg?height=944&width=1037&top_left_y=1206&top_left_x=132)

Fig. 5.3 Measurement of flux density

When a magnetic material undergoes cyclic magnetization, two kinds of power losses occur in it Hysteresis Loss and Eddy Current Loss which together are known as core-loss. The core-loss is important in determining heating, temperature rise, rating and efficiency of transformers, machines and other ac run magnetic devices. Hysteresis Loss Figure 2.18 shows a typical hysteresis loop of a ferromagnetic material. As the mmf is increased from zero to its maximum value, the energy stored in the field per unit volume of material is Hysteresis Loss and Eddy Current Loss
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-130.jpg?height=660&width=1066&top_left_y=456&top_left_x=128)

Fig. 2.18 Hysteresis loss
Eddy current Loss When a magnetic core carȩies a time-varying flux, voltages are induced in all possible paths enclosing the flux. The result is the production of circulating currents in the core (all magnetic materials are conductors). These currents are knownas eddy-currents afid have power loss (i2R) associated with them called eddy-current loss. This loss, of course, depends upon the resistivity of the material and lengths of the paths of circulating currents for a given cross-section. Higher resistivity and longer paths increase the effective resistance offered by the material to induce voltages resulting in reduction of eddy-current loss. High resistivity is achieved by adding silicon to steel and hence silicon steel is used for cores conducting alternating flux. Dividing up the material into thin laminatigns along the flow of flux, with each lamination lightly insulated (varnish is generally used) from the adjoining ones, increases the path length of the circulating currents with consequent reduction in eddy-current loss.

Example 3 A moving coil ballistic galvanometer of 200 ohm resistance gives a throw of 100 divisions when the flux through a search coil to which it is connected is reversed. Find the flux density, given that the galvanometer constant is $120 \mu$ C per scale division and the search coil has 1500 turns, a mean area of $60 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and a resistance of $30 \Omega$.
Solution It is given that, Number of turns in the search coil Cross-sectional area of search coil Galvanometer sensitivity (a constant) Combined resistance of the circuit Galvanometer throw (deflection) Permeability of specimen in air
$$\begin{aligned}
N & =1500 \text { ampere-turn }(\mathrm{AT}) / \mathrm{m} \\

\theta & =100 \\
\mu_{0} & =4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \text { Henry } / \text { meter }
\end{aligned}$$

Now, flux density B is given as
$$\begin{aligned}
B & =\frac{R K q}{2 N A} \mathrm{~Wb} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \\
\text { or, } \quad B & =\frac{230 \times 120 \times 10^{-6} \times 100}{2 \times 15000 \times 60 \times 10^{-4}} \mathrm{~Wb} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \\
B & =0.153 \mathrm{~Wb} / \mathrm{m}^{2}
\end{aligned}$$

Example 4 For calibration of a flux meter, it is connected to the secondary of an aircored solenoid placed at its centre. The solenoid is 2 meter long and is wound with 1000 turns. The secondary has 600 turns and mean area of $6 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. When a current of 5 amps in the primary is reversed, there is a deflection of 30 scale divisions in, The flux meter. Calculate the constant of the flux meter in flux linkage per scale division.
Solution It is given that,
Number of turns in the primary winding
Number of turns in the secondary winding
$$\begin{aligned}
& N_{1}=1000 \text { ampere-turn }(\mathrm{AT}) / \mathrm{m} \\
& N_{2}=600 \text { ampere-turn }(\mathrm{AT}) / \mathrm{m}
\end{aligned}$$

Cross-sectional area of secondary
Length of the solenoid
Reversing current
Flux meter deflection
Permeability of specimen in air
We know,
$$\begin{aligned}
\partial A & =6 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}=6 \times 1 Q^{G} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
l & =2 \mathrm{~m} \\
I & =5 \text { amperes } \\
\theta & =30 \\
\mu_{0} & =4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \text { Henry/meter }
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
H & =\frac{N_{1} I}{l} \mathrm{AT} / \mathrm{m} \\
& =\frac{1000 \times 5}{2}=2500 \mathrm{AT} / \mathrm{m}
\end{aligned}$$

Also,
$$\begin{aligned}
B & =\mu_{0} H \\
& =4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \times 2500 \\
& =31.43 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~Wb} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \\
\Phi & =B A \\
& =31.43 \times 10^{-4} \times 6 \times 10^{-4} \\
& =188.6 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~Wb}
\end{aligned}$$

Now, the flux linkage to secondary winding,
$$\psi=N_{2} \Phi=K \theta$$

Hence, the constant of the flux meter in flux linkage per scale division

\section*{ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS AND COMMON FAULTS}

SOLDERING
"Soldering" is a low-temperature form of welding commonly used to join electrical conductors together for permanent connections.

\section*{Soldering Materials and tools}
1. Soldering Iron- Used to melt solder and connect component pins to board pads.
2. Solder- An alloy of tin and lead with a low melting point. An alloy of $60 / 40$ ( $60 \%$ tin, $40 \%$ lead)
3. Flux or Rosin - A flux is a chemical purifying agent. In soldering metals, flux provides three functions: -
- it eliminates rust from the components.
- It prevents oxidation of the metals that are being connected
- enhances the ability of the solder to "wet" the surfaces that are being joined
4. Solder Wick or De-soldering Braid- A tool used to extract solder and de-solder components from the board,
5. Flux Remover- A liquid used to remove flux residue (eg. Home dry cleaner).
6. Stand on which to hold the hot soldering iron
7. Sponge :The damp sponge is used to clean the tip of the iron.
8. Steel wool or fine sandpaper: This is used to clean connections prior to soldering.
9. Crocodile clips: These can be used as heat sinks, if needed. helping to prevent component damage
10. Pliers, Knife, Multi-Meter, and Magnifier- Pliers are used to cut, bend, and sometimes strip component leads; a knife to strip wires and trim traces; rfulti-meters to test electrical connectivity; and a magnifier for soldering small SMT chip components.

\section*{Some basic soldering rules are :}
1. Soldering tip must be tinned andselean.
2. Metals to be soldered must be clean.
3. Support the joint mechanically where possible.
4. Tin large areas before soldering them together.
5. Apply solder to joint, not to gun or irontip, solder must flow freely and have a shiny, smooth appearance.
6. Use only enough solder to make a solid connection.
7. Where additional flux is used, apply to joint, not to soldering tip. Use only rosin or resin flux.
8. Solder rapidly and do not permit components or insulation to burn or overheat
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-132.jpg?height=711&width=608&top_left_y=1786&top_left_x=119)

\section*{Common Problems and Troubleshooting}
1. Solder will not flow.
- The parts to be joined may be dirty. Remove the solder and clean the parts.
2. The connection looks grainy or crystalline.
- Parts were moved before the solder was allowed to cool.
- Reheat to form a good joint. You may need a larger soldering iron to heat connections adequately.
3. The tip is oxidized.
- Soldering is much easier with a shiny, clean tip.
- Clean the tip with a damp synthetic sponge while the iron is hot.
- To avoid oxidizing the tip, do not leave the iron plugged in when not in use.
- Do not use the iron at a higher temperature than is necessary to melt solder.
- Clean the tip of the iron on a damp synthetic sponge as soon as it starts to change from a silver color.
4. There is too much or too little solder.
- Using too much solder can cause a solder bridge, which means that two adjacent joints are accidentally connected.
- Using too little solder might result in poor elestrical continuity between the board and component. The connection should be smooth, shiny, and rigid.
5. Cold solder joint. A "cold solder joint" is a poof solder connection resulting from motion of the pieces during the cooling process or insufficient temperature.

\section*{Types of soldering iron}
1. Soldering pencil: is a pencil-shaped device withran electrical heating element in its end.
2. A soldering station: consists of a soldering pencil attached to a power station.
3. Soldering systems: consist of several hand pieces including soldering iron, hot-air gun, de-soldering gun, thermo-tweezers and so on.
4. Soldering "guns" have a pistol-shaped body, with a loop of thick copper wire at the end acting directly as a heating element.

\section*{NB: Proper soldering requires the following:-}
1. Clean metallic surfaces.
2. Sufficient heat applied to the joint to melt solder when solder is applied to the heated wire surface.

\section*{CIRCUITS AND FAULTS}

Definitions:
Electrical fault is a condition in the electrical system that causes failure of the electrical equipment in the circuit. Electrical faults can be categorized as:
- Short-Circuit Faults: A short circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching zero.
- Open Circuit Faults: An open circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching infinity. Open circuit is an unwanted break in a circuit
- In a grounded circuit the current flows to ground without flowing to the part
- Abnormal resistance is due to a bad connection or partial short

Note for a capacitor
If the capacitor is not shorted, the needle will make a rapid swing toward zero and slowly return to infinity. If the capacitor has an internal short, the needle will stay at zero, indicating that the instrument will not take the
charge. What you are actually doing is attempting to charge the capacitor using the battery in the ohmmeter (be sure the battery in the ohmmeter is good). An open capacitor will read high with no dip and no recovery.

Transistor amplifier components functions
(i) Biasing Circuit:The resistances $\mathrm{R}_{1}, \mathrm{R}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{E}}$ provide biasing and stabilisation.
(ii) Input Capacitor ( $\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{1}}$ ): is used to couple the signal to the base of the transistor.

Otherwise, the signal source resistance will come across $\mathrm{R}_{2}$ and thus can change the bias.
This capacitor allows only the a.c. signal to flow but isolates the Signal source from $\mathrm{R}_{2}$.
iii) Emitter Bypass Capacitor ( $\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{E}}$ ): Used in parallel with $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{E}}$ to provide a low reactance path to the amplified a.c. signal. If this capacitor is not conneeted in the output eircuit then the amplified a.c. signal will flow through $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{E}}$ and cause a voltage drop across it, thereby reducing the output voltage.
(iv) Coupling Capacitor ( $\mathbf{C}_{2}$ ): Used to couple onestage of amplification to the next stage.

If it is not used, the bias condition of the next stage will be drastically changed due to the shunting effect of $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{C}}$. This is because $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{C}}$ will come in parallel with the resistance $\mathrm{R}_{1}$ of the biasing circuit of the next stage amplifier circuit and hence, alter the biasing condition of the next stage.
Therefore, the coupling capacitor is used to isolates the d.c. of one stage from the next stage and allows the a.c. signal only.

\section*{Possible amplifier faults}
1. Collector load resistor open

The base is still forward biased, so base current flows. The base current will be higher than normal, because all the emitter current goes to the base and none to the collector.Since there is more current through R1, there will be a higher voltage drop across it, and the base voltage will be lower.

\section*{2.Emitter Resistor Open Circuit}

There can be no base or collector current. Since the current through R1 is less than normal, there will be a lower voltage drop across it and the base voltage will be higher than normal.
Since there is no current through R3 there will be no voltage dropped across it. The voltage will be the same at both ends, and the collector will be at the supply voltage.

\section*{3. Upper Base Bias Resistor Open Circuit}

With R1 o/c there is no voltage on the base, no base bias and no base current.
The transistor is OFF and there is no collector current and no voltage drop across R3.

The collector voltage will be the same as the supply volts, +9 . There is no current through R4, so there is no voltage drop across it. The voltage at both ends is the same, zero volts.

\section*{4. Emitter Capacitor Short Circuit}

The emitter is connected to zero volts and there is an increased emitter/base forward bias.
Base and collector currents increase. There is more current through R1, a higher voltage drop across it, and a lower base voltage. Since the collector current is higher there will be a larger voltage drop across R3. The collector voltage will be lower than normal.
The emitter voltage will of course be zero. If the capacitor goes open circuit, the dc voltages will remain at their normal values. However, the gain will be much reduced

\section*{5.Lower Base Bias Resistor Open Circuit}

There is no potential divider action and the full +9 volts is applied to the base by R1.
This causes a high base current to flow, which in turn causes a high collector current to flow.
There is a large volts drop across R3, causing a low collector volts.
There is a large volts drop across R4, causing the emitter voltssto rise.

\section*{3. Integrated Circuits}

An Integrated Circuit or an IC is an integration or incorporation of several electronic components (mainly transistors) on a single device (or chip) madequp of a semiconductor material (usually Silicon).

\section*{Common faults:}

Short Between Two Pins
Missing components
Wire breaks
Open solder joints
Solder bridging
Component misalignment
Open Signal Lines
This category includes any fault that produces a break or discontinuity in the conducting path such that a voltage level or signal is prevented from go-ing from one point to another. Some of the causes of open signal lines are:
1. Broken wire
2. Poor solder connection; loose wire-wrap connection
3. Crack or cut trace on a printed circuit board (some of these are hairline cracks that are difficult to see without a magnifying glass)
4. Bent or broken pin on an IC
5. Faulty IC socket such that the IC pin does not make good contact with the socket

\section*{TESTING INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (IC's)}
--Integrated Circuits can be tested with a LOGIC PROBE. A Logic Probe will tell you if a line is HIGH, LOW or PULSING.
Most logic circuits operate on 5 v and a Logic Probe is connected to the 5 v supply so the readings are accurate for the voltages being tested.
A Logic Probe can also be connected to a 12 v CMOS circuit.

\section*{Printed Circuit Board (PCB)Failures}

Printed circuit boards have copper tracks on one side, or sometimes both sides, of the board. The tracks connect the holes where the component leads and wires are soldered. On single-sided PCBs the components are placed on one side of the board with the copper tracks on the other. Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are used to make permanent, soldered circuits. Common faults of PCBs include:

\section*{1. Burnt Components}

It is common for PCB's components to burn due to the high temperatures they undergo, especially if there is insufficient space around the component. Each component only has a certain amount of heat that it can absorb which is dependent on size and structure.

\section*{2. Poorly Manufactured Components}

There is always a possibility of acquiring a poorly manufactured PCB. Some signs and symptoms include loose components, connection issues, even a bad solder or left over flux. One example of a bad solder job is a cold solder. This causes a bad connection and has the potential to lead to burnt components and power issues. Left over flux, a substance used to aid in the soldering process, can also do harm to your component as it can cause corrosion on a PCB.

\section*{3. Environmental Factors}

Temperature change could be the cause of a PCB's malfunction.
Moisture is also a PCB's enemy as it can cause rusting, oxidation, and corrosion.
A third environmental issue that can cause problems witha PCB is the buildup of debris such as dust, dirt, and even insects

\section*{4. Age}

With age comes component failure. A failing capacitor will generațe intermittent power issues. The same goes with other PCB parts. Old parts can be changed out for new ones.

\section*{Pin Configuration of the 555 Timer}

Here is the identification for each pin:

\section*{Pin 1 (Ground):}

Connects to the 0 v power supply.

\section*{Pin 2 (Trigger):}

Detects $1 / 3$ of rail voltage to make output HIGH. Pin 2 has control over pin 6. If pin 2 is LOW, and pin 6 LOW, output goes and stays HIGH. If pin 6 HIGH, and pin 2 goes LOW, output goes LOW while pin 2 LOW. This pin has a very high impedance (about 10M) and will trigger with about 1uA.

\section*{Pin 3 (Output):}
(Pins 3 and 7 are "in phase.") Goes HIGH (about 2 v less than rail) and LOW (about 0.5 v less than 0 v ) and will deliver up to 200 mA .

\section*{Pin 4 (Reset):}

Internally connected HIGH via 100k. Must be taken below 0.8 v to reset the chip.

\section*{Pin 5 (Control):}

A voltage applied to this pin will vary the timing of the RC network (quite considerably).

\section*{Pin 6 (Threshold):}

Detects $2 / 3$ of rail voltage to make output LOW only if pin 2 is HIGH. This pin has a very high impedance (about 10M) and will trigger with about 0.2 uA .

\section*{Pin 7 (Discharge):}

Goes LOW when pin 6 detects $2 / 3$ rail voltage but pin 2 must be HIGH. If pin 2 is HIGH, pin 6 can be HIGH or LOW and pin 7 remains LOW. Goes OPEN (HIGH) and stays HIGH when pin 2 detects $1 / 3$ rail voltage (even as a LOW pulse) when pin 6 is LOW. (Pins 7 and 3 are "in phase.") Pin 7 is equal to pin 3 but pin 7 does not go high - it goes OPEN. But it goes LOW and will sink about 200 mA .

\section*{Pin 8 (Supply):}

Connects to the positive power supply (Vs). This can be any woltage between 4.5 V and 15 V DC, but is commonly 5V DC when working with digital ICs.

\section*{TROUBLESHOOTING AND REPAIR}

What is troubleshooting?•Detection and rectification of faults in the equipment.
Troubleshooting- finding and repairing malfunctions and errors in circuits and equipment by using systematic analysis and tests.
Repairing means to rectify the problem in the hardware or software.
Steps for Electrical Troubleshooting
1. Gather Information. The first step of any electrical system troubleshooting exercise involves gathering as much information about the problem as possible. Instead of immediately diving in and haphazardly attempting anything to get the equipment running, first step back and determine how is the equipment supposed to operate, what techinical documentation is available for the equipment, and is there someone familiar with similar equipment who may have experienced this same issue.
2. Understand the malfunction and the role the malfunctioning equipment plays within the entire process. When you understand how the equipment and process is supposed to work, you can better understand what part of it is not functioning correctly.
3. Identify what can be measured so that you can identify items that are outside the acceptable range. For example, are there voltage readings or tempurature readings that would help you evaluate the source of the problem?
4. Identify the source of the problem using available data and analytical tools to isolate the defective component. This could involve isolating components and evaluating their circuit parameters or isolating the circuits by group when dealing with a complicated circuit.
5. Correct/repair the damaged component.
6. Verify the repair after completion. Once the repair has been performed, start the system to ensure it now runs as required. This is important because there may have been other underlying problems. For example, there may be an issue with a circuit causing a fuse to blow (such as a shorted electrical connection). If this is the case, additional troubleshooting will be required.
7. Perform root cause analysis to determine what really caused the problem. Since one of the objectives of troubleshooting is to ensure the problem doesn't reoccur, it is important to determine what really caused the malfunction and take action to ensure a permanent solution is found.

\section*{Common Troubleshooting Techniques}

\section*{Functional Area Approach}

An electronic system comprises several functional parts such as power supplies, amplifier, signal converters, etc. When the system fails to give the expected performance, the problem could be in any of these functional areas. Therefore, it is essential to troubleshoot the system in order to isolate the fault to the failing functional area and then to the failing component. The logical approach of isolating a fault is through a process of elimination of the functional areas that are performing properly. Once a failure is isolated, further analysis of the circuitry within this area is carried out to isolate the malfunction to the faulty component. This functional area approach is also called the Block-Diagram approach to troubleshooting.

\section*{Half-Split technique}

In this technique, as the name suggests, the circuit issplit in half and the output is checked at the half-way point in case of an absence of an output. This helps to isolate the failing cireuit in the first or second part. When the faulty half is determined, the ageing circuit is split into half for further isolation of failure. This splitting is continued until the failure is isolated to oneffenction or component.

The diagram illustrates the idea behind half split. You basically keep dividing the circuit in half until you identify the block where the fault lies. Extremely useful techniques for larger more complex circuits.

\section*{FAULT INDING AIDS}
1) Operational and maintenance manual
2) Component data sheets
3) Fault codes

\section*{Operational and maintenance manual(O\&M)}

An IOM or O\&M Manual is a document created by a pump manufacturer that contains instructions on proper installation, operation, and maintenance of electrical equipment. It contains
- A brief description of the equipment
- Manufacturer's details with the item type / model details for all maintainable items
- Drawings
- Troubleshooting procedure
- Test and commissioning info
- Manufacturer's literature relating to the operation and maintenance of the item. Or technical reference
-
Components data sheets
This inform the technical or the properties of the equipment. Also useful if a replacement is needed.

\section*{Fault codes}

A trouble code is an alphanumeric value that corresponds to a particular type of fault.
Diagnostic trouble codes are alphanumeric codes that are used to identify a problem that is present on any of the systems that are monitored by the on-board computer (ECM ${ }^{\text {ºr }}$ PCM)
The first character is a letter. It identifies the "main system" where the fault originated. This will be one of the following systems:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-142.jpg?height=353&width=589&top_left_y=1089&top_left_x=725)

\section*{Five Steps to Fault Finding}

\section*{Step 1 - Prepare}
- Are there any safety issues?
- What test equipment do you intend to use?
- Document your findings!

\section*{Step 2 - Observe}
- Are there signs of damage - overheated components, melted insulation, frayed wire, bad solder joints?
- Can you smell burning or overheating?
- Take voltage measurements from a working circuit.
- Take voltage measurements from the faulty circuit to compare.
- Document your findings!

\section*{Step 3 - Identify the problem subsystem}
- Which subsystems are operating correctly?
- Where does the problem seem to lie?
- Document your findings!

\section*{Step 4 - Suggest possible causes}
- Check likely components:
- switches, fuses and bulbs tend to wear out or burn out.
- Check possible components:
- motors, relays, inductors - components with coils - may overheat.
- Check connections:
- look for faulty connections or loose contacts which may offer high resistance.
- look for stray connections that can short-circuit.
- look for breaks that create open-circuit conditions.
- Document your findings!

\section*{Step 5 - Test and repair}
- Be safe! Remember -
- capacitors can store electrical charge and give electric shocks;
- inductors can store energy in a magnetic field and give electric shocks.
- Take measurements around the circuit, but mentally predict what they should be.
- In this way, home in on the problem component(s), and replace it, observing all safety procedures.
- Next, re-test the system to ensure that no other faults exist.
- Document your findings!

\section*{TROUBLESHOOTING A RECTIFIER}

\section*{Procedure}

Assume that you are troubleshooting the circuit below. You can start by measuring the dc load voltage. It should be approximately the same as the peak secondary voltage. If not, there are two possible courses of action. First, if there is no load voltage, you can use a floating $W$ WOM or DMM to measure the secondary voltage (ac range). The reading is the rms voltage across the secondary winding. Convert this to peak value. You camestimate the peak value by adding 40 percent to the rms value. If this is normal, the diodes may be defective. If there is no secondary voltage, either the fuse is blown or the transformer is defective.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-143.jpg?height=405&width=1205&top_left_y=1142&top_left_x=135)

Second, if there is dc load voltage but it is lower than it should be, look at the dc load voltage with an oscilloscope and measure the ripple. A peak-to-peak ripple around 10 percent of the ideal load voltage is reasonable. The ripple may be somewhat more or less than this, depending on the design. Furthermore, the ripple frequency should be 120 Hz for a full-wave or bridge rectifier. If the ripple is 60 Hz , one of the diodes may be open.

\section*{Common Troubles}

Here are the most common troubles that arise in bridge rectifiers with capacitor input filters:
1. If the fuse is open, there will be no voltages anywhere in the circuit.
2. If the filter capacitor is open, the dc load voltage will be low because the output will be an unfiltered full-wave signal.
3. If one of the diodes is open, the dc load voltage will be low because there will be only half-wave rectification. Also, the ripple frequency will be 60 Hz instead of 120 Hz . If all diodes are open, there will be no output.
4. If the load is shorted, the fuse will be blown. Possibly, one or more diodes may be ruined or the transformer may be damaged.
5. Sometimes, the filter capacitor becomes leaky with age, and this reduces the dc load voltage.
6. Occasionally, shorted windings in the transformer reduce the dc output voltage. In this case, the transformer often feels very warm to the touch.
7. Besides these troubles, you can have solder bridges, cold-solder joints, bad connections, and so on.

\section*{BASIC COMPONENTS TESTING EQUIPMENTS}

When it comes to designing electronic circuits, testing and measuring various parameters like current, voltage, frequency, resistance, capacitance, etc. is very important. Hence, the Test and Measurement Equipment like Oscilloscopes, Multimeters, Logic Analyzers, Function Generators (or Signal Generators) are often used regularly

Diagnostic Equipment
- A multimeter (VOM) is a voltmeter, ohmmeter, and ammeter combined into one case
- A digital multimeter (DVOM) has a number readout for the test value
- An analog multimeter (AVOM) has a pointer that moves across the face of a scale
- Use of an AVOM can damage sensitive electronic components

Test Light, Jumper Wires
- Test light can determine if current is flowing through a circuit(continuity tester)
- Jumper wires are used to temporarily bypass circuits or components for testing

Using Multimeters
- A multimeter must never be connected to a circuit in which current is flowing
- To measure resistance with a multimeter:
- Set the range selector switch on the highest range
- Connect the test leads to opposite ends of the circuit
- Reduce the range setting until the meter Shows a reading near the middle of the scale

Checking Continuity
- A circuit remains closed and operational whén it has continuity
- The continuity check determines if the electrical circuit hasa complete path without any opens
- Set the range selector switch_on'the highest resistance range position
- Connect the multimeter test leads to the opposite ends of the wire or part being tested
- Read the meter
- An infinite reading shows an open circuit and azero reading shows continuity

Checking for Shorts
- When checking for a short between two adjoining wires in a harness:
- Set the range selector as for a continuity check
- Connect the test leads to the opposite ends of the adjoining wires
- The multimeter should read almost infinity
- Signal Source/generator
- provides a test signal for a circuit which processes analogue signals.
- Oscilloscope: • provides a voltage/time graph of time-varying signals, such as sine waves. • is used much like the multimeter, with its probes connected in parallel with the compo-nent terminals under investigation. To test amplifier and many logic circuits, an oscilloscope is almost essential to view the varying signals.
- A logic analyser is similar to oscilloscope, but dedicated to looking at digital signals, whereas an oscilloscope uses an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) to create accurate voltage/time graphs of the signal.

\section*{MAINTENANCE}

Maintenance is any activity designed to keep the resources in good working condition or restore them to operating status.
"Maintenance is a function to keep the equipment or machinery in their normal operating condition by servicing or repairing or replacing some of the components".
Each maintenance cycle requires four key activities:
1. Completing the requested maintenance action.
2. Retesting the system.
3. Recording details of the activities carried out.
4. Noting any resulting changes made to the system configuration

The primary goals of maintenance program are to:
1. Minimize the number of component failures in the system.
2. Minimize the process impact of failures that do occur and
3. Effectively diagnose the cause of failure and take corrective actions as quickly as possible.

The basic need (Importance) for maintenance of any equipment or machinery is to:
1. Minimize the frequency of interruptions to production by reducing breakdowns.
2. Maximize the production capacity from the given equipment resources.
3. Enhance the safety of work force.
4. Enhance the service reliability of equipment.
5. Enable to achieve the quality of a product or service throưgh well-maintained equipment.
6. Maximize the useful life of the equipment.
7. Reduce the repair or breakdown cost component in the total production cost.

\section*{BENEFITS OF MAINTENANCE}
(a) Minimization of Equipment's down time
(b) Increase availability of the entire system
(c) Enhancement of equipment's produretive life
(d) Safe working environment to the workmen.

\section*{TYPES OF MAINTENANCE}

Martand Telsang (1998) [8] classified the maintenance activity into two types:
i) Planned Maintenance
ii) ii) Unplanned Maintenance
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-147.jpg?height=849&width=1237&top_left_y=1652&top_left_x=119)

PLANNED MAINTENANCE

This is an organized type of maintenance work carried out as per recorded procedures having control. To evade breakdowns, the maintenance tasks are preplanned considering „when and what kind of the maintenance works", and „who would take up the maintenance work".
Following is the sub-classification of Planned Maintenance.

\section*{I. Preventive Maintenance}

\section*{-Scheduled Maintenance}
II. Corrective Maintenance
-Breakdown Maintenance

\section*{III. Predictive Maintenance}

\section*{PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE (PM)}

The preventive maintenance policy is a system of planned and scheduled maintenance with the aim of minimizing or preventing breakdowns. Preventive maintenance is "the utilization of planned and coordinated inspections, repairs, adjustments, and replacements in maintaining an equipment or plant".

\section*{PM inspection and service functions can be classified into three following groups:}
(i) Routine up-keep, i.e., adjustment, lubrication and cleaning of equipment.
(ii) Periodic inspections, i.e., visual inspections, tear down inspections, overhauls, scheduled replacement of parts, etc.
(iii) Contingent work, e.g., inspection of oil burners while relining a furnace.

\section*{Preventive maintenance records:}

It is very necessary to keep records because they are theonly reliable guides for measuring the effectiveness of the preventive maintenance programme. Only records tell us, what is the situation at present and where it is going. Good updated records, proper filing equipinent and adequatecierical help are the backbone of PM programme.

\section*{Record keeping is also necessary:}
(i) When budgeting for major overhauls.
(ii) When budgeting for general maintenance costs.
(iii) For finding equipment reliability.
(iv) For determining frequency of inspections.
(v) For preparing maintenance schedules.
(vi) For predicting equipment life.
(vii) For designing maintenance cost contrai systems.
(viii) For equipment replacement analysis.
(ix) For carrying out cost reduction studies (e.g., value analysis).

\section*{Advantages of preventive maitenance:}
1. Reduced breakdowns and connected down-time.
2. Lesser odd-time repairs and reduced overtime to the maintenance work-force.

\section*{SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE:}

Scheduled maintenance is a stitch-in-time procedure and incorporates
- inspection
- lubrication
- repair and overhaul of equipments

If neglected can result in breakdown
Generally followed for:
- overhauling of machines
- changing of heavy equipment oils
- cleaning of water and other tanks etc.

\section*{Maintenance schedule should:}
(1) Be such that, the maintenance work can be carried out during lunch hours, between shifts or at weekends etc.,
(2) Take advantage of planned machine stoppages such as tool changes, loading and unloading of job etc.,
(3) Plan major repairs and overhauls during holidays,
(4) Make use of reserve plant if the need arises.

\section*{Procedure:}

\section*{The scheduling of maintenance work involves essentially two steps:}
1. Preparation of master maintenance schedule.
2. Preparation of Detailed weekly or daily schedule.

Master maintenance schedule indicates the nature and magnitude of each repair and construction task segment of maintenance for a specified time span.
Detailed weekly work schedule provides information to each craft and shop regarding the task to be carried on each job for each day in the coming week.
Maintenance schedule of each machine may be prepared and it will indicate the list of works which must be carried out (together with the frequency) and will contain servicing, adjustments, lubrication details and

\section*{CORRECTIVE OR BREAKDOWN MAINTENANCE}

It is one type of planned maintenance and can be defined as "the practice carried out to restore the full performance of the equipment that has stopped working to acceptable standards
Corrective or Breakdown maintenance implies that repairs are made after the equipment is failed and cannot perform its normal function anymore
Quite justified in small factories where:
- Down times are non-critical and repair costs are less than other type of maintenance
- Financial justification for scheduling are not felt

\section*{Disadvantages of Corrective(breakdown) Maintenance}
i. Breakdown generally occurs inappropriate times leading to poor and hurried maintenance
ii. Excessive delay in production \& reduces output
iii. Faster plant deterioration
iv. Increases chances of accidents and less safety for botherkers and machines
v. More spoilt materials
vi. Direct loss of profit
vii. Cannot be employed for equipments regulated by statutory provisions e.g. cranes, lift and hoists etc

PREVENTIVE VERSUS BREAKDOWNMAINTENANCE Preventive maintenance is the routine inspection and service activities designed to detect potentialfailure conditions and make major adjustments or repairs that will help prevent major operating problems whereas, breakdown maintenance is the emergency repair and it involves higher cost of facilities and equipment's that have been used until they fail to operate.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-151.jpg?height=741&width=893&top_left_y=1462&top_left_x=117)

\section*{Preventive maintenance records:}

It is very necessary to keep records because they are the only reliable guides for measuring the effectiveness of the preventive maintenance programme. Only records tell us, what is the situation at present and where it is going. Good updated records, proper filing equipment and adequate clerical help are the backbone of PM programme.
Record keeping is also necessary:
(i) When budgeting for major overhauls.
(ii) When budgeting for general maintenance costs.
(iii) For finding equipment reliability.
(iv) For determining frequency of inspections.
(v) For preparing maintenance schedules.
(vi) For predicting equipment life.
(vii) For designing maintenance cost control systems.
(viii) For equipment replacement analysis.
(ix) For carrying out cost reduction studies (e.g., value analysis).

Records should show:
(i) Type of equipment and its description.
(ii) Whether it is a key item?
(iii) Name of the manufacturer.
(iv) Cost and date of purchase of the equipment.
(v) Location of the equipment in the factory.
(vi) Equipment identification (e.g., chassis) number.
(vii) Inspection of job specification reference number.
(viii) Estimated cost of inspection and the cost and data of planned repairs.
(ix) Breakdowns, their dates and reasons.
(x) Cost of breakdowns and other associated implications.

Spare parts once procured should be stored adequately in order to locate them immediately at the time of need for this:
(i) Spare parts should have stamped code number.
(ii) The stock card may be identified by this number.
(iii) The bin or rack, in which the part is lying, should have its location reference number recorded on the stock card.
(iv) Spare parts for an equipment may begrouped together and referred to by their plant number.
(v) For locating a part, the storekeeperswould first check the stock card bearing the plant number and take down the bin (or storage rack) reference number. Then, by the code number of the part, he will identify the required spare part from the many parts lying in that bin.

\section*{Predictive Maintenance:}

It is comparatively a newer maintenance technique.
It makes use of human senses or other sensitive instruments such as:
Audio gauges,
Vibration analyzers,
Amplitude meters,
Pressure, temperature and resistance strain gauges, etc., to predict troubles before the equipment fails.
Unusual sounds coming out of a rotating equipment predict a (coming) trouble; an electric cable excessively hot at one point predicts a trouble. Simple hand touch can point out many unusual (equipment) conditions and thus predict a trouble. In predictive maintenance, equipment conditions are measured periodically or on a continuous basis and this enables maintenance men to take a timely action such as equipment adjustments, repair or overhaul. Predictive maintenance extends the service life of an equipment without fear of failure.
Maintenance Costs:
- Cost to replace or repair
- Losses of output
- Delayed shipment
- Scrap and rework

\section*{Maintenance Costs}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-153.jpg?height=508&width=787&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=119)

The figure below provides a correlation between the maintenance costs and repair costs associated with the three different maintenance strategies. While Predictive Maintenance (PDM) generally has the highest maintenance cost, it will result in the lowest repair costs. CM, on the other hand, has the lowest maintenance cost but the highest corresponding costs associated with asset repairs.

\section*{ROUTINE MAINTENANCE}

Small-scale activities associated with regułar (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) and general upkeep of a building, equipment, machine, plant, or system against normal wear and tear. "Routine maintenance" means the repair or replacement of existing electrical apparatus or equipment of the same size and type for which no changes in wiring are made.
By contrast, the definition of preventative maintenance is systematic inspection, detection, correction, and prevention of incipient failures, before they become actual or major failures.

Routine maintenance tasks
i. Tightening of connections
ii. Checking outputs
iii. Replacement of regularly changed "lifed" components (lamps, bulbs, indicators etc.)
iv. Checking and adjusting movements/components
v. Inspection for damage/ wear/ corrosion/ movement
vi. Replacement of worn/damaged/corroded components
vii. Cleaning

\section*{summary}
1.Planned Maintenance:
"The maintenance organized and carried out with forethought, control and the use of records to a predetermined plan."
2.Unplanned Maintenance: "The maintenance carried out to no predetermined plan."
3.Preventive Maintenance: "The maintenance carried at pre-determined intervals or corresponding to prescribed criteria and intended to reduce the probability of failure or the performance degradation of an item."
4.Corrective Maintenance: "The maintenance carried out after a failure has occurred and intended to restore an item to a state in which it can perform its required function."
5. Emergency Maintenance: "The maintenance which it is necessary to put in hand immediately to avoid serious consequences." This is sometimes referred to as day-to-day maintenance, resulting from such incidents as gas leaks and gale damage.
6. Condition-based Maintenance: "The preventive maintenance initiated as a result of knowledge of the condition of an item from routine or continuous monitoring."
7. Scheduled Maintenance: "The preventive maintenance carried out to a predetermined interval of time, number of operations, mileage, etc.

\section*{RELIABILITY}

\section*{DEINITION OF TERMS}
- Failure is defined as the ending of the ability of a design element to meet its function before its design lifetime is achieved.

Reliability can be defined as:
Generally defined as the ability of a product toperform, as expected, over certain time.
- Formally defined as the probability that an item, a product, piece of equipment, or system will perform its intended function for a stated period of time under specified operating conditions.
- In the simplest sense, reliability means how long an item (such as a machine) will perform its intended function without a breakdown.

Reliability means how long an item (such as a machine) will perform its intended function without a breakdown. Reliability is defined as the probability that a device will perform its intended function during a specified period of time under stated conditions. It refers to the like hood that equipment will not fail during its operation.
The probability that an item will perform a defined function without failure under stated conditions for a stated period of time.
The Reliability, $\mathrm{R}(\mathrm{t})$, of a component or system is defined as The probability that a piece of equipment operating under specified conditions shall perform satisfactorily for a given period of time.
Reliability is the probability of success or the probability that the system will perform its intended function under specified design
Reliability: the probability of no failure throughout a prescribed operating period.
Availability: The probability that a system is performing satisfactorily at time t
Failure -The change functioning - failed state
Failure: the inability of an equipment to perform its required function
Rate-The number of failures per unit of gross operating period in terms of time, events, cycles.
Repair - Change from a failure to a functioning
Repairing - bring the component /system back to an "as good as new" condition.
For a repairable system, the cycle continues repeatedly with the repair-to failure and the failure-to-repair process.

MTBF -Mean Time Between Failures-The average time between failure occurrences. The number of items and their operating time divided by the total number of failures. For Repairable Items
MTTF -Mean Time To Failure-The average time to failure occurrence. The number of items and their operating time divided by the total number of failures. For Repairable Items and Non-repairable Items
Hazard-The potential to cause harm. Harm including ill health and injury, damage to property, plant, products or the environment, production losses or increased liabilities.
Risk -The likelihood that a specified undesired event will occur due to the realisation of a hazard by, or during work activities or by the products and services created by work activities.

\section*{Why is Reliability important?}

Unreliability has a number of unfortunate consequences and therefore for many products and services is a serious threat. For example poor reliability can have implications for:
-Safety
-Competitiveness
-Profit margins
-Cost of repair and maintenance
-Delays further up supply chain
-Reputation
-Good will
The main advantages of imposing reliability requirements(or analysisf in industries are increased productivity and reductions in forced outage equipment due to planned maintenance activity.

\section*{Types of reliability}

Reliability can be generally of two types:
(i) Inherent Reliability: It is associated with the quality of the material and design of machine parts.
(ii) Achievable Reliability: It depends upon other factors such as maintenance and operation of the equipment.

\section*{Factors Affecting Reliability}

\section*{1. Design Factors}

Design for Reliability ( DfR ) is a process that encompasses tools and procedures to ensure that a product meets its reliability requirements, under its use environment, for the duration of its lifetime
The most important factor is good, careful design based on sound experience, resulting in known safety margins. Making the units rugged through careful design and controlled overstress testing is a very important part of making the product reliable.
- Inherent (generic) reliability of the components used

\section*{2. Complexity}

Keep things simple - what isn't there, can't fail, but be careful: what isn't there can cause a failure! A complicated or difficult specification will, invariably result in reduced reliability. Every component used will contribute to the equipment's unreliability.

\section*{3. Stress}

In electronic equipment, the most prominent stresses are temperature, voltage, vibration, and temperature rise due to current. The effect of each of these stresses on each of the components must be considered. In order to achieve good reliability, various de-rating factors have to be applied to these stress levels. The de-rating has to be traded off against cost and size implications. The layout has to be such that heat-generating components are kept away from other components and are adequately cooled.

\section*{4. Generic (Inherent) Reliability}

Inherent reliability refers to the fact that film capacitors are more reliable than electrolytic capacitors, wire-wrap connections more reliable than soldered ones, fixed resistors more reliable than pots, and so on. Components
have to be carefully selected to avoid the types with high generic failure rates. Quite often, there is a cost trade off - more reliable components are usually more expensive.

\section*{PARAMETERS OF RELIABILITY}
i. Failure rate(FR)
ii. MTBF -Mean Time Between Failures
iii. MTTF -Mean Time To Failure
iv. MTTR -Mean Time To Repair
v. Availability

These parameters can be grouped based on repairable or non-repairable items or equipments as follows
a) Non-Repairable Systems:
i. Reliability=Availability
ii. Failure Rate (FR)
iii. Mean Time To Fail (MTTF)
iv. Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
b) Repairable Systems:
i. Availability....(Function of Reliability and Maintainability)
ii. Failure Rate and Repair Rate
iii. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

\section*{Repairable Items}

For repairable items, reliability is the probability that failure will not occur in the time period of interest; or when more than one failure can occur, reliabdity can be expressed as the failure rate, $\lambda$, or the rate of occurrence of failures (ROCOF). In the case of repairáble items, reliability can be characterized by MTBF described above, but only under the condition of constage failure rate.

\section*{Non-repairable items}

Non-repairable items are components or systemssuch as a light bulb, transistor, rocket motor, etc. Their reliability is the survival probability over the jitems expected life or over a specific period of time during its life, when only one failure can occur. During the component or systems life, the instantaneous probability of the first and only failure is called the hazard rate or failure rate, $\mathrm{r}(\mathrm{t})$. Life values such as MTTF described above are used to define non-repairable items.

\section*{FAILURE RATE}

The term failure may be defined as
1. any loss that interrupts the continuity of production
2. a loss of assets availability
3. the unavailability of equipment
4. a deviation from the status quo
5. not meeting target expectations
6. Any secondary defect.

Failure - inability to produce work in appropriate manner . OR Failure rate( $\lambda$ ): Rate at which components fail per unit time
. Failure rate is the ratio of the number of failures during particular unit interval to the average population during that interval. This failure rate is also known as hazard rate and instantaneous failure rate.
- Conditional Failure Rate or Failure Intensity, $\lambda(t)$ - anticipated number of times an item will fail in a specified time period, (good as new at t 0 and functioning at time t ).

It is a calculated value that provides a measure of reliability for a product. This value is normally expressed as failures per million hours (fpmh or $10^{6}$ hours) The mean failure rate h is obtained by finding the mean of the failures rates for specified period of time.
Failure rate $=\frac{\text { Items Failed }}{\text { Total Operating Time }}$
Example
10 components were tested. The components (not repairable) failed as follows:
Component 1,2,3,4,5 failed after 75,125, 130, 325, 525 hours. Find the failure rate and mean time till failure..

Solution:
No. of failures $=5$
Total operating time $=75+125+130+325+525+5^{*} 525=3805$
Failure rate $\lambda=5 / 3805=0.001314$
Mean time till failure $=1 / \lambda$
$$\begin{array}{r}
=1 / 0.001314 \\
=761.04 \text { hours } .
\end{array}$$

\section*{Example 2}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-157.jpg?height=470&width=1145&top_left_y=1012&top_left_x=520)

Suppose 1000 transistors are put on test, out which 25 fail over a 1000 hr period, the failure rate FR $=25 / 1000=0.025$ per 1000 hrs
$=0,025 / 1000$ per hour
$=2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ per hour
Often failure rate is expressed as a percentage, therefore FR $=25 / 1000 \times 100 \%$ per 1000hr $=2.5 \%$ per 1000 hrs

\section*{The main causes of failures include:}
i) Improper circuit design
-The product is not fit for purpose or more specifically the design is inherently incapable.
-Failures might be caused by variation.
ii) Manufacturing deficiencies
-Wrong specifications may cause failures.
iii) Improper or negligent handling and operating (Incorrect usage of equipment)
-Misuse of the item may cause failure. $\bullet$ The item may be overstressed in some way.
iv) Environmental factors
-Items are designed for a specific operating environment and if they are then used outside this environment then failure can occur.

\section*{Types of failure}

It is often difficult to decide what is failure and whether an item has failed. Dummer and Winton' classify failures by cause, time, degree, and combinations of these three:
1. Cause:
(a) Misuse, e.g. due to the application of stresses beyond the stated capacity of the item:
(b) Inherent weakness, i.e. in the item itself when subject to stresses within the stated capacities of that item.
2. Tïme:
(a) Sudden failure. i.e. that could not be anticipated by prior examination;
(b) Gradual failure. i.e. that could be anticipated by prior examination;
3. Degree:
(a) Partial failure, i.e. resulting in deviations in the characteristics of the item beyond specified limits which nevertheless do not cause complete lack of the required function:
(b) Complete failure, i.e. resultingin deviations in the characteristics of the item beyond specified dimits which causcoomplete lack of the required function:
4. Combinations:
(a) Catastrophic, i.e failures which are both sudden and complete;
(b) Degradation. i.e. failures which are both gradual and partial.

NOTE: in GRADUAL FAILURE, as the lifife of an item increases, its efficiency deteriorates, causing:
- Increased expenditure for operating costs
- Decreased equipments" productivity
- Decrease in the value of the equipment

Example: bearings, pistons, piston rings, „Automobile Tyres", mechanical systems like machines, machine tools, flexible manufacturing equipment etc. fall under this category.

In SUDDEN FAILURE: This type of failure is applicable to those items that do not deteriorate markedly with service, but which ultimately fail after some period of using. For any particular type of equipment the period from installation to failure is not equal but will follow some „frequency distribution which may be progressive, retrogressive, or random in nature".

Progressive failures: In this mechanism, probability of failure increases as the life of equipment increases. Examples include: electric light bulbs, automobile tubes etc.,

Random failures: Under this failure, constant probability of failure is associated with the equipment that fails from random causes such as physical shocks, not related to age. In such a case, virtually all equipments fail prior to their
expected life. Example: Electronic components like transistors, semi conductor elements, glass made items, delicate or brittle items, perishable items like fruits and vegetables" have been shown to fail at a rate independent of the age.

\section*{Failure Analysis Testing}

Failure analysis is the process by which information/data about failure occurring in equipments/ systems are collected and analyzed to find the root cause of failures, and the causes are addressed to prevent recurrence of failures.

When a product or device fails, you need to know why. Root cause failure analysis helps a business get to the source of a product failure. More importantly, it provides the manufacturer with the information needed to address and correct the issue causing the failure.
Root cause failure analysis is usually a multidisciplinary process. The tools NTS uses during an analysis include visual inspections, metallographic, environmental and chemical analysis and simulation tests. The specific tests utilized depend on the type of product and the failure mode.

\section*{three types of failure models}
> Predictable failure model
> Unpredictable failure model
> Running-In-Failure model

\section*{Why do Failure Analysis Testing?}

There are many reasons to conduct failure analysis testing, including:
- Determining corrective actions for pioduct failures
- Improving manufacturing processes and efficiencies ${ }^{\circ}$
- Eliminating the risk of physicalharm from product failures
- Reducing financial costs associated with prodact failure / recalls
- Meeting regulatory standards required for product sales or exports
- Assigning liability for product failures in@ legal setting

\section*{Failure rate over the life of a product(faílure pattern/periods)}

The failure rate is expected to vary over the life of a product -'Bathtub Curve'
The life of a population of devices (a group of devices of the same type) can be divided into three distinct periods:

\section*{Early Life}

If we follow the slope from the leftmost start to where it begins to flatten out this can be considered the first period. The first period is characterized by a decreasing failure rate. It is what occurs during the "early life" of a population of units. The weaker units fail leaving a population that is more rigorous.

\section*{Useful Life}

The next period is the flat bottom portion of the graph. It is called the "useful life" period. Failures occur more in a random sequence during this time. It is difficult to predict which failure mode will occur, but the rate of failures is predictable. Notice the constant slope.

\section*{Wearout}

The third period begins at the point where the slope begins to increase and extends to the rightmost end of the graph. This is what happens when units become old and begin to fail at an increasing rate. It is called the "wearout" period.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-160.jpg?height=417&width=1714&top_left_y=136&top_left_x=132)

A-B Early Failure
-'Teething' problems. Caused by design/material flaws. Eg: Joints, Welds, Contamination, Misuse, Misassembly
B-C Useful life.
-Lower than initial failure rate and more or less constant until end of life
C-D End of life failure / Wear out phase.
-Failure rate rises again due to components reaching end of life. Eg: Corrosion, Cracking, Wear, Friction, Fatigue, Erosion, Lack of PM

Note that for a constant failure rate, plotting reliability against time "t" gives a negative exponential curve
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-160.jpg?height=570&width=1177&top_left_y=1051&top_left_x=138)

Reliability $\mathrm{R}(\mathrm{t})$ Plotted Against $(\lambda, t)$ for a unit with a constant failure rate $\lambda$

\section*{Life Cycle Costing}

A life cycle cost analysis involves the analysis of the costs of a system or a component over its entire life span. Typical costs for a system may include:
- Acquisition costs (or design and development costs).
- Operating costs:
- Cost of failures
- Cost of repairs
- Cost for spares
- Downtime costs
- Loss of production
- Maintenance costs:
- Cost of corrective maintenance
- Cost of preventive maintenance
- Cost for predictive maintenance
- Disposal costs.

\section*{Life Cycle Costs}
--All costs associated with the acquisition and ownership of a system over its full life. The usual figure of merit is net present value. Life cycle costs include cradle to grave costs the first cost is not the only cost!

The following figure shows the Cost Per Unit Time vs. Time plot and it can be seen that the corrective replacement costs increase as the replacement interval increases. In other words, the less often you perform a PM action, the higher your corrective costs will be. Obviously, as we let a component operate for longer times, its failure rate increases to a point that it is more likely to fail, thus requiring more corrective actions. The opposite is true for the preventive replacement costs. The longer you wait to perform a PM, the less the costs; if you do PM too often, the costs increase. If we combine both costs, we can see that there is an optimum point that minimizes the costs. In other words, one must strike a balance between the risk (costs) associated with a failure while maximizing the time between PM actions.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-161.jpg?height=937&width=1261&top_left_y=762&top_left_x=145)

Same as users costs vs availability
Minimum cost = cost of equipment
Costs of failure = corrective replacement costs

\section*{EXAMPLE}

One thousand transistors are placed on life test, and the number of failures in each time interval are recorded.
Find the reliability and the failure rate at $0,100,200$, etc hours. (Youmay find it helpful to set this up on a spreadsheet.)
\begin{tabular}{ll} 
Time interval & Number of failures \\
$0-100$ & 160 \\
$100-200$ & 86 \\
$200-300$ & 78 \\
$300-400$ & 70 \\
$400-500$ & 64 \\
$500-600$ & 58 \\
$600-700$ & 52 \\
$700-800$ & 43
\end{tabular}

Draw a graph to show the change in the failure rate as the transistors get older.
Do you think this component shows the bath tub pattern of failure?
Draw a graph to show how the reliability changes over time.

\section*{example}

Suppose it is desired to estimate the failure rate of a certain component. A test can be performed to estimate its failure rate. Ten identical components are each tested until they either fail or reach 1000 hours, at which time the test is terminated for that component. (The level of statistical confidence is not considered in this example.) The results are as follows:
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Component & $\frac{\text { Hours }}{}$ & \\
\hline Component 1 & 1000 & Failure \\
No failure \\
Component 2 & 1000 & No failure \\
Component 3 & 467 & Failed \\
Component 4 & 1000 & No failure \\
Component 5 & 630 & Failed \\
Component 6 & 590 & Failed \\
Component 7 & 1000 & No failure \\
Component 8 & 285 & Failed \\
Component 9 & 648 & Failed
\end{tabular}

Estimated failure rate is $=\frac{6 \text { failures }}{7502 \text { hours }}=0.0007998 \frac{\text { failures }}{\text { hour }}=799.8 \times 10^{-6} \frac{\text { failures }}{\text { hour }}$, or 799.8 failures for every million hours of operation
example, suppose you had five light bulbs connected to an automatic circuit that you could then turn on and off once per hour for 1,000 hours, giving you the following data:
- Bulb 1 burned out after 422 hours.
- Bulb 2 burned out after 744 hours
- Bulb 3 burned out after 803 hours
- Bulb 4 burned out after 678 hours
- Bulb 5 stayed lit for 1000 hours

This gives you 4 failures over a total of 3,647 hours.
To calculate the failure rate, divide the number of failures by the total number of hours, such as 4/3,647 = 0.0011 failures per hour.

In this example, the failure rate per hour is so small that it is almost insignificant. Multiplying the number by 1,000 would make it more meaningful to someone thinking about buying a light bulb, which would be 1.1 failures per 1,000 hours. Since there are 8,760 hours in one year, you can divide 3,647 by 8,760 to get 0.41 failures per year, or about 2 failures every five years.
that successfully completed the test. As an example, suppose 10 units were tested under specified operating conditions where the test time is 600 hours, and assume that failed units are not repaired. Failures occur as follows:
- Unit 1 failed after 75 hours
- Unit 2 failed after 125 hours
- Unit 3 failed after 130 hours
- Unit 4 failed after 325 hours
- Unit 5 failed after 525 hours

Five units successfully completed the test cycle. The failure rate ( $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ ), in number of failures per hour, can be expressed as
$$\lambda=\frac{5}{75+125+130+325+525+5(600)}=\frac{5}{4180}=0.001196$$

As a second example, consider a given system with an operating cycle as depicted in Figure 4.2. The total operating time in this case is 152 hours and the system fails a total of six times as indicated. The failure rate per hour is
$$\lambda=\frac{\text { number of failures }}{\text { total operating time }}=\frac{6}{\sqrt{152}}=0.03947$$

Further, assuming an exponential time dêhity function, the system mean life or the MTBF is
$\operatorname{MTBF}=\frac{1}{\lambda}=\frac{1}{0.03947}=25.3357$ hours

\section*{Basic categories of failure rates:}
1. Mean time between failures (MTBF) - The average time between failure occurrences. The number of items and their operating time divided by the total number of failures.
It is a basic measure of reliability for repairable items = time passed before a component, assembly, or system fails, under the condition of a constant failure rate / expected value of time between two consecutive failures, for repairable systems.
It is a commonly used variable in reliability and maintainability analyses.

MTBF = total time of correct operation in a period/number of failures
For example: a system should operate correctly for 9 hours During this period, 4 failures occurred. Adding to all failures, we have 60 minutes (1 hour). Calculating the MTBF, we would have:
$$\text { MTBF }=(9-1) / 4=2 \text { hours }$$

This index reveals that a failure in the system occurs every 2 hours, leaving it unavailable and generating losses to the company. The opportunity to spot this index allows you to plan strategies to reduce this time.

The MTBF is the inverse of the failure rate.
$\mathrm{MTBF}=1 / \lambda, \quad \lambda=\mathrm{FR}$. Note: failure rate is in all components

Suppose a system contains 100 transistors and failure rate is $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ per hour , the chance of the system failing is $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ per hour $\times 100=2.5 \times 10^{-3}$
Therefore MTBF $=1 / 2.5 \times 10^{-3}=400$ hours

\section*{2.Mean time to failure (MTTF) (non-repairable systems)}

MTTF: Mean time to failure describes the expected time to failure for a non-repairable and Repairable Items.
For example, assume you tested 3 identical systems starting from time 0 until all of them failed. The first system failed at 10 hours, the second failed at 12 hours and the third failed at 13 hours. The MTTF is the average of the three failure times, which is 11.6667 hours. Ie $(10+12+13) / 3$

The average time to failure occurrence. The number of items and their operating time divided by the total number of failures. For Repairable Items and Non-repairable Items
Mean time to failure (MTTF) is a basic measure of reliability for non-repairable systems. It is the mean time expected until the first failure of a piece of equipment. MTTE, ís a statistical value and is intended to be the mean over a long period of time and with a large number of units. For constant failure rate systems, MTTF is the inverse of the failure rate, $\lambda$. If failure rate, $\lambda$, is in fatlures $/$ million hours, $\mathrm{MTTF}=1,000,000$ /
Failure Rate, $\lambda$, for components with exponential distributions. Or
$$M T T F=\frac{1}{\lambda \text { failures } / 10^{6} \text { hours }}$$

For repairable systems, MTTF is the expected span of time from repair to the first or nextfailure.

\section*{NOTE:}

Strictly speaking, MTBF applies to equipment that is going to be repaired and returned to service, MTTF to parts that will be thrown away on failing.

\section*{Example:}

From the example on FR which was $2.5 \times 10^{-5}$ per hour, I one transistor is used in the system, MTTF $=1 / \mathrm{FR}=1 / 2.5 \times 10^{-5}=40,000$ hours = 1666 days

IF 5 transistors are tested until failure and the time to failure were as follows
\begin{tabular}{cc} 
Transistor no & Time to failure \\
1 & 400 hours \\
2 & 500 hours \\
3 & 750 hours \\
4 & 300 hours \\
5 & 600 hours
\end{tabular}

Total test time $=400+500+750+300+600=2550$ hours
$\mathrm{FR}=5 / 2550 \mathrm{MTTF}=1 / \mathrm{FR}=2550 / 5=510$ hours
3.Mean time to repair (MTTR) - Mean Time to Repair is the arithmetic mean of the time required to perform maintenance action. MTTR is defined as the Ratio of total maintenance time and number of maintenance action. MTTR = Total maintenance time/ Number of maintenance action.

Total amount of time spent performing all corrective or preventative maintenance repairs divided by the total number of those repairs.
It is the expected span of time from a failure (or shut down) to the repair or maintenance completion.
This term is typically only used with repairable systems.

\section*{Example}

System should operate correctly for 9 hours During this period, 4 failures occurred. Adding to all failures, we have 60 minutes (1 hour).

MTTR = Total maintenance time/ Number of maintenance action or no of failures
$$M T T R=60 \mathrm{~min} / 4 \text { failures }=15 \text { minutes }$$

\section*{AVAILABILTY}

The availability of a system is defined as the probability that the system is successful at time $t$. Mathematically, If we let A represent availability, then the simplest formula for availability is:
$$\text { A }=\text { Uptime/(Uptime }+ \text { Downtime) } \quad \text { Availability }=\frac{\text { Up time }}{\text { Total time }}$$

Of course, it's more interesting when you start looking at the things that influence uptime and downtime. The most common measures that can be used in this way are2MTBF and MTTR.

MTBF is Mean Time Between Failures and MiTR is Mean Time To Repair
$$\text { Availability } A(t)=\frac{M T B F}{M T B F+M T T R}$$

\section*{example}

A copier is expected to be able to operate for 200 hours after repair, and the mean repair time is expected to be two hours. Determine the availability of the copier.
$$\begin{gathered}
\text { MTTF }=200 \text { hours, and MTTR }=2 \text { hours } \\
\text { Availability }=\frac{\text { MTTF }}{\text { MTTF }+ \text { MTTR }}=\frac{200}{200+2}=.99
\end{gathered}$$

\section*{Unavailability}

Unavailability is the probability that an item will not operate correctly at a given time and under specified conditions.
Unavailability = 1 - availability
Unavailability may be expressed mathematically as the ratio,
U = MTTR/(MTTR+MTTF)

\section*{Uptime calculation}

The uptime calculation involves MTTR and MTBF. We can get to the uptime of a system, for instance, using these 2 KPIs. Let's check the formula:
$$\text { uptime }=\text { MTBF/(MTBF }+ \text { MTTR })$$

To be more clear, nothing better than a practical example. Imagine the following situation:
A. How long the system should work: 36 hours
B. How long the system was not working: 24 hours
C. How long the system has been available: 12 hours
D. A total of 4 failures occurred.
$$\text { uptime: }(A-B / D) /[(A-B / D)+(B / D)]=(36-24 / 4) /[(36-24 / 4)+(24 / 4)]=3 / 9=33 \%$$

Failure Rate for Repairable and Non-repairable systems EXAMPLES
MTBF $\quad \theta=$ Total time / Total Number of failures
Average Failure Rate $\lambda=1 / \theta \rightarrow \lambda \theta=1$

\section*{Example:}

300 cars have accumulated 45000 hours, 10 failures are observed. What is the MTBF? What is the failure rate?
Note: considering Car as repairable system, Use MTBF MTBF $=45000 / 10=4500$ hours.
Average Failure rate $\lambda=10 / 45000 \geqslant 0.00022$ pei hour.

Five oil pumps were tested with failure hours of 45, 33, 62, 94 and 105. What is the MTTF and failure rate?

Note: considering pumps as non repairable systems, Use MTTF.
MTTF $=(45+33+62+94+105) / 5=67.8$ hours
Failure rate $\lambda=5 /(45+33+62+94+105)=0.0147$ per hour.
Note that MTTF is a reciprocak of failure rate.

\section*{Example:}

50 components are tested for two weeks. 20 of them fail in this time, with an average failure time of 1.2 weeks.

What is the mean time till failure assuming a constant failure rate?

Answer:

No. Of failures $=20$
Total time $=20 * 1.2+30 * 2=84$ weeks
Failure rate $=20 / 84=0.238 /$ week
Mean time till failure is estimated to $6 \mathrm{be}=(1 /$ failure rate $)$
$$=9 / 0.238=4.2 \text {.Weeks. }$$

\section*{Laws of reliability}

Reliability is defined as the probability that a device will perform its intended function during a specified period of time under stated conditions.

The reliability of components in series must take into account the probability of individual failures in a given period. For a measuring system with $n$ serial components, the reliability Rs is the product of the individual reliabilities

The reliability may increase with components set in parallel, which means that the system will fail if all components fail. In this case, the reliability Rs is given by:
Rs = 1 - Fs, where Fs is the system non reliability. The non reliability is Fs = F1xF2...F3.
For example, a safe measuring system has three identical devices in parallel. The reliability of each one is 0.95 and the system reliability is given by:
Rs $=1-[(1-0.95) x(1-0.95) x(1-0.95)]=0.999875$

\section*{Improving the reliability of a measuring system}

There are several ways of increasing the reliability of a measuring system:
- Choice of the devices: always pay attention to the specified devices, their influence on the process, materials, the environment, etc.
- Protection of the devices: take adequate measures to protect the devices to improve and ensure better level of reliability. For example, thermocouples must avoid unfavorable operational conditions.
- Regularly scheduled calibration: most failures may be due to drifts that cause incorrect outputs. Therefore, in compliance to good instrumentation practices, check and calibrate periodically the equipment.
- Redundancy: when more than one equipment work in parallel and switched, sometimes automatically, reliability is significantly improved.

\section*{How to calculate reliability}

\section*{example}

Find the mean time to failure of a component which has a failure rate of 2 failures per year. Calculate its reliability for different mission times, e.g. 10, 1000, 10000 hours.
MTTF $=1 / \lambda=1 / 2=0.5 \mathrm{yrs}=0.5 \times 8760=4380 \mathrm{hrs}$
$$R(t)=e^{-\lambda t} \quad R(10)=0.997719, \quad R(1000)=0.795877, \quad R(10000)=0.101967$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-168.jpg?height=503&width=1112&top_left_y=746&top_left_x=241)
example
- An amplifier has an exponential time-to-failure distribution with a failure rate of $8 \%$ per 1000 hours. What is the reliability of the amplifier at 5000 hours? Find the mean time to failure.

Solution The constant failure rate $\lambda$ is obtained as
$$\lambda=0.08 / 1000 \text { hours }=0.00008 / \text { hour }$$

The reliability at 5000 hours is
$$R(t)=e^{-\lambda t}=e^{-(0.00008)(5000)}=e^{-0.4}=0.6703$$

The mean time to failure is
$$\text { MTTF }=1 / \lambda=1 / 0.00008=12,500 \text { hours }$$

\section*{Maintainability}
- Maintainability is defined as the probability that a unit or system will be restored to specified working conditions within a given period when maintenance action is taken in accordance with the prescribed procedures and resources.
Maintainability is the measure of the ability of a system or item to be retained or restored to a specified condition when maintenance is performed by qualified personnel using specified procedure and resources.
- Maintabnility can be measured with Mean Time To Repair (MTTR), MTTR is average repair time and is given by
$$M T T R=\frac{\text { Total Ma int enance Down Time }}{\text { Total Number of Ma int enance Actions. }}$$

\section*{System Forms}
-The components may be in - series: system performs satisfactorily if all components are fully functional
-For example, Christmas lights - parallel: system performs if any one component remains operational
- For example, (i) an airplane with four engines, or (ii) a laptop with a power source and a battery. combination of series and parallel

\section*{Systems Reliability}

A system consists of components which determine whether or not it will work. There are various types of configurations of the components in different systems.
- Series System

This is a system in which all the components are in series and they all have to work for the system to work. If one component fails, the system fails.
- Parallel System

This is a system that will fail only if they all fail.
- Series-Parallel System

This is a system where some of the components in series are replicated in parallel.

\section*{Components in Series}
- If the components are in series, system performs satisfactorily if all components are fully functionab ${ }^{3}$
- If there are $n$ components in series, where the reliability of the $i$-th component is denoted $b y^{\prime} r_{i}$, the system reliability is
$$R_{s}=\left(r_{1}\right)\left(r_{2}\right) \cdots\left(r_{n}\right)$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-169.jpg?height=210&width=1006&top_left_y=1315&top_left_x=153)

Note: if the components are in series, reliability increases if the number of components decreases

\section*{Components in Parallel}
- If the components are in parallel, system performs if any one component remains operational
- If there are $n$ components in parallel, where the reliability of the $i$-th component is denoted by $r_{i}$, the system reliability is
$$R_{p}=1-\left(1-r_{1}\right)\left(1-r_{2}\right) \cdots\left(1-r_{n}\right)$$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-169.jpg?height=665&width=538&top_left_y=1749&top_left_x=758)

Note: if the components are in parallel, the reliability decreases if the number of components decreases.

A system has three parallel components, A, B, and C with reliabilities $0.95,0.92$, and 0.90 ,
respectively. Find the reliability of the system if C is out of order.

Consider a two component parallel system. If both components are both working, then the system is working. If either component 1 or 2 fails, the system is still working. If and only if both components fail, then the system fails. Unlike a series system where any one failure causes a system failure, in this simple example, two failure events have to occur before the system fails.

What is the chance of having two failures? The formula is based on the probability of component 1 or component 2 operating. Without doing the derivation, we can write the reliability of the 2 component parallel system as:
$$R_{s s j}(t)=R_{1}+R_{2}-R_{1} R_{2}$$

When the components in parallel are the same (reliability wise), then the above simplifies to
$$R_{s y s}(t)=2 R-R^{2}$$

\section*{Examples}
1. A simple computer consists of a processor, a but and a memory. The computer will work only if all three are functioning correctly. The probability that the.processor is functigring is 0.99 , that the bus is functioning 0.95 , and that the memory is functioning is 0.99
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-170.jpg?height=164&width=1134&top_left_y=1273&top_left_x=119)

The probability that the computer will work is:
Rel $=.99 \times .95 \times .99=0.893475$
So even though all the components have abgue $95 \%$ or more reliability, The overall Reliability of the computer is less that $90 \%$.
2. A system consists of 5 components in series each having a reliability of 0.97 . What is the reliability of the system?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-170.jpg?height=104&width=1075&top_left_y=1734&top_left_x=132)

Rel $=0.97^{5}=0.86$
With series systems, reliability decreases as the number of components increases.
With 6 components in series;
Rel $=0.97^{6}=0.832972$
With 7 components; Rel $=0.97^{7}=0.8079828$
3. An electronic product contains 100 integrated circuits. The probability that any integrated circuit is defective is .001 and the integrated circuits are independent. The product operates only if all the integrated circuits are operational. What is the probability that the product is operational?

\section*{Solution:}

The probability that any component is functioning is .999 . Since the product operates only if all 100 components are operational, the probability that the 100 components are functioning is:
Rel $=.999^{100}$ obtained in R with $.999 * * 100$
[1] 0.9047921
The reliability is just over $90 \%$ even though each component hasa reliability of $99.9 \%$. Bearing in mind that computing and electrical systems have hundreds or thousands of components, a series formation on its own will
never be sufficiently reliable, no matter how high the individual component reliability is. The components need to be backed up in parallel.

\section*{Reliability of a Parallel System}

Systems with parallel structure have built in redundancy. Components are backed up, and the system will work even if some of these cease to function.
Examples
1. A system consists of 5 components in parallel. If each component has a reliability of 0.97 , what is the overall reliability of the system?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-171.jpg?height=743&width=1197&top_left_y=588&top_left_x=117)

System will function provided at leastone of the 5 compohents works:
$\mathrm{Rel}=\mathrm{P}$ (At least one component is functioning) Takingthe complementary approach, P (at least one component functioning ) $=1-\mathrm{P}$ (all components fail).
Therefore
Rel $=1-(0.03)^{5}-1.00000$
With parallel systems the "law of diminishing returns" operates:
With 2 components Rel $=1-0.03^{2}=0.9991$
With 3 components Rel $=1-0.03^{3}=0.999973$
With 4 components Rel $=1-0.03^{4}=0.9999992$
Reliability of a parallel system with increasing number of components: component reliability = . 97

\section*{Series-Parallel Systems}

\section*{Examples}
1. Consider a system with 5 kinds of component, with reliabilities
- component $1: 0.95$,
- component 2 : 0.95,
- component 3 : 0.70,
- component $4: 0.75$,
- component $5: 0.90$.

Because of the low reliability of the third and fourth components, they are replicated; the system contains 3 of the third component and 2 of the fourth component.
The System:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}

\section*{Summary}

The reliability of a system, i.e. the probability.that it is functioning properly depends on
- the reliability of each of its the components
- the type of system

\section*{Reliability with Series Systems:}

The problem with series systems is that reliability quickly decreases as the number of components increases.

\section*{Reliability with Parallel Systems}

The problem with parallel systems is that the 'law of diminishing returns' operates. The rate of increase in reliability with each additional component decreases as the number of components increases.
Most systems are combinations of series and parallel systems

\section*{Other examples}
