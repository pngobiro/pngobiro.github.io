                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Electron gun assembly.</h3>
                        <p>The electron gun assembly produces a sharply focussed beam of electrons which are accelerated to high velocity. This focussed beam of electrons strikes the fluorescent screen with sufficient energy to cause a luminous spot on the screen After leaving the electron gun, the electron beam passes through two pairs of "electrostatic deflection plates". Voltages applied to these plates deflect the beam. Voltages applied to one pair of plates move the beam vertically up and down and the voltages applied to the other pair of plates move the beam horizontally from one side to another. Focusing anode is used to focus the beam on the screen, and the accelerating anode makes the electron beam to move with high velocity.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2)Vertical Amplifier:</h3>
                        <p>This is a wide band amplifier used to amplify signals in the vertical section.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3)Delay Line:</h3>
                        <p>It is used to delay the signal from some time in the vertical section.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4) Horizontal Amplifier:</h3>
                        <p>The horizontal basically serves two purposes:</p>
                        <p>a)When the oscilloscope is being in the X-Y node, the signal applied to the horizontal input terminal will be amplified by the horizontal amplifier.<br>
                           b) When the oscilloscope is being used in the ordinary mode of operation to display a signal applied to the vertical input, the horizontal amplifier will amplify the $s$ weep generator output.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">5) Time base generator:</h3>
                        <p>It is used to generate the saw tooth voltage required'to deflect the beain in the horizontal section.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">6) Trigger circuit:</h3>
                        <p>This is used to convert the incoming signal ightÃ´ trigger pulses that the input signal and the sweep frequency can be synchronised.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7) Power supply:</h3>
                        <p>There are two power supplies, a negative high voltage (HV) supply and a positive low voltage (LV) supply. Two voltages are generated in the CRO. The positive volt supply is from -100 V to +1500 V . This voltage is passed through a bleeder resistor at a few mA. The intermediate voltages are obtained from the bleeder resistor for intensity, focus and positioning controls.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Screens for CRT's:</h3>
                        <p>When the electron beam strikes the screen of the CRT, a spot light is produced. The screen material on the inner surface of the CRT that produces this effect is the phosphor. The phosphor absorbs the kinetic energy of the bombarding electrons and remits energy at the lower frequency in the visible spectrum. The property of some crystalline materials such as phosphor or zinc oxide to emit light when simulated by radiation is called flourescence. Fluorescent materials have a second characteristic called as phosphorescence which refers to the property of the material to continue light emission even after the source of excitation is cut off. The length of time during which phosphorescence or afterglow occurs is called as the persistence of phosphor.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CRO Operation:</h3>
                        <p>A simplified block diagram of a typical oscilloscope is shown in Fig. The signal to be displayed is amplified by the vertical amplifier and applied to the vertical deflection plates of the CRT. A portion of the signal in the vertical amplifier is applied to the sweep trigger as a triggering signal.</p>
