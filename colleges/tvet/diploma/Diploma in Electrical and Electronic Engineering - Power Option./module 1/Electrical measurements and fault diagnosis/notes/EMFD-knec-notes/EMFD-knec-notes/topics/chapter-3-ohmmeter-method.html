                        <p>A continuity tester is a simple device consisting of two testing probes and a light (LED) or buzzer indicator. It is used to detect the presence of continuity or a break in between the two ends of a conductor which is connected to its testing probes. A continuity tester consists of a battery in a housing, with a test probe connected to one end of the battery housing and a test wire with an alligator clip connected to the other end. It is used with the current turned off to determine whether a particular electrical component is carrying electricity and to pinpoint the cause of a problem.</p>
                        <p>To use a continuity tester, unplug the appliance and disassemble it to get at the component you want to test. Fasten the clip of the tester to one wire or connection of the component, and touch the probe to the other wire or connection. If the component is receiving electricity and transmitting it, the tester will light or buzz; this indicates that the circuit is continuous. If the tester doesn't light or buzz or it reacts only slightly, the component is faulty.</p>

                        <p>Ohmmeter is an electrical apparatus used to measure ©lectrical resistance. Ohmmeter is used to measure the value of resistance between any two points of an electric عiícuit. The PMMC (Permanent-Magnetic Moving-Coil Movement) can change to be ohmmeter with connected voltage source and limited current resistor in series. The type of Ohmmeter is series ohmmeter and parallel ohmmeter. The purpose of an ohmmeter is to measure the resistance placed between its leads. This resistance reading is indicated through a mechanical meter movement which operates on electric current.</p>
                        <p>There are two types of ohmmeters: series ohmmeter, and shunt ohmmeter.<br>
                           In series type ohmmeter, the resistor whose value is unknown and to be measured should be connected in series with the ohmmeter. It is useful for measuring high values of resistances.<br>
                           In shunt type ohmmeter, the resistor whose value is unknown and to be measured should be connected in parallel (shunt) with the ohmmeter. It is useful for measuring low values of resistances.</p>

                        <p>When Rx = 0 ( AB terminal short), the current in circuit is maximum and the pointer shown the full reading. Adjust the R2 until the full scale, IM. The pointer at full scale is mark as 0 ohm. When Rx = infinity ( AB terminal open), the current in circuit is 0 . The unknown resistance must connect series with basic meter movement. This circuit use to measure higher resistance and the pointer is mark as infinity.</p>
