                        <p>(defined based on international agreement ) They represent certain units of measurements to the closest possible accuracy that production and measurement technology allow. These standards are maintained at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in America and not available to the ordinary user of measuring instruments.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Primary Standards</h3>
                         <p>(maintained by national standards laboratories) The primary (basic) standards are maintained by national standards laboratories in different parts of the world. The National Bureau of standards (NBS) in America, National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Britain, and Physikalisch Technische in Germany. The primary standards represent the fundamental units and some of the derived mechanical and electrical units. Primary standards are not available for use outside the national laboratories. One of the main functions of primary standards is the verification and calibration of secondary standards.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Secondary Standards</h3>
                         <p>( used by industrial measurement laboratories). Secondary standards are the basic reference standards used in industrial measurement laboratories. These standards are maintained by the particular involved industry and are generally sent to the national standards laboratories (primary) on a periodic basis for calibration and comparison.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Working Standards</h3>
                         <p>( used in general laboratory). Working standards are the principal tools of a measurement laboratory. They are used to check and calibrate general laboratory instrument for accuracy and performance or to perform comparison measurements in industrial applications. A manufacturer of precision resistances, for example, may use a standard resistor (a working standard) in the quality control department of his plant to check his testing equipment.</p>

                        <p>Calibration of all instruments is important since it affords the opportunity to check the instruments against a known standard and subsequently to find errors and accuracy. Calibration Procedure involve a comparison of the particular instrument with either :a primary standard, a secondary standard with a higher accuracy than the instrument to be calibrated or an instrument of known accuracy</p>
