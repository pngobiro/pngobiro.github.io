                        <p>For this test, the circuit diagram is shown in Figure 12.10. In this test the magnetisation winding of the ring specimen is supplied from a potential divider having few tappings. The tappings are arranged so that the magnetisation force $H$ may be increased in suitable number of steps, upto desired maximum value. Before testing the specimen, it must be demagnetised.</p>
                        <p>Keeping the switch $S 2$ on the tap 1 position, the switch $S 1$ is closed. Current flow in the magnetising winding sets up a magnetising force, $H 1$ which in turns increases the flux density in the specimen, from zero to some value B1, and corresponding throw of galvanometer is observed. The $B 1$ value can be calculated from the throw of the galvanometer. H 1 value may be calculated from the reading of the ammetre, connected to the magnetising winding circuit. The magnetising force is then increased to some value H 2 by switching $S 2$ suddenly to the tapping 2 and the corresponding increase in flux density $\Delta B$ is determined from the throw of the galvanometer. Then the flux density $B 2$ corresponding to magnetising force H 2 is calculated as $\mathrm{B} 2=\mathrm{B} 1+\Delta B$. The process is repeated for other values of $H$ up to the maximum point and the complete $B$ - $H$ curve thus drawn as shown in Figure</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Step-by-step Method</h4>
                        <p>The determination of the hysteresis loop by this method is carried out simply by continuing the procedure described in the previous section where the $B-H$ curve was obtained. After reaching the point of maximum $H$ with $S 2$ on the tapping 8 , the magnetising current is then reduced, in steps to zero by moving $S 2$ down through tapping points $8,7,6 \ldots 2,1$. After the reduction of the magnetising force to zero, negative values of $H$ are obtained by reversing the reversing supply to the potential divider and then moving the switch $S 2$ in steps as before.</p>

                        <p>A standard of magnetic flux linkage suitable for fluxmeter or galvanometer calibration. It comprises a stabilized magnet producing a radial field in an annular gap, through which a cylinder carrying a multiturn coil can be dropped</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How magnetic lux density is measured using Ballistic galvanometer</h3>
                        <p>The measurement of flux density inside a specimen can be done by winding a search coil over the specimen. This search coil is known as a " B coil". This search coil is then connected to a ballistic galvanometer or to a flux meter. Let us consider that we have to measure the flux density in a ring specimen shown in Fig below The ring specimen is wound with a magnetizing winding which carries a current I. A search coil of convenient number of turns is wound on the ${}^{3}$ specimen and connected through a resistance and calibrating coil, to a ballistic galvanometer as shown, The current through the magnetizing coil is reversed and therefore the flux linkages of the search coil change inducing an emf it. Thus emf sends a current through the ballistic galvanometer causing it to deflect.</p>
