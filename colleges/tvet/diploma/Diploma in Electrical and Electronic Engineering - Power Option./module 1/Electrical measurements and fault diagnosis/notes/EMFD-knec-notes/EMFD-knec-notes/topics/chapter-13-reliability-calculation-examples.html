                            - Unit 1 failed after 75 hours<br>
                            - Unit 2 failed after 125 hours<br>
                            - Unit 3 failed after 130 hours<br>

                         <p>Five units successfully completed the test cycle. The failure rate ($\boldsymbol{\lambda}$), in number of failures per hour, can be expressed as</p>

                         </div></div>
                        <p>As a second example, consider a given system with an operating cycle as depicted in Figure 4.2. The total operating time in this case is 152 hours and the system fails a total of six times as indicated. The failure rate per hour is</p>

                            $$\lambda=\frac{\text { number of failures }}{\text { total operating time }}=\frac{6}{\sqrt{152}}=0.03947$$
                         </div></div>
                        <p>Further, assuming an exponential time dÃªhity function, the system mean life or the MTBF is</p>

                        <p>1. Mean time between failures (MTBF) - The average time between failure occurrences. The number of items and their operating time divided by the total number of failures.<br>
                           It is a basic measure of reliability for repairable items = time passed before a component, assembly, or system fails, under the condition of a constant failure rate / expected value of time between two consecutive failures, for repairable systems.<br>
                           It is a commonly used variable in reliability and maintainability analyses.</p>
                        <p>MTBF = total time of correct operation in a period/number of failures<br>
                           For example: a system should operate correctly for 9 hours During this period, 4 failures occurred. Adding to all failures, we have 60 minutes (1 hour). Calculating the MTBF, we would have:</p>
                        <div class="math-block"><div class="equation">
                           $$\text { MTBF }=(9-1)/4=2 \text { hours }$$
                        </div></div>
                        <p>This index reveals that a failure in the system occurs every 2 hours, leaving it unavailable and generating losses to the company. The opportunity to spot this index allows you to plan strategies to reduce this time.</p>
                        <p>The MTBF is the inverse of the failure rate.<br>
                           MTBF $=1/\lambda, \quad\lambda=\mathrm{FR}$. Note: failure rate is in all components</p>
