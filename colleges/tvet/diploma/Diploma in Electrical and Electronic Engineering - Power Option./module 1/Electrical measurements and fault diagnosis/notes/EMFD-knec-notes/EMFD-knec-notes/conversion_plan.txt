Next Steps:
1. Convert PDF to MMD using Mathpix OCR:
   ```bash
   node /home/ngobiro/.local/share/Roo-Code/MCP/mathpix-ocr-server/build/index.js EMFD-knec-notes.pdf > EMFD-knec-notes/EMFD-knec-notes.mmd
   ```

2. After MMD conversion:
   - Analyze document structure
   - Create detailed chunking plan
   - Document special elements inventory
   - Create chunk-by-chunk tracking sections
   - Update this plan with complete information

Special Elements Inventory:
-------------------------
To be populated after MMD conversion with:
- Equations count and locations
- Tables count and locations
- Figures count and locations
- Code blocks count and locations
- Complex lists count and locations

Critical Sections:
To be identified during content analysis

Chunk-by-Chunk Tracking:
-----------------------
To be populated after content analysis and chunking

Cross-Chunk Navigation Planning:
------------------------------
To be determined after chunking is complete

Issues & Resolutions Log:
------------------------
[PENDING] Initial PDF conversion and analysis

Conversion Milestone Tracking:
----------------------------
[X] Initial Setup & Planning
    Completed: May 1, 2025
    - Created directory structure
    - Set up main.css
    - Set up navigation.js
    - Created initial conversion plan
