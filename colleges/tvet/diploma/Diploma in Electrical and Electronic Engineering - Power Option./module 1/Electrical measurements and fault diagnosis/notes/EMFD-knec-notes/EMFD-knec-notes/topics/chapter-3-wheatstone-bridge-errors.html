                        <p>The above mention error can be reduced by using the best qualities resistor and galvanometer. The error because of self-heating of resistance can minimise by measuring the resistance within the short time. The thermal effect can also be reduced by connecting the reversing switch between the battery and the bridge.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sensitivity of the Wheatstone Bridge</h3>
                        <p>The Wheatstone bridge is more sensitive when all their resistances are equal, or their ratio is unity. Their sensitivity decreases when their ratio is less than unity. The reduction in sensitivity reduces the accuracy of the bridge.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Application of Wheatstone Bridge</h3>
                        <p>One of the application of the Wheatstone bridge is a light détector circuit using a Wheatstone bridge circuit. The applications of the balanced bridge circuits mainly thvolve in various electronic applications to measure variations in light intensity, pressure or strain. The yarious kinds of resistive sensors are used in a Wheatstone bridge circuit are light dependent resistors, Thermistors, potentiometers and strain gauges, etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Kelvin Bridge Circuit</h3>
                        <p>Definition: The Kelvin bridge or Thompson bridge is used for measuring the unknown resistances having a value less than $1 \Omega$. It is the modified form of the Wheatstone Bridge.</p>
                        <p>One of the major drawbacks of the Wheatstone bridge is that although it can measure the resistance from few ohm to several mega ohm - it gives significant errors when measuring low resistances. Kelvin Bridge provides high accuracy especially in the measurement of low resistance. The measurement range would typically be $1 \mathrm{~m} \Omega$ to $1 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ with the smallest resolution of $1 \mu \Omega$.<br>
                           The limitations of the Kelvin bridge are:-</p>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Kelvin Double Bridge has generally been replaced by digital ohifmeters.</p>
                        <p>In Wheatstone Bridge, while measuring the low-value resistance, the resistance of their lead and contacts increases the resistance of their total measured value. This ean easily be understood with the help of the circuit diagram</p>
