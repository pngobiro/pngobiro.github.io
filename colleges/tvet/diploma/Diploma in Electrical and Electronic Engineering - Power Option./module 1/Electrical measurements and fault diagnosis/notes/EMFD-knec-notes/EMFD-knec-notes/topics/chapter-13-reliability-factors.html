                        <p>Design for Reliability ( DfR ) is a process that encompasses tools and procedures to ensure that a product meets its reliability requirements, under its use environment, for the duration of its lifetime</p>
                        <p>The most important factor is good, careful design based on sound experience, resulting in known safety margins. Making the units rugged through careful design and controlled overstress testing is a very important part of making the product reliable.</p>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Complexity</h3>
                        <p>Keep things simple - what isn't there, can't fail, but be careful: what isn't there can cause a failure! A complicated or difficult specification will, invariably result in reduced reliability. Every component used will contribute to the equipment's unreliability.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. Stress</h3>
                        <p>In electronic equipment, the most prominent stresses are temperature, voltage, vibration, and temperature rise due to current. The effect of each of these stresses on each of the components must be considered. In order to achieve good reliability, various de-rating factors have to be applied to these stress levels. The de-rating has to be traded off against cost and size implications. The layout has to be such that heat-generating components are kept away from other components and are adequately cooled.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Generic (Inherent) Reliability</h3>
                        <p>Inherent reliability refers to the fact that film capacitors are more reliable than electrolytic capacitors, wire-wrap connections more reliable than soldered ones, fixed resistors more reliable than pots, and so on. Components</p>
