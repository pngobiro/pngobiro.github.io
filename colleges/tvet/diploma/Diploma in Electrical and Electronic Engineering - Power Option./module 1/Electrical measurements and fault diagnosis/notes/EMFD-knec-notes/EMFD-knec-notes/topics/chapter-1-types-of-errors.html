                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Gross Errors:</h3>
                        <p>The gross errors mainly occur due to carelessness or lack of experience of a human begin. These errors also occur due to incorrect adjustments of instruments.These errors cannot be treated mathematically</p>
                        <p>These errors are also called personal errors'.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ways to minimize gross errors:</h3>
                        <p>The complete elimination of gross errors is not possible but one can minimize them by the following ways:</p>
                        <p>Taking great care while taking the reading, recording the reading &amp; calculating the result Without depending on only one reading, at least three or more readings must be taken * preferably by different persons.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Systematic errors:</h3>
                        <p>A constant uniform deviation of the operation of an instrument is known as a Systematic error. The Systematic errors are mainly due to the short comings of the instrument &amp; the characteristics of the material use d in the instrument, such a s defective or worn parts, ageing effects, environmental effects, etc. The systematic errors can be subdivided as static and dynamic errors. The static errors are caused by the limitations of the measuring device while the dynamic errors are caused by the instrument not responding fast enough to follow the changes in the variable to be measured.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of Systematic errors:</h3>
                        <p>There are three types of Systematic errors</p>

                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Instrumental errors:</h3>
                        <p>These errors can be mainly due to the following three reasons:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">a) Short comings of instruments:</h4>
                        <p>These are because of the mechanical structure of the instruments. For example friction in the bearings of various moving parts; irregular spring tensions, reductions in due to improper handling , hysteresis, gear backlash, stretching of spring, variations in air gap, etc .,</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Ways to minimize this error:</h4>
                        <p>These errors can be avoided by the following methods:</p>
                        <p>(a) Selecting a suitable instrument for the particular measurement applications.<br>
                           (b) Applying correction factors after determining the amount of instrumental error.<br>
                           (c) Calibrating the instrument against a standard.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsection-heading">b) Misuse of instruments:</h4>
                        <p>A good instrument if used in abnormal way gives misleading results. Poor initial adjustment, Improper zero setting, using leads of high resistance etc., are the examples of misusing a good instrument. Such things do not cause the permanent damage to the instruments but definitely cause the serious errors.<br>
                           Instrumental errors can be avoided by</p>

                         <h4 class="subsection-heading">C) Loading effects</h4>
                        <p>Loading effects due to im proper way of using the instrument cause the serious errors. The best ex ample of such loading effect error is connecting a w ell calibrated volt meter across the two points of high resistance circuit. The same volt meter connected in a low resistance circuit gives accurate reading.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Ways to minimize this error:</h4>
                        <p>Thus the err ors due to the loading effect can be avoided by using an instrument intelligently and correctly.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Environmental errors:</h3>
                        <p>These errors are due to the conditions external to the measuring instrument. The various factors resulting these environmental errors are temperature changes, pressure changes, thermal emf, ageing of equipment and frequency sensitivity of an instrument.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Observational errors:</h3>
                        <p>These are the errors introduced by the observer.<br>
                           These are many sources of observational errors such as parallax error while reading a meter, wrong scale selection, etc.<br>
                           Following are some of the reasons for observational errors</p>

                        <p>(a) Construction of the Scale : There is a possibility of error due to the division of the scale not being uniform and clear.<br>
                           (b) Fitness and Straightness of the Pointer : If the pointer is not fine and straight, then it always gives the error in the reading.<br>
                           (c) Parallax : Without a mirror under the pointer there may parallax error in reading.<br>
                           (d) Efficiency or Skillness of the Observer : Error in the reading is largely dependent upon the skillness of the observer by which reading is noted accurately.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ways to minimize this error</h3>
                        <p>To eliminate such errors one should use the instruments with mirrors, knife edged pointers, etc.,</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Random errors:</h3>
                        <p>Some errors still result, though the systematic and instrumental errors are reduced or at least accounted for. The causes of such errors are unknown and hence the errors are called random errors.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ways to minimize this error</h3>
                        <p>The only way to reduce these errors is by increasing the number of observations and using the statistical methods to obtain the best approximation of the reading.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">NOTE:</h3>
                        <p>In general, systematic errors can be subdivided into static and dynamic errors.<br>
                           Static error - caused by limitations of the measuring device or the physical laws governing its behavior.<br>
                           Dynamic error - caused by the instrument not responding very fast enough to follow the changes in a measured variable.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Error due to Other Factors</h3>
                         <h4 class="subsection-heading">Temperature Variation</h4>
                        <p>Variation in temperature not only changes the values of the parameters but also brings changes in the reading of the instrument. For a consistent error, the temperature must be constant.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Effect of the Time on Instruments</h4>
                        <p>There is a possibility of change in calibration error in the instrument with time. This may be called ageing of the instrument.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Effect of External Electrostatic and Magnetic Fields</h3>
                        <p>These electrostatic and magnetic fields influence the readings of instruments. These effects can be minimized by proper shielding.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mechanical Error</h3>
                        <p>Friction between stationary and rotating parts and residual torsion in suspension wire cause errors in instruments. So, checking should be applied. Generally, these errors may be checked from time to time.</p>
