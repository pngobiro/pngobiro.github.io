                        <p>Unreliability has a number of unfortunate consequences and therefore for many products and services is a serious threat. For example poor reliability can have implications for:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of reliability</h3>
                        <p>Reliability can be generally of two types:</p>
                        <p>(i) Inherent Reliability: It is associated with the quality of the material and design of machine parts.<br>
                           (ii) Achievable Reliability: It depends upon other factors such as maintenance and operation of the equipment.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors Affecting Reliability</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">1. Design Factors</h4>
                        <p>Design for Reliability ( DfR ) is a process that encompasses tools and procedures to ensure that a product meets its reliability requirements, under its use environment, for the duration of its lifetime</p>
                        <p>The most important factor is good, careful design based on sound experience, resulting in known safety margins. Making the units rugged through careful design and controlled overstress testing is a very important part of making the product reliable.</p>
