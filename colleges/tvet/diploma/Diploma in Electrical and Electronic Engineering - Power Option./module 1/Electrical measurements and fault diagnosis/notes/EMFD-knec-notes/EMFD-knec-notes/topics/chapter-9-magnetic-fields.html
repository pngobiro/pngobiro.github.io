                        <p>Magnetism $\square$ Force of attraction or repulsion that acts between magnets and other magnetic materials<br>
                           Flux lines $\square$ Show direction and intensity of this field at all points<br>
                           Flux, $\square$ : Total number of lines<br>
                           The number of magnetic lines of forces set up in a magnetic circuit is called Magnetic Flux.<br>
                           Symbol is Phi, ( $\Phi$ ) with the unit of flux being the Weber, ( Wb ).<br>
                           But the number of lines of force within a given unit area is called the "Flux Density" and since flux ( $\Phi$ ) is measured in ( Wb ) and area ( A ) in metres squared, ( $\mathrm{m}^{2}$ ), flux density is therefore measured in Webers/Metre ${ }^{2}$ or ( $\mathrm{Wb} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ) and is given the symbol B .</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Magnetic Flux Density</h3>
                         <div class="math-block"><div class="equation">
                            $$\text { Magnetic Flux Density, (tesla) }=\frac{\text { Magnetic Flux, (weber) }}{\text { Area, }(\mathrm{m} 2)}$$
                         </div></div>
                        <p>The symbol for magnetic flux density is B and the unit of magnetic flux density is the Tesla, T .</p>
                         <div class="math-block"><div class="equation">
                           $$B=\frac{\Phi}{A} \quad \text { in Teslas }$$
                        </div></div>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Magnetism Example No1</h3>
                        <p>The amount of flux present in a round magnetic bar was measured at 0.013 webers. If the material has a diameter of 12 cm , calculate the flux density.</p>
                        <p>The cross sectional area of the magnetic material in m 2 is given as:</p>
                        <div class="math-block"><div class="equation">
                           $$\begin{aligned}
                           \text { Diameter }&amp;=12 \mathrm{~cm}\\
                           \therefore \text { Area }&amp;=\pi \mathrm{r}^{2}\\
                           \mathrm{~A}&amp;=3.142 \times 0.06^{2}=0.0113 \mathrm{~m}^{2}
                           \end{aligned}$$
                        </div></div>
                        <p>The magnetic flux is given as 0.013 webers, therefore the flux density can be calculated as:</p>
                        <div class="math-block"><div class="equation">
                           $$\mathrm{B}=\frac{\Phi}{\mathrm{A}}=\frac{0.013}{0.0113}=1.15 \mathrm{~T}$$
                        </div></div>
                        <p>So the flux density is calculated as 1.15 Teslas.</p>

                        <p>The magnetic field is defined as the region around the magnet where its poles and the electrical charges experience the force of attraction or repulsion,</p>
                        <p>Magnetic field intensity, H . Also called mÃ©gnetizing force . Measures mmf per unit length of a circuit.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Difference Between Magnetic Field &amp; Magnetic Flux</h3>
                        <p>The most significant difference between the magnetic field and the magnetic flux is that the magnetic field is the region around the magnet where the moving charge experiences a force, whereas the magnetic flux shows the quantity or strength of magnetic lines produced by the magnet.</p>
