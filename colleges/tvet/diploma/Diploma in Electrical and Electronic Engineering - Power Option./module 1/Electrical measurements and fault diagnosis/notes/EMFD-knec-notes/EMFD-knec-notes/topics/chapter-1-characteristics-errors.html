                        <p>The set of criteria defined for the instruments, which are changes rapidly with time, is called 'dynamic characteristics'.</p>
                        <p>The various dynamic characteristics are:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Speed of response:</h3>
                        <p>It is defined as the rapidity with which a measurement system responds to changes in the measured quantity.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Measuring lag:</h3>
                        <p>It is the retardation or delay in the response of a measurement system to changes in the measured quantity. The measuring lags are of two types:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">a) Retardation type:</h4>
                        <p>In this case the response of the measurement system begins immediately after the change in measured quantity has occurred.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">b) Time delay lag:</h4>
                        <p>In this case the response of the measurement system begins after a dead time after the application of the input.</p>

                        <p>Fidelity: It is defined as the degree to which a measurement system indicates changes in the measurand quantity without dynamic error.</p>
                        <p>Dynamic error: It is the difference between the true value of the quantity changing with time &amp; the value indicated by the measurement system if no static error is assumed. It is also called measurement error.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Errors in Measurement</h3>
                        <p>In order to understand the concept of errors in measurement, we should know the two terms that defines the error and these two terms are written below:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">True Value</h3>
                        <p>It is not possible to determine the true value of quantity by experiment means. True value may be defined as the average value of an infinite number of measured values when average deviation due to various contributing factor will approach to zero.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Measured Value</h3>
                        <p>It may be defined as the approximated value of true value. It can be found out by taking means of several measured readings during an experiment, by applying suitable approximations on physical conditions.. Static error is defined as the difference of the measured value and the true value of the quantity</p>
                        <p>Static error = measured value - true value. defined as the difference btn the measured value and true value of quantity i.e $\delta A=A_{m}-A_{t}$<br>
