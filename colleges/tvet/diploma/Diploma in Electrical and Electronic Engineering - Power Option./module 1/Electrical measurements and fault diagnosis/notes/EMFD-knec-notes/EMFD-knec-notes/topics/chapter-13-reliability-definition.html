                        <p>- Failure is defined as the ending of the ability of a design element to meet its function before its design lifetime is achieved.</p>

                        <p>Reliability means how long an item (such as a machine) will perform its intended function without a breakdown. Reliability is defined as the probability that a device will perform its intended function during a specified period of time under stated conditions. It refers to the like hood that equipment will not fail during its operation.</p>
                        <p>The probability that an item will perform a defined function without failure under stated conditions for a stated period of time.</p>
                        <p>The Reliability, $\mathrm{R}(\mathrm{t})$, of a component or system is defined as The probability that a piece of equipment operating under specified conditions shall perform satisfactorily for a given period of time.</p>
                        <p>Reliability is the probability of success or the probability that the system will perform its intended function under specified design</p>
                        <p>Reliability: the probability of no failure throughout a prescribed operating period.</p>
                        <p>Availability: The probability that a system is performing satisfactorily at time t</p>
                        <p>Failure -The change functioning - failed state</p>
                        <p>Failure: the inability of an equipment to perform its required function</p>
                        <p>Rate-The number of failures per unit of gross operating period in terms of time, events, cycles.</p>
                        <p>Repair - Change from a failure to a functioning</p>
                        <p>Repairing - bring the component /system back to an "as good as new" condition.</p>
                        <p>For a repairable system, the cycle continues repeatedly with the repair-to failure and the failure-to-repair process.</p>
