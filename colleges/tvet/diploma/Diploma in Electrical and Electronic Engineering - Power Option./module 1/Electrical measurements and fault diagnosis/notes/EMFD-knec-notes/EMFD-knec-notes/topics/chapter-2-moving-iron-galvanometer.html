                         <p>1) Hysteresis error: Due to hysteresis effect, the tux density for the same current while ascending and descending values is different. While descending, the flux density is higher and while ascending it is lesser. So frneter reads higher for descending values of current or voltage. So remedy for this is to use smaller iron parts which can demagnetise quickly or to work with lower flux densities.</p>
                        <p>2) Temperature error : The temperature error arises due to the effect of temperature on the temperature coefficient of the spring. This error is of the order of $0.02 \%$ per oC change in temperature. Errors can cause due to self heating of the coil and due to which change in resistance of the coil. So coil and series resistance must have low temperature coefficient. Hence mangnin is generally used for the series resistance.</p>
                        <p>3) Stray magnetic Field Error : The operating magnetic field in case of moving iron instruments is very low. Hence effect of external i.e. stray magnetic field can cause error. This effect depends on the direction of the stray magnetic field with respect to the operating field of the instrument.</p>
                        <p>4) Frequency Error : These are related to a.c. operation of the instrument. The change in frequency affects the reactance of the working coil and also affects the magnitude of the eddy currents. This cause error in the instrument.</p>
                        <p>5) Eddy Current Error : When instrument is used for a.c. measurements the eddy currents are produced in the iron parts of the instrument. The eddy current affects the instrument current causing the change in the deflection torque. This produce the error in the meter reading. As eddy current are frequency dependent, frequency changes cause eddy current error.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Analog Meters: Galvanometers</h3>
                        <p>Analog meters have a needle that swivels to point at numbers on a scale, as opposed to digital meters, which have numerical readouts similar to a hand-held calculator. The heart of most analog meters is a device called a galvanometer, denoted by G. Current flow through a galvanometer, IG , produces a proportional needle deflection. (This deflection is due to the force of a magnetic field upon a current-carrying wire.) This movement of coil is called D'Arsonval movement and basic meter is called D'Arsonval galvanometer.</p>
                        <p>The two crucial characteristics of a given galvanometer are its resistance and current sensitivity. Current sensitivity is the current that gives a full-scale deflection of the galvanometer's needle, the maximum current that the instrument can measure. For example, a galvanometer with a current sensitivity of $50 \mu \mathrm{A}$ has a maximum deflection of its needle when $50 \mu \mathrm{A}$ flows through it, reads half-scale when $25 \mu \mathrm{A}$ flows through it, and so on. If such a galvanometer has a $25-\Omega$ resistance, then a voltage of only $V=I R=(50 \mu \mathrm{A})(25 \Omega)=1.25 \mathrm{mV}$ produces a full-scale reading. By connecting resistors to this galvanometer in different ways, you can use it as either a voltmeter or ammeter that can measure a broad rangeeof voltages or currents.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Galvanometer as an Ammeter</h3>
                        <p>The same galvanometer can also be made into ag ammeter by placing it in parallel with a small resistance $R$, often called the shunt resistance, Since the shunt resistance is small, most of the current passes through it, allowing an ammeter to measure currents mish greater than thase producing a full-scale deflection of the galvanometer.</p>
