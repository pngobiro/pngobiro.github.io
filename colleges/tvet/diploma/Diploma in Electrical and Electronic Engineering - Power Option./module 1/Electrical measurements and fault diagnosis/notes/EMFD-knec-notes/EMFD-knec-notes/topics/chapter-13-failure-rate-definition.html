                        <p>It is often difficult to decide what is failure and whether an item has failed. Dummer and Winton' classify failures by cause, time, degree, and combinations of these three:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">1. Cause:</h4>
                        <p>(a) Misuse, e.g. due to the application of stresses beyond the stated capacity of the item:<br>
                           (b) Inherent weakness, i.e. in the item itself when subject to stresses within the stated capacities of that item.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">2. TÃ¯me:</h4>
                        <p>(a) Sudden failure. i.e. that could not be anticipated by prior examination;<br>
                           (b) Gradual failure. i.e. that could be anticipated by prior examination;</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">3. Degree:</h4>
                        <p>(a) Partial failure, i.e. resulting in deviations in the characteristics of the item beyond specified limits which nevertheless do not cause complete lack of the required function:<br>
                           (b) Complete failure, i.e. resultingin deviations in the characteristics of the item beyond specified dimits which causcoomplete lack of the required function:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">4. Combinations:</h4>
                        <p>(a) Catastrophic, i.e failures which are both sudden and complete;<br>
                           (b) Degradation. i.e. failures which are both gradual and partial.</p>

                        <p>This type of failure is applicable to those items that do not deteriorate markedly with service, but which ultimately fail after some period of using. For any particular type of equipment the period from installation to failure is not equal but will follow some â€žfrequency distribution which may be progressive, retrogressive, or random in nature".</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Progressive failures:</h3>
                        <p>In this mechanism, probability of failure increases as the life of equipment increases. Examples include: electric light bulbs, automobile tubes etc.,</p>

                        <p>Under this failure, constant probability of failure is associated with the equipment that fails from random causes such as physical shocks, not related to age. In such a case, virtually all equipments fail prior to their</p>
