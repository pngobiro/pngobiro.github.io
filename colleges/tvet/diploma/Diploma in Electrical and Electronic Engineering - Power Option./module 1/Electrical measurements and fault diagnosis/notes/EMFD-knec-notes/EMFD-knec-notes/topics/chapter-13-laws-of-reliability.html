                        <p>Reliability is defined as the probability that a device will perform its intended function during a specified period of time under stated conditions.</p>
                        <p>The reliability of components in series must take into account the probability of individual failures in a given period. For a measuring system with $n$ serial components, the reliability Rs is the product of the individual reliabilities</p>
                        <p>The reliability may increase with components set in parallel, which means that the system will fail if all components fail. In this case, the reliability Rs is given by:<br>
                           Rs = 1 - Fs, where Fs is the system non reliability. The non reliability is Fs = F1xF2...F3.<br>
                           For example, a safe measuring system has three identical devices in parallel. The reliability of each one is 0.95 and the system reliability is given by:<br>
                           Rs $=1-[(1-0.95) x(1-0.95) x(1-0.95)]=0.999875$</p>

                        <p>There are several ways of increasing the reliability of a measuring system:</p>
