                        <p>Definition: The meter which is used for measuring the flux of the permanent magnet such type of meter is known as the flux meter. The fluxmeter is the advaÃ±eed form of the ballistic galvanometer which has certain advantages like the meter has low controlling toigue and heavy electromagnetic damping.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Construction of Flux Meter</h3>
                        <p>The construction of the fluxmeter is shown in the figure below. The fluxmeter has a coil which is freely suspended by the help of the spring and the single silk thread. The coil moves freely between the poles of the permanent magnet.</p>

                         </figure>
                        <p>The current enters into the coil with the help of the helices which is very thin and made from the annealed silver strips. This current reduces the controlling torque to the ninimum value. The air friction damping of the coil is negligible.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Operation of Flux Meter</h3>
                        <p>The terminals of the fluxmeter are connected across the searoh coil as shown in the figure below. The flux linking with the coil is varied by eitherremoving it fromthe magnetic field or by reversing the field of the magnet. The change of the flux induces the electromotive force in the coil. This emf induces the current in the search coil and send it through the flux meter. Because of the current, the pointer of the fluxmeter deflects, and their deflection is directly proportional to the change in the value of flux linkages.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_01_b9c6c5644ff12c14cd75g-125.jpg?height=607&amp;width=912&amp;top_left_y=1569&amp;top_left_x=116.jpg" alt="Circuit diagram showing Flux Meter with Search Coil.">

                        <p>As, the variation of the flux linkages reduces, coil stop moving because of their high electromagnetic damping. The high electromagnetic damping is because of the low resistance circuit between the fluxmeter and the search coil.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Advantages of Fluxmeter</h3>
                        <p>The following are the advantages of fluxmeter.</p>

                                <span class="item-icon">â€¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">3. The deflection of the coil is free from the time taken by the flux to change.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Disadvantages</h3>
                        <p>The only disadvantage of the fluxmeter is that it is less sensitive and accurate as compared to the flux meter.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ballistic Galvanometer</h3>
                        <p>Definition: The galvanometer which is used for estimating the quantity of charge flow through it is called the ballistic galvanometer.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Construction of Ballistic Galvanometer</h3>
                        <p>The ballistic galvanometer consists coil of copper wire which is wound on the non-conducting frame of the galvanometer. The phosphorous bronze suspends the coil between the north and south poles of a magnet. For increasing the magnetic flux the iron core places within the coil. The lower portion of the coil connects with the spring. This spring provides the restoring torque to the coil.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The working principle of the ballistic galvanometer.</h3>
                        <p>When the charge passes through the galvanometer, their coil starts moving and gets an impulse. The impulse of the coil is proportional to the charges passes through it. The actual reading of the galvanometer achieves by using the coil having a high moment of inertia. The moment of inertia means the body oppose the angular movement. If the coil has a high moment of inertia, then their oscillations are large. Thus, accurate reading is obtained</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Calibration of Galvanometer</h3>
                        <p>The calibration of the galvanometer is the process of determining its constant value by the help of the practical experiments. The following are the methods used for determining the constant of the ballistic galvanometer.</p>
