                        <p>Failure analysis is the process by which information/data about failure occurring in equipments/ systems are collected and analyzed to find the root cause of failures, and the causes are addressed to prevent recurrence of failures.</p>
                        <p>When a product or device fails, you need to know why. Root cause failure analysis helps a business get to the source of a product failure. More importantly, it provides the manufacturer with the information needed to address and correct the issue causing the failure.<br>
                           Root cause failure analysis is usually a multidisciplinary process. The tools NTS uses during an analysis include visual inspections, metallographic, environmental and chemical analysis and simulation tests. The specific tests utilized depend on the type of product and the failure mode.</p>

                        <p>The failure rate is expected to vary over the life of a product -'Bathtub Curve'</p>
                        <p>The life of a population of devices (a group of devices of the same type) can be divided into three distinct periods:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Early Life</h4>
                        <p>If we follow the slope from the leftmost start to where it begins to flatten out this can be considered the first period. The first period is characterized by a decreasing failure rate. It is what occurs during the "early life" of a population of units. The weaker units fail leaving a population that is more rigorous.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Useful Life</h4>
                        <p>The next period is the flat bottom portion of the graph. It is called the "useful life" period. Failures occur more in a random sequence during this time. It is difficult to predict which failure mode will occur, but the rate of failures is predictable. Notice the constant slope.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsection-heading">Wearout</h4>
                        <p>The third period begins at the point where the slope begins to increase and extends to the rightmost end of the graph. This is what happens when units become old and begin to fail at an increasing rate. It is called the "wearout" period.</p>
