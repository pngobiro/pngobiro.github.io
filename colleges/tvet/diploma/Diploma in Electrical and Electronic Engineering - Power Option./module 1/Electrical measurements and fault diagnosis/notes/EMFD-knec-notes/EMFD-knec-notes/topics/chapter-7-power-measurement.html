                        <p>A special meter movement designed especially for power measurement is called the dynamometer movement, and is similar to a D'Arsonval meter. A dynamometer movement connected in a circuit looks something like this:</p>

                        <p>The internal construction of a wattmeter is such that it consists of two cols. One of the coil is in series and the other is connected in parallel. The coil that is connected in series with the circuit is known as the current coil and the one that is connected in parallel with the circuit is known as the voltage coil. The needle that is supposed to move on the marked scale to indicate the amount of power is also attached to the potential coil. The reason for this is that the potential coil is allowed to move whereas the current coil is kept fixed.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Working of a Wattmeter</h3>
                        <p>When the current passes through the current coil, it creates an electromagnetic field around the coil. The strength of this electromagnetic field is directly proportional to the amount of current passing through it.</p>
                        <p>In case of DC current, the current is also in phase with its generated electromagnetic field. The voltage is dropped across the potential coil and as a result of this complete process, the needle moves across the scale. The needle deflection is such that it is according to the product of the current passing and the voltage dropped, that is, $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{VI}$.</p>
