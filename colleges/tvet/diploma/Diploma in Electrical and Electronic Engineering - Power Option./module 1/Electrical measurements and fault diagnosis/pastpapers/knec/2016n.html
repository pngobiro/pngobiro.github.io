                                <p class="answer-intro">This question focuses on equipment reliability, the bathtub curve, and calculations of reliability metrics like MTTR, MTBF, and system reliability.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Factors affecting Reliability and Bathtub Curve (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Two factors that affect equipment reliability:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Component Quality:** The intrinsic reliability of the individual components used in the equipment. Higher quality components manufactured to tighter specifications generally lead to higher equipment reliability.</li>
                                    <li>**Design Robustness:** How well the equipment is designed to withstand expected operating stresses (voltage, current, temperature, vibration, humidity) and variations without failure. Derating components is a design practice to improve reliability.</li>
                                    <li>**Manufacturing and Assembly Processes:** The quality of manufacturing and assembly, including soldering, wiring, testing, and quality control, directly impacts the number of initial defects and thus reliability.</li>
                                    <li>**Operating Environment:** The conditions under which the equipment operates (temperature, humidity, dust, vibration, power supply stability). Harsh environments can accelerate degradation and cause failures.</li>
                                    <li>**Maintenance Quality:** The quality and timeliness of preventive and corrective maintenance. Poor maintenance can introduce new faults or fail to address potential issues.</li>
                                    <li>**Usage/Stress Level:** How the equipment is used relative to its design limits (e.g., continuous heavy load vs. intermittent light load).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Sketch and explanation of the failure rate curve (Bathtub Curve):**</p>
                                <figure class="question-figure">
                                    <img src="images/2016n_q1-fig1.png" alt="Graph showing failure rate vs. time, illustrating the bathtub curve with three regions: Infant Mortality (decreasing failure rate), Useful Life (constant failure rate), and Wear-out (increasing failure rate).">

                                <p class="answer-intro">The bathtub curve illustrates the typical failure rate of a population of components or equipment over its lifespan, composed of three periods:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Infant Mortality (Early Failures):** The failure rate is high initially but decreases rapidly. Caused by manufacturing defects, poor quality components, or installation errors. These are often screened out during burn-in testing.</li>
                                    <li>**Useful Life (Random Failures):** The failure rate is relatively constant and low. Failures are random events, often stress-induced (e.g., voltage spikes, transient surges, external shock), not related to age. This is the desired operating period.</li>
                                    <li>**Wear-out Period:** The failure rate increases rapidly with time. Caused by aging, wear, fatigue, corrosion, and material degradation. Preventive maintenance or replacement is often scheduled before this phase.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Reliability of Units and Equipment (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">For components or units connected in series, the failure of any single unit causes the failure of the entire system. The system reliability is the product of the individual unit reliabilities.</p>
                                <p>Given MTBFs for units in a series system and an operating period \(t = 1000\) hours. The reliability \(R(t)\) for a time \(t\), assuming a constant failure rate (\(\lambda = 1/MTBF\)), is \( R(t) = e^{-\lambda t} = e^{-t/MTBF} \).</p>
                                <p>From Table 1 (Figure 1):</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Power supply: MTBF = 30,000 hrs</li>
                                    <li>Pre-amplifier: MTBF = 100,000 hrs</li>
                                    <li>Oscillator: MTBF = 60,000 hrs</li>
                                    <li>Modulator: MTBF = 75,000 hrs</li>
                                    <li>Power amplifier: MTBF = 40,000 hrs</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>**(i) Reliability of each unit for an operating period of 1000 hours:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Power supply: \( R_{PS}(1000) = e^{-1000/30000} = e^{-1/30} \approx e^{-0.0333} \approx 0.9672 \)</li>
                                    <li>Pre-amplifier: \( R_{PA}(1000) = e^{-1000/100000} = e^{-0.01} \approx 0.9900 \)</li>
                                    <li>Oscillator: \( R_{Osc}(1000) = e^{-1000/60000} = e^{-1/60} \approx e^{-0.0167} \approx 0.9835 \)</li>
                                    <li>Modulator: \( R_{Mod}(1000) = e^{-1000/75000} = e^{-1/75} \approx e^{-0.0133} \approx 0.9868 \)</li>
                                    <li>Power amplifier: \( R_{PowA}(1000) = e^{-1000/40000} = e^{-1/40} = e^{-0.025} \approx 0.9753 \)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>**(ii) Reliability of the equipment for an operating period of 1000 hours:**</p>
                                <p>For a series system, the system reliability (\(R_{system}\)) is the product of the individual unit reliabilities:</p>
                                \[ R_{system}(t) = R_{PS}(t) \times R_{PA}(t) \times R_{Osc}(t) \times R_{Mod}(t) \times R_{PowA}(t) \]
                                \[ R_{system}(1000) \approx 0.9672 \times 0.9900 \times 0.9835 \times 0.9868 \times 0.9753 \]
                                \[ R_{system}(1000) \approx 0.9055 \]
                                <p>Alternatively, calculate the total failure rate for the series system: \( \lambda_{system} = \sum \lambda_i = \sum (1/MTBF_i) \).</p>
                                \[ \lambda_{system} = \frac{1}{30000} + \frac{1}{100000} + \frac{1}{60000} + \frac{1}{75000} + \frac{1}{40000} \quad (\text{per hour}) \]
                                \[ \lambda_{system} \approx (33.33 + 10 + 16.67 + 13.33 + 25) \times 10^{-6} \quad (\text{per hour}) \]
                                \[ \lambda_{system} \approx 98.33 \times 10^{-6} \quad (\text{per hour}) \]
                                \[ \lambda_{system} \approx 0.09833 \quad (\text{per 1000 hours}) \]
                                <p>System reliability: \( R_{system}(1000) = e^{-\lambda_{system} \times 1000} = e^{-0.09833} \approx 0.9063 \).</p>
                                <div class="key-point">Note: The two methods (multiplying individual reliabilities vs. using total failure rate) yield slightly different results due to rounding. Using the total failure rate calculated from MTBFs is generally more precise for a series system. \( R_{system}(1000) \approx 0.9063 \).</div>

                                <p><strong>(c) Generator System Reliability Metrics (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Operating period = 1 year</li>
                                    <li>Number of failures in 1 year = 3</li>
                                    <li>Total time to repair = 14 days</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Assume 1 year = 365 days.</p>
                                <p>**(i) Mean time to repair (MTTR), in days:**</p>
                                <p>MTTR is the total time spent on repair divided by the number of failures.</p>
                                \[ MTTR = \frac{\text{Total Time to Repair}}{\text{Number of Failures}} = \frac{14 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ failures}} \approx 4.67 \text{ days/failure} \]

                                <p>**(ii) Mean time between failure (MTBF), in days:**</p>
                                <p>MTBF is the average time between successive failures for a repairable system. It includes both operating time and repair time.
                                \[ MTBF = \frac{\text{Total Operating Period}}{\text{Number of Failures}} = \frac{1 \text{ year}}{3 \text{ failures}} = \frac{365 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ failures}} \approx 121.67 \text{ days/failure} \]
                                <p>Alternatively, MTBF can be viewed as \( MTBF = MTTF + MTTR \). Total operating time (uptime) = Total period - Total downtime = 365 days - 14 days = 351 days.
                                \[ MTTF = \frac{\text{Total Uptime}}{\text{Number of Failures}} = \frac{351 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ failures}} = 117 \text{ days} \]
                                \[ MTBF = MTTF + MTTR = 117 \text{ days} + 4.67 \text{ days} = 121.67 \text{ days} \]
                                <p>Both definitions yield the same result.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers different systems of units (MKS vs CGS, ESU, EMU) and factors affecting the precision of Wheatstone bridge measurements.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) MKS vs CGS Units and Charge Units Comparison (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Two advantages of MKS over CGS system of units:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Practical Magnitudes:** The base units (meter, kilogram, second) and many derived units (like Newton, Joule, Watt) have magnitudes that are more convenient for practical engineering applications compared to the CGS units (centimeter, gram, second).</li>
                                    <li>**Basis for SI:** The MKS system formed the foundation for the modern International System of Units (SI), which is the internationally adopted standard.</li>
                                    <li>**Simplified Formulas:** When extended to electromagnetism (MKSA), it provides a coherent system where electromagnetic equations (like Maxwell's equations) often take a simpler form without awkward constants compared to CGS-ESU or CGS-EMU.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Comparison of charge units (cgs e.m.u vs MKS):**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Comparing charge units requires understanding the definitions in each system and the relationship between them, which involves the speed of light (\(c\)). This is a complex derivation typically covered in electromagnetism courses.</p>
                                <p>In cgs e.m.u, current is a fundamental quantity derived from force between conductors. The unit of current (abampere) is defined such that \(k=1\) in Ampere's force law (\(F = k \frac{I_1 I_2 l}{r}\)). The unit of charge (abcoulomb) is defined as 1 abampere-second.</p>
                                <p>In MKS (or SI), current (Ampere) is a fundamental quantity. The unit of charge (Coulomb) is defined as 1 Ampere-second.</p>
                                <p>The relationship between abampere (emu current) and Ampere (SI current) is 1 abampere = 10 Amperes.</p>
                                <p>The relationship between abcoulomb (emu charge) and Coulomb (SI charge) is 1 abcoulomb = 1 abampere \(\times\) 1 second = 10 Amperes \(\times\) 1 second = 10 Coulombs.</p>
                                <p>So, one unit of charge in cgs electromagnetic units (1 abcoulomb) is equal to 10 units of charge in MKS/SI units (1 Coulomb). The question states "equal to one unit", which is incorrect based on the standard definitions. It might be asking for the *dimensional* equality or a specific context where a factor might make them numerically equal, but conventionally, 1 abcoulomb = 10 C.</p>
                                <p>Let's check the dimensions. In CGS-EMU, charge \([Q]_{emu} = [M^{1/2}L^{1/2}]\). In MKS/LMTI, charge \([Q]_{LMTI} = [IT]\). These dimensions are fundamentally different, highlighting the distinct nature of the systems.</p>
                                <p>Given the likely simplification intended, perhaps it's just a concept check. The ratio of the unit of charge in ESU to the unit of charge in EMU is numerically equal to the speed of light \(c\). 1 statcoulomb \(\approx 3.3356 \times 10^{-10}\) Coulomb. 1 abcoulomb = 10 Coulomb.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Conclusion: One unit of charge in cgs electromagnetic units (abcoulomb) is **not** equal to one unit of charge in MKS/SI units (Coulomb); 1 abcoulomb = 10 Coulombs.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Dimensional Expressions in CGS Units (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">CGS units (centimeter-gram-second) have two main electromagnetic branches: ESU (electrostatic) and EMU (electromagnetic). The dimensions can be expressed in terms of L, M, T for each branch.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Charge (Q) in e.s.u:** As derived in Q1b of the July 2014 paper:
                                        \[ [Q]_{esu} = [M^{1/2}L^{3/2}T^{-1}] \]
                                        This is derived from Coulomb's Law assuming \(k=1/\epsilon_0=1\).</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Magnetising Force (H) in e.m.u:** Magnetising force H is related to magnetic flux density B (\(B = \mu H\)). In EMU, permeability of vacuum \(\mu_0\) is dimensionless and taken as 1. H is related to the magnetic field produced by current. For a long solenoid, \(H = NI/l\). In EMU, current \(I\) has dimensions \([M^{1/2}L^{1/2}T^{-1}]\). Length \(l\) has dimensions \([L]\). N is dimensionless.
                                        \[ [H]_{emu} = \frac{[I]_{emu}}{[L]} = \frac{[M^{1/2}L^{1/2}T^{-1}]}{[L]} = [M^{1/2}L^{-1/2}T^{-1}] \]
                                        Alternatively, using the force between magnetic poles: \(F = k \frac{p_1 p_2}{r^2}\). In EMU, \(k=1/\mu_0=1\). Force \([MLT^{-2}]\), Length \([L]\). Magnetic pole strength \(p\) has dimensions \( [p]_{emu} = [M^{1/2}L^{3/2}T^{-1}] \) (same as charge in ESU). Magnetic field strength \(H\) is force per unit pole strength \(H = F/p\).
                                        \[ [H]_{emu} = \frac{[MLT^{-2}]}{[M^{1/2}L^{3/2}T^{-1}]} = [M^{1/2}L^{-1/2}T^{-1}] \]
                                        Both derivations yield the same dimensions for H in EMU.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Factors affecting precision of medium resistance measurement with Wheatstone Bridge (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">This section seems to be a repeat from Question 2(c) of the July 2014 paper. The explanation for each factor is the same:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Temperature effects:** Changes in temperature affect the resistance values of the bridge arms. Non-uniform heating or temperature drift during measurement can lead to incorrect balance points. Using resistors with low temperature coefficients or operating in a temperature-controlled environment minimizes this error.</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Contact resistance:** Resistance introduced at the connections between components and wiring. These small resistances add in series to the bridge arms. While often negligible for high resistances, they can become significant when measuring medium resistances, affecting precision. Using clean terminals and secure connections helps.</li>
                                    <li>**(iii) Thermo-electric effects:** Small voltages generated at junctions of dissimilar metals due to temperature differences (Seebeck effect). These e.m.f.s can disturb the null detector's reading, especially when using a sensitive galvanometer. Keeping the bridge at a uniform temperature or using specific switching sequences can help mitigate this.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">This question tests understanding of fundamental unit systems and the practical considerations for achieving precision in bridge measurements.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Measuring Depth of Modulation with CRO (Timebase OFF) and Waveform (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">When the time base of an oscilloscope is switched off, the spot on the screen moves only in the vertical direction if the signal is applied to the Y-input. For an amplitude modulated (AM) wave, the amplitude of the carrier signal varies according to the modulating signal. Applying the AM wave to the Y-input with the timebase off results in a vertical line whose length corresponds to the peak-to-peak variation of the AM signal's amplitude.</p>
                                <p>Procedure:</p>
                                <ol>

                                \[ m = \frac{V_{max} - V_{min}}{V_{max} + V_{min}} \]
                                <p>On the CRO display with timebase off, the length of the vertical line swings between \(2V_{max}\) and \(2V_{min}\). We measure the total maximum vertical deflection \(A_{max} = 2V_{max}\) and the total minimum vertical deflection \(A_{min} = 2V_{min}\). So \(V_{max} = A_{max}/2\) and \(V_{min} = A_{min}/2\).</p>
                                \[ m = \frac{A_{max}/2 - A_{min}/2}{A_{max}/2 + A_{min}/2} = \frac{(A_{max} - A_{min})/2}{(A_{max} + A_{min})/2} = \frac{A_{max} - A_{min}}{A_{max} + A_{min}} \]

                                <p class="answer-intro">Electrostatic voltmeters measure voltage by the electrostatic force between charged plates. The torque on the movable plates is balanced by a spring torque.</p>
                                <p>The energy stored in a capacitor is \( W = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \). In an electrostatic voltmeter, the change in stored energy with respect to displacement (\(\theta\)) gives the electric torque \(T_e\):</p>

                                <p>Note that \(\theta\) must be in radians for the derivative \(dC/d\theta\) to be dimensionally correct in the torque equation which is typically in Nm/radian. The given deflection is 100 degrees. Convert this to radians:</p>
                                \[ \theta_{FSD} = 100^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} \mathrm{rad} = \frac{100\pi}{180} \mathrm{rad} = \frac{5\pi}{9} \mathrm{rad} \]

                                \[ \frac{1}{2} (100 \times 10^6) \times (35.4 \times 10^{-12}) = K_s \times \frac{5\pi}{9} \]
                                \[ 50 \times 10^6 \times 35.4 \times 10^{-12} = K_s \times \frac{5\pi}{9} \]

                                <p><strong>(a) Capacitor Failures and Component Handling (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(I) Two factors that may cause premature failure of capacitors:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Overvoltage:** Applying a voltage exceeding the capacitor's voltage rating can cause the dielectric material to break down, leading to a short circuit.</li>
                                    <li>**Overheating:** Operating the capacitor at temperatures above its maximum rated temperature can accelerate degradation of the dielectric and electrolyte (for electrolytics), leading to reduced capacitance, increased ESR, or bulging/venting.</li>
                                    <li>**Incorrect Polarity:** Applying reverse voltage to polarized capacitors (like electrolytic or tantalum) can cause chemical reactions leading to damage, leakage, venting, or explosion.</li>
                                    <li>**Excessive Ripple Current:** For capacitors used in filtering (especially electrolytics), excessive AC ripple current can cause internal heating, leading to premature aging and failure.</li>
                                    <li>**Physical Stress:** Bending leads too sharply, mechanical shock, or vibration can damage internal connections or the case.</li>

                                <p>**(II) Two precautions when handling and testing electronic components:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Static Discharge (ESD) Prevention:** Especially important for static-sensitive devices like MOSFETs and ICs. Use grounded wrist straps and work surfaces, handle components by the body, and keep them in anti-static packaging until use.</li>
                                    <li>**Proper Tool Usage:** Use appropriate tools and techniques to avoid damaging components or the PCB. Use heat sinks when soldering heat-sensitive components. Use correct desoldering methods.</li>
                                    <li>**Power Off Before Testing:** Disconnect power to the circuit before performing resistance or continuity checks with a multimeter to avoid damaging the meter or components.</li>
                                    <li>**Component Polarity:** Pay attention to the polarity of polarized components (diodes, electrolytic capacitors, ICs, transistors) during installation and testing.</li>
                                    <li>**Voltage/Current Ratings:** Be aware of the voltage and current limitations of components and test equipment to avoid overstressing or damaging them during testing.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) Amplifier Fault Analysis (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 2 shows a common-emitter amplifier with voltage divider bias. We need to estimate DC voltages at test points TP1, TP2, and TP3 under normal operation and given fault conditions. TP1 is at the collector, TP2 at the base, and TP3 at the emitter.</p>
                                <p>Assume typical \(V_{BE} = 0.7V\) for silicon, and a reasonable \(\beta\) (e.g., 100) for estimating base voltage if not negligible. Let's first analyze normal operation to get a baseline.</p>
                                <p>From Figure 2: \(V_{CC} = 12V\), \(R_1 = 33k\Omega\), \(R_2 = 8.2k\Omega\), \(R_C = 3.3k\Omega\), \(R_E = 1k\Omega\).</p>
                                <p>Normal Operation (Approximate Calculation):</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Base Voltage \(V_B \approx V_{CC} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = 12V \times \frac{8.2k}{33k + 8.2k} = 12V \times \frac{8.2}{41.2} \approx 2.398V \). TP2 voltage \(\approx 2.4V\).</li>
                                    <li>Emitter Voltage \(V_E = V_B - V_{BE} \approx 2.398V - 0.7V = 1.698V \). TP3 voltage \(\approx 1.7V\).</li>
                                    <li>Emitter Current \(I_E = V_E / R_E = 1.698V / 1k\Omega \approx 1.7mA\).</li>
                                    <li>Collector Current \(I_C \approx I_E \approx 1.7mA\).</li>
                                    <li>Collector Voltage \(V_C = V_{CC} - I_C R_C = 12V - (1.7mA)(3.3k\Omega) = 12V - (1.7 \times 10^{-3})(3.3 \times 10^3) = 12V - 5.61V \approx 6.39V \). TP1 voltage \(\approx 6.4V\).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Normal Voltages: TP1 (\(V_C\)) \(\approx 6.4V\), TP2 (\(V_B\)) \(\approx 2.4V\), TP3 (\(V_E\)) \(\approx 1.7V\).</p>

                                <p>**(i) Estimate voltages at test points for each fault:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(I) Resistor \(R_1\) open circuit:**
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>If \(R_1\) opens, the base is biased only by \(R_2\) to ground. The base voltage \(V_B\) will be very low, pulled towards ground through \(R_2\). Ideally, with no base current path from \(V_{CC}\), \(I_B\) approaches zero, and the transistor goes into cutoff. \(V_B\) will be close to 0V (or slightly above due to leakage or \(R_2\) current if it were connected to a negative rail, but here it's to ground).</li>
                                            <li>**Effect:** Transistor turns OFF (\(I_C \approx 0\), \(I_E \approx 0\)).
                                            <li>**Estimated Voltages:** TP1 (\(V_C\)) \(\approx V_{CC} = 12V\) (no drop across \(R_C\)), TP2 (\(V_B\)) \(\approx 0V\) (pulled down by \(R_2\) to ground), TP3 (\(V_E\)) \(\approx 0V\) (no current through \(R_E\)).</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>**(II) Transistor base-emitter junction short circuit:**
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>If the B-E junction shorts, \(V_{BE}\) is forced to 0V. This prevents the transistor from operating in the active region where \(V_{BE} \approx 0.7V\). Instead, the base and emitter are effectively connected directly.</li>
                                            <li>**Effect:** The transistor is likely in cutoff or behaving abnormally. The voltage divider \(R_1, R_2\) now connects to \(R_E\) through the short. The base voltage will be \(V_B = V_E\). \(V_E\) will be determined by the voltage division of \(V_{CC}\) by \(R_1, R_2,\) and \(R_E\).</li>
                                            <li>Let's calculate \(V_B = V_E\). \(R_1, R_2, R_E\) form a complex divider from \(V_{CC}\) to ground. Effectively, \(R_1 || R_2\) is in series with \(R_E\) from the perspective of \(V_{CC}\). However, the current path is \(V_{CC}\) -> \(R_1\) -> Base/Emitter node -> \(R_E\) -> Ground, AND \(V_{CC}\) -> \(R_1\) -> Base/Emitter node -> \(R_2\) -> Ground. This is a network. A simpler view is that \(V_B = V_E\). The current \(I_E\) will flow through \(R_E\), and \(I_B\) will flow through \(R_1 || R_2\). With \(V_B = V_E\), the voltage divider calculation for \(V_B\) will be affected because \(I_B\) is now significant. The emitter current will be very high, only limited by the external resistors. This fault usually destroys the transistor and/or other components. However, assuming the fault just forces \(V_{BE}=0\), the transistor won't conduct significantly.
                                            <li>Let's assume the intended effect is that \(V_{BE}=0V\) prevents conduction.
                                            <li>**Estimated Voltages:** TP1 (\(V_C\)) \(\approx V_{CC} = 12V\) (transistor OFF), TP2 (\(V_B\)) \(\approx V_E\) (shorted), TP3 (\(V_E\)) \(\approx 0V\) (transistor OFF, no current in \(R_E\)), leading to TP2 \(\approx 0V\). This result (\(V_B \approx 0V, V_E \approx 0V, V_C \approx 12V\)) is the same as \(R_1\) open, suggesting cutoff.</li>
                                            <div class="key-point">Note: A B-E short causing cutoff is a common consequence, but depending on the exact nature of the short and circuit impedances, it could also lead to high currents. The provided solution likely expects the cutoff scenario.</div>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>**(ii) Effect of an open circuit in capacitor \(C_3\) (4 marks):**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">\(C_3\) is the bypass capacitor connected in parallel with the emitter resistor \(R_E\). Its function is to bypass AC signals around \(R_E\) to effectively ground the emitter for AC signals, maximizing AC voltage gain. It is open for DC.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Effect:** If \(C_3\) is open-circuited, it no longer provides an AC path around \(R_E\). For AC signals, \(R_E\) is no longer effectively shorted out. This increases the AC negative feedback in the emitter circuit.</li>
                                    <li>**Symptom:** The AC voltage gain of the amplifier will decrease significantly. The DC biasing (voltages at TP1, TP2, TP3) will remain unaffected (since \(C_3\) is open for DC anyway). The amplifier might still function, but with much lower amplification of the input signal.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Since the fault is *suspected* in the PS, the most efficient approach is to test its output first (TP1 or TP2). If the voltage there is absent or low, the PS is confirmed faulty. If the voltage is correct, the fault lies elsewhere in the system.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">A thermocouple ammeter measures current by utilizing the heating effect of the current and the Seebeck effect (thermo-electric effect). It can measure both AC and DC currents and is particularly useful for measuring RMS values of non-sinusoidal AC currents.</p>
                                <p>**Description:**</p>
                                <p>The main components are a heating element (a resistor), a thermocouple junction, and a sensitive DC moving-coil meter. The current to be measured (\(I\)) passes through the heating element (\(R_{heater}\)). The heating element heats up due to power dissipation (\(P = I^2 R_{heater}\)). A thermocouple, made of two dissimilar metals joined at a junction, is placed in close thermal contact with the heating element (but electrically insulated from it). The temperature difference between the hot junction (near the heater) and the cold junction (at the meter terminals) generates a small DC voltage (thermo-electric e.m.f.) proportional to the temperature difference. This DC voltage is then measured by a sensitive DC moving-coil voltmeter (which is typically calibrated to read current). Since the heating effect is proportional to the square of the current (\(I^2\)), the instrument's deflection is proportional to the RMS value of the input current, regardless of waveform, provided the frequency is not too high.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) Thermocouple ammeter square law response calculation (4 marks):**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">A perfect square law response means the deflection (\(\theta\)) of the instrument is directly proportional to the square of the current (\(I^2\)): \( \theta = k I^2 \), where \(k\) is a constant.</p>

                                \[ \theta_{half} = k I_{half}^2 \]

                                <p>Divide by \(k\) (assuming \(k \neq 0\)):</p>
                                \[ 50 = I_{half}^2 \]
                                \[ I_{half} = \sqrt{50} \, A \]
                                \[ I_{half} \approx 7.071 \, A \]

                                <p>Thermionic emission is the release of electrons from the surface of a heated metal. Metals have many free electrons in their conduction band. These electrons are held within the metal by a potential barrier at the surface. When the metal is heated to a sufficiently high temperature, some of the free electrons gain enough thermal energy to overcome this surface barrier (work function) and escape from the metal into the surrounding space (vacuum or gas). The higher the temperature and the lower the work function of the metal, the greater the rate of thermionic emission.</p>

                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Final anode voltage \(V_a = 2 \, kV = 2000 \, V\).</li>

                                    <li>Screen distance from center of plates \(L = 30 \, cm = 0.3 \, m\).</li>
                                    <li>Deflection voltage \(V_d = 100 \, V\).</li>
                                    <li>Electronic charge \(e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, C\) (using the value from the 2023j paper for consistency, though 1.6e-19C is common).</li>
                                    <li>Electron mass \(m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, kg\) (using the value from the 2023j paper for consistency).</li>
                                </ul>

                                \[ v_x = \sqrt{\frac{2 e V_a}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, C) \times (2000 \, V)}{9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, kg}} \]
                                \[ v_x = \sqrt{\frac{6.408 \times 10^{-16}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}} = \sqrt{0.70359 \times 10^{15}} = \sqrt{7.0359 \times 10^{14}} \]
                                \[ v_x \approx 2.6525 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m/s} \]

                                <p>While passing through the deflection plates, the electron experiences a constant electric field in the y-direction \( E_y = V_d / d \). This causes an acceleration \( a_y = \frac{e E_y}{m} = \frac{e V_d}{m d} \). The time spent between the plates is \( t_d = l_d / v_x \).</p>
                                <p>The vertical velocity gained is \( v_y = a_y t_d = \frac{e V_d}{m d} \times \frac{l_d}{v_x} \).</p>
                                <p>The vertical displacement as the electron leaves the plates is \( y_1 = \frac{1}{2} a_y t_d^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{e V_d}{m d} \left(\frac{l_d}{v_x}\right)^2 \).</p>
                                <p>After leaving the plates, the electron travels in a straight line at an angle \(\alpha\) to the horizontal, where \( \tan \alpha = v_y / v_x \). This line appears to originate from the center of the deflection plates (at \(x = l_d/2\)). The total deflection on the screen (at \(x = L + l_d/2\)) is \(Y\).</p>
                                \[ Y = \tan \alpha \times L + y_1 \]
                                <p>A simpler formula for the total deflection \(Y\) on the screen is often used, assuming \(y_1\) is negligible compared to the deflection caused by the angle \( \tan \alpha \times L \):</p>
                                \[ Y \approx \tan \alpha \times L = \frac{v_y}{v_x} \times L = \left(\frac{e V_d l_d}{m d v_x}\right) / v_x \times L = \frac{e V_d l_d L}{m d v_x^2} \]
                                <p>Substitute \( v_x^2 = \frac{2 e V_a}{m} \):</p>
                                \[ Y = \frac{e V_d l_d L}{m d (2 e V_a / m)} = \frac{e V_d l_d L}{2 e V_a d} = \frac{V_d l_d L}{2 V_a d} \]
                                <p>**(I) Maximum deflection, in cm:**</p>
                                <p>Using the formula for \(Y\):</p>
                                \[ Y = \frac{100 \, V \times 0.02 \, m \times 0.3 \, m}{2 \times 2000 \, V \times 0.005 \, m} = \frac{100 \times 0.02 \times 0.3}{2 \times 2000 \times 0.005} \, m \]
                                \[ Y = \frac{0.6}{20} \, m = 0.03 \, m \]
                                <p>Convert to cm: \( Y = 0.03 \, m \times 100 \, cm/m = 3 \, cm \).</p>

                                <p>**(II) Sensitivity of CRT, in \( \mathrm{mm} / \mathrm{V} \):**</p>
                                <p>Sensitivity is the deflection per unit deflection voltage (\(S = Y / V_d\)). Use the deflection in mm.</p>
                                \[ Y = 3 \, cm = 30 \, mm \]
                                \[ S = \frac{Y}{V_d} = \frac{30 \, mm}{100 \, V} = 0.3 \, \mathrm{mm/V} \]

                                <p>**(III) Deflection factor, in \( \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{mm} \):**</p>
                                <p>Deflection factor is the reciprocal of sensitivity (\(D = 1/S\)).</p>
                                \[ D = \frac{V_d}{Y} = \frac{100 \, V}{30 \, mm} = \frac{10}{3} \, \mathrm{V/mm} \approx 3.33 \, \mathrm{V/mm} \]

                                            <li>The reverse saturation current (\(I_S\)) increases significantly with increasing temperature. This is because more minority carriers are generated thermally at higher temperatures. \(I_S\) approximately doubles for every 10°C rise in temperature.</li>
                                            <li>The reverse breakdown voltage (\(V_{BR}\)) can also change with temperature, typically increasing slightly with temperature for avalanche breakdown and decreasing for Zener breakdown.</li>

                                <p>The sketch should show two curves, one for \(100^\circ C\) and one for \(200^\circ C\). The \(200^\circ C\) curve should be to the left of the \(100^\circ C\) curve in the forward bias (lower \(V_F\) for same \(I_F\)) and much lower in the reverse bias (much higher \(I_R\) for same \(V_R\)).</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) FET vs BJT Advantages and NPN Operation (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Two advantages of FETs over BJTs:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**High Input Impedance:** FETs, especially MOSFETs, have extremely high input impedance (gate terminal), which minimizes the loading effect on the preceding stage. BJTs have relatively lower input impedance.</li>
                                    <li>**Less Noise:** FETs generally produce less noise than BJTs, making them suitable for sensitive amplifier applications.</li>
                                    <li>**Better Thermal Stability:** FETs are less susceptible to thermal runaway compared to BJTs.</li>
                                    <li>**Simpler Manufacturing (MOSFETs):** MOSFETs can be manufactured with higher packing density on integrated circuits compared to BJTs.</li>
                                    <li>**Voltage Controlled:** FETs are voltage-controlled devices, simplifying some circuit designs.</li>

                                <p class="answer-intro">An NPN transistor has a P-type base between two N-type regions (Emitter and Collector). It operates in the active region when the Emitter-Base junction is forward-biased (\(V_{BE} \approx 0.7V\) for Silicon) and the Collector-Base junction is reverse-biased (\(V_{CB} > 0V\) or \(V_{CE} > V_{BE}\)).</p>
                                <p>**Operation in Active Region:** Electrons are injected from the heavily doped Emitter into the thin Base due to the forward bias. Most electrons diffuse through the Base and are swept into the Collector by the reverse bias electric field across the Collector-Base junction. A small Base current exists due to electron-hole recombination in the Base and holes injected from the Base into the Emitter. The Collector current (\(I_C\)) is controlled by the Base current (\(I_B\)) or Base-Emitter voltage (\(V_{BE}\)), where \(I_C \approx \beta I_B\).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) JFET Amplifier Analysis and Plotting (11 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 4 shows a self-biased common-source N-channel JFET amplifier. Table 2 gives the transfer characteristics (\(I_D\) vs \(V_{GS}\)).</p>
                                <p>From Figure 4: \(V_{DD} = 15V\), \(R_G = 1M\Omega\), \(R_D = 1.5k\Omega\), \(R_S = 0.75k\Omega\).</p>
                                <p>In a self-biased circuit, the gate is grounded via \(R_G\), so \(V_G = 0V\). The source voltage is \(V_S = I_D R_S\). The gate-source voltage is \(V_{GS} = V_G - V_S = 0 - I_D R_S = -I_D R_S\). This is the equation of the bias line (or self-bias line).</p>

                                <p>**(i) Plot the transfer curve:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Plot the data from Table 2 with \(V_{GS}\) on the x-axis and \(I_D\) on the y-axis.</p>

                                </ul>
                                <p class="key-point">Plotting requires graph paper or plotting software, which cannot be provided in this text output. The curve will be a parabola opening downwards, starting from \(I_{DSS}=8mA\) at \(V_{GS}=0V\) and reaching \(I_D=0\) at \(V_{GS}=-4V\) (the pinch-off voltage \(V_p\)).</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Construct the dc loadline:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">There are two DC load lines for this circuit: the bias line and the drain line. The question likely refers to the operating point bias line (\(V_{GS} = -I_D R_S\)) on the transfer characteristics graph.</p>
                                <p>The bias line equation is \(V_{GS} = -I_D R_S\). With \(R_S = 0.75 k\Omega\), this is \(V_{GS} = -I_D \times 0.75k\). To plot this line on the \(I_D\) vs \(V_{GS}\) graph, find two points:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If \(I_D = 0mA\), then \(V_{GS} = -0 \times 0.75k = 0V\). Point 1: (0V, 0mA).</li>
                                    <li>Choose another \(I_D\) value, say \(4mA\). \(V_{GS} = -4mA \times 0.75k\Omega = -(4 \times 10^{-3})(0.75 \times 10^3) = -3V\). Point 2: (-3V, 4mA).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Draw a straight line connecting the points (0V, 0mA) and (-3V, 4mA) on the same graph as the transfer curve. The intersection of this bias line with the transfer curve is the Q-point (\(I_{DQ}, V_{GSQ}\)).</p>
                                <p>The DC drain load line exists on the \(I_D\) vs \(V_{DS}\) output characteristics graph. Its equation is \(V_{DD} = I_D (R_D + R_S) + V_{DS}\), or \(I_D = \frac{V_{DD}}{R_D+R_S} - \frac{1}{R_D+R_S} V_{DS}\). This is typically called the DC load line. The Q-point is also projected onto this line.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Given the context of using the transfer curve, "construct the dc loadline" most likely refers to plotting the *bias line* (\(V_{GS} = -I_D R_S\)) on the \(I_D\) vs \(V_{GS}\) transfer characteristics graph to graphically determine the Q-point. The intersection looks to be around \(I_D \approx 4.5mA\) and \(V_{GS} \approx -3.4V\), or perhaps \(I_D \approx 4mA\) at \(V_{GS} \approx -3V\) based on the table values.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">This question tests knowledge of FET types, BJT operation, and graphical analysis techniques (transfer curves and load lines) for biasing JFET amplifiers.</p>

                                    <li>During the **negative half-cycle** of the AC input voltage, diode D2 is forward-biased, and D1 is reverse-biased. Current flows through D2, charging capacitor C2. The voltage across C2 is the sum of the input AC voltage (negative peak) and the voltage already stored on C1 (\(V_{peak}\)). Diode D2 conducts and charges C2 to approximately \(V_{peak}\). As the negative peak of the input voltage is reached, the voltage across C2 becomes approximately \(V_{peak}\) (bottom plate positive, top plate negative relative to the junction point).</li>
                                    <li>The output DC voltage is taken across the series combination of capacitors C1 and C2. Since C1 is charged to \(V_{peak}\) and C2 is charged to \(V_{peak}\) (with opposing polarities relative to their junction), the total output DC voltage is \(V_{out} = V_{C1} + V_{C2} = V_{peak} + V_{peak} = 2 V_{peak}\).</li>

                                <p class="answer-intro">The circuit is a Zener diode shunt regulator. The Zener diode maintains a constant voltage \(V_Z\) across the load as long as the input voltage \(V_{in}\) and load resistance \(R_L\) vary within limits that keep the Zener in its breakdown region (i.e., Zener current \(I_Z\) is between \(I_{Z,min}\) and \(I_{Z,max}\)).</p>
                                <p>Given: \(V_{in} = 20V\), \(R_S = 220\Omega\). Zener diode: \(V_Z = 10V\), \(I_{Z,min} = 5mA\), \(I_{Z,max} = 50mA\). Load is variable resistor \(R_L\).</p>
                                <p>The voltage across the load \(V_L\) is regulated by the Zener diode, so \(V_L = V_Z = 10V\). The voltage across the series resistor \(R_S\) is \(V_{R_S} = V_{in} - V_L = 20V - 10V = 10V\).</p>
                                <p>The current through the series resistor \(I_S\) is constant as long as \(V_{in}\) and \(R_S\) are constant:</p>
                                \[ I_S = \frac{V_{R_S}}{R_S} = \frac{10 \, V}{220 \, \Omega} \approx 0.04545 \, A = 45.45 \, mA \]
                                <p>The current \(I_S\) splits between the Zener diode (\(I_Z\)) and the load (\(I_L\)): \(I_S = I_Z + I_L\).</p>
                                <p>For regulation to be maintained, the Zener diode must be in breakdown, meaning \(I_{Z,min} \leq I_Z \leq I_{Z,max}\). The load current \(I_L\) varies as \(R_L\) varies: \(I_L = V_L / R_L = 10V / R_L\).</p>

                                <p>**(i) Minimum value of \(R_L\) that the Zener will tolerate in maintaining \(V_L\) constant:**</p>
                                <p>Regulation is maintained as long as \(I_Z \geq I_{Z,min}\). Since \(I_S = I_Z + I_L\), the minimum Zener current corresponds to the maximum load current (\(I_{L,max}\)).</p>
                                \[ I_Z = I_S - I_L \]
                                <p>Minimum \(I_Z\) occurs when \(I_L\) is maximum: \( I_{Z,min} = I_S - I_{L,max} \).</p>
                                \[ I_{L,max} = I_S - I_{Z,min} = 45.45 \, mA - 5 \, mA = 40.45 \, mA \]
                                <p>The minimum load resistance \(R_{L,min}\) occurs when the load current is maximum:</p>
                                \[ R_{L,min} = \frac{V_L}{I_{L,max}} = \frac{10 \, V}{40.45 \, mA} = \frac{10 \, V}{40.45 \times 10^{-3} \, A} \approx 247.22 \, \Omega \]

                                <p>**(ii) Minimum value of load current:**</p>
                                <p>The minimum load current (\(I_{L,min}\)) occurs when the Zener current is maximum (\(I_{Z,max}\)).</p>
                                \[ I_{L,min} = I_S - I_{Z,max} = 45.45 \, mA - 50 \, mA = -4.55 \, mA \]
                                <p>A load current cannot be negative. This result suggests that even with minimum load current (or load removed, \(I_L = 0\)), the maximum current through the Zener \(I_S = 45.45mA\) is within the Zener's \(I_{Z,max} = 50mA\) rating. The minimum load current that still allows regulation is when \(I_Z = I_{Z,max}\). The absolute minimum load current would be 0 (open circuit load). Regulation is maintained as long as the Zener doesn't exceed \(I_{Z,max}\) or go below \(I_{Z,min}\). The lower limit for \(I_L\) is when \(I_Z = I_{Z,max}\).</p>
                                \[ I_{L,min} = I_S - I_{Z,max} = 45.45 \, mA - 50 \, mA = -4.55 \, mA \]
                                <p>This indicates that \(I_S\) is never large enough to push the Zener current to its maximum limit, even if \(I_L\) is zero. Thus, the minimum load current for which regulation is maintained is when \(I_Z = I_{Z,min}\). The actual minimum load current the circuit can *handle* while maintaining regulation is when \(I_Z = I_{Z,max}\). However, the calculation shows \(I_S < I_{Z,max}\), so the Zener current will never reach \(I_{Z,max}\). The minimum load current corresponds to maximum \(I_Z\), but since \(I_S\) is limited, \(I_Z\) cannot exceed \(I_S\). The range of \(I_L\) for regulation is from \(I_S - I_{Z,max}\) to \(I_S - I_{Z,min}\). Since \(I_S < I_{Z,max}\), the lower bound is negative, meaning the Zener current never reaches \(I_{Z,max}\) within the operating range.
                                The practical minimum load current is often considered to be 0 (open circuit load). In this case, \(I_Z = I_S = 45.45mA\), which is between \(I_{Z,min}\) and \(I_{Z,max}\), so regulation is maintained.
                                Given the calculation resulted in a negative value, there might be an interpretation issue or the Zener limits are set such that \(I_S\) is within the Zener's operating range regardless of the load. The minimum *required* load current to keep \(I_Z\) below \(I_{Z,max}\) would be \(I_S - I_{Z,max}\). Let's state the minimum load current for which \(I_Z \ge I_{Z,min}\).
                                \[ I_{L,max} = I_S - I_{Z,min} = 40.45 \, mA \]
                                \[ R_{L,min} = 10V / 40.45mA \approx 247.22\Omega \]
                                If \(R_L\) is larger than \(R_{L,min}\), \(I_L\) is smaller than \(I_{L,max}\), and \(I_Z = I_S - I_L\) will be greater than \(I_{Z,min}\). The maximum possible \(R_L\) is infinite, meaning \(I_L = 0\). In this case, \(I_Z = I_S = 45.45mA\). Since \(5mA \le 45.45mA \le 50mA\), the Zener stays in breakdown for all \(R_L \ge 247.22\Omega\).
                                The question asks for the minimum value of load current. This is when \(R_L\) is maximum (ideally infinite or open circuit).
                                \[ I_{L,min} = \frac{V_L}{R_{L,max}} = \frac{10V}{\infty} = 0A \]
                                Regulation is maintained down to \(I_L=0A\) because \(I_S=45.45mA\) is within the Zener's operational range (5mA to 50mA).

                                <p>**(iii) Maximum value of load current:**</p>
                                <p>The maximum value of load current (\(I_{L,max}\)) occurs when the Zener current is at its minimum (\(I_{Z,min}\)).</p>
                                \[ I_{L,max} = I_S - I_{Z,min} = 45.45 \, mA - 5 \, mA = 40.45 \, mA \]
