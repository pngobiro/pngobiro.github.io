                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers standards of measurement, calculation involving a standard cell, dimensional analysis for work, and voltmeter loading effect calculation.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Standards of Measurement and Standard Cell (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Standards of measurement descriptions:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(I) Secondary Standards:** These are standards whose values are determined by comparing them with primary standards. They are maintained by national standards laboratories and are used for calibrating working standards. They are highly accurate but less accurate than primary standards.</li>
                                    <li>**(II) Working Standards:** These are standards used in everyday laboratory measurements and calibrations. They are calibrated against secondary standards. They are less accurate than secondary standards but are practical for routine use.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Standard cell calculations:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">A standard cell is designed to provide a very stable and precise reference voltage. However, it has some internal resistance and insulation resistance, which can cause a slight voltage drop under load or current drain.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Rated voltage (\(V_{rated}\)) = 1.018500 V</li>
                                    <li>Internal resistance (\(R_{int}\)) = \(500 \Omega\)</li>
                                    <li>Insulation resistance (\(R_{ins}\)) = \(5 \, M\Omega = 5 \times 10^6 \, \Omega\)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(I) Current drain due to insulation resistance:**</p>
                                <p>Insulation resistance is in parallel with the load (or effectively across the terminals if no load is connected). The rated voltage is across this insulation resistance, causing a small leakage current.</p>
                                \[ I_{leakage} = \frac{V_{rated}}{R_{ins}} = \frac{1.018500 \, V}{5 \times 10^6 \, \Omega} = 0.2037 \times 10^{-6} \, A = 0.2037 \, \mu A \]
                                <p>The current drain due to insulation resistance is \(0.2037 \, \mu A\).</p>
                                <p>**(II) Difference between the rated voltage and the drop due to internal resistance:**</p>
                                <p>The voltage drop due to internal resistance occurs when there is current flowing *out* of the cell. This current is the sum of any load current and the leakage current calculated above. If no external load is connected, the only current flowing out is the leakage current \(I_{leakage}\).</p>
                                \[ V_{drop} = I_{leakage} \times R_{int} = (0.2037 \times 10^{-6} \, A) \times (500 \, \Omega) \]
                                \[ V_{drop} = 101.85 \times 10^{-6} \, V = 0.10185 \, mV \]
                                <p>The terminal voltage of the cell, with only the insulation resistance as load, is \( V_{terminal} = V_{rated} - V_{drop} = 1.018500 \, V - 0.00010185 \, V = 1.01839815 \, V \).</p>
                                <p>The difference between the rated voltage and the drop due to internal resistance is \( V_{drop} = 0.10185 \, mV \).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Dimensional equation of "work done" in MLT system (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Work is defined as Force times Distance (\(W = F \times d\)). In the MLT system, Force (F) has dimensions of Mass (M) times Acceleration (L/TÂ²). So, the dimensions of force are \([MLT^{-2}]\).</p>
                                \[ [\text{Work}] = [\text{Force}] \times [\text{Distance}] \]
                                \[ [\text{Work}] = [MLT^{-2}] \times [L] \]
                                \[ [\text{Work}] = [ML^2T^{-2}] \]
                                <p>The dimensional equation for work done is \( [ML^2T^{-2}] \).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Percentage error due to voltmeter loading effect (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">When a voltmeter is connected in parallel with a resistor to measure its voltage, its internal resistance reduces the total resistance of the parallel combination, affecting the current distribution in the circuit and thus the measured voltage (loading effect).</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Voltmeter Sensitivity = \(1000 \Omega/V\)</li>
                                    <li>Voltmeter Scale = 150 V</li>
                                    <li>Voltmeter Reading (\(V_m\)) = 100 V</li>
                                    <li>Milliammeter Reading (\(I_m\)) = 5 mA = \(5 \times 10^{-3} \, A\)</li>
                                    <li>Milliammeter resistance is neglected.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Internal resistance of the voltmeter (\(R_v\)) = Sensitivity \(\times\) Full Scale Voltage = \(1000 \, \Omega/V \times 150 \, V = 150,000 \, \Omega = 150 \, k\Omega\).</p>
                                <p>The milliammeter measures the total current entering the parallel combination of the unknown resistor \(R_x\) and the voltmeter. This total current is \(I_m = 5 \, mA\). The voltmeter measures the voltage \(V_m = 100 \, V\) across this parallel combination.</p>
                                <p>The apparent resistance (\(R_{apparent}\)) being measured is the resistance of the parallel combination of \(R_x\) and \(R_v\), calculated from the meter readings:</p>
                                \[ R_{apparent} = \frac{V_m}{I_m} = \frac{100 \, V}{5 \times 10^{-3} \, A} = \frac{100}{0.005} \, \Omega = 20,000 \, \Omega = 20 \, k\Omega \]
                                <p>This \(R_{apparent}\) is the equivalent resistance of \(R_x\) in parallel with \(R_v\).</p>
                                \[ R_{apparent} = \frac{R_x R_v}{R_x + R_v} \]
                                <p>Solve for the actual unknown resistance \(R_x\):</p>
                                \[ 20 \, k\Omega = \frac{R_x \times 150 \, k\Omega}{R_x + 150 \, k\Omega} \]
                                \[ 20 (R_x + 150) = 150 R_x \quad (\text{dropping } k\Omega) \]
                                \[ 20 R_x + 3000 = 150 R_x \]
                                \[ 3000 = 130 R_x \]
                                \[ R_x = \frac{3000}{130} = \frac{300}{13} \approx 23.077 \, k\Omega \]
                                <p>The percentage error due to loading is typically calculated as the difference between the actual value and the measured (apparent) value, relative to the actual value.</p>
                                \[ \% \text{Error} = \frac{R_x - R_{apparent}}{R_x} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Error} = \frac{23.077 \, k\Omega - 20 \, k\Omega}{23.077 \, k\Omega} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Error} = \frac{3.077}{23.077} \times 100\% \approx 13.33\% \]
                                <p>The voltmeter loading effect causes the measured resistance to be 13.33% lower than the actual resistance.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">This question tests knowledge of measurement standards, basic electrical calculations involving standard sources and internal resistances, dimensional analysis, and the practical impact of instrument loading on measurement accuracy.</p>

                                    <li>**Variable Frequency Oscillator (VFO):** Generates a signal with a known frequency (\(f_{VFO}\)) that can be precisely adjusted over a range. This frequency is applied as the second input to the mixer.</li>
                                    <li>**Mixer:** This is a non-linear circuit that combines the two input frequencies (\(f_{unknown}\) and \(f_{VFO}\)).

                                <p>The magnetic field \(H\) at the center of a long solenoid is \( H = \frac{N_{sol} I}{l} \). The flux density \(B\) inside the solenoid (assuming air core, i.e., permeability \(\mu_0\)) is \( B = \mu_0 H = \mu_0 \frac{N_{sol} I}{l} \).</p>
                                \[ B = \mu_0 \frac{N_{sol} I}{l} \]

                                \[ \Delta\Phi \approx 0.008378 \times 3.14159 \times 2.25 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{Wb} \]
                                \[ \Delta\Phi \approx 5.923 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb} \]
                                <p>The total change in flux linkage (\(\Delta\Psi\)) with the search coil is the change in flux multiplied by the number of turns in the search coil:</p>

                                \[ Q = \frac{\Delta\Psi}{R_{total}} \]

                                \[ K \approx 0.001742 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C/division} = 1.742 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C/division} \]
                                <p>The ballistic constant of the galvanometer is approximately \(1.742 \, \mathrm{nC/division}\).</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Reliability, with respect to engineering systems, is the probability that the system will perform its intended function without failure for a specified period of time under specified operating conditions.

                                <p class="answer-intro">The manufacturing cost generally increases significantly as the required reliability increases. To achieve higher reliability, manufacturers must use higher quality components, implement more stringent manufacturing processes, perform more thorough testing and quality control checks, and potentially employ redundancy in the design. These measures all add to the cost of production.</p>

                                <p>The curve showing manufacturing cost versus reliability typically slopes upwards and is convex. This means that achieving small improvements in reliability becomes increasingly expensive as the reliability level gets higher, especially when approaching 100% reliability, where costs can rise very sharply.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Note: The question asks for "manufacturing cost against reliability" and "each curve". This implies there might be other cost curves expected here, such as design and development cost or the total cost curve (including maintenance), which is commonly shown alongside manufacturing cost when discussing the economics of reliability (as seen in Q4b of July 2014 paper). Assuming the question might implicitly expect the total cost perspective or at least one other cost like design/development, the explanation would be similar â these costs also increase with target reliability.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Procedure of assessing the reliability of an equipment (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Reliability assessment is a process to estimate or predict the reliability of an equipment based on data and analysis. The procedure can involve several steps:</p>

                                    <li>**Define System Boundaries and Function:** Clearly define what constitutes the equipment and its intended function, as well as what is considered a failure.</li>
                                    <li>**Identify Stress Levels and Operating Conditions:** Specify the environmental (temperature, humidity, vibration) and operational (voltage, current, duty cycle) conditions under which the equipment will operate.</li>
                                    <li>**Collect Data:** Gather data on component failure rates (from databases, manufacturer specifications, or historical data) or conduct reliability testing on prototype or production units. Record times to failure for individual components or the system.</li>
                                    <li>**Perform Reliability Modeling:** Use reliability block diagrams or other models to represent the system structure (series, parallel, standby redundancy) and how component failures affect system failure.</li>
                                    <li>**Calculate Reliability Metrics:** Based on the collected data and the system model, calculate key reliability metrics such as component failure rates (\(\lambda\)), Mean Time To Failure (MTTF), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and system reliability \(R(t)\) for a specified time \(t\).</li>
                                    <li>**Identify Failure Modes and Effects (FMEA):** Analyze potential ways the equipment can fail and the consequences of these failures. This helps identify critical components or single points of failure.</li>
                                    <li>**Perform Statistical Analysis:** Use statistical methods to analyze failure data, determine the failure rate distribution (e.g., exponential, Weibull), and calculate confidence intervals for reliability estimates.</li>
                                    <li>**Predict System Reliability:** Based on the component reliabilities and the system model, predict the overall reliability of the equipment.</li>
                                    <li>**Report and Document:** Document the reliability assessment process, results, assumptions, and any limitations.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>Failure rate is the number of failures per unit of operating time.</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Mean time to fail (MTTF):**</p>
                                <p>MTTF is the average time a unit is expected to function before failure. For a constant failure rate period, MTTF is the reciprocal of the failure rate.</p>
                                \[ MTTF = \frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{\text{Total Operating Time}}{\text{Number of Failures}} \]
                                \[ MTTF = \frac{400,000 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ failures}} = 80,000 \text{ hours/failure} \]
                                <p>The MTTF for the diodes is 80,000 hours.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Resistor Faults and Feedback Control System (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Two possible causes of open circuit fault in carbon composition resistors:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Physical stress:** Excessive bending or pulling of the leads where they connect to the carbon body can cause the internal connection to break.</li>
                                    <li>**Overheating:** Prolonged exposure to excessive current or temperature can degrade the carbon material or the connection between the carbon element and the end caps/leads, leading to an open circuit.</li>
                                    <li>**Corrosion:** Environmental factors like moisture and contaminants can corrode the leads or end caps, causing the connection to become intermittent or open over time.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Effect and verification of an open circuit in the feedback line of a DC motor speed control system:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 1 shows a closed-loop speed control system where the tachogenerator measures the actual motor speed and provides a feedback signal to the comparator. The comparator compares the feedback signal (representing actual speed) with the input speed reference signal (representing desired speed).</p>
                                <p>**Effect of open circuit in feedback line:**</p>
                                <p>If the feedback line from the tachogenerator opens, the comparator receives no feedback signal (or a zero signal, depending on implementation). The comparator will sense a large difference between the input speed reference (desired speed) and the feedback signal (perceived as zero). This large error signal will be amplified by the controller and power amplifier, causing the motor to receive maximum voltage and drive the motor speed to its highest possible value (limited by the power supply and motor characteristics), irrespective of the input speed reference setting. The control loop becomes effectively open, and the system loses regulation.</p>
                                <p>**How it can be verified:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Measure the voltage signal output from the tachogenerator (the signal in the feedback line). This voltage should be proportional to the actual motor speed. If the line is open, the voltage at the comparator input end of the feedback line will be zero or floating, while the tachogenerator output terminal (if measured directly) might show a voltage depending on the motor speed (if the tachogenerator itself is working).</li>
                                    <li>Alternatively, with the system running and the motor spinning at high speed, vary the input speed reference setting. If the motor speed does not change in response to changes in the reference, it indicates the feedback loop is broken or ineffective.</li>
                                    <li>Check for continuity of the feedback wiring using a multimeter (with power off).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>**Procedure:**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>**Set up Equipment:** Connect the signal generator output to the input of the audio amplifier. Connect the amplifier's output to the input of the oscilloscope. Ensure all equipment is properly grounded.</li>
                                    <li>**Configure Signal Generator:** Set the signal generator to produce a sinusoidal waveform at a suitable frequency within the amplifier's operating range (e.g., 1 kHz for audio). Set the output amplitude to a small level that is within the amplifier's linear operating range (check specifications if available, or start low and increase gradually to avoid clipping).</li>
                                    <li>**Measure Input Voltage:** Use the oscilloscope to measure the peak-to-peak or RMS voltage of the signal directly at the amplifier's input terminals. Record this value as \(V_{in}\). Adjust the oscilloscope's vertical sensitivity (Volts/Div) and horizontal timebase for a clear view of the waveform.</li>
                                    <li>**Measure Output Voltage:** Move the oscilloscope probe to the amplifier's output terminals. Measure the peak-to-peak or RMS voltage of the output signal. Record this value as \(V_{out}\). Ensure the output waveform is not distorted (clipped), which would indicate the amplifier is overloaded or faulty. If clipping occurs, reduce the input voltage.</li>
                                    <li>**Calculate Gain:** The voltage gain (\(A_v\)) is the ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage. Use consistent units (both peak-to-peak or both RMS).
                                        \[ A_v = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \]
                                        The gain can also be expressed in decibels (dB): \( A_v(dB) = 20 \log_{10} (A_v) \).</li>
                                    <li>**Repeat (Optional):** Repeat the measurement at different frequencies within the amplifier's bandwidth to assess its frequency response.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(c) Maintainability Calculations (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The probability of a system being returned to a working condition within a specified time \(t\) is a measure of its maintainability \(M(t)\). Maintainability is often modeled by an exponential function \(M(t) = 1 - e^{-t/\text{MTTR}}\) or \(M(t) = 1 - e^{-\mu t}\), where MTTR is the Mean Time To Repair, and \(\mu = 1/\text{MTTR}\) is the repair rate.</p>
                                <p>Given: Probability \(P(t) = M(t) = 86.5\% = 0.865\) within a time \(t = 4\) hours.</p>
                                <p>The formula is \( M(t) = 1 - e^{-t/\text{MTTR}} \).</p>
                                \[ 0.865 = 1 - e^{-4/\text{MTTR}} \]
                                \[ e^{-4/\text{MTTR}} = 1 - 0.865 = 0.135 \]
                                <p>Take the natural logarithm of both sides:</p>
                                \[ \ln(e^{-4/\text{MTTR}}) = \ln(0.135) \]
                                \[ -4/\text{MTTR} = \ln(0.135) \]
                                \[ -4/\text{MTTR} \approx -2.000 \]
                                \[ 4/\text{MTTR} \approx 2.000 \]
                                <p>**(i) Mean time to repair (MTTR):**</p>
                                \[ \text{MTTR} = \frac{4}{2.000} = 2.0 \, \text{hours} \]

                                <p>**(ii) Failure rate:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The question asks for "failure rate" in the context of maintainability. Failure rate (\(\lambda\)) is a measure of reliability, not maintainability. Maintainability relates to how quickly a system can be repaired *after* failure. There is no direct way to determine the failure rate (\(\lambda\)) solely from maintainability data (\(M(t)\)). The relationship is within Availability \(A = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)\) or \(A = \mu / (\mu + \lambda)\), where \(MTBF = 1/\lambda\) and \(\mu = 1/\text{MTTR}\). To find \(\lambda\), we would need either the MTBF or the Availability. Assuming the question might contain a typo and meant to ask for the *repair rate* (\(\mu\)) instead of failure rate, we can calculate the repair rate:</p>
                                \[ \text{Repair Rate } (\mu) = \frac{1}{\text{MTTR}} = \frac{1}{2.0 \, \text{hours}} = 0.5 \, \text{repairs/hour} \]
                                <div class="key-point">Assuming the question intended to ask for the repair rate, it is 0.5 repairs/hour. If it genuinely intended failure rate, the information provided is insufficient.</div>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Analyzing control system faults, testing amplifier characteristics, and quantifying maintainability through metrics like MTTR and repair rate are important aspects of electrical and electronic engineering practice.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">A moving-coil instrument measures the average value of current. To measure AC voltage, a rectifier circuit is used to convert the AC voltage into a pulsating DC voltage, which drives a current through the moving-coil meter proportional to the average value of the rectified AC voltage. A full-wave rectifier utilizes both positive and negative half-cycles of the input AC waveform.</p>
                                <p>**Description:**</p>
                                <p>The instrument consists of a series multiplier resistor (\(R_s\)), a full-wave bridge rectifier (typically four diodes), and a DC moving-coil meter. The AC voltage to be measured is applied across the series combination of \(R_s\) and the bridge rectifier circuit. The bridge rectifier converts the input AC voltage into a pulsating DC voltage across its output terminals. This pulsating DC voltage causes a unidirectional current to flow through the moving-coil meter. The deflection of the meter is proportional to the average value of this current, which in turn is proportional to the average value of the rectified AC voltage.</p>
                                <p>The scale of the instrument is typically calibrated to read the RMS value of a sine wave, based on the relationship between the average and RMS values for a pure sine wave (e.g., \(V_{RMS} \approx 1.11 V_{Avg}\) for a full-wave rectified sine wave). The multiplier resistor \(R_s\) is used to limit the current through the meter and extend the voltage range, similar to how it's used in a DC voltmeter.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Two-Wattmeter Method for 3-Phase Power (12 marks):</strong></p>

                                \[ P_1 + P_2 = V_L I_L [2 \cos 30^\circ \cos \phi] = V_L I_L [2 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos \phi] = \sqrt{3} V_L I_L \cos \phi \]
                                <p>This is the total power in a balanced 3-phase system.</p>
                                <p>For unbalanced loads, instantaneous power \( p_R = v_R i_R \), \( p_Y = v_Y i_Y \), \( p_B = v_B i_B \). Total instantaneous power \( p_{total} = p_R + p_Y + p_B \). The instantaneous power measured by W1 is \( p_1 = v_{RY} i_R \). The instantaneous power measured by W2 is \( p_2 = v_{BY} i_B \). Using Kirchhoff's Current Law at point Y (\(i_R + i_Y + i_B = 0 \implies i_Y = -(i_R + i_B)\)) and line voltage relations, it can be shown that \( p_1 + p_2 = p_R + p_Y + p_B = p_{total} \). Since the average of the sum equals the sum of the averages, \( P_1 + P_2 = P_{total} \) for both balanced and unbalanced 3-wire loads.</p>

                                        \[ \phi = \arctan(3.413) \approx 73.65^\circ \]
                                        Power factor \( \cos \phi = \cos(73.65^\circ) \approx 0.2815 \). Since \(P_2\) is negative, the power factor is lagging and less than 0.5.</li>

                                <p>Thermionic emission is the release of electrons from the surface of a heated metal. Metals have many free electrons in their conduction band. These electrons are held within the metal by a potential barrier at the surface. When the metal is heated to a sufficiently high temperature, some of the free electrons gain enough thermal energy to overcome this surface barrier (work function) and escape from the metal into the surrounding space (vacuum or gas). The higher the temperature and the lower the work function of the metal, the greater the rate of thermionic emission.</p>

                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Final anode voltage \(V_a = 2 \, kV = 2000 \, V\).</li>

                                    <li>Screen distance from center of plates \(L = 30 \, cm = 0.3 \, m\).</li>
                                    <li>Deflection voltage \(V_d = 100 \, V\).</li>
                                    <li>Electronic charge \(e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, C\) (using the value from the 2023j paper for consistency, though 1.6e-19C is common).</li>

                                <p>First, calculate the velocity (\(v_x\)) of the electrons after being accelerated by the anode voltage \(V_a\). The kinetic energy gained equals the potential energy lost: \( \frac{1}{2} m v_x^2 = e V_a \).</p>
                                \[ v_x = \sqrt{\frac{2 e V_a}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, C) \times (2000 \, V)}{9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, kg}} \]
                                \[ v_x = \sqrt{\frac{6.408 \times 10^{-16}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}} = \sqrt{0.70359 \times 10^{15}} = \sqrt{7.0359 \times 10^{14}} \]
                                \[ v_x \approx 2.6525 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m/s} \]

                                <p>While passing through the deflection plates, the electron experiences a constant electric field in the y-direction \( E_y = V_d / d \). This causes an acceleration \( a_y = \frac{e E_y}{m} = \frac{e V_d}{m d} \). The time spent between the plates is \( t_d = l_d / v_x \).</p>
                                <p>The vertical velocity gained is \( v_y = a_y t_d = \frac{e V_d}{m d} \times \frac{l_d}{v_x} \).</p>
                                <p>The vertical displacement as the electron leaves the plates is \( y_1 = \frac{1}{2} a_y t_d^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{e V_d}{m d} \left(\frac{l_d}{v_x}\right)^2 \).</p>
                                <p>After leaving the plates, the electron travels in a straight line at an angle \(\alpha\) to the horizontal, where \( \tan \alpha = v_y / v_x \). This line appears to originate from the center of the deflection plates (at \(x = l_d/2\)). The total deflection on the screen (at \(x = L + l_d/2\)) is \(Y\).</p>
                                \[ Y = \tan \alpha \times L + y_1 \]
                                <p>A simpler formula for the total deflection \(Y\) on the screen is often used, assuming \(y_1\) is negligible compared to the deflection caused by the angle \( \tan \alpha \times L \):</p>
                                \[ Y \approx \tan \alpha \times L = \frac{v_y}{v_x} \times L = \left(\frac{e V_d l_d}{m d v_x}\right) / v_x \times L = \frac{e V_d l_d L}{m d v_x^2} \]

                                \[ Y = \frac{e V_d l_d L}{m d (2 e V_a / m)} = \frac{e V_d l_d L}{2 e V_a d} = \frac{V_d l_d L}{2 V_a d} \]
                                <p>**(I) Maximum deflection, in cm:**</p>
                                <p>Using the formula for \(Y\):</p>
                                \[ Y = \frac{100 \, V \times 0.02 \, m \times 0.3 \, m}{2 \times 2000 \, V \times 0.005 \, m} = \frac{100 \times 0.02 \times 0.3}{2 \times 2000 \times 0.005} \, m \]
                                \[ Y = \frac{0.6}{20} \, m = 0.03 \, m \]
                                <p>Convert to cm: \( Y = 0.03 \, m \times 100 \, cm/m = 3 \, cm \).</p>

                                <p>**(II) Sensitivity of CRT, in \( \mathrm{mm} / \mathrm{V} \):**</p>
                                <p>Sensitivity is the deflection per unit deflection voltage (\(S = Y / V_d\)). Use the deflection in mm.</p>
                                \[ Y = 3 \, cm = 30 \, mm \]
                                \[ S = \frac{Y}{V_d} = \frac{30 \, mm}{100 \, V} = 0.3 \, \mathrm{mm/V} \]

                                <p>**(III) Deflection factor, in \( \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{mm} \):**</p>
                                <p>Deflection factor is the reciprocal of sensitivity (\(D = 1/S\)).</p>
                                \[ D = \frac{V_d}{Y} = \frac{100 \, V}{30 \, mm} = \frac{10}{3} \, \mathrm{V/mm} \approx 3.33 \, \mathrm{V/mm} \]

                                <p class="answer-intro">An NPN transistor has a P-type base between two N-type regions (Emitter and Collector). It operates in the active region when the Emitter-Base junction is forward-biased (\(V_{BE} \approx 0.7V\) for Silicon) and the Collector-Base junction is reverse-biased (\(V_{CB} > 0V\) or \(V_{CE} > V_{BE}\)).</p>
                                <p>**Operation in Active Region:** Electrons are injected from the heavily doped Emitter into the thin Base due to the forward bias. Most electrons diffuse through the Base and are swept into the Collector by the reverse bias electric field across the Collector-Base junction. A small Base current exists due to electron-hole recombination in the Base and holes injected from the Base into the Emitter. The Collector current (\(I_C\)) is controlled by the Base current (\(I_B\)) or Base-Emitter voltage (\(V_{BE}\)), where \(I_C \approx \beta I_B\).</p>

                                <p>In a self-biased circuit, the gate is grounded via \(R_G\), so \(V_G = 0V\). The source voltage is \(V_S = I_D R_S\). The gate-source voltage is \(V_{GS} = V_G - V_S = 0 - I_D R_S = -I_D R_S\). This is the equation of the bias line (or self-bias line).</p>

                                <p class="key-point">The curve is a parabola opening downwards, starting from \(I_{DSS}=8mA\) at \(V_{GS}=0V\) and reaching \(I_D=0\) at \(V_{GS}=-4V\) (the pinch-off voltage \(V_p\)).</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Construct the dc loadline:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">There are two DC load lines for this circuit: the bias line and the drain line. The question likely refers to the operating point bias line (\(V_{GS} = -I_D R_S\)) on the transfer characteristics graph.</p>
                                <p>The bias line equation is \(V_{GS} = -I_D R_S\). With \(R_S = 0.75 k\Omega\), this is \(V_{GS} = -I_D \times 0.75k\). To plot this line on the \(I_D\) vs \(V_{GS}\) graph, find two points:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If \(I_D = 0mA\), then \(V_{GS} = -0 \times 0.75k = 0V\). Point 1: (0V, 0mA).</li>
                                    <li>Choose another \(I_D\) value, say \(4mA\). \(V_{GS} = -4mA \times 0.75k\Omega = -(4 \times 10^{-3})(0.75 \times 10^3) = -3V\). Point 2: (-3V, 4mA).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Draw a straight line connecting the points (0V, 0mA) and (-3V, 4mA) on the same graph as the transfer curve. The intersection of this bias line with the transfer curve is the Q-point (\(I_{DQ}, V_{GSQ}\)). From the table and the line, the intersection appears to be at \(V_{GS} = -3V\) and \(I_D = 4mA\). Let's check this with the equation: \(I_D = 8mA(1 - V_{GS}/(-4V))^2\). If \(V_{GS} = -3V\), \(I_D = 8mA(1 - (-3)/(-4))^2 = 8mA(1 - 0.75)^2 = 8mA(0.25)^2 = 8mA \times 0.0625 = 0.5mA\). This does not match. Let's try \(V_{GS} = -2V, I_D=2mA\). \(I_D R_S = 2mA \times 0.75k\Omega = 1.5V\). \(V_{GS} = -1.5V\). So (-1.5V, 2mA) is a point on the bias line. Let's choose \(V_{GS} = -1V\). \(I_D = 4.5mA\). \(I_D R_S = 4.5mA \times 0.75k\Omega = 3.375V\). \(V_{GS} = -3.375V\). Point (-3.375V, 4.5mA). Let's choose \(V_{GS} = -2V\). \(I_D = 2mA\). \(I_D R_S = 2mA \times 0.75k\Omega = 1.5V\). \(V_{GS} = -1.5V\). Point (-1.5V, 2mA). The intersection of the bias line \(V_{GS} = -I_D R_S\) with the transfer curve is the Q-point.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Graphically, the Q-point is the intersection of the transfer curve and the bias line defined by \(V_{GS} = -I_D R_S\). The point (-3V, 4mA) given earlier was likely a mix-up. Plot the bias line \(V_{GS} = -0.75k \times I_D\) on the graph with the transfer curve. The Q-point lies at their intersection. A point on the line is (0,0). Another point is (-0.75V, 1mA), (-1.5V, 2mA), (-2.25V, 3mA), (-3V, 4mA). Plotting these on the transfer curve visually estimates the Q-point.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Using the equation \(I_D = 8mA(1 - V_{GS}/(-4V))^2\) and \(I_D = -V_{GS}/0.75k\):
                                \(I_D = 8(1 + V_{GS}/4)^2\). Substitute \(V_{GS} = -I_D R_S = -0.75 I_D\). This leads to a complex equation. It's usually solved graphically. Looking at the table and the bias line points: (-1V, 4.5mA) on curve, (-0.75V, 1mA) on line. (-2V, 2mA) on curve, (-1.5V, 2mA) on line. (-3V, 0.5mA) on curve, (-2.25V, 3mA) on line. The Q-point seems to be between \(V_{GS} = -1V\) and \(-2V\).</p>

                                </figure>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The circuit is a Zener diode shunt regulator. The Zener diode maintains a constant voltage \(V_Z\) across the load as long as the input voltage \(V_{in}\) and load resistance \(R_L\) vary within limits that keep the Zener in its breakdown region (i.e., Zener current \(I_Z\) is between \(I_{Z,min}\) and \(I_{Z,max}\)).</p>
                                <p>Given: \(V_{in} = 20V\), \(R_S = 220\Omega\). Zener diode: \(V_Z = 10V\), \(I_{Z,min} = 5mA\), \(I_{Z,max} = 50mA\). Load is variable resistor \(R_L\).</p>
                                <p>The voltage across the load \(V_L\) is regulated by the Zener diode, so \(V_L = V_Z = 10V\). The voltage across the series resistor \(R_S\) is \(V_{R_S} = V_{in} - V_L = 20V - 10V = 10V\).</p>
                                <p>The current through the series resistor \(I_S\) is constant as long as \(V_{in}\) and \(R_S\) are constant:</p>
                                \[ I_S = \frac{V_{R_S}}{R_S} = \frac{10 \, V}{220 \, \Omega} \approx 0.04545 \, A = 45.45 \, mA \]
                                <p>The current \(I_S\) splits between the Zener diode (\(I_Z\)) and the load (\(I_L\)): \(I_S = I_Z + I_L\).</p>
                                <p>For regulation to be maintained, the Zener diode must be in the breakdown region, meaning \(I_{Z,min} \leq I_Z \leq I_{Z,max}\). The load current \(I_L\) varies as \(R_L\) varies: \(I_L = V_L / R_L = 10V / R_L\).</p>

                                <p>**(i) Minimum value of \(R_L\) that the Zener will tolerate in maintaining \(V_L\) constant:**</p>
                                <p>Regulation is maintained as long as \(I_Z \geq I_{Z,min}\). Since \(I_S = I_Z + I_L\), the minimum Zener current corresponds to the maximum load current (\(I_{L,max}\)).</p>
                                \[ I_Z = I_S - I_L \]
                                <p>Minimum \(I_Z\) occurs when \(I_L\) is maximum: \( I_{Z,min} = I_S - I_{L,max} \).</p>
                                \[ I_{L,max} = I_S - I_{Z,min} = 45.45 \, mA - 5 \, mA = 40.45 \, mA \]
                                <p>The minimum load resistance \(R_{L,min}\) occurs when the load current is maximum:</p>
                                \[ R_{L,min} = \frac{V_L}{I_{L,max}} = \frac{10 \, V}{40.45 \, mA} = \frac{10 \, V}{40.45 \times 10^{-3} \, A} \approx 247.22 \, \Omega \]

                                <p>**(ii) Minimum value of load current:**</p>
                                <p>The minimum load current (\(I_{L,min}\)) corresponds to the condition where the Zener current is at its maximum (\(I_{Z,max}\)). However, the calculated \(I_S\) (45.45mA) is less than \(I_{Z,max}\) (50mA). This means the series resistor \(R_S\) limits the total current to a value below the Zener's maximum rating. Therefore, the Zener current will never reach \(I_{Z,max}\) in this circuit, even when the load current is minimum (i.e., load is open circuit, \(I_L = 0\)).</p>
                                <p>Regulation is maintained as long as \(I_Z \ge I_{Z,min}\). When \(I_L\) is at its minimum possible value (0A for an open circuit), \(I_Z = I_S = 45.45mA\). Since \(5mA \le 45.45mA \le 50mA\), regulation is maintained even with the load removed.</p>
                                <p>The minimum value of load current for which regulation is maintained is when \(I_Z\) is maximum. But since \(I_S\) is the maximum possible Zener current (\(I_S < I_{Z,max}\)), the lowest load current is when Zener takes all \(I_S\) except \(I_{Z,min}\).
                                The *range* of load current for regulation is from \(I_S - I_{Z,max}\) to \(I_S - I_{Z,min}\).
                                \(I_{L,min} = I_S - I_{Z,max} = 45.45mA - 50mA = -4.55mA\). This negative value implies that the Zener *could* handle even more current if \(I_S\) was higher.
                                The *actual* minimum load current is when \(I_Z\) is just above \(I_{Z,min}\), which means \(I_L\) is just below \(I_{L,max}\). The theoretical minimum load current is 0A (open circuit load). Since \(I_S = 45.45mA\) is between \(I_{Z,min}=5mA\) and \(I_{Z,max}=50mA\), the Zener stays in breakdown even with no load. Thus, the minimum load current for which regulation holds is 0A.</p>
                                \[ I_{L,min} = 0 \, A \]

                                <p>**(iii) Maximum value of load current:**</p>
                                <p>The maximum value of load current (\(I_{L,max}\)) occurs when the Zener current is at its minimum (\(I_{Z,min}\)).</p>
                                \[ I_{L,max} = I_S - I_{Z,min} = 45.45 \, mA - 5 \, mA = 40.45 \, mA \]

                                <p>Summary of Zener Regulator Calculations:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) minimum value of \(R_L\):** \( R_{L,min} \approx 247.22 \, \Omega \) (This occurs at max load current)</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) minimum value of load current:** \( I_{L,min} = 0 \, A \) (Regulation holds down to no load)</li>
