                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers fundamental concepts of measurement standards, units, and dimensional analysis.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Measurement Standards (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Describe "standard" with respect to measurements:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A standard, in the context of measurements, is a reference quantity used to define, realize, or reproduce a unit of a physical quantity. It serves as a basis for comparison in the measurement process. Standards ensure that measurements are consistent, accurate, and comparable globally.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Distinguish between primary and secondary standards:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Primary standards:** These are standards of the highest metrological quality. Their values are established directly from the fundamental definitions of the units or by comparison with international standards. They are maintained at national standards laboratories and are not used for routine measurements. They are used to calibrate secondary standards.</li>
                                    <li>**Secondary standards:** These are high-precision standards calibrated directly or indirectly against primary standards. They are also maintained by national standards laboratories or accredited calibration laboratories. They are used to calibrate working standards.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Dimensional equation for magnetic flux density using LMTI system (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The LMTI system uses Length (L), Mass (M), Time (T), and Electric Current (I) as fundamental dimensions. Magnetic flux density (B) can be dimensionally derived from the force experienced by a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field: \(F = BI l\), where F is force, B is magnetic flux density, I is current, and l is the length of the conductor perpendicular to the field.</p>
                                <p>Rearrange the formula to solve for B: \( B = \frac{F}{I l} \).</p>
                                <p>Force (F) has dimensions \([MLT^{-2}]\).</p>

                                <p>Length (l) has dimensions \([L]\).</p>
                                <p>Substitute these dimensions into the expression for B:</p>
                                \[ [B] = \frac{[F]}{[I][l]} \]
                                \[ [B] = \frac{[MLT^{-2}]}{[I][L]} \]
                                \[ [B] = [M L^{1-1} T^{-2} I^{-1}] \]
                                \[ [B] = [MT^{-2}I^{-1}] \]
                                <p>The dimensional equation for magnetic flux density in the LMTI system is \( [MT^{-2}I^{-1}] \).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Derived units and dimensional equation for momentum (7 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Derived units for quantities:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Derived units are combinations of fundamental units.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**I. Density:** Density is mass per unit volume (\(\rho = m/V\)). The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg), and the SI unit of volume is cubic meter (m³).
                                        <br>Derived unit: kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³).</li>
                                    <li>**II. Electric field strength:** Electric field strength is force per unit charge (\(E = F/Q\)). The SI unit of force is Newton (N), and the SI unit of charge is Coulomb (C).
                                        <br>Derived unit: Newtons per Coulomb (N/C).
                                        <br>Alternatively, electric field strength is also voltage per unit distance (\(E = V/d\)). The SI unit of voltage is Volt (V), and the SI unit of distance is meter (m).
                                        <br>Derived unit: Volts per meter (V/m).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Derive the dimensional equation for momentum:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Momentum (p) is defined as the product of mass (m) and velocity (v): \(p = mv\).</p>
                                <p>Mass (m) has dimensions \([M]\).</p>
                                <p>Velocity (v) is distance per unit time, so its dimensions are \([LT^{-1}]\).</p>
                                <p>Substitute these dimensions into the expression for momentum:</p>
                                \[ [p] = [m] \times [v] \]
                                \[ [p] = [M] \times [LT^{-1}] \]
                                \[ [p] = [MLT^{-1}] \]
                                <p>The dimensional equation for momentum is \( [MLT^{-1}] \).</p>

                                <p>**Description:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Input Signal:** The AC or pulse signal whose frequency is to be measured is applied to the input.</li>
                                    <li>**Amplifier/Shaper (Schmitt Trigger):** This stage amplifies the input signal (if necessary) and converts it into a clean train of sharp pulses (typically square waves or logic pulses). Each pulse corresponds to one cycle of the input signal.</li>
                                    <li>**Main Gate:** An electronic switch (usually a logic gate, like an AND gate) that controls the flow of pulses from the shaper to the counter. It is enabled (opened) for a precise, predetermined time interval by the gate control unit.</li>
                                    <li>**Gate Control Unit:** Generates timing signals that open and close the main gate for an accurate duration (the gate time, e.g., 1 ms, 10 ms, 100 ms, 1 s). This unit uses a high-stability crystal oscillator and frequency dividers to produce the required gate time intervals.</li>
                                    <li>**Decade Counters:** A series of interconnected electronic counters (typically decimal or BCD counters) that count the number of pulses that pass through the main gate during the gate time. Each counter stage represents a digit.</li>
                                    <li>**Decoder & Display Drivers:** Converts the digital count from the counters into a format suitable for the digital display. The display drivers illuminate the segments or pixels of the digital display.</li>
                                    <li>**Digital Display:** Shows the final count as a numerical value, which represents the frequency (e.g., if 1000 pulses are counted in 1 ms, the frequency is 1000 pulses/ms = 1,000,000 pulses/s = 1 MHz).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The process starts with resetting the counters to zero. The gate control unit opens the main gate for a precise time. Input pulses pass through the gate and are counted. After the gate time expires, the gate control unit closes the gate, stopping the count. The final count held in the counters is transferred to the display, and the unit prepares for the next measurement cycle.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Moving Coil Instrument Range Extension (5 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">To extend the range of a moving coil instrument, a shunt resistor is used for ammeter ranges (parallel connection) and a multiplier resistor is used for voltmeter ranges (series connection).</p>
                                <p>Given: Coil resistance \(R_m = 5 \, \Omega\). FSD current \(I_m = 15 \, mA = 15 \times 10^{-3} \, A\).</p>
                                <p>Calculate the voltage across the meter at FSD: \( V_m = I_m R_m = (15 \times 10^{-3} \, A) \times (5 \, \Omega) = 75 \times 10^{-3} \, V = 75 \, mV \).</p>

                                <p>**(i) Parallel resistance (Shunt) for 1 A range:**</p>
                                <p>Desired current range \(I = 1 \, A\). Current through shunt \(I_{sh} = I - I_m = 1 \, A - 15 \times 10^{-3} \, A = 1 - 0.015 = 0.985 \, A\).
                                At FSD, the voltage across the shunt equals the voltage across the meter: \(I_{sh} R_{sh} = I_m R_m\).</p>
                                \[ R_{sh} = \frac{I_m R_m}{I_{sh}} = \frac{V_m}{I - I_m} \]
                                \[ R_{sh} = \frac{75 \times 10^{-3} \, V}{1 \, A - 15 \times 10^{-3} \, A} = \frac{0.075}{0.985} \, \Omega \approx 0.07614 \, \Omega \]
                                <p>A shunt resistor of approximately \(0.07614 \, \Omega\) is needed in parallel.</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Series resistance (Multiplier) for 15 V range:**</p>
                                <p>Desired voltage range \(V = 15 \, V\). Current through the meter and multiplier at FSD is \(I_m = 15 \, mA\).
                                Total resistance \( R_{total} = R_m + R_{mult} \). By Ohm's Law \( V = I_m R_{total} \).</p>
                                \[ 15 \, V = (15 \times 10^{-3} \, A) \times (5 \, \Omega + R_{mult}) \]
                                \[ \frac{15}{15 \times 10^{-3}} = 5 + R_{mult} \]
                                \[ 1000 = 5 + R_{mult} \]
                                \[ R_{mult} = 1000 - 5 = 995 \, \Omega \]
                                <p>A multiplier resistor of \(995 \, \Omega\) is needed in series.</p>

                                        \[ R_X(1000) = e^{-1000/20000} = e^{-1/20} = e^{-0.05} \approx 0.9512 \]

                                    <li>Unreliability of Unit X: \( U_X(t) = 1 - R_X(t) \)
                                        \[ U_X(1000) = 1 - 0.9512 = 0.0488 \]

                                <p>**(iii) Probability of failure of the system for 1,000 hours:**</p>
                                <p>For a parallel system, the system fails only if both units X and Y fail. Assuming the failures of X and Y are independent events, the probability of system failure (unreliability \(U_{system}\)) is the product of the individual unreliabilities.</p>
                                \[ U_{system}(t) = U_X(t) \times U_Y(t) \]
                                \[ U_{system}(1000) = U_X(1000) \times U_Y(1000) \approx 0.0488 \times 0.0100 \]
                                \[ U_{system}(1000) \approx 0.000488 \]

                                <p>**(iv) System reliability for 1,000 hours:**</p>
                                <p>System reliability \(R_{system}(t)\) is \( 1 - U_{system}(t) \).</p>
                                \[ R_{system}(1000) = 1 - U_{system}(1000) \approx 1 - 0.000488 \]
                                \[ R_{system}(1000) \approx 0.999512 \]
                                <p>Alternatively, system reliability for parallel units can be calculated as \( R_{system}(t) = 1 - (1 - R_X(t))(1 - R_Y(t)) \).
                                \[ R_{system}(1000) = 1 - (1 - 0.9512)(1 - 0.9900) = 1 - (0.0488)(0.0100) \]
                                \[ R_{system}(1000) = 1 - 0.000488 = 0.999512 \]

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Connecting units in parallel significantly increases system reliability compared to individual unit reliabilities, especially if individual unit reliabilities are high.</p>

                                <p>**(i) Three activities during routine maintenance:**</p>
                                <ul>

                                <p>**(ii) Explain preventive maintenance:**</p>
                                <p>Preventive maintenance is a type of planned maintenance performed at predetermined intervals or according to specified criteria (e.g., time-based, usage-based) while the equipment is still functioning normally. The goal is to prevent future failures or performance degradation by identifying and addressing potential issues early on, or by replacing components before they reach the end of their expected lifespan. Examples include scheduled inspections, cleaning, lubrication, adjustments, and periodic replacement of wear-prone parts like filters, belts, or batteries.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Convergent and Divergent Systems (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">These terms describe how signals or processes flow through a system.</p>
                                <p>Divergent System:</p>

                                <p>**Description:** In a divergent system, a single input branches out to produce multiple outputs or feed multiple subsequent stages. Information or energy flows from one point outward to several points. Example: A power supply distributing power to multiple circuits, a single sensor feeding data to several monitoring systems.</p>

                                <p>**Description:** In a convergent system, multiple inputs are combined or processed to produce a single output. Information or energy flows from several points inward to a single point. Example: An audio mixer combining signals from multiple microphones into a single output, a control system receiving feedback from multiple sensors to adjust a single actuator, a logic gate combining multiple inputs to produce one output.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">Given information about an equipment's failure rate and average repair time.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Failure rate \( \lambda = 0.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{failures/hour} \).</li>
                                    <li>Average time to repair (MTTR) = 2.5 hours.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>**(i) repair rate:**</p>
                                <p>The repair rate (\(\mu\)) is the reciprocal of the Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).</p>
                                \[ \mu = \frac{1}{MTTR} = \frac{1}{2.5 \, \text{hours}} = 0.4 \, \text{repairs/hour} \]

                                <p>**(ii) mean time between failure:**</p>
                                <p>MTBF is the reciprocal of the failure rate (\(\lambda\)), assuming a constant failure rate.</p>
                                \[ MTBF = \frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{0.5 \times 10^{-3}} \, \text{hours/failure} = \frac{1}{0.0005} \, \text{hours/failure} = 2000 \, \text{hours/failure} \]

                                <p>**(iii) availability:**</p>
                                <p>Availability (\(A\)) is the long-term probability that the equipment is operational. \( A = \frac{MTBF}{MTBF + MTTR} \).</p>
                                \[ A = \frac{2000 \, \text{hours}}{2000 \, \text{hours} + 2.5 \, \text{hours}} = \frac{2000}{2002.5} \]
                                \[ A \approx 0.99875 \]

                                <p>**(iv) maintainability for a time of 6 hours:**</p>
                                <p>Maintainability \(M(t)\) is the probability that a failed equipment is repaired within time \(t\). Assuming exponential repair times, \(M(t) = 1 - e^{-t/\text{MTTR}}\) or \(M(t) = 1 - e^{-\mu t}\).</p>
                                <p>Here, \(t = 6\) hours and \(MTTR = 2.5\) hours (\(\mu = 0.4\) repairs/hour).</p>
                                \[ M(6) = 1 - e^{-6 \, \text{hours} / 2.5 \, \text{hours}} = 1 - e^{-2.4} \]
                                \[ M(6) \approx 1 - 0.09072 \]
                                \[ M(6) \approx 0.90928 \]

                                    <li>**I. Tweezers:** Small pincer-like tools used for picking up, holding, and positioning small components (like surface-mount devices), wires, or other delicate items in electronic assembly, repair, or handling.</li>
                                    <li>**II. Solder sucker (Desoldering pump):** A tool used to remove molten solder from a solder joint by creating a vacuum. Essential for desoldering components from a PCB or cleaning up excess solder.</li>
                                    <li>**III. Crimping tool:** A tool used to join a connector to the end of a wire by deforming (crimping) the connector around the wire. This creates a secure electrical and mechanical connection without soldering. Used for making wire terminals or attaching connectors to cables.</li>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>Ensure the resistor is disconnected from the circuit and power is removed. Resistance measurements should ideally be performed on components isolated from the rest of the circuit to avoid measuring parallel paths.</li>
                                    <li>Set the digital multimeter to the resistance measurement function (\(\Omega\)). Select an appropriate range (if manual ranging) that is higher than the expected resistance value. Most DMMs have auto-ranging.</li>
                                    <li>Touch the probes of the multimeter firmly to the two leads of the resistor.</li>
                                    <li>Read the resistance value displayed on the DMM screen. Compare this reading to the resistor's marked value (using color codes or markings, considering tolerance).</li>
                                    <li>A resistor is considered good if the measured value is within its specified tolerance range of the marked value. An open resistor will show a very high or "OL" (Over Limit) reading. A shorted resistor will show a very low resistance, close to 0 \(\Omega\) (this is rare for standard resistors unless physically damaged or burnt).</li>

Possible causes: drying out of the electrolyte (common with age and high temperature), corrosion of leads, internal fuse activation (some types), physical damage.

                                <p><strong>(c) Oscilloscope Voltage Measurement (7 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">An oscilloscope displays voltage on its vertical axis. The vertical sensitivity setting determines how many volts are represented by each division on the screen's vertical graticule.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Peak height of sinusoidal waveform displayed = 3 cm.</li>
                                    <li>Vertical sensitivity = \(20 \, \mathrm{V/cm}\).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The peak height measured is from the center (zero axis) to the peak of the waveform. This represents the peak voltage (\(V_{peak}\)).</p>
                                \[ V_{peak} = \text{Peak height (in cm)} \times \text{Vertical Sensitivity (V/cm)} \]
                                \[ V_{peak} = 3 \, \mathrm{cm} \times 20 \, \mathrm{V/cm} = 60 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>For a sinusoidal waveform, the RMS value (\(V_{rms}\)) is related to the peak value by \( V_{rms} = \frac{V_{peak}}{\sqrt{2}} \).</p>
                                \[ V_{rms} = \frac{60 \, V}{\sqrt{2}} \approx \frac{60}{1.4142} \, V \approx 42.426 \, V \]
                                <p>The RMS value of the voltage is approximately 42.426 V.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers fundamental semiconductor concepts (holes, band gap, doping), avalanche breakdown, atomic structure, and diode characteristics from tabulated data.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Semiconductor Definitions and Avalanche Breakdown (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Definitions with respect to semiconductors:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**I. Hole:** A vacancy or absence of an electron in a covalent bond within the crystal structure of a semiconductor. It behaves as if it were a positive charge carrier with a mobility. Holes are the majority carriers in p-type semiconductors and minority carriers in n-type semiconductors.</li>
                                    <li>**II. Forbidden gap:** The range of energy levels that electrons cannot occupy in a solid material according to quantum mechanics. It is the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. The size of the forbidden gap (\(E_g\)) determines whether a material is a conductor, semiconductor, or insulator.</li>
                                    <li>**III. Dour atom:** This term is likely a typo in the OCR. Based on the context of doping semiconductors (making them extrinsic), the intended term is probably **Donor atom**. A donor atom is an impurity atom added to an intrinsic semiconductor that has one or more valence electrons more than the semiconductor atom (e.g., a pentavalent impurity in silicon). These extra electrons are loosely bound and become free electrons, contributing to conduction.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Explain avalanche breakdown with respect to p-n junctions (6 marks):**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Avalanche breakdown is a mechanism of conduction that can occur in a reverse-biased p-n junction when the reverse voltage becomes sufficiently high (at or above the breakdown voltage \(V_{BR}\)).</p>
                                <p>**Explanation:** When a reverse bias voltage is applied, a strong electric field exists across the depletion region. Minority carriers (electrons on the p-side, holes on the n-side) that are thermally generated are accelerated by this field. As they gain energy, they collide with atoms in the crystal lattice. If the energy gained is sufficient, these collisions can break covalent bonds, generating new electron-hole pairs (impact ionization). The newly created carriers are also accelerated by the field and cause further impact ionization collisions, leading to a cumulative multiplication effect (avalanche effect). When the reverse voltage reaches \(V_{BR}\), the avalanche process becomes self-sustaining, causing a rapid and significant increase in the reverse current.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Structure of an Atom with Diagram (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The basic structure of an atom, according to the Bohr model, consists of a nucleus at the center containing protons and neutrons, and electrons orbiting the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells.</p>

                                <p>**Explanation:** An atom consists of a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus at its core, containing protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge). Negatively charged electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, quantized energy shells or levels. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. The electrons in the outermost shell are called valence electrons and are involved in chemical bonding and electrical conduction in materials.</p>

The current increases slowly initially and then more rapidly as the voltage increases above a certain point (which would be the knee voltage if more data were provided beyond 0.5V).</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Determine the forward resistance of the diode:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Forward resistance of a diode can be defined in two ways: DC or Static resistance, and AC or Dynamic resistance.</p>
                                <p>**DC (Static) Resistance (\(R_{DC}\)):** The ratio of the voltage across the diode to the current through it at a specific operating point (\(R_{DC} = V_D / I_D\)). This resistance changes with the operating point.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>At \(V_D = 0.1V, I_D = 0.25mA\): \( R_{DC, 0.1V} = \frac{0.1V}{0.25mA} = \frac{0.1}{0.25 \times 10^{-3}}\Omega = 400 \, \Omega \).</li>
                                    <li>At \(V_D = 0.5V, I_D = 8.0mA\): \( R_{DC, 0.5V} = \frac{0.5V}{8.0mA} = \frac{0.5}{8.0 \times 10^{-3}}\Omega = 62.5 \, \Omega \).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**AC (Dynamic) Resistance (\(r_d\)):** The reciprocal of the slope of the V-I characteristic curve at a specific operating point (\( r_d = \frac{\Delta V_D}{\Delta I_D} \)).</p>
                                <p>Let's calculate the dynamic resistance between two points, e.g., between (0.4V, 3.0mA) and (0.5V, 8.0mA):</p>
                                \[ r_d = \frac{0.5 \, V - 0.4 \, V}{8.0 \, mA - 3.0 \, mA} = \frac{0.1 \, V}{5.0 \, mA} = \frac{0.1}{5.0 \times 10^{-3}} \, \Omega = 20 \, \Omega \]
                                <p>The forward resistance can vary depending on how it's defined (DC or AC) and the operating point. Since the question asks for "the" forward resistance, it might imply the dynamic resistance around the higher current region or the average dynamic resistance over the range.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's calculate the dynamic resistance at the highest current point if possible, or between the last two points, as this is often the most relevant for amplifier analysis. Using points (0.4V, 3mA) and (0.5V, 8mA), \(r_d = 20 \, \Omega\). Using points (0.3V, 1mA) and (0.4V, 3mA), \(r_d = \frac{0.4-0.3}{3-1} = \frac{0.1}{2mA} = 50 \, \Omega\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Given the data points cover the region where current starts increasing rapidly, the dynamic resistance is likely intended. Let's state the dynamic resistance calculated from the steepest part of the curve (highest voltages/currents).</p>
                                <p>Dynamic resistance using (0.4V, 3.0mA) and (0.5V, 8.0mA) is \(20 \, \Omega\).</p>

                                <p>Horizontal velocity (\(v_x\)) after acceleration by \(V_a\): \( \frac{1}{2} m v_x^2 = e V_a \).</p>
                                \[ v_x = \sqrt{\frac{2 e V_a}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C) \times (2500 \, V)}{9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, kg}} \]
                                \[ v_x = \sqrt{\frac{8 \times 10^{-16}}{9.1 \times 10^{-31}}} = \sqrt{0.87912 \times 10^{15}} = \sqrt{8.7912 \times 10^{14}} \]
                                \[ v_x \approx 2.965 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m/s} \]

                                <p>Sensitivity (\(S\)) is the deflection per unit deflection voltage (\(S = Y / V_d\)). Express in mm/V.</p>
                                \[ Y = 4.125 \, cm = 41.25 \, mm \]
                                \[ S = \frac{41.25 \, mm}{150 \, V} = 0.275 \, \mathrm{mm/V} \]

                                <p>**(iv) Deflection factor of the tube:**</p>
                                <p>Deflection factor (\(D\)) is the reciprocal of sensitivity (\(D = 1/S\)). Express in V/mm.</p>

                                <p>**Description:** The circuit uses four diodes arranged in a bridge configuration. The AC input voltage is applied to one set of opposite corners of the bridge. The pulsating DC output is taken from the other set of opposite corners.</p>

                                <p>In both half-cycles, current flows through the load in the same direction, resulting in a full-wave rectified output voltage across the load. The output voltage waveform is the absolute value of the input voltage waveform.</p>

                                    <li>**Forward Bias (\(V_d > 0\)):** When a positive voltage is applied above the knee voltage \(V_K\) (\(\approx 0.7V\) for silicon, \(\approx 0.3V\) for germanium), the diode conducts current easily, and the current increases exponentially with voltage.

                                    <li>**Reverse Bias (\(V_d < 0\)):** When a negative voltage is applied, the diode conducts only a very small reverse saturation current (\(I_S\)). This current is nearly constant until the reverse breakdown voltage \(V_{BR}\) is reached.</li>
                                    <li>**Reverse Breakdown (\(V_d \le V_{BR}\)):** When the reverse voltage reaches or exceeds \(V_{BR}\), the diode conducts current heavily in the reverse direction due to avalanche or Zener breakdown.

                                <p><strong>(d) Intrinsic Semiconductor Calculation (11 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">An intrinsic semiconductor has equal concentrations of electrons and holes due to thermal generation. When a voltage is applied, both contribute to the current (drift current).</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Number of mobile electrons passing a point in 1 second = \(10^{13}\).</li>
                                    <li>DC supply voltage \(V = 12 \, V\).</li>
                                    <li>Electronic charge \(e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C\).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>In an intrinsic semiconductor, the number of mobile holes is equal to the number of mobile electrons. So, \(10^{13}\) mobile holes also pass through the point in 1 second (in the opposite direction of electrons, but contributing to current in the same conventional direction as positive charges).</p>

                                <p>**(i) current in the material:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The current is the total charge passing a point per unit time. The total charge is the sum of the charge carried by electrons and the charge carried by holes. Both electron and hole motion contribute to the current in the same conventional direction.</p>
                                <p>Charge carried by electrons per second = (Number of electrons per second) \(\times\) (charge per electron)</p>
                                \[ Q_e / s = (10^{13} \, \text{electrons/s}) \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C/electron}) = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C/s} \]
                                <p>Charge carried by holes per second = (Number of holes per second) \(\times\) (charge per hole)</p>
                                \[ Q_h / s = (10^{13} \, \text{holes/s}) \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C/hole}) = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C/s} \]
                                <p>Total current \( I = (Q_e/s) + (Q_h/s) \). Assuming "mobile electrons passing through a given point in 1 second" implies only the electron count, and we need to account for holes as well.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">If "mobile electrons passing through a given point in 1 second" refers to the *total* current in terms of electron flow equivalent, then \(Q_{total}/s = 10^{13} \times e\). However, in intrinsic semiconductors, both carriers contribute. Let's assume \(10^{13}\) electrons passing a point per second is *the number of mobile electrons*. Since it's intrinsic, there are also \(10^{13}\) holes passing per second.</p>
                                <p>Current due to electrons \( I_e = (10^{13}) \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19}) = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} \, A \).
                                Current due to holes \( I_h = (10^{13}) \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19}) = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} \, A \).
                                Total current \(I = I_e + I_h = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} + 1.6 \times 10^{-6} = 3.2 \times 10^{-6} \, A = 3.2 \, \mu A\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">However, the phrasing "passing through a given point" usually refers to net flow, which constitutes the current. If \(10^{13}\) electrons are the *net* electrons crossing a plane per second due to drift, then the current is \(10^{13} \times e\). Let's assume "mobile electrons passing through a given point in 1 second" directly gives us the electron current magnitude.</p>
                                <p>Electron current magnitude \( I_e = 10^{13} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} \, A \).
                                In intrinsic semiconductors under an electric field, the electron drift current is typically equal to the hole drift current (\(I_e = I_h\)) IF the electron mobility equals the hole mobility (\(\mu_n = \mu_p\)). This is not generally true (e.g., \(\mu_n > \mu_p\) in Si and Ge). However, the number of mobile carriers generated is equal (\(n=p\)). The total current \(I = I_e + I_h\), where \(I_e = n e \mu_n E A\) and \(I_h = p e \mu_p E A\). Since \(n=p\), \(I = n e E A (\mu_n + \mu_p)\). The number \(10^{13}\) is likely the number of electrons *or* holes generated, not necessarily the number passing a point per second. The number passing a point per second depends on their velocity and concentration.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Given the simplicity of the problem, the most plausible interpretation is that the number \(10^{13}\) refers to the *rate of flow* of *one type* of carrier (electrons) contributing to the current. And in intrinsic materials, the contribution from holes is also significant. A simpler interpretation could be that the *total* number of carriers crossing the point *per second* is \(10^{13}\), and half are electrons, half are holes. Or that \(10^{13}\) electrons are the electron current equivalent, and there's also a hole current.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the simplest interpretation that the *total charge* passing per second is due to \(10^{13}\) units of electronic charge, carried by both electrons and holes, such that the net effect is equivalent to \(10^{13}\) elementary charges per second. Then \(I = 10^{13} \times e\). This seems less likely given the distinction between electrons and holes.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume "mobile electrons passing through a given point in 1 second" means the electron current magnitude is \(10^{13} \times e\), and the hole current also exists. Without mobility info, assume \(I_e \approx I_h\), or \(10^{13}\) is the *total* number of carriers passing per second. Let's assume the most direct interpretation: the number of electrons is \(10^{13}\) per second. And since it's intrinsic, the number of holes is also \(10^{13}\) per second. Total current is sum of currents.</p>
                                <p>Let's assume the question intends that the number of electrons *contributing to current* per second is \(10^{13}\), and the number of holes *contributing to current* per second is also \(10^{13}\).
                                Charge per second = (Number of electrons per sec) \(\times\) e + (Number of holes per sec) \(\times\) e
                                \[ I = (10^{13} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}) + (10^{13} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}) \]
                                \[ I = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} + 1.6 \times 10^{-6} = 3.2 \times 10^{-6} \, A = 3.2 \, \mu A \]
                                <p>However, if the resistance (2 k\(\Omega\)) and voltage (12V) are given, the current *should* be calculable from Ohm's law: \( I = V/R = 12V / 2k\Omega = 12V / 2000\Omega = 0.006A = 6mA \). This contradicts the current calculated from the number of carriers (\(3.2 \, \mu A\)).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">There seems to be inconsistent information in the question (carrier count implies ~3.2 µA, V and R imply 6 mA). Let's assume the voltage and resistance are the intended data to calculate the current, and the carrier count is either illustrative or related in a way not obvious from the problem statement alone (e.g., related to generation rate, not net flow rate). Let's use Ohm's Law.</p>
                                \[ I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{12 \, V}{2 \, k\Omega} = \frac{12}{2000} \, A = 0.006 \, A = 6 \, mA \]

                                <p>**(ii) power dissipated.**</p>
                                <p>Power dissipated in the material is \(P = V \times I\).</p>
                                \[ P = 12 \, V \times 6 \, mA = 12 \, V \times 6 \times 10^{-3} \, A \]
                                \[ P = 72 \times 10^{-3} \, W = 72 \, mW \]

                                <p>**(iii) V It**</p>
                                <p class="key-point">"V It" is likely a typo or fragment. It looks like a formula for energy (Voltage x Current x Time). Without a specified time, we cannot calculate energy. Assuming it's related to part (d) and asking for the energy dissipated in some time (e.g., 1 second, or the time related to carrier flow), let's calculate energy dissipated in 1 second (carrier count time).</p>
                                <p>Energy in 1 second = \(P \times t = 72 \, mW \times 1 \, s = 72 \, mJ\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Given the options in previous questions (e.g., Q6c(ii) July 2019 asks for energy expended if current is maintained for 30ms), it's highly likely "V It" is a fragmented question about energy for a specified time, but the time is missing. I will state the power and note the ambiguity.</p>
                                <p>Power dissipated is \(72 \, mW\).</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">This question covers semiconductor fundamentals, atomic structure, diode characteristics, and calculations for current and power, but contains inconsistencies in the provided data and fragmented text.</p>
