                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers fundamental concepts in electrical measurements, including resolution, dimensions, unit systems (specifically c.g.s electrostatic), SI units, and dimensional analysis for mechanical quantities.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Measurement Definitions (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Resolution:** The smallest change in the measured quantity that an instrument can detect and indicate reliably. It is the level of detail an instrument can provide.</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Dimensions:** In physics, dimensions refer to the physical nature of a quantity and the type of units used to measure it (e.g., length, mass, time, electric current). Dimensional analysis expresses physical quantities in terms of these fundamental dimensions.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Dimensional equation for capacitance in c.g.s electrostatic units (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">In the c.g.s. electrostatic system (esu), units are based on the centimeter (L), gram (M), and second (T). Electrical quantities are defined via Coulomb's law, where the permittivity of vacuum (\(\epsilon_0\)) is dimensionless and set to 1. Charge (Q) is derived from force.</p>
                                <p>Capacitance (C) is defined as the ratio of charge (Q) stored on a conductor to the potential difference (V) across it: \(C = Q/V\).</p>
                                <p>Potential difference (V) is energy (W) per unit charge (Q): \(V = W/Q\). So, \( C = Q / (W/Q) = Q^2 / W \).</p>
                                <p>Energy (Work, W) has dimensions \([ML^2T^{-2}]\).</p>
                                <p>We need the dimensions of charge (Q) in esu. From Coulomb's law, \(F = \frac{Q^2}{r^2}\) (in esu, the constant is 1). Force \(F\) has dimensions \([MLT^{-2}]\), distance \(r\) has dimensions \([L]\).</p>
                                \[ F = \frac{Q^2}{L^2} \implies Q^2 = F \times L^2 \]
                                \[ [Q^2]_{esu} = [MLT^{-2}] [L^2] = [ML^3T^{-2}] \]
                                \[ [Q]_{esu} = [M^{1/2}L^{3/2}T^{-1}] \]
                                <p>Now substitute \([Q^2]_{esu}\) and \([W]\) into the expression for \(C\):</p>
                                \[ [C]_{esu} = \frac{[Q^2]_{esu}}{[W]} = \frac{[ML^3T^{-2}]}{[ML^2T^{-2}]} \]
                                \[ [C]_{esu} = [M^{1-1} L^{3-2} T^{-2-(-2)}] \]
                                \[ [C]_{esu} = [L] \]
                                <p>The dimensional equation for capacitance in c.g.s. electrostatic units is \( [L] \). This means capacitance has the dimensions of length in the ESU system.</p>

                                    <li>**I. Momentum (p):** The product of mass (m) and velocity (v).
                                        \[ p = mv \]

                                    <li>**II. Torque (\(\tau\)):** A measure of how much a force acting on an object causes that object to rotate about a pivot. It is the product of the force (F) and the perpendicular distance (r) from the pivot to the line of action of the force.
                                        \[ \tau = F \times r \]
                                        (or \( \tau = I \alpha \) where I is moment of inertia and \(\alpha\) is angular acceleration).</li>
                                    <li>**III. Stiffness (k):** A measure of the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an applied force. For a spring, it is the ratio of the force (F) applied to the resulting displacement (\(\Delta x\)).
                                        \[ k = \frac{F}{\Delta x} \]
                                        (or \( k = -\frac{F}{\Delta x} \) in Hooke's Law).</li>

                                <p>**Description:** The current to be measured (\(I\)) passes through a heating element, causing it to heat up (\(P = I^2 R_{heater}\)). A thermocouple, consisting of two dissimilar metals (e.g., copper and constantan), has one junction (the hot junction) placed in close thermal contact with the heating element. The other junction(s) (cold junctions) are typically located at the terminals where the thermocouple connects to a sensitive DC moving-coil meter. The temperature difference between the hot and cold junctions generates a small DC voltage (thermo-electric e.m.f.) proportional to the temperature difference. This DC voltage is applied to the DC moving-coil meter, causing a deflection. Since the heating effect is proportional to \(I^2\), the deflection is proportional to the RMS value of the input current. The scale is calibrated to read current directly.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Ammeter-Voltmeter Resistance Measurement Error Analysis (Figure 1) (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 1 shows the voltmeter-across-R configuration. The ammeter measures the total current \(I_m\), and the voltmeter measures the voltage \(V_m\) across the resistor R.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ammeter reads \(I_m = 10 \, A\) on a 100 A range.</li>
                                    <li>Voltmeter reads \(V_m = 125 \, V\) on a 150 V range.</li>
                                    <li>Ammeter constructional error: \( \pm 0.3\% \) of 100 A FS.</li>
                                    <li>Voltmeter constructional error: \( \pm 0.4\% \) of 150 V FS.</li>
                                    <li>Ammeter internal resistance \(R_A = 0.25 \, \Omega\).</li>
                                    <li>Voltmeter internal resistance \(R_V\). Sensitivity is not given, but the reading and range are. Let's assume accuracy implies internal resistance based on other similar problems (e.g., Q1c July 2017, Q2c Nov 2015), but \(R_V\) is given as \(2000 \Omega\) in some papers (Q2c Nov 2022). Here, \(R_V\) is not given, but is needed to determine the true current through R. Let's assume the diagram labeling for \(R_A\) and \(R_V\) implies they are known parameters for the meters. Let's assume \(R_V\) is needed but missing from the text description. Let's check Figure 1 again. Figure 1 *shows* \(R_A\) and \(R_V\) in the diagram. Let's take values from the diagram if labeled there, or assume they are implied to be used from the text if stated as "internal resistance are...". The text only states \(R_A = 0.25\Omega\). It doesn't give \(R_V\). Let's assume \(R_V\) is needed and missing from the text and diagram label.</p>
                                    <p class="key-point">Reviewing the OCR text, Figure 1 shows the connection, and the text provides meter readings, accuracies, and \(R_A\), but not \(R_V\). However, the formula for calculating true R in this configuration requires \(R_V\). Let's assume \(R_V\) value is needed from the problem context but is missing in the text/diagram. If this is a KNEC question, there might be a standard assumed value for voltmeter resistance based on sensitivity or a previous question. Let's assume \(R_V\) should have been stated.</p>
                                    <p class="key-point">Let's proceed with the parts that *can* be determined or assume a typical \(R_V\) if needed for later parts. The measured value (ii) doesn't need \(R_V\). The error calculation (i, iv) doesn't directly need \(R_V\), but finding the true value (iii) does.</p>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(i) total systematic error in instrument readings:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Systematic error in each instrument is given as a percentage of its full-scale (FS) reading. We need to calculate the absolute error for each instrument at the time of reading.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ammeter error: \( \Delta I_{abs} = \pm 0.3\% \text{ of } 100 \, A = 0.003 \times 100 \, A = \pm 0.3 \, A \).</li>
                                    <li>Voltmeter error: \( \Delta V_{abs} = \pm 0.4\% \text{ of } 150 \, V = 0.004 \times 150 \, V = \pm 0.6 \, V \).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Total systematic error in the readings (sum of absolute errors): \( \Delta_{total\_reading} = \Delta I_{abs} + \Delta V_{abs} = \pm 0.3 \, A + \pm 0.6 \, V \). This sum is not meaningful as they are different quantities.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Perhaps "total systematic error in instrument readings" refers to the combined effect of their errors on the final calculated value (Resistance R). Or maybe it means the sum of their maximum absolute errors. Let's interpret it as the combined influence on the resistance calculation.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">For \( R = V/I \), the maximum percentage error in R is approximately the sum of the percentage errors in V and I *at the reading*.
                                Percentage error in ammeter reading at 10A: \( \frac{\pm 0.3 \, A}{10 \, A} \times 100\% = \pm 3\% \).
                                Percentage error in voltmeter reading at 125V: \( \frac{\pm 0.6 \, V}{125 \, V} \times 100\% = \pm 0.48\% \).
                                Total percentage error in R calculation (due to instrument accuracy) \(\approx \pm 3\% \pm 0.48\% = \pm 3.48\%\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">The question asks for "total systematic error in instrument readings", not the error in R. This is confusing. Let's assume it means the absolute errors: \(\pm 0.3A\) for ammeter, \(\pm 0.6V\) for voltmeter. It's possible it wants the percentage error of the *readings* relative to FS: 0.3% for ammeter, 0.4% for voltmeter.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Given "total systematic error", it might refer to the combined absolute effect. Let's assume the intended meaning is the maximum absolute error contributed by both instruments. However, adding errors of different quantities isn't standard. Let's assume it means the sum of their absolute contributions to the *value* being read (10A and 125V). The absolute error in ammeter reading is \(\pm 0.3A\). The absolute error in voltmeter reading is \(\pm 0.6V\). Total absolute error as a concept isn't well-defined here.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume it's asking for the maximum *percentage error of the readings* relative to their full scale, summed up. 0.3% + 0.4% = 0.7%. This seems unlikely. Let's assume it asks for the absolute errors at FS as calculated: \(\pm 0.3A\) and \(\pm 0.6V\). This is the most direct interpretation of "constructional error ... at full scale". However, it says "in instrument readings", referring to the actual readings 10A and 125V. At reading 10A, error is \(\pm 0.3A\). At reading 125V, error is \(\pm 0.6V\). This is the likely intent.</p>
                                <p>Total systematic error in instrument readings: Ammeter has an error of \( \pm 0.3 \, A \), and Voltmeter has an error of \( \pm 0.6 \, V \).</p>

                                <p>**(ii) measured value of resistor R:**</p>
                                <p>The measured value is given directly as \(R_m = 90 \, \Omega\). This is confirmed by \(V_m/I_m = 125V/10A = 12.5\Omega\). Wait, the reading are 10A and 125V, but the given measured resistance is 90 Ohm. This is contradictory. Figure 1 shows Ammeter reading I_m and Voltmeter reading V_m, and measured R_m is V_m/I_m. If I_m=10A and V_m=125V, R_m should be 12.5 Ohm. But the text says "The measured resistance, Rm=90 Î©". This indicates a significant inconsistency in the problem statement.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the *readings* are correct (10A and 125V) and the *given Rm=90Î©* is wrong or refers to something else. Then measured R is 12.5Î©. Or let's assume the *measured resistance Rm=90Î©* is correct, and the readings 10A/125V are what the meters *showed* when R was 90Î©, and we need to find the true R. Given the explicit statement "The measured resistance, Rm=90 Î©", let's assume this is the value obtained, perhaps using different readings than 10A/125V or a different formula implied by Rm. This is very confusing.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the readings 10A and 125V are correct, and Rm = Vm/Im = 125V/10A = 12.5 Ohm. The "Rm=90Î©" is a typo. Then the measured value is 12.5 Ohm.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the readings 10A and 125V are correct for R=90 Ohm *with meter errors*. This is too complex without more information. Let's assume the simplest interpretation: readings are 10A and 125V, measured resistance is 125V/10A = 12.5 Ohm, and Rm=90 Ohm is a typo or unrelated value.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Alternative interpretation: readings are 10A and 125V. These are the *actual* values after accounting for error, OR the *indicated* values which have error. The question asks for error *in* the measurement, suggesting 10A and 125V are the *indicated* readings. "The measured resistance, Rm=90Î©" is the calculated value using *some* readings, maybe not these ones, or maybe it's another piece of data. This is highly ambiguous.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the readings are 10A and 125V, and the measured value R_m is calculated *from these readings*. So R_m = 125V/10A = 12.5 Ohm. Then "The measured resistance, Rm=90 Î©" is definitively wrong or confusing context.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the readings are indeed 10A and 125V, and the statement "The measured resistance, Rm=90 Î©" is an error in the question itself.</p>
                                <p>Let's calculate based on readings 10A and 125V.</p>
                                <p>Measured value of resistor R: \( R_{measured} = \frac{V_m}{I_m} = \frac{125 \, V}{10 \, A} = 12.5 \, \Omega \).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Okay, let's consider the possibility that the text intends for the *true* current through R to be 10A and the *true* voltage across R to be 125V, and 90Î© is the correct R. This contradicts the meters showing 10A and 125V with their errors and internal resistances. Let's assume the readings 10A, 125V are *indicated* values, and Rm=90Î© is also an *indicated* value from some previous step or a typo.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the readings *are* 10A and 125V, the *measured resistance calculated from these* is 12.5 Ohm, and the value R=90 Ohm mentioned is the *true* value for R. Then we calculate error between 12.5 and 90 Ohm. This also seems unlikely given the flow.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's go back to the most probable interpretation based on similar problems: Readings are 10A and 125V. Measured R = Vm/Im. Find true R using internal resistances. Calculate error between measured and true. And the statement "The measured resistance, Rm=90 Î©" is a typo.</p>
                                <p>Measured value of resistor R: \( R_{measured} = \frac{V_m}{I_m} = \frac{125 \, V}{10 \, A} = 12.5 \, \Omega \). (Assuming readings 10A and 125V are used for this calculation, overriding Rm=90Î© statement).</p>

                                <p>**(iii) true value of resistor R:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">In the voltmeter-across-R configuration, the ammeter measures the total current \(I_m\), which is the sum of the current through R (\(I_R\)) and the current through the voltmeter (\(I_V\)). \( I_m = I_R + I_V \).</p>
                                <p>The voltmeter measures the voltage across R, \(V_m\). The current through the voltmeter is \( I_V = \frac{V_m}{R_V} \). We need \(R_V\). It is not given in the text or diagram label.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume \(R_V\) should have been provided. Let's check the value from Q2c Nov 2015 or Q1c July 2017 where \(R_V = 1000\Omega/V \times 150V = 150k\Omega\), or Q1c Nov 2017 where \(R_V = 1000\Omega/V \times 150V = 150k\Omega\), or Q2b Nov 2017 where \(R_V = 2.5k\Omega\). The range is 150V, like Q1c July 2017. Let's assume \(R_V\) from Q1c July 2017: \(R_V = 150 k\Omega\). This value seems too high compared to \(R_A=0.01\Omega\). Let's look at the diagram's visual representation of \(R_V\). It looks similar in representation to \(R_A\), implying it's an internal resistance. The text gives \(R_A = 0.01\Omega\) and \(R_V = 2000\Omega\) in Q2c Nov 2022. Let's assume \(R_V = 2000\Omega\) from Q2c Nov 2022 is the value intended for this standard voltmeter.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Assuming \(R_V = 2000 \Omega\):</p>
                                \[ I_V = \frac{V_m}{R_V} = \frac{125 \, V}{2000 \, \Omega} = 0.0625 \, A \]
                                <p>The true current through R is \( I_R = I_m - I_V = 10 \, A - 0.0625 \, A = 9.9375 \, A \).</p>
                                <p>The true value of resistor R is \( R_{true} = \frac{V_m}{I_R} = \frac{125 \, V}{9.9375 \, A} \approx 12.578 \, \Omega \).</p>

                                <p>**(iv) percentage error in the value of \( R \):**</p>
                                <p>Percentage error = \( \frac{R_{measured} - R_{true}}{R_{true}} \times 100\% \).</p>
                                \[ \% \text{Error} = \frac{12.5 \, \Omega - 12.578 \, \Omega}{12.578 \, \Omega} \times 100\% = \frac{-0.078}{12.578} \times 100\% \approx -0.62 \% \]
                                <p>The measured resistance is 0.62% lower than the true value due to the voltmeter loading effect.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Note: This calculation assumes readings 10A and 125V, ignores the Rm=90Î© statement, and assumes \(R_V = 2000\Omega\) based on another paper. This problem statement has significant ambiguities/errors.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Factors affecting Reliability and Effects of Humidity (12 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Three factors that may affect the reliability of an engineering equipment:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Quality of components:** Using low-quality or out-of-spec components increases the likelihood of early failures or reduced lifespan.</li>
                                    <li>**Environmental stress:** Operating the equipment outside its specified temperature, humidity, vibration, or atmospheric conditions can accelerate degradation and cause failures.</li>
                                    <li>**Design robustness:** How well the design anticipates and handles operating stresses, tolerances, and potential failure modes.</li>
                                    <li>**Manufacturing and assembly quality:** Errors during manufacturing (e.g., poor soldering, incorrect component placement) introduce defects that affect reliability.</li>
                                    <li>**Operating time and stress level:** Longer operating hours and higher stress levels (voltage, current, temperature) generally lead to increased wear and probability of failure.</li>
                                    <li>**Maintenance quality:** Poor or inadequate maintenance can introduce new faults or fail to prevent age-related failures.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Effects of humidity on performance and minimization:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Humidity, the amount of water vapor in the air, can significantly impact the performance and reliability of electrical and electronic equipment.</p>
                                <p>**Effects:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Corrosion:** Moisture combined with contaminants can accelerate the corrosion of metal parts (leads, contacts, traces), leading to increased resistance, intermittent connections, or open circuits.</li>
                                    <li>**Insulation Degradation:** High humidity reduces the insulation resistance of materials, leading to leakage currents, especially on PCB surfaces, which can cause malfunction or short circuits.</li>
                                    <li>**Component Changes:** Moisture can affect the dielectric properties of capacitors, change the resistance of some materials, or even be absorbed by some components (like IC packages), leading to internal damage.</li>
                                    <li>**Electrolysis:** In the presence of moisture and voltage, ionic contaminants on PCBs can migrate, leading to dendritic growth that causes short circuits.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Reliability Calculations from Given Failure Rate (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Given an equipment's failure rate and an operating period. We can calculate MTTF/MTBF, reliability, and probability of failure for that period.</p>
                                <p>Given: Failure rate \( \lambda = 16 \% \) per 1000 hours. Operating period \(t = 1000\) hours.</p>
                                <p>Convert percentage failure rate to a decimal rate per 1000 hours: \( \lambda_{per \, 1000hrs} = 16\% = 0.16 \).</p>
                                <p>Convert to failures per hour: \( \lambda_{per \, hour} = \frac{16 / 100}{1000} = \frac{0.16}{1000} = 1.6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{failures/hour} \).</p>

                                <p>**(i) mean time between failures:**</p>
                                <p>MTBF is the reciprocal of the failure rate (assuming constant failure rate).</p>
                                \[ MTBF = \frac{1}{\lambda_{per \, hour}} = \frac{1}{1.6 \times 10^{-4}} \, \text{hours/failure} = \frac{10000}{1.6} \, \text{hours/failure} = 6250 \, \text{hours/failure} \]

                                <p>**(ii) reliability:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Reliability \(R(t)\) for a time \(t\). Use \(R(t) = e^{-\lambda t}\). Given \(t = 1000\) hours. Use \(\lambda_{per \, hour}\).</p>
                                \[ R(1000) = e^{-(1.6 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{failures/hour}) \times (1000 \, \text{hours})} = e^{-0.16} \]
                                \[ R(1000) \approx 0.8521 \]
                                <p>Alternatively, using the failure rate per 1000 hours: \( R(1000) = e^{-\lambda_{per \, 1000hrs}} = e^{-0.16} \approx 0.8521 \).</p>
                                <p>The reliability for an operating period of 1,000 hours is approximately 0.8521 or 85.21%.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) probability of failure:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Probability of failure (unreliability \(U(t)\)) is \( 1 - R(t) \).</p>
                                \[ U(1000) = 1 - R(1000) \approx 1 - 0.8521 = 0.1479 \]
                                <p>The probability of failure for an operating period of 1,000 hours is approximately 0.1479 or 14.79%.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Understanding factors affecting reliability, modeling failure rates, and calculating reliability metrics are essential for predicting equipment performance and lifespan.</p>

                                    <li>**(i) availability:** The probability that an equipment is in an operable state at any given time when required for use. It considers both how often the equipment fails (reliability) and how quickly it can be repaired (maintainability).</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) failure rate:** The frequency with which a system or component fails, typically expressed as the number of failures per unit of time (e.g., failures per hour) or per unit of operation (e.g., failures per cycle).

                                <p class="answer-intro">Preventive maintenance is a proactive approach to maintaining equipment. (Same as Q5a(ii) in Nov 2015 or Q2a(ii) in July 2021)</p>
                                <p>**Description:** Preventive maintenance involves performing routine inspections, servicing, adjustments, and component replacements at scheduled intervals (time-based, usage-based, or condition-based) *before* a failure occurs or before performance degrades significantly. Its main goal is to prevent unexpected breakdowns, minimize unplanned downtime, extend the lifespan of the equipment, and maintain optimal performance and safety. This contrasts with corrective maintenance, which is reactive (performed after failure).</p>

                                    <li>**I. No output from both output terminals:** If neither the modulated/CW output (Output 1) nor the modulating signal output (Output 2) is present, the fault is likely in a block common to both paths.
                                        <br>**Fault:** Power Supply block (no power to any circuit), or the Amplifier block (since both outputs pass through it). Could also be the Output Control block or a common fuse/switch.</li>
                                    <li>**II. No output 2 but output 1 is correct:** If Output 1 (modulated or CW) is present and correct, but Output 2 is absent, the fault is likely in a block specific to the Output 2 path or the Modulating Oscillator block itself.
                                        <br>**Fault:** Modulating Oscillator block (no modulating signal generated), or the part of the Amplifier/Output Control that feeds only Output 2 (if such a split exists after the main amplifier). It could also be an open connection specific to the Output 2 terminal.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Number of failures \(f = 4\).</li>
                                    <li>Total period of observation \(T_{total} = 1600\) hours.</li>

                                <p>Failure rate (\(\lambda\)) is the number of failures divided by the total operating time (uptime).
                                \[ \lambda = \frac{\text{Number of Failures}}{\text{Total Operating Time}} = \frac{4 \text{ failures}}{1592 \text{ hours}} \approx 0.002513 \, \text{failures/hour} \]

                                <p>**(ii) mean time to repair:**</p>
                                <p>Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) is the total time spent on repairs divided by the number of failures.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">Maintainability \(M(t)\) is the probability that a failed system is repaired within time \(t\). Assuming exponential repair times, \(M(t) = 1 - e^{-t/\text{MTTR}}\). Use \(t = 6\) hours and \(MTTR = 2.0\) hours.</p>
                                \[ M(6) = 1 - e^{-6 \, \text{hours} / 2.0 \, \text{hours}} = 1 - e^{-3} \]
                                \[ M(6) \approx 1 - 0.049787 = 0.950213 \]

                                    <li>**Safety:** Ensure the circuit containing the resistor is powered off and disconnected from the power source.</li>
                                    <li>**Isolation:** If possible, disconnect at least one lead of the resistor from the circuit. This prevents measuring the resistance of other components in parallel with the resistor.</li>
                                    <li>**Meter Setup:** Set the DMM to the resistance measurement function (\(\Omega\)). Select an appropriate range (if manual ranging) or use auto-ranging.</li>
                                    <li>**Probe Connection:** Touch the red and black probes of the multimeter firmly to the two leads of the resistor.</li>
                                    <li>**Read Measurement:** Observe the resistance value displayed on the DMM screen.</li>
                                    <li>**Verification:** Compare the measured resistance value with the resistor's labeled value (from color code or markings) and its specified tolerance. A good resistor should measure within its tolerance range.</li>
                                    <li>**Interpretation:** An open resistor will show a very high reading or "OL" (Over Limit). A shorted resistor (rare) will show a reading close to 0 \(\Omega\).</li>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers fundamental semiconductor concepts (holes, band gap, doping), avalanche breakdown, atomic structure, and diode characteristics from tabulated data.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Semiconductor Definitions and Avalanche Breakdown (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Definitions with respect to semiconductors:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**I. Hole:** A vacancy or absence of an electron in a covalent bond within the crystal structure of a semiconductor. It behaves as if it were a positive charge carrier with a mobility. Holes are the majority carriers in p-type semiconductors and minority carriers in n-type semiconductors.</li>
                                    <li>**II. Forbidden gap:** The range of energy levels that electrons cannot occupy in a solid material according to quantum mechanics. It is the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. The size of the forbidden gap (\(E_g\)) determines whether a material is a conductor, semiconductor, or insulator.</li>
                                    <li>**III. Dour atom:** This term is likely a typo in the OCR. Based on the context of doping semiconductors (making them extrinsic), the intended term is probably **Donor atom**. A donor atom is an impurity atom added to an intrinsic semiconductor that has one or more valence electrons more than the semiconductor atom (e.g., a pentavalent impurity in silicon). These extra electrons are loosely bound and become free electrons, contributing to conduction.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Explain avalanche breakdown with respect to p-n junctions (6 marks):**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Avalanche breakdown is a mechanism of conduction that can occur in a reverse-biased p-n junction when the reverse voltage becomes sufficiently high (at or above the breakdown voltage \(V_{BR}\)). (Same as Q6a(ii) Oct/Nov 2018)</p>
                                <p>**Explanation:** When a reverse bias voltage is applied, a strong electric field exists across the depletion region. Minority carriers (electrons on the p-side, holes on the n-side) that are thermally generated are accelerated by this field. As they gain energy, they collide with atoms in the crystal lattice. If the energy gained is sufficient, these collisions can break covalent bonds, generating new electron-hole pairs (impact ionization). The newly created carriers are also accelerated by the field and cause further impact ionization collisions, leading to a cumulative multiplication effect (avalanche effect). When the reverse voltage reaches \(V_{BR}\), the avalanche process becomes self-sustaining, causing a rapid and significant increase in the reverse current.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Structure of an Atom with Diagram (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The basic structure of an atom, according to the Bohr model, consists of a nucleus at the center containing protons and neutrons, and electrons orbiting the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells.</p>

                                <p>**Explanation:** An atom consists of a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus at its core, containing protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge). Negatively charged electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, quantized energy shells or levels. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. The electrons in the outermost shell are called valence electrons and are involved in chemical bonding and electrical conduction in materials. (Same as Q8b Nov 2021)</p>

                                <p>The plot shows the non-linear relationship between forward voltage and current in the diode.

                                    <li>Between (0.2V, 0.5mA) and (0.3V, 1.0mA): \( r_d = \frac{0.3-0.2}{1.0-0.5} \, \Omega = \frac{0.1V}{0.5mA} = \frac{0.1}{0.5 \times 10^{-3}} = 200 \, \Omega \).</li>

                                <p class="key-point">The forward resistance is not constant. It decreases as the voltage and current increase. The dynamic resistance at higher current levels (e.g., 20 \(\Omega\)) is often considered more representative of the diode's ON resistance.</p>
                                <p>If "the" forward resistance is asked, and no specific point or method is given, the dynamic resistance in the steeper part of the curve is usually implied.</p>
                                <p>Forward resistance (dynamic) varies from 400 \(\Omega\) at low current to 20 \(\Omega\) at higher current.</p>

                                <p>**Description:** The circuit consists of a series resistor \(R_S\) connected between the unregulated input voltage \(V_{in}\) and the Zener diode, which is connected in parallel (shunt) with the load \(R_L\). The Zener diode is connected in reverse bias. \(R_S\) limits the current flowing into the Zener and the load. When the input voltage \(V_{in}\) is greater than the Zener breakdown voltage \(V_Z\), the Zener diode enters the breakdown region and maintains a nearly constant voltage \(V_Z\) across its terminals and, therefore, across the parallel load \(R_L\). If \(V_{in}\) increases, the current through \(R_S\) increases; the Zener current \(I_Z\) increases while \(V_L\) remains nearly constant. If the load current \(I_L\) decreases (due to increasing \(R_L\)), \(I_Z\) increases to keep \(I_S\) constant (\(I_S = I_Z + I_L\)), maintaining \(V_L\) constant. Regulation is maintained as long as the Zener stays in breakdown (\(I_Z \ge I_{Z,min}\)) and its maximum current rating is not exceeded (\(I_Z \le I_{Z,max}\)). (Same as Q8c(ii) Nov 2018)</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) DC Power Supply Performance Metrics (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Given information about a DC power supply's output voltage under different load conditions and its ripple.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>No load output voltage (\(V_{NL}\)) = 60 V</li>
                                    <li>Full load output voltage (\(V_{FL}\)) = 56 V</li>
                                    <li>Ripple component RMS voltage (\(V_{ripple,rms}\)) = 1.25 V rms</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(i) Percentage voltage regulation:**</p>
                                <p>Voltage regulation is a measure of how well a power supply maintains a constant output voltage as the load changes. It is usually expressed as the percentage change in output voltage from no load to full load, relative to the full load voltage.</p>
                                \[ \% \text{Voltage Regulation} = \frac{V_{NL} - V_{FL}}{V_{FL}} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Voltage Regulation} = \frac{60 \, V - 56 \, V}{56 \, V} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Voltage Regulation} = \frac{4 \, V}{56 \, V} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{14} \times 100\% \approx 7.143 \% \]

                                <p>**(ii) Percentage ripple:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Percentage ripple is a measure of the amount of AC voltage superimposed on the DC output voltage. It's typically the ratio of the RMS ripple voltage to the DC output voltage, expressed as a percentage.</p>
                                <p>The DC output voltage can be taken as the full load voltage \(V_{FL}\) if the ripple is measured at full load, or the average DC voltage. Assuming the ripple is measured at full load, the DC output voltage reference is \(V_{FL}\).</p>
                                \[ \% \text{Ripple} = \frac{V_{ripple,rms}}{V_{dc}} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Ripple} = \frac{1.25 \, V_{rms}}{56 \, V} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Ripple} \approx 0.02232 \times 100\% \approx 2.232 \% \]

                                </ul>
                                <p>Assume the electron starts with negligible initial velocity from the cathode.</p>
                                <p>**(i) Velocity of the electron:**</p>
                                <p>The velocity (\(v\)) after acceleration by \(V_a\) is found from the kinetic energy gained (\( \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \)) equaling the potential energy lost (\(e V_a\)).</p>
                                \[ \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = e V_a \]
                                \[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2 e V_a}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C) \times (2000 \, V)}{9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, kg}} \]
                                \[ v = \sqrt{\frac{6.4 \times 10^{-16}}{9.1 \times 10^{-31}}} = \sqrt{0.70329 \times 10^{15}} = \sqrt{7.0329 \times 10^{14}} \]
                                \[ v \approx 2.652 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m/s} \]

                                <p>**(ii) Acceleration of the electron:**</p>

                                \[ a \approx 1.061 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{m/s}^2 \]
                                <p class="key-point">Note: This assumes the 0.25 ÂµS is the actual time taken to accelerate from rest to the final velocity, which occurs within the electron gun region. This might be an oversimplification depending on the specific electron gun design.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) Loss in potential energy:**</p>
                                <p>The loss in potential energy is equal to the charge multiplied by the potential difference it falls through.</p>
                                \[ \text{Loss in PE} = e V_a = (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C) \times (2000 \, V) = 3.2 \times 10^{-16} \, J \]

                                <p>**(iv) Gain in kinetic energy:**</p>
                                <p>According to the work-energy theorem, the gain in kinetic energy is equal to the work done by the electric field, which is equal to the loss in potential energy (assuming no other forces like friction are doing work). Starting from rest (initial KE = 0), the gain in KE is equal to the final KE.</p>
                                \[ \text{Gain in KE} = \text{Final KE} - \text{Initial KE} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - 0 \]
                                \[ \text{Gain in KE} = 3.2 \times 10^{-16} \, J \]
                                <p>The gain in kinetic energy is \(3.2 \times 10^{-16} \, J\). (Same as Q8b(iii) Nov 2018)</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question compares FETs and BJTs, describes JFET operation, and involves DC bias calculations for a BJT common-emitter amplifier.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Disadvantages of Field Effect Transistors (FETs) compared to Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Sensitivity to Electrostatic Discharge (ESD):** Especially MOSFETs, the thin gate oxide is easily damaged by static electricity, requiring careful handling. While BJTs can also be damaged by ESD, MOSFETs are generally more sensitive.</li>
                                    <li>**Lower Transconductance:** FETs typically have lower transconductance (\(g_m = \Delta I_D / \Delta V_{GS}\)) compared to the transconductance (\(g_m = \Delta I_C / \Delta V_{BE}\) or \(g_m = I_C/V_T\)) of BJTs for the same operating current. This means that for the same change in input voltage, a BJT can provide a larger change in output current.</li>
                                    <li>**Limited Current Driving Capability:** Power BJTs can generally handle larger currents and powers compared to FETs of similar size, making BJTs often preferred for high-power switching or amplification applications.</li>
                                    <li>**Switching Speed (sometimes):** Although MOSFETs can switch very fast, BJTs sometimes offer faster switching speeds in specific high-current applications due to lower ON-resistance limitations in some power FETs.</li>

                                <p>**Principle of Operation:**</p>
                                <p>For proper operation, the gate-source PN junction is typically reverse-biased. For a P-channel JFET, this means applying a positive voltage to the gate relative to the source (\(V_{GS} > 0\)). The drain is connected to a negative voltage relative to the source (\(V_{DS} < 0\)) to cause holes to flow from source to drain.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A negative voltage \(V_{DS}\) is applied between the drain and source. This causes holes (majority carriers in the P-channel) to flow from the source (positive terminal) through the channel to the drain (negative terminal), constituting the drain current \(I_D\). The current direction is usually shown as flowing from drain to source (conventional current, positive direction).</li>
                                    <li>A positive voltage \(V_{GS}\) is applied between the gate and source. This reverse-biases the PN junction between the N-type gate and the P-channel.</li>
                                    <li>The reverse bias voltage creates a depletion region within the P-channel, depleted of free charge carriers. This narrows the conductive path of the channel.</li>
                                    <li>As the positive \(V_{GS}\) voltage is increased (made more positive), the reverse bias across the gate-channel junction increases, widening the depletion region and further constricting the channel.</li>
                                    <li>If \(V_{GS}\) is made sufficiently positive, the depletion regions can meet, closing off the channel and reducing \(I_D\) to zero. This \(V_{GS}\) voltage is called the pinch-off voltage (\(V_p\)), which is positive for a P-channel JFET.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The P-channel JFET acts as a voltage-controlled resistor or current source, where the positive \(V_{GS}\) controls the negative \(I_D\) (or positive conventional \(I_D\) flowing S to D).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Common Emitter Amplifier DC Bias Calculation (14 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 3 shows an NPN BJT common emitter amplifier with voltage divider bias. We need to determine the DC bias voltages and currents (Q-point). We are given \(V_{BE} = 0.7 \, \mathrm{V}\) and the approximation \(I_C \simeq I_E\).</p>
                                <p>From Figure 3: \(V_{CC} = 12 \, \mathrm{V}\), \(R_1 = 20 \, k\Omega\), \(R_2 = 4.7 \, k\Omega\), \(R_C = 2.2 \, k\Omega\), \(R_E = 1 \, k\Omega\).</p>
                                <p>**(i) \(V_{B}\) (Base voltage):**</p>
                                <p>The base voltage is set by the voltage divider \(R_1\) and \(R_2\). Assume the base current \(I_B\) is small enough to be neglected compared to the current through the divider (valid if \(R_2 \ll \beta R_E\)).</p>
                                \[ V_B = V_{CC} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \]
                                \[ V_B = 12 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{4.7 \, k\Omega}{20 \, k\Omega + 4.7 \, k\Omega} = 12 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{4.7}{24.7} \]
                                \[ V_B \approx 12 \times 0.19028 \approx 2.2834 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The base voltage \(V_B\) is approximately 2.2834 V.</p>

                                <p>**(ii) \(V_{E}\) (Emitter voltage):**</p>
                                <p>The emitter voltage is \(V_B\) minus the base-emitter voltage drop \(V_{BE}\).</p>
                                \[ V_E = V_B - V_{BE} = 2.2834 \, \mathrm{V} - 0.7 \, \mathrm{V} = 1.5834 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The emitter voltage \(V_E\) is approximately 1.5834 V.</p>

                                <p>The emitter current \(I_E\) flows through \(R_E\).</p>
                                \[ I_E = \frac{V_E}{R_E} = \frac{1.5834 \, V}{1 \, k\Omega} = \frac{1.5834}{1000} \, A = 0.0015834 \, A = 1.5834 \, mA \]
                                <p>The emitter current \(I_E\) is approximately 1.5834 mA.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) \(I_{B}\) (Base current):** Using the approximation \(I_C \simeq I_E\), the base current \(I_B = I_E - I_C\) is very small compared to \(I_E\) and \(I_C\). The exact value depends on the transistor's \(\beta\), where \(I_B = I_E / (1+\beta)\). Without knowing \(\beta\), we cannot calculate the exact value of \(I_B\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the intended calculation requires a typical \(\beta\). Given the marks, let's assume \(\beta \approx 100\). Then \(I_B = I_E / (1+\beta) = 1.5834mA / 101 \approx 0.01568mA = 15.68 \mu A\).</p>
                                <p>**(v) \(V_{C}\) (Collector voltage):** Using the approximation \(I_C \simeq I_E \approx 1.5834 \, \mathrm{mA}\) for calculating the voltage drop across \(R_C\).</p>
                                \[ V_C = V_{CC} - I_C R_C \approx 12 \, \mathrm{V} - (1.5834 \, \mathrm{mA}) \times (2.2 \, k\Omega) \]
                                \[ V_C \approx 12 \, \mathrm{V} - (1.5834 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{A}) \times (2.2 \times 10^3 \, \Omega) = 12 \, \mathrm{V} - 3.4835 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                \[ V_C \approx 8.5165 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The collector voltage \(V_C\) is approximately 8.5165 V.</p>

                                <p>**(vi) \(V_{CE}\) (Collector-to-emitter voltage):**</p>
                                \[ V_{CE} = V_C - V_E = 8.5165 \, \mathrm{V} - 1.5834 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                \[ V_{CE} \approx 6.9331 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The collector-to-emitter voltage \(V_{CE}\) is approximately 6.9331 V.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Check operating region: \(V_{CE} \approx 6.93V\). \(V_{BE}=0.7V\). Since \(V_{CE} > V_{BE}\), the transistor is in the active region as expected for an amplifier. Also check \(V_C > V_E\). \(8.5V > 1.58V\).</p>
