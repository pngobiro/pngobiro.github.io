                                    <li>**Indirect-contact (Advantage):** The heater and thermocouple are electrically insulated, allowing for measurement of high AC voltages across the heater without affecting the DC measuring circuit. This provides isolation.</li>
                                    <li>**Indirect-contact (Disadvantage):** The thermal coupling is less efficient than direct contact, potentially making the instrument less sensitive or slower to respond to current changes.</li>
                                    <li>**Direct-contact (Advantage):** More efficient thermal transfer between the heater and thermocouple, leading to higher sensitivity and faster response time.</li>
                                    <li>**Direct-contact (Disadvantage):** The thermocouple is electrically connected to the heating element circuit. This limits its use primarily to low AC voltages across the heater and can introduce errors if the DC measuring circuit is not properly isolated or has high impedance.</li>

                                <p>**Description:** In a direct-contact thermocouple ammeter, the heating element through which the current to be measured flows is integrated directly into the hot junction of the thermocouple. The AC or DC current (\(I\)) heats the junction due to \(I^2R\) losses. The temperature difference between this hot junction and the cold junctions (typically at the terminals of the DC meter) generates a proportional DC voltage (thermo-electric e.m.f. or Seebeck effect). This DC voltage drives a current through the sensitive DC moving-coil meter, causing a deflection. The meter scale is calibrated to indicate the RMS value of the current. This type has better thermal transfer but is electrically connected to the circuit being measured, which can be a limitation.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Permeameter Measurement Calculations (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The permeameter setup measures magnetic properties of a specimen. Coil X is likely the magnetizing coil (or a search coil for flux density in the specimen), and Coil Y is a search coil for flux density in the air gap (leakage flux). The galvanometer deflections are proportional to the change in flux linkage when the magnetizing current is reversed.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Galvanometer constants: \(K_X = K_Y = 25 \times 10^{-6}\) Wb-turn/division.</li>
                                    <li>Coil X: \(N_X = 100\) turns, \(A_X = 50 \times 10^{-6} \, m^2\). Deflection \(\theta_X = 100\) divisions.</li>
                                    <li>Coil Y: \(N_Y = 10,000\) turns, \(A_Y = 5 \times 10^{-6} \, m^2\). Deflection \(\theta_Y = 10\) divisions.</li>
                                    <li>\(\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, H/m\).</li>
                                    <li>Current reversal implies change in flux is \(2\Phi\). The charge \(Q\) in the galvanometer is proportional to \(\Delta\Psi/R\), and deflection \(\theta\) is proportional to \(Q\). So \(\theta \propto \Delta\Psi\). Let the constant of proportionality be \(C_{gal}\) (divisions/Wb-turn). The given constant \(K\) is Wb-turn/division, so \( C_{gal} = 1/K \).</li>
                                    <li>Change in flux linkage in coil X: \( \Delta\Psi_X = K_X \theta_X = (25 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb-turn/div}) \times 100 \, \mathrm{div} = 2500 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb-turns} \). This change is \( N_X \Delta\Phi_{specimen} \), where \( \Delta\Phi_{specimen} \) is the change in flux in the specimen. \( \Delta\Phi_{specimen} = \Delta B_{specimen} \times A_{specimen} \). If coil X measures flux linkage in the specimen, \( \Delta\Psi_X = N_X \Delta\Phi_{specimen} = N_X (2 \Phi_{specimen}) \). Assuming it measures the total flux change (\(2\Phi\)), \( \Delta\Psi_X = N_X (2 \Phi_{specimen}) \).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="key-point">Figure 1 shows Coil X around the specimen and Coil Y possibly in an air gap or measuring leakage. Let's assume Coil X measures the change in flux linkage within the specimen (\(2\Phi_{specimen}\)), and Coil Y measures the change in flux linkage outside the specimen, possibly in the air gap or leakage path (\(2\Phi_{air}\)).</p>
                                <p>Change in flux in specimen: \( 2\Phi_{specimen} = \frac{\Delta\Psi_X}{N_X} = \frac{2500 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb-turns}}{100 \text{ turns}} = 25 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb} \).</p>
                                <p>Assume \(A_{specimen}\) is the area of the specimen. The flux density in the specimen is \( B_{specimen} = \frac{\Phi_{specimen}}{A_{specimen}} = \frac{25 \times 10^{-6} / 2}{A_{specimen}} \). We don't have \(A_{specimen}\) from the diagram or text. Let's assume \(A_X\) is the effective area of Coil X linking the flux, and this is the cross-sectional area of the specimen \(A_{specimen} = A_X = 50 \times 10^{-6} \, m^2\).</p>

                                <p>**(i) Flux density in the specimen:**</p>
                                \[ B_{specimen} = \frac{\Phi_{specimen}}{A_{specimen}} = \frac{25 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb} / 2}{50 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m}^2} = \frac{12.5 \times 10^{-6}}{50 \times 10^{-6}} \, \mathrm{Wb/m}^2 = 0.25 \, \mathrm{Wb/m}^2 \]

                                <p>Change in flux linkage in coil Y: \( \Delta\Psi_Y = K_Y \theta_Y = (25 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb-turn/div}) \times 10 \, \mathrm{div} = 250 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb-turns} \).</p>
                                <p>This change is \( N_Y \Delta\Phi_{air} = N_Y (2 \Phi_{air}) \). \( \Delta\Phi_{air} = \Delta B_{air} \times A_Y \). Assume \(A_Y\) is the effective area of Coil Y linking the flux, and this is the area of the air gap \(A_{air} = A_Y = 5 \times 10^{-6} \, m^2\).</p>
                                <p>Change in flux in air: \( 2\Phi_{air} = \frac{\Delta\Psi_Y}{N_Y} = \frac{250 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb-turns}}{10000 \text{ turns}} = 0.025 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb} \).</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Flux density in the air:**</p>
                                \[ B_{air} = \frac{\Phi_{air}}{A_{air}} = \frac{0.025 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb} / 2}{5 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m}^2} = \frac{0.0125 \times 10^{-6}}{5 \times 10^{-6}} \, \mathrm{Wb/m}^2 = 0.0025 \, \mathrm{Wb/m}^2 \]

                                <p>**(iii) Magnetising force (\(H\)):**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The magnetizing force \(H\) is related to the magnetizing current and the geometry of the magnetic circuit. For a toroidal specimen with uniform winding, \( H = \frac{N_{mag} I}{l_{mean}} \), where \(N_{mag}\) is the number of turns in the magnetizing winding and \(l_{mean}\) is the mean magnetic path length of the specimen. These are not directly given. However, \(H\) in the specimen is related to \(B_{specimen}\) and the permeability of the specimen \(\mu_{specimen} = \mu_r \mu_0\) by \(B_{specimen} = \mu_{specimen} H\). Also, \(H\) is assumed to be relatively uniform within the specimen under test by the permeameter.</p>
                                <p>We can calculate \(H\) in the air gap using \(B_{air} = \mu_0 H_{air}\). In a well-designed permeameter, \(H\) in the specimen is approximately equal to \(H_{air}\) in the closely coupled search coil region, adjusted for leakage. However, without more information or standard formulas for this specific permeameter setup, let's assume \(H\) in the specimen is related to the magnetizing current (5A) and the magnetizing coil (likely Coil X based on Figure 1, but Q text says "magnetising winding" and then refers to Coil X & Y connected to galvanometers) geometry. Let's assume the magnetizing winding is a separate winding (not Coil X) with \(N_{mag}\) turns and mean length \(l_{mean}\). The text says Coil X has 100 turns, deflection 100 divisions, etc. This is likely a search coil *within* the specimen.</p>
                                <p>Let's assume the question intends for us to calculate \(H\) in the specimen using the relationship \(B_{specimen} = \mu_0 H_{specimen}\) if it were air, and relate it to the \(H\) from the magnetizing current. A permeameter aims to create a known \(H\) in the specimen. The magnetizing force \(H\) in the specimen is generated by the magnetizing current. Often, \(H\) is calculated from the current in the magnetizing coil (e.g., \(H = N_{mag} I_{mag} / l_{mean}\)). This \(H\) creates the flux density \(B_{specimen}\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Without \(N_{mag}\) or \(l_{mean}\) of the magnetizing circuit, \(H\) cannot be calculated directly from the current. However, in some permeameter contexts, \(H\) is related to the current in the air gap winding or measured differently. Given the context of magnetic measurements, \(H\) must be related to the magnetizing current (5A). Let's assume Coil X is the search coil for the specimen. Let's assume there's a standard formula relating the magnetic field H to the current reversal and deflection of Coil Y. This is unlikely.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the question implies that the magnetizing winding (carrying 5A) generates a certain MMF, which is distributed across the magnetic circuit (specimen + air gap + joints). MMF \( = N_{mag} I \). This MMF drives the flux. \(MMF = \int H \cdot dl = H_{specimen} l_{specimen} + H_{air} l_{air} + ...\). This requires knowing the lengths and areas, which are not given.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume there's a relationship between \(H\) and the current reversal measured by Coil Y. Coil Y measures flux change in air. \( \Delta\Psi_Y = N_Y (2 \Phi_{air}) \). \( \Phi_{air} = B_{air} A_Y = \mu_0 H_{air} A_Y \). \( \Delta\Psi_Y = N_Y (2 \mu_0 H_{air} A_Y) \). \( H_{air} = \frac{\Delta\Psi_Y}{2 N_Y \mu_0 A_Y} \). Let's calculate \(H_{air}\).</p>
                                \[ H_{air} = \frac{250 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{Wb-turns}}{2 \times 10000 \text{ turns} \times (4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{H/m}) \times (5 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m}^2)} \]
                                \[ H_{air} = \frac{250 \times 10^{-6}}{20000 \times 4\pi \times 5 \times 10^{-13}} = \frac{250 \times 10^{-6}}{40000\pi \times 10^{-13}} = \frac{250 \times 10^{-6}}{4\pi \times 10^{-9}} \, \mathrm{A/m} \]
                                \[ H_{air} = \frac{250}{4\pi} \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{A/m} \approx 19.89 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{A/m} \]
                                <p class="key-point">In some permeameter designs, the magnetizing force \(H\) in the specimen is assumed to be approximately equal to the magnetizing force in a small air gap specifically designed for measurement (which Coil Y might be measuring). Let's assume \(H_{specimen} \approx H_{air}\).</p>
                                \[ H_{specimen} \approx 19.89 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{A/m} \]

                                <p>Relative permeability is defined as \( \mu_r = \frac{B_{specimen}}{\mu_0 H_{specimen}} \). Using the values calculated:</p>
                                \[ \mu_r = \frac{0.25 \, \mathrm{Wb/m}^2}{(4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{H/m}) \times (19.89 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{A/m})} \]
                                \[ \mu_r = \frac{0.25}{4\pi \times 19.89 \times 10^{-4}} = \frac{0.25}{249.8 \times 10^{-4}} = \frac{0.25}{0.02498} \]
                                \[ \mu_r \approx 10.008 \]
                                <p>The relative permeability of the specimen is approximately 10.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Voltmeter Percentage Limiting Error (5 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Limiting error is the guaranteed maximum deviation from the true value, usually specified as a percentage of the full-scale reading.</p>

                                <p>This means any reading on the 150V scale could potentially be off by up to \( \pm 1.5 \, V \).</p>
                                <p>The percentage limiting error for a specific reading is the maximum absolute error divided by that reading, multiplied by 100%:</p>

                                \[ \% \text{Limiting Error at } 75V = \frac{1.5 \, V}{75 \, V} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Limiting Error at } 75V = 0.02 \times 100\% = 2\% \]

                                <p><strong>(a) Redundancy and Vibration Effects on Reliability (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Definition of redundancy with respect to reliability:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Redundancy is the inclusion of duplicate or alternative components or subsystems that can take over the function of a primary element if it fails. This increases the overall system reliability because the system can continue to operate even if a single component fails, as long as a redundant path or component is available.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Effects of mechanical vibrations and shock on reliability and minimization:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**1. Effects:**
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>**Fatigue:** Repeated stress from vibration can cause metal parts (like leads, solder joints, traces) to weaken and eventually fracture.</li>
                                            <li>**Loose Connections:** Vibrations can cause connectors to become loose, leading to intermittent operation or complete open circuits.</li>
                                            <li>**Component Damage:** Sensitive components or those with mechanical parts can be damaged by excessive shock or prolonged vibration.</li>
                                            <li>**Wire Chafing:** Wires rubbing against each other or sharp edges can wear through insulation, causing short circuits.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>**II. Ways of minimizing the effects:**
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>**Mounting and Isolation:** Mounting the equipment on vibration-absorbing mounts or pads to isolate it from the source of vibration.</li>
                                            <li>**Robust Design and Construction:** Using robust connectors, providing strain relief for wires and components, securing components firmly to the PCB and chassis, using conformal coatings on PCBs, and selecting components rated for the expected vibration/shock levels.</li>
                                            <li>**Routing and Support:** Routing wires carefully and providing adequate support to prevent chafing and excessive movement.</li>

                                    </li>

                                <p><strong>(b) Design Features for High Availability (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Availability depends on both reliability (low failure rate) and maintainability (short repair time). Designers can incorporate features to improve both aspects.</p>
                                <p>Five features a designer should consider for high availability:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Modularity:** Designing the system as a collection of independent, easily replaceable modules. This simplifies fault isolation and speeds up repair by allowing replacement of a faulty module rather than repairing a component on a complex board.</li>
                                    <li>**Accessibility:** Ensuring critical components and test points are easily accessible for testing, removal, and replacement without extensive disassembly.</li>
                                    <li>**Built-In Test (BIT) / Diagnostics:** Including internal circuitry or software that can perform self-tests, identify faults, and indicate the location of the fault (e.g., via LEDs, display codes, or diagnostic interfaces).</li>
                                    <li>**Standardization:** Using standard, off-the-shelf components and connectors where possible, which are readily available for replacement and whose characteristics are well known.</li>
                                    <li>**Error Reporting/Logging:** Designing the equipment to detect and log errors or failures, providing valuable information for diagnosis.</li>
                                    <li>**Redundancy:** Implementing redundant subsystems for critical functions (as discussed in a(i)), allowing the system to continue operating after a failure (improves reliability, thus availability).</li>
                                    <li>**Simplified Interfaces:** Designing clear and simple user and maintenance interfaces.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Equipment Reliability Calculations from Component Data (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">To determine the reliability metrics for the equipment, we need to calculate the total failure rate from the component data in Table 1 (Figure 3). Assuming the components are in series (failure of any leads to system failure) and the test represents the useful life period (constant failure rate). The weighting factor (w) adjusts the base failure rate (\(\lambda\)) for factors like operating conditions, quality, or manufacturing process, effectively giving an adjusted component failure rate \(\lambda'_{comp} = \lambda \times w\). The total failure rate contribution of a component type is \(\lambda'_{comp} \times n\).</p>

                                <p>MTBF is the reciprocal of the equipment failure rate (assuming constant failure rate).</p>
                                \[ MTBF = \frac{1}{\lambda_{equipment}} = \frac{1}{2.66 \times 10^{-4}} \, \text{hours/failure} \]

                                <p>The operating period is given as \(t = 1000\) hours. Using the failure rate per 1000 hours directly:</p>
                                \[ \lambda_{equipment, per \, 1000hrs} = 26.6 / 100 = 0.266 \]
                                \[ R(1000) = e^{-0.266} \approx 0.7665 \]
                                \[ U(1000) = 1 - R(1000) = 1 - 0.7665 = 0.2335 \]

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers measuring the depth of modulation using a CRO, characteristics and calculations for ammeter shunts and voltmeter multipliers, and the theoretical basis for wattmeter measurement in AC circuits.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Measurement of Depth of Modulation with CRO (Timebase OFF) and Diagram (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">When the oscilloscope timebase is switched off, the horizontal deflection is disabled. Applying a signal to the vertical input (Y-input) causes the spot to move only up and down. For an amplitude modulated (AM) wave, the amplitude of the carrier varies according to the modulating signal. The resulting display is a vertical line whose length varies over time, tracing the maximum and minimum amplitudes of the AM envelope.</p>
                                <pre>

  (A_max) |-----------
          |          |

                                <figcaption>Figure 4: CRO Display of AM Wave (Timebase OFF - ASCII Art)</figcaption>
                                <p>**Explanation:** Connect the AM signal to the Y-input of the oscilloscope with the timebase switched off. The display will be a vertical line that oscillates in length. The maximum length of this line corresponds to the peak-to-peak amplitude of the modulated wave when the envelope is at its maximum (\(A_{max}\)), and the minimum length corresponds to the peak-to-peak amplitude when the envelope is at its minimum (\(A_{min}\)). The depth of modulation (modulation index, \(m\)) is calculated from these measured values:</p>
                                \[ m = \frac{A_{max} - A_{min}}{A_{max} + A_{min}} \]
                                <p>Where \(A_{max}\) is the maximum vertical deflection (peak-to-peak) and \(A_{min}\) is the minimum vertical deflection (peak-to-peak) observed on the screen. This is based on the relationship \(A_{max} = 2V_{max}\) and \(A_{min} = 2V_{min}\), where \(V_{max}\) and \(V_{min}\) are the maximum and minimum instantaneous amplitudes of the AM envelope measured from the zero axis.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">To extend the range of a moving coil instrument, shunts are used for ammeters (connected in parallel) and multipliers are used for voltmeters (connected in series).</p>
                                <p>Given: Moving coil instrument coil resistance \(R_m = 4 \, \Omega\). FSD current \(I_m = 20 \, mA = 20 \times 10^{-3} \, A\).</p>
                                <p>**(i) Three desirable characteristics of shunts:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Low temperature coefficient of resistance:** The shunt resistance should not change significantly with temperature to maintain accuracy across different operating temperatures. Manganin is commonly used.</li>
                                    <li>**Stable over time:** The resistance value should remain constant over the lifespan of the instrument.</li>
                                    <li>**Low resistance:** The shunt must have a low resistance value to divert the majority of the current and minimize the voltage drop across the ammeter.</li>
                                    <li>**Non-inductive:** For AC measurements (though this is a DC instrument question, shunts are also used for AC meters), the shunt should ideally be non-inductive.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Resistors required for range extension:**</p>

                                <p>I. To read up to 1 A (Ammeter): A shunt resistor \(R_{sh}\) is needed in parallel with the meter.</p>

                                <p>Voltage across shunt \(V_{sh} = I_{sh} R_{sh}\). At FSD, \(V_{sh} = V_m\).
                                \[ I_m R_m = I_{sh} R_{sh} \]
                                \[ 80 \, mV = 0.98 \, A \times R_{sh} \]
                                \[ R_{sh} = \frac{80 \times 10^{-3} \, V}{0.98 \, A} \approx 0.08163 \, \Omega \]
                                <p>A shunt resistor of approximately \(0.08163 \, \Omega\) is required for the 1A range.</p>
                                <p>II. To read up to 15 V (Voltmeter): A multiplier resistor \(R_{mult}\) is needed in series with the meter.</p>
                                <p>Total voltage \(V = 15 \, V\). The current through the meter and multiplier at FSD is \(I_m = 20 \, mA\).</p>
                                <p>The total resistance of the voltmeter (meter + multiplier) is \( R_{total} = R_m + R_{mult} \).</p>
                                <p>By Ohm's Law, \( V = I_m \times R_{total} \).</p>
                                \[ 15 \, V = (20 \times 10^{-3} \, A) \times (R_m + R_{mult}) \]
                                \[ 15 = 0.02 \times (4 + R_{mult}) \]
                                \[ \frac{15}{0.02} = 4 + R_{mult} \]
                                \[ 750 = 4 + R_{mult} \]
                                \[ R_{mult} = 750 - 4 = 746 \, \Omega \]
                                <p>A multiplier resistor of \(746 \, \Omega\) is required for the 15V range.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Average Power vs. Wattmeter Reading Proof (5 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">For an AC circuit with instantaneous voltage \(v(t)\) and instantaneous current \(i(t)\) lagging by an angle \(\phi\), the instantaneous power is \(p(t) = v(t) i(t)\).</p>
                                <p>Let \(v(t) = V_{peak} \sin(\omega t)\) and \(i(t) = I_{peak} \sin(\omega t - \phi)\).</p>
                                <p>Instantaneous power \( p(t) = V_{peak} \sin(\omega t) I_{peak} \sin(\omega t - \phi) \).</p>
                                <p>Using the identity \( \sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A-B) - \cos(A+B)] \):</p>
                                \[ p(t) = V_{peak} I_{peak} \frac{1}{2} [\cos(\omega t - (\omega t - \phi)) - \cos(\omega t + (\omega t - \phi))] \]
                                \[ p(t) = \frac{V_{peak} I_{peak}}{2} [\cos(\phi) - \cos(2\omega t - \phi)] \]
                                \[ p(t) = \frac{V_{peak} I_{peak}}{2} \cos(\phi) - \frac{V_{peak} I_{peak}}{2} \cos(2\omega t - \phi) \]
                                <p>The average power over one cycle is the integral of the instantaneous power over one period (\(T = 2\pi/\omega\)) divided by the period:</p>
                                \[ P_{avg} = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T p(t) dt = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi/\omega} \left[ \frac{V_{peak} I_{peak}}{2} \cos(\phi) - \frac{V_{peak} I_{peak}}{2} \cos(2\omega t - \phi) \right] dt \]
                                \[ P_{avg} = \frac{V_{peak} I_{peak}}{2} \cos(\phi) \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T dt - \frac{V_{peak} I_{peak}}{2} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \cos(2\omega t - \phi) dt \]
                                <p>The integral of \(\cos(2\omega t - \phi)\) over a full cycle (or integer multiple of cycles) of \(2\omega t\) is zero. So the second term's average is zero.</p>
                                \[ P_{avg} = \frac{V_{peak} I_{peak}}{2} \cos(\phi) \times 1 - 0 \]
                                \[ P_{avg} = \frac{V_{peak}}{\sqrt{2}} \frac{I_{peak}}{\sqrt{2}} \cos(\phi) = V_{rms} I_{rms} \cos(\phi) \]
                                <p>A wattmeter measures the average power in an AC circuit. The torque produced in a wattmeter is proportional to the product of the RMS voltage of the pressure coil, the RMS current of the current coil, and the cosine of the phase angle between them. If the wattmeter is connected correctly, the voltage across the pressure coil is the circuit voltage \(V\) and the current through the current coil is the circuit current \(I\), and the torque is proportional to \(V_{rms} I_{rms} \cos \phi\). The deflection of the pointer is proportional to the average torque. Therefore, the wattmeter reading is equal to the average power over one cycle, \( V_{rms} I_{rms} \cos \phi \).</p>

                                    <li>**Testing:** Performing basic operational checks or measurements (e.g., voltage, current, speed, temperature) to verify the equipment is functioning within specified parameters.</li>
                                    <li>**Adjustments:** Making minor adjustments (e.g., belt tension, alignment, calibration) to maintain optimal performance.</li>

                                <p>**(ii) Explanation of preventive maintenance:**</p>
                                <p>Preventive maintenance is a proactive maintenance strategy where maintenance tasks are performed at predetermined intervals or according to specified criteria (e.g., time-based, usage-based) while the equipment is still operating, in order to reduce the likelihood of failure or degradation of performance. Its goal is to prevent breakdowns by addressing potential issues before they cause significant problems. Examples include scheduled inspections, lubrication, cleaning, and component replacements based on expected lifespan (e.g., replacing filters, belts, or capacitors after a certain operating time).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Effects of Faults in Regulated DC Power Supply (Figure 2) (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 2 shows a typical linear regulated DC power supply consisting of a transformer, rectifier, filter capacitor (C1), IC regulator, and output capacitor (C2).</p>
                                <p>**(i) Diode D1 open circuit:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>D1 is one of the diodes in the bridge rectifier. If D1 opens, the bridge rectifier will effectively become a half-wave rectifier circuit (using D2 and D3, or D4 depending on connection).</li>
                                    <li>**Effect:** The output of the bridge will be pulsating DC from only half of the AC cycle. The ripple frequency will be the same as the input frequency (e.g., 50 Hz or 60 Hz) instead of double (e.g., 100 Hz or 120 Hz). The average voltage after the rectifier will be lower.</li>
                                    <li>**Symptom:** The voltage across C1 will have a much larger ripple amplitude and a lower average value. The IC regulator might fail to maintain a stable output voltage if its input voltage drops too low during parts of the cycle, resulting in a regulated output with significant ripple or a lower average value.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Capacitor C1 short circuit:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>C1 is the main filter capacitor after the rectifier. If it shorts out, it creates a very low resistance path across the output of the rectifier.</li>
                                    <li>**Effect:** This will essentially short-circuit the rectifier's output terminals. A large current will flow from the transformer secondary through the rectifier diodes and C1. This large current will likely blow a fuse (if present) or damage the transformer secondary winding and/or the rectifier diodes. The IC regulator will receive no voltage or a very low/shorted voltage at its input.</li>
                                    <li>**Symptom:** No output voltage from the entire power supply. Blown fuse, possible smell of burning, rectifier diodes or transformer may be hot or damaged.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(iii) Terminal 3 of the IC regulator open to ground:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Terminal 3 is typically the "Ground" or "Adjust" terminal of a 3-terminal regulator IC (like a 78xx or LM317). It provides the reference for the output voltage. For fixed regulators (like 78xx), it's directly connected to ground. For adjustable regulators (like LM317), it's connected to ground via a resistor.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Effect (Assuming 78xx type where terminal 3 is Ground):** If the ground connection is open, the regulator loses its reference. The internal feedback loop requires this terminal to be at ground potential relative to the output voltage regulation. Without a stable ground reference, the regulator cannot function correctly.</li>
                                    <li>**Symptom:** The output voltage will likely be unregulated and much higher than the rated voltage, potentially rising close to the input voltage (\(V_{in}\) to the IC). This can damage the connected load. Or, the regulator might simply shut down or produce unstable output depending on the IC design.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(iv) Capacitor C2 open circuit:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>C2 is the output filter capacitor after the IC regulator. Its function is to smooth out any remaining high-frequency ripple or transient voltages from the regulator output and improve load transient response.</li>
                                    <li>**Effect:** If C2 is open, the filtering of high-frequency components at the output is reduced or eliminated. The regulator's transient response to sudden changes in load current might also be degraded.</li>
                                    <li>**Symptom:** The output DC voltage may appear stable for steady loads, but closer inspection with an oscilloscope will reveal more high-frequency noise or ripple, and potentially larger voltage dips or overshoots when the load current changes rapidly. The DC voltage level should remain correct.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(d) Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) Calculation (3 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The repair rate (\(\mu\)) is the number of repairs completed per unit of time. It is the reciprocal of the Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).</p>
                                <p>Given: Repair rate \( \mu = 0.5 \).</p>
                                \[ MTTR = \frac{1}{\mu} \]
                                \[ MTTR = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \, \text{time units} \]
                                <p>Since the unit for the repair rate (0.5) is not specified (e.g., repairs/hour, repairs/day), the unit for MTTR will be the reciprocal of that unit. Assuming the repair rate is in repairs/hour, then MTTR is in hours.</p>
                                <p>Assuming repair rate is 0.5 repairs/hour, the MTTR is 2 hours.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Effective maintenance requires understanding common faults, their causes, and their effects on circuit or system operation, as well as quantifying maintainability using metrics like repair rate and MTTR.</p>

                                <p>**Description:** Silicon is a group IV element with 4 valence electrons. A trivalent impurity atom (group III element) has only 3 valence electrons. When a trivalent atom substitutes a silicon atom in the crystal lattice, it forms covalent bonds with three neighboring silicon atoms. The bond with the fourth silicon atom is incomplete, as the trivalent atom can only share 3 electrons, while the silicon atom has 4 electrons to share. This deficiency of an electron in the covalent bond creates a "hole". These holes are free to move throughout the crystal lattice, acting as positive charge carriers. The trivalent impurity atoms, having accepted an electron to complete three bonds, become fixed negative ions in the lattice. In a p-type semiconductor, holes are the majority carriers, and electrons are the minority carriers.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">Ernest Rutherford proposed a model of the atom based on the results of his gold foil scattering experiment (Geiger-Marsden experiment).</p>
                                <p>**Explanation:** Rutherford's model, sometimes called the nuclear model, described the atom as having:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A very small, dense, positively charged **nucleus** located at the center of the atom. This nucleus contains most of the atom's mass (attributed to protons and neutrons, although neutrons were discovered later).</li>
                                    <li>Negatively charged **electrons** orbiting around the nucleus in definite paths, much like planets orbiting the sun.</li>
                                    <li>The atom is mostly **empty space**, as evidenced by the fact that most alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil without deflection.</li>
                                    <li>The total positive charge of the nucleus is equal to the total negative charge of the orbiting electrons, making the atom electrically neutral.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This model replaced the earlier plum-pudding model but had limitations, particularly in explaining why orbiting electrons (which are accelerating charges) did not lose energy and spiral into the nucleus according to classical physics.</p>

                                <p>**Description:** The circuit consists of a series resistor \(R_S\) connected between the unregulated input voltage \(V_{in}\) and the Zener diode, which is connected in parallel (shunt) with the load \(R_L\). The Zener diode is connected in reverse bias. \(R_S\) limits the current flowing into the Zener and the load. When the input voltage \(V_{in}\) is greater than the Zener breakdown voltage \(V_Z\), the Zener diode enters the breakdown region and maintains a nearly constant voltage \(V_Z\) across its terminals and, therefore, across the parallel load \(R_L\). If \(V_{in}\) increases, the current through \(R_S\) increases; the Zener current \(I_Z\) increases while \(V_L\) remains nearly constant. If the load current \(I_L\) decreases (due to increasing \(R_L\)), \(I_Z\) increases to keep \(I_S\) constant (\(I_S = I_Z + I_L\)), maintaining \(V_L\) constant. Regulation is maintained as long as the Zener stays in breakdown (\(I_Z \ge I_{Z,min}\)) and its maximum current rating is not exceeded (\(I_Z \le I_{Z,max}\)). (Same as Q8c(ii) Nov 2018)</p>

                                <p>Voltage regulation is a measure of how well a power supply maintains a constant output voltage as the load changes. It is usually expressed as the percentage change in output voltage from no load to full load, relative to the full load voltage.</p>
                                \[ \% \text{Voltage Regulation} = \frac{V_{NL} - V_{FL}}{V_{FL}} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Voltage Regulation} = \frac{60 \, V - 56 \, V}{56 \, V} \times 100\% \]

                                \[ \% \text{Ripple} \approx 0.02232 \times 100\% \approx 2.232 \% \]

                                \[ \text{Loss in PE} = e V_a = (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C) \times (2000 \, V) = 3.2 \times 10^{-16} \, J \]

                                <p>**(iv) Gain in kinetic energy:**</p>
                                <p>According to the work-energy theorem, the gain in kinetic energy is equal to the work done by the electric field, which is equal to the loss in potential energy (assuming no other forces like friction are doing work). Starting from rest (initial KE = 0), the gain in KE is equal to the final KE.</p>
                                \[ \text{Gain in KE} = \text{Final KE} - \text{Initial KE} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - 0 \]
                                \[ \text{Gain in KE} = 3.2 \times 10^{-16} \, J \]
                                <p>The gain in kinetic energy is \(3.2 \times 10^{-16} \, J\). (Same as Q8b(iii) Nov 2018)</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Disadvantages of Field Effect Transistors (FETs) compared to Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) (4 marks):</strong></p>

                                    <li>**Sensitivity to Electrostatic Discharge (ESD):** Especially MOSFETs, the thin gate oxide is easily damaged by static electricity, requiring careful handling. While BJTs can also be damaged by ESD, MOSFETs are generally more sensitive.</li>
                                    <li>**Lower Transconductance:** FETs typically have lower transconductance (\(g_m = \Delta I_D / \Delta V_{GS}\)) compared to the transconductance (\(g_m = \Delta I_C / \Delta V_{BE}\) or \(g_m = I_C/V_T\)) of BJTs for the same operating current. This means that for the same change in input voltage, a BJT can provide a larger change in output current.</li>
                                    <li>**Limited Current Driving Capability:** Power BJTs can generally handle larger currents and powers compared to FETs of similar size, making BJTs often preferred for high-power switching or amplification applications.</li>
                                    <li>**Switching Speed (sometimes):** Although MOSFETs can switch very fast, BJTs sometimes offer faster switching speeds in specific high-current applications due to lower ON-resistance limitations in some power FETs.</li>

                                <p>**Principle of Operation:**</p>
                                <p>For proper operation, the gate-source PN junction is typically reverse-biased. For a P-channel JFET, this means applying a positive voltage to the gate relative to the source (\(V_{GS} > 0\)). The drain is connected to a negative voltage relative to the source (\(V_{DS} < 0\)) to cause holes to flow from source to drain.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A negative voltage \(V_{DS}\) is applied between the drain and source. This causes holes (majority carriers in the P-channel) to flow from the source (positive terminal) through the channel to the drain (negative terminal), constituting the drain current \(I_D\). The current direction is usually shown as flowing from drain to source (conventional current, positive direction).</li>
                                    <li>A positive voltage \(V_{GS}\) is applied between the gate and source. This reverse-biases the PN junction between the N-type gate and the P-channel.</li>
                                    <li>The reverse bias voltage creates a depletion region within the P-channel, depleted of free charge carriers. This narrows the conductive path of the channel.</li>
                                    <li>As the positive \(V_{GS}\) voltage is increased (made more positive), the reverse bias across the gate-channel junction increases, widening the depletion region and further constricting the channel.</li>
                                    <li>This increases the channel resistance and decreases the drain current \(I_D\) for a given \(V_{DS}\).</li>
                                    <li>If \(V_{GS}\) is made sufficiently positive, the depletion regions can meet, closing off the channel and reducing \(I_D\) to zero. This \(V_{GS}\) voltage is called the pinch-off voltage (\(V_p\)), which is positive for a P-channel JFET.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The P-channel JFET acts as a voltage-controlled resistor or current source, where the positive \(V_{GS}\) controls the negative \(I_D\) (or positive conventional \(I_D\) flowing S to D).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Common Emitter Amplifier DC Bias Calculation (14 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 3 shows an NPN BJT common emitter amplifier with voltage divider bias. We need to determine the DC bias voltages and currents (Q-point). We are given \(V_{BE} = 0.7 \, \mathrm{V}\) and the approximation \(I_C \simeq I_E\).</p>
                                <p>From Figure 3: \(V_{CC} = 12 \, \mathrm{V}\), \(R_1 = 20 \, k\Omega\), \(R_2 = 4.7 \, k\Omega\), \(R_C = 2.2 \, k\Omega\), \(R_E = 1 \, k\Omega\).</p>

                                <p>The base voltage is set by the voltage divider \(R_1\) and \(R_2\). Assume the base current \(I_B\) is small enough to be neglected compared to the current through the divider (valid if \(R_2 \ll \beta R_E\)).</p>
                                \[ V_B = V_{CC} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \]
                                \[ V_B = 12 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{4.7 \, k\Omega}{20 \, k\Omega + 4.7 \, k\Omega} = 12 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{4.7}{24.7} \]
                                \[ V_B \approx 12 \times 0.19028 \approx 2.2834 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The base voltage \(V_B\) is approximately 2.2834 V.</p>

                                <p>The emitter voltage is \(V_B\) minus the base-emitter voltage drop \(V_{BE}\).</p>
                                \[ V_E = V_B - V_{BE} = 2.2834 \, \mathrm{V} - 0.7 \, \mathrm{V} = 1.5834 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The emitter voltage \(V_E\) is approximately 1.5834 V.</p>

                                <p>The emitter current \(I_E\) flows through \(R_E\).</p>

                                <p>The emitter current \(I_E\) is approximately 1.5834 mA.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) \(I_{B}\) (Base current):**</p>
                                <p>Using the approximation \(I_C \simeq I_E\) and the relationship \(I_E = I_B + I_C\), we get \(I_E \simeq I_B + I_E\), which implies \(I_B \simeq 0\). However, to find the actual \(I_B\), we need \(\beta\) or use the more accurate relationship between \(I_C\) and \(I_B\). If we use the assumption \(I_C \simeq I_E\), it means \(\alpha = I_C/I_E \simeq 1\). If \(\alpha \simeq 1\), then \(\beta = \alpha/(1-\alpha)\) is very large, which supports the voltage divider assumption \(I_B\) is small. Let's assume we need to find \(I_B\) from the calculated \(I_E\) using \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\). We don't have \(\beta\). We can't calculate \(I_C\) from \(V_C\) yet. The assumption \(I_C \simeq I_E\) implies \(\alpha \approx 1\). If \(\alpha \approx 1\), then \(I_C = \alpha I_E \approx I_E\), and \(I_B = I_E - I_C \approx I_E - I_E = 0\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's re-read the question. It asks for \(I_B\). Using \(I_C \simeq I_E\) means \(I_B \simeq 0\), which isn't a specific value. It might mean to calculate \(I_E\) and then state that \(I_C \approx I_E\) and \(I_B \approx 0\). Or it implicitly expects a typical \(\beta\) or \(\alpha\) value. Let's calculate \(I_E\), state \(I_C \approx I_E\), and calculate \(I_B\) using \(I_B = I_E - I_C\). If we use \(I_C=I_E\), then \(I_B=0\). Let's use the more common approximation \(I_C \approx I_E\) to mean \(I_C = \alpha I_E\) where \(\alpha \approx 1\), or simply \(I_B \ll I_C, I_E\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">A better approach is to calculate \(I_E\), then use \(I_C \simeq I_E\) for the voltage drop calculation, but acknowledge that \(I_B = I_E - I_C\) is the exact relation. The question likely intends for us to find \(I_E\), use it for \(I_C\) in the voltage drop calculation, and then find \(I_B\) if \(\beta\) was known or expected. Without \(\beta\), we can't find \(I_B\) accurately beyond saying it's small. However, the steps ask for \(I_B\), \(I_C\), etc.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume \(I_C = \alpha I_E\) and \(I_E = I_B + I_C\). From \(I_C \simeq I_E\), let's assume \(\alpha \simeq 1\). If \(\alpha = 0.99\), \(\beta = 0.99/(1-0.99) = 99\). If \(\alpha=0.995\), \(\beta = 0.995/0.005 = 199\). Let's assume a typical \(\beta\) for this type of problem, e.g., \(\beta \approx 100\). Then \(\alpha = \beta / (1+\beta) = 100/101 \approx 0.9901\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">If \(I_E = 1.5834 \, mA\), and \(\beta \approx 100\), then \(I_B = I_E / (1+\beta) = 1.5834mA / 101 \approx 0.01568 mA = 15.68 \mu A\). And \(I_C = I_E - I_B = 1.5834mA - 0.01568mA = 1.56772mA\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">This makes \(I_C\) slightly different from \(I_E\). Let's assume the question means to calculate \(I_E\), and then state \(I_C \approx I_E\) and \(I_B \approx I_E / \beta\). But \(\beta\) is unknown. Given the ordering, it's more likely we are expected to calculate \(V_B, V_E, I_E\), then use \(I_C \simeq I_E\) to get \(V_C, V_{CE}\), and only then maybe \(I_B = I_E - I_C\). But if \(I_C \simeq I_E\), \(I_B\) would be nearly zero.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's use the voltage divider analysis to calculate \(V_B, V_E, I_E\). Then use \(I_C \approx I_E\) to calculate \(V_C\) and \(V_{CE}\). For \(I_B\), state it's small or related by \(I_B = I_E / (1+\beta)\) if \(\beta\) were known.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Revisiting the Q ordering: (i) \(V_B\), (ii) \(V_E\), (iii) \(I_E\), (iii) \(I_B\), (iv) \(V_C\), (v) \(V_{CE}\). There are two parts labeled (iii). Let's assume they are (iii) \(I_E\) and (iv) \(I_B\), and then (v) \(V_C\), (vi) \(V_{CE}\). This doesn't fit the 14 marks well unless some parts are simpler. Let's assume (i) \(V_B\), (ii) \(V_E\), (iii) \(I_E\), (iv) \(I_B\), (v) \(V_C\), (vi) \(V_{CE}\) and the marks are distributed. Let's use the approximation \(I_C \approx I_E\) for calculating voltage drops.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) \(I_{B}\) (Base current):** Use \(I_C \simeq I_E\) for voltage drop calc, but find \(I_B\) relation. \(I_B = I_E / (1+\beta)\). Without \(\beta\), we cannot find \(I_B\). Let's assume the question intends for us to find \(I_E\), state \(I_C \approx I_E\), and for \(I_B\), show the relationship \(I_B = I_E / (1+\beta)\) or \(I_B = I_E - I_C\). If \(I_C \simeq I_E\), then \(I_B \ll I_E\). Let's assume the simplest expected answer is just stating \(I_B\) is small or related to \(I_E\) via an unknown \(\beta\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the intended calculation is \(I_E\), then use \(I_C \approx I_E\) for subsequent voltage calculations, and calculate \(I_B\) based on the relation \(I_E = I_B + I_C\) and \(I_C = \beta I_B\). This requires \(\beta\). Let's assume the question expects the standard steps, including calculating \(I_E\), and then deriving \(I_B\) and \(I_C\) if \(\beta\) was given, or just stating \(I_C \approx I_E\) and that \(I_B\) is small. Given the marks, a calculation for \(I_B\) might be expected.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's look at the provided solutions in the instructions example (July 2022 Q1). It calculates \(I_B, I_C, I_E, V_B, V_C, V_{CE}\). It uses a specific \(\beta\). This implies \(\beta\) is either given or assumed in these problems. \(\beta\) is not given here. Let's assume there's a typical \(\beta\) intended, e.g., \(\beta=100\). Then \(I_B = I_E / (1+\beta) = 1.5834mA / 101 \approx 0.01568mA\). \(I_C = I_E - I_B \approx 1.56772mA\). This \(I_C\) is slightly different from \(I_E\), but the approximation \(I_C \simeq I_E\) might be used for calculating \(V_C\) and \(V_{CE}\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's try using the voltage divider analysis without the \(I_B\) negligible assumption: \(V_B = \frac{V_{CC} R_2 + I_B R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}\) and \(V_B = V_{BE} + I_E R_E = V_{BE} + (I_B + I_C) R_E = V_{BE} + (I_B + \beta I_B) R_E = V_{BE} + I_B (1+\beta) R_E\). Equating these allows solving for \(I_B\). This requires \(\beta\). Again, \(\beta\) is needed.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the simplest interpretation based on "Taking \(Vbe=0.7V\) and \(I_C \simeq I_E\)" is that we calculate \(V_B, V_E, I_E\), then use \(I_C = I_E\) exactly for voltage drop calculation, and then calculate \(I_B\) from \(I_B = I_E - I_C\). If \(I_C = I_E\), then \(I_B = 0\). This seems too simple for marks. Let's stick with \(I_C \approx I_E\) and calculate \(I_E\) accurately, then assume \(I_C \approx I_E\) for the next steps, and calculate \(V_C, V_{CE}\). For \(I_B\), let's state the relation and approximate its value as small.</p>

                                <p>**(i) \(V_{B}\) (Base voltage):** \( V_B \approx 2.2834 \, \mathrm{V} \).</p>
                                <p>**(ii) \(V_{E}\) (Emitter voltage):** \( V_E \approx 1.5834 \, \mathrm{V} \).</p>
                                <p>**(iii) \(I_{E}\) (Emitter current):** \( I_E \approx 1.5834 \, \mathrm{mA} \).</p>
                                <p>**(iv) \(I_{B}\) (Base current):** Using the approximation \(I_C \simeq I_E\), the base current \(I_B = I_E - I_C\) is very small compared to \(I_E\) and \(I_C\). The exact value depends on the transistor's \(\beta\), where \(I_B = I_E / (1+\beta)\). Without knowing \(\beta\), we cannot calculate the exact value of \(I_B\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the intended calculation requires a typical \(\beta\). Given the marks, let's assume \(\beta \approx 100\). Then \(I_B = I_E / 101 = 1.5834mA / 101 \approx 0.01568mA = 15.68 \mu A\).</p>
                                <p>**(v) \(V_{C}\) (Collector voltage):** Using the approximation \(I_C \simeq I_E \approx 1.5834 \, \mathrm{mA}\) for calculating the voltage drop across \(R_C\).</p>
                                \[ V_C = V_{CC} - I_C R_C \approx 12 \, \mathrm{V} - (1.5834 \, \mathrm{mA}) \times (2.2 \, k\Omega) \]
                                \[ V_C \approx 12 \, \mathrm{V} - (1.5834 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{A}) \times (2.2 \times 10^3 \, \Omega) = 12 \, \mathrm{V} - 3.4835 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                \[ V_C \approx 8.5165 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The collector voltage \(V_C\) is approximately 8.5165 V.</p>

                                <p>**(vi) \(V_{CE}\) (Collector-to-emitter voltage):**</p>
                                \[ V_{CE} = V_C - V_E = 8.5165 \, \mathrm{V} - 1.5834 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                \[ V_{CE} \approx 6.9331 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The collector-to-emitter voltage \(V_{CE}\) is approximately 6.9331 V.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Check operating region: \(V_{CE} \approx 6.93V\). \(V_{BE}=0.7V\). Since \(V_{CE} > V_{BE}\), the transistor is in the active region as expected for an amplifier. Also check \(V_C > V_E\). \(8.5V > 1.58V\).</p>
