                            <div class="answer-detail">
                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers fundamental concepts of errors in electrical measurements, resistance measurement methods, and calibration of a ballistic galvanometer.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Types of Measurement Errors:</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Gross Errors:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Explanation:** These are primarily human errors resulting from mistakes in reading instruments, recording observations, or connecting circuits. They are often large and easily identifiable if care is taken.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Environmental Errors:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Explanation:** These errors are caused by external conditions or surroundings affecting the instrument or the process of measurement. Examples include changes in temperature, humidity, pressure, or the presence of external magnetic or electrostatic fields.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(iii) Random Errors:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Explanation:** These errors remain even after gross and systematic errors have been accounted for. They are unpredictable fluctuations in measurements, usually caused by small, uncontrollable variations in the measurement system, environment, or observer's judgment. They tend to average out over many measurements.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Resistance Measurement by Ammeter-Voltmeter Method:</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Factors determining the choice of resistance measurement method:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Magnitude of the resistance:** Different methods are suitable for low, medium, and high resistances (e.g., Kelvin bridge for low, Wheatstone bridge for medium, Megger for high).</li>
                                    <li>**Required accuracy:** The desired precision of the measurement influences the choice of method and instrument. Bridge methods are generally more accurate than direct reading methods like the ammeter-voltmeter method.</li>
                                    <li>**Availability of equipment:** The instruments and bridges available will dictate which methods can be used.</li>
                                    <li>**Application:** Whether the measurement is for a laboratory experiment, industrial testing, or field troubleshooting affects the choice (portability, ruggedness, ease of use).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>**(ii) Ammeter-Voltmeter Measurement Calculation:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The circuit involves an unknown resistor \(R_x\) in series with a milliammeter, and a voltmeter connected across \(R_x\). The voltmeter has a sensitivity of \(1000 \Omega/V\) on a 150V scale and reads 100V. The milliammeter reads 5mA.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Voltmeter Sensitivity = \(1000 \Omega/V\)</li>
                                    <li>Voltmeter Scale = 150 V</li>
                                    <li>Voltmeter Reading = 100 V (\(V_m\))</li>
                                    <li>Milliammeter Reading = 5 mA (\(I_m\))</li>
                                    <li>Milliammeter resistance is neglected.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>First, calculate the internal resistance of the voltmeter (\(R_v\)):</p>
                                \[ R_v = \text{Sensitivity} \times \text{Full Scale Voltage} = 1000 \, \Omega/V \times 150 \, V = 150,000 \, \Omega = 150 \, k\Omega \]
                                <p>The milliammeter measures the total current \(I_m = 5 \, mA = 5 \times 10^{-3} \, A\). This current flows into the parallel combination of the unknown resistor \(R_x\) and the voltmeter's internal resistance \(R_v\). The voltmeter measures the voltage \(V_m = 100 \, V\) across this parallel combination.</p>

                                <p>**(I) Apparent value of the resistor:**</p>
                                <p>The apparent resistance is calculated by simply dividing the measured voltage by the measured current, ignoring the loading effect of the voltmeter:</p>
                                \[ R_{apparent} = \frac{V_m}{I_m} = \frac{100 \, V}{5 \times 10^{-3} \, A} = \frac{100}{0.005} \, \Omega = 20,000 \, \Omega = 20 \, k\Omega \]

                                <p>**(II) Actual value of the resistor:**</p>
                                <p>The apparent resistance \(R_{apparent}\) is the equivalent resistance of \(R_x\) in parallel with \(R_v\).</p>
                                \[ R_{apparent} = \frac{R_x \times R_v}{R_x + R_v} \]
                                \[ 20 \, k\Omega = \frac{R_x \times 150 \, k\Omega}{R_x + 150 \, k\Omega} \]
                                \[ 20(R_x + 150) = 150 R_x \quad (\text{dropping } k\Omega) \]
                                \[ 20 R_x + 3000 = 150 R_x \]
                                \[ 3000 = 130 R_x \]
                                \[ R_x = \frac{3000}{130} = \frac{300}{13} \approx 23.077 \, k\Omega \]

                                <p>**(III) Percentage error:**</p>
                                <p>Percentage error is typically \( \frac{|\text{Measured Value} - \text{Actual Value}|}{\text{Actual Value}} \times 100\% \). In this case, the measured value is the apparent resistance.</p>
                                \[ \% \text{Error} = \frac{|R_{apparent} - R_x|}{R_x} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Error} = \frac{|20 \, k\Omega - 23.077 \, k\Omega|}{23.077 \, k\Omega} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Error} = \frac{|-3.077 \, k\Omega|}{23.077 \, k\Omega} \times 100\% = \frac{3.077}{23.077} \times 100\% \approx 13.33\% \]
                                <p>The apparent value is lower than the actual value due to the voltmeter loading effect. The percentage error due to loading is 13.33%.</p>

                                     <img src="images/2015j_q1-fig1.png" alt="Diagram of Hibbert Magnetic Standard connected to a ballistic galvanometer. Shows a coil moving through a magnetic field produced by permanent magnets.">

                                <p class="answer-intro">The Hibbert Magnetic Standard is used to provide a known and reproducible change in magnetic flux linkage to calibrate a ballistic galvanometer (or fluxmeter). A ballistic galvanometer measures the total charge passed through it, which is proportional to the change in flux linkage.</p>
                                <p>**Description:**</p>
                                <p>The standard consists of a pair of powerful permanent magnets arranged to produce a strong, uniform magnetic field in a small air gap. A cylindrical soft-iron core is placed between the magnets to concentrate the flux. A long, narrow test coil with a known number of turns (\(N\)) is designed to pass through this air gap.</p>
                                <p>**Calibration Procedure:**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The test coil is connected directly to the terminals of the ballistic galvanometer.</li>
                                    <li>The test coil is initially placed outside the magnetic field of the standard (either above or below the air gap).</li>
                                    <li>The coil is then quickly moved through the air gap into the region of the strong, uniform magnetic field. As the coil enters the field, the magnetic flux linking with its turns changes from zero to a maximum value.</li>
                                    <li>This change in flux linkage induces a voltage in the coil, causing a pulse of current to flow through the ballistic galvanometer.</li>
                                    <li>The ballistic galvanometer undergoes a deflection (throw), which is proportional to the total charge that passed through it during the flux change. The total charge is also proportional to the total change in flux linkage (\(\Delta\Psi = N \Delta\Phi\)).</li>
                                    <li>The magnetic flux density (\(B\)) in the air gap of the standard is known (or can be determined). If the cross-sectional area (\(A\)) of the coil is also known, the total flux entering the coil is \(\Delta\Phi = B \times A\). Thus, the total flux linkage change is \(N \times B \times A\).</li>
                                    <li>By measuring the galvanometer deflection (\(\theta\)) corresponding to the known change in flux linkage (\(NB A\)), the ballistic constant \(K\) of the galvanometer can be determined:
                                        \[ K = \frac{NBA}{\theta} \]
                                        where \(K\) is the charge per unit deflection (Coulombs/division or Coulombs/radian). Once \(K\) is known, the galvanometer can be used to measure unknown changes in flux linkage in other magnetic circuits.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question focuses on soldering, electronic components (ICs vs. PCBs), fault location techniques, and different types of maintenance.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Soldering Terms and Procedure (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Definitions:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(I) Solder:** A fusible metal alloy, typically made of tin and lead or tin and other metals (like silver, copper for lead-free), used to create a permanent electrical and mechanical bond between metal surfaces. It has a melting point below that of the materials being joined.</li>
                                    <li>**(II) Flux:** A chemical cleaning agent used in soldering. Its primary purpose is to remove oxidation and other surface contaminants from the metals being joined and to prevent further oxidation during the soldering process, allowing the molten solder to properly wet and adhere to the surfaces.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Soldering Procedure:**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>**Prepare Surfaces:** Ensure the component leads and PCB pads are clean, free from dirt, grease, or oxidation. Tin the tip of the soldering iron with a small amount of solder.</li>
                                    <li>**Apply Heat:** Place the tip of the heated soldering iron in contact with both the component lead and the PCB pad simultaneously to heat them to the correct temperature.</li>
                                    <li>**Apply Solder:** Apply the solder wire to the junction of the heated surfaces (not directly to the iron tip). The solder should melt and flow onto and around the joint by capillary action, creating a smooth, shiny fillet. Use only enough solder to cover the joint adequately.</li>
                                    <li>**Remove Solder and Iron:** First, remove the solder wire, and then immediately remove the soldering iron tip from the joint.</li>
                                    <li>**Cool and Inspect:** Allow the joint to cool naturally and solidify without disturbing it. Inspect the joint visually for proper coverage, shine, and absence of defects like cold joints, bridges, or spikes. Clean off any flux residue if necessary.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(b) Electronic Components and Fault Location (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Distinction between IC and PCB:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Integrated Circuit (IC):** A miniature electronic circuit manufactured on a single piece of semiconductor material (usually silicon), containing many tiny transistors, resistors, capacitors, and other components interconnected to perform a specific function (e.g., amplifier, processor, memory chip). An IC is a *component*.</li>
                                    <li>**Printed Circuit Board (PCB):** A board made of insulating material (like fiberglass) with conductive pathways (traces) etched or printed onto its surface. Components (including ICs) are mounted onto the PCB, and their leads are soldered to the traces, providing mechanical support and electrical connections between the components. A PCB is a *platform* or *assembly* for components.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Methods of Fault Location:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(I) Functional Area Test:** This method involves dividing the electronic system into functional blocks (e.g., power supply, amplifier stage, logic circuit, output stage). Test signals are applied to the input of each block, and the output is monitored. By testing blocks sequentially or using a signal tracing/injection approach, the faulty block or area can be identified. This narrows down the problem before focusing on individual components.</li>
                                    <li>**(II) Half-Split Method:** This is a systematic troubleshooting approach. The technician starts by making a test or measurement approximately halfway through the suspected faulty circuit path. Based on the result (correct signal/voltage or incorrect), the technician can eliminate half of the remaining circuit and then repeat the "half-split" test in the remaining faulty section. This process quickly isolates the faulty component or section by repeatedly halving the possibilities.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Types of Maintenance and Planned Programme (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Types of Maintenance in an Electrical Workshop:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(I) Corrective Maintenance:** Also known as breakdown maintenance or reactive maintenance. This type of maintenance is performed *after* equipment has failed or broken down to restore it to normal operating condition. It is typically unplanned and can lead to costly downtime and emergency repairs.</li>
                                    <li>**(II) Planned Maintenance:** This encompasses maintenance activities that are scheduled and carried out according to a predetermined plan. It aims to prevent failures or identify potential issues before they cause breakdowns. It includes:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>**Preventive Maintenance:** Routine inspections, servicing, lubrication, adjustments, and component replacements performed at fixed intervals (time-based or usage-based) to keep equipment in good working order and prevent failures.</li>
                                            <li>**Predictive Maintenance:** Monitoring the condition of equipment using various techniques (e.g., vibration analysis, thermal imaging, oil analysis) to predict when maintenance is needed, allowing for scheduling repairs just before failure is expected.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Steps involved in carrying out a planned maintenance programme:**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>**Identify Critical Equipment:** Determine which equipment is essential for operations and whose failure would cause significant disruption or safety hazards.</li>
                                    <li>**Establish Maintenance Tasks and Intervals:** Based on manufacturer recommendations, equipment history, operating conditions, and criticality, define specific maintenance tasks (inspections, cleaning, lubrication, replacements) and how often they should be performed.</li>
                                    <li>**Develop Schedules:** Create a detailed schedule outlining when and by whom each maintenance task should be carried out. This can be time-based (e.g., monthly, annually) or usage-based (e.g., every 1000 operating hours).</li>
                                    <li>**Allocate Resources:** Ensure that the necessary labor (skilled technicians), tools, equipment, and spare parts are available when needed according to the schedule.</li>
                                    <li>**Execute the Plan:** Carry out the scheduled maintenance tasks as planned.</li>
                                    <li>**Record Keeping:** Maintain detailed records of all maintenance activities performed, including dates, tasks done, parts used, observations made, and any issues found.</li>
                                    <li>**Review and Adjust:** Regularly review the effectiveness of the planned maintenance program based on failure rates, downtime, maintenance costs, and equipment condition. Adjust tasks, intervals, and schedules as needed to optimize the program.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Understanding maintenance strategies, troubleshooting methods, and basic electronic assembly practices like soldering is crucial for ensuring the reliable operation of electrical and electronic systems.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers units, systems of units, standards of measurement, and error analysis.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Units and Systems of Units (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Explanation of "unit":**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A unit, in relation to measurements, is a specific magnitude of a physical quantity that is defined and adopted by convention or by law. It serves as a standard for measuring the same physical quantity. For example, the meter is a unit of length, and the ampere is a unit of electric current.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Differentiation between ESU and EMU:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Electrostatic System of Units (ESU):** This is a system of units based on the CGS (centimeter-gram-second) system, where electrical quantities are defined based on the force between electric charges (Coulomb's law) in a vacuum. The permittivity of vacuum (\(\epsilon_0\)) is taken as 1. Examples include the statcoulomb (unit of charge) and the statvolt (unit of voltage).</li>
                                    <li>**Electromagnetic System of Units (EMU):** This is also a system of units based on the CGS system, but electrical quantities are defined based on the force between electric currents (Ampere's force law) or magnetic poles in a vacuum. The permeability of vacuum (\(\mu_0\)) is taken as 1. Examples include the abcoulomb (unit of charge) and the abvolt (unit of voltage).</li>

                                <p>These two systems arose historically and have different dimensions for the same electrical quantities, related by the speed of light. The modern SI system integrates electromagnetism based on fundamental constants and is preferred in practice.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Standards of Measurements (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>Standards of measurement are reference values or objects used to define, realize, conserve, or reproduce a unit or quantity.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) International Standards:** These are the highest-level standards, maintained at international laboratories (like the International Bureau of Weights and Measures - BIPM). They are based on the fundamental definitions of SI units and serve as the ultimate reference for all measurements worldwide. They are not available for ordinary use but are used to calibrate national standards.</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Secondary Standards:** These are high-precision standards calibrated directly or indirectly against primary standards. They are maintained by national standards laboratories in different countries. They are used to calibrate working standards in industrial or research laboratories. They do not have the same accuracy as primary standards but are much more accessible.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Errors and Error Calculation (8 marks):</strong></p>

                                    <li>**(I) Absolute Error:** The difference between the measured value and the true or actual value of a quantity.
                                        \[ \text{Absolute Error} = \text{Measured Value} - \text{True Value} \]
                                        or sometimes expressed as the magnitude \( |\text{Measured Value} - \text{True Value}| \).</li>
                                    <li>**(II) Relative Error:** The ratio of the absolute error to the true value of the quantity. It can be expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage.
                                        \[ \text{Relative Error} = \frac{\text{Absolute Error}}{\text{True Value}} \]
                                        \[ \text{Percentage Error} = \frac{\text{Absolute Error}}{\text{True Value}} \times 100\% \]
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Actual (True) Value (\(R_a\)) = \(10.22 \, \Omega\)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(I) Absolute error of measurement:**</p>
                                \[ \text{Absolute Error} = R_m - R_a = 10.25 \, \Omega - 10.22 \, \Omega = 0.03 \, \Omega \]

                                <p>**(II) Percentage error:**</p>
                                \[ \text{Percentage Error} = \frac{\text{Absolute Error}}{R_a} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \text{Percentage Error} = \frac{0.03 \, \Omega}{10.22 \, \Omega} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \text{Percentage Error} \approx 0.002935 \times 100\% \approx 0.2935\% \]

                                <p>The absolute error is \(0.03 \, \Omega\), and the percentage error is approximately 0.2935%.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Equipment Reliability Terms (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Derating:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The practice of operating a component or equipment at a level significantly below its maximum rated capability (voltage, current, power, temperature) to reduce stress and improve its lifespan and reliability. For example, using a resistor rated for 1 Watt in an application where it will only dissipate 0.2 Watts.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Mean Time to Repair (MTTR):**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The average time required to diagnose and repair a failed equipment and return it to an operational state. It includes the time spent on fault detection, localization, isolation, repair, and testing. A lower MTTR indicates better maintainability.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Maintainability and Costs (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Terms with respect to equipment maintainability:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(I) Availability:** The probability that an equipment is in an operable state at any given time when required for use. It is a measure of the balance between reliability (MTBF - how long it works before failing) and maintainability (MTTR - how quickly it's fixed). Availability is often calculated as \( \frac{MTBF}{MTBF + MTTR} \). Higher availability means the equipment is operational more often when needed.</li>
                                    <li>**(II) Life Cycle Costs:** The total cost associated with an equipment or system from its initial concept and design, through manufacturing, operation, maintenance, and ultimately disposal. It considers not just the purchase price but also operating costs (energy, labor), maintenance costs (preventive, corrective, parts), downtime costs (lost production), and end-of-life costs. Designing for reliability and maintainability significantly impacts life cycle costs.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>**(ii) User's Costs vs. Availability Curves:**</p>

                                    <li>**(I) Equipment Price (or Initial/Acquisition Cost):** This cost generally increases as the required availability increases. Achieving higher availability often requires higher quality components, more robust design, redundancy, and more stringent manufacturing/testing, all of which add to the initial price. The curve typically slopes upwards, potentially becoming steeper at very high availability levels.</li>
                                    <li>**(II) Costs of Failure:** This represents the costs incurred when the equipment fails (downtime, repair labor, parts, lost production, safety issues). As availability increases (meaning failures are less frequent and/or quicker to fix), the costs associated with failures decrease significantly. The curve typically slopes downwards, steeply at low availability and leveling off at high availability.</li>
                                    <li>**(III) Total Cost:** This is the sum of the Equipment Price and the Costs of Failure. The total cost curve is typically U-shaped. It is high at low availability (dominated by failure costs) and also high at very high availability (dominated by high acquisition costs). The bottom of the U-shape represents the **Optimum Availability**, where the total cost to the user is minimized. This is the economically ideal level of availability to aim for.</li>

Includes circuit diagrams, block diagrams, test procedures, component layouts, part lists, calibration procedures, and sometimes fault isolation guides.</li>
                                    <li>**Installation Manual:** Provides instructions for installing and setting up the equipment, including power requirements, environmental considerations, physical mounting, and initial configuration.</li>

                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Signal Generator:** An instrument that produces various electronic signals (e.g., sine waves, square waves, pulses) with adjustable frequency, amplitude, and waveform. Used to inject known signals into circuits for testing and troubleshooting, or for aligning/calibrating equipment.</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Solder Sucker:** A manual or powered tool used to remove molten solder from a joint, typically for desoldering components. It works by creating a vacuum to suck up the molten solder.</li>
                                    <li>**(iii) Long Nose Pliers:** Pliers with long, slender jaws, often tapered, used for bending, holding, or manipulating small wires and components in tight spaces. Can also have cutting jaws.</li>
                                    <li>**(iv) Screw Driver:** A tool used to turn screws. Various types and sizes are available for different screw heads (slotted, Phillips, Torx, etc.). Essential for opening equipment enclosures or securing components.</li>
                                    <li>**(v) Multimeter:** A versatile measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one unit, typically including voltage (AC/DC), current (AC/DC), and resistance. Digital multimeters (DMMs) often include additional functions like continuity testing, diode testing, capacitance, frequency, and temperature measurement. Used for testing components, checking circuit voltages/currents, and verifying continuity/isolation.</li>

                                <p class="answer-intro">Moving-coil instruments inherently respond to the average value of current and can only measure DC quantities accurately. To measure AC current using a moving-coil instrument, a rectifier circuit is used to convert the AC current into a pulsating DC current, whose average value is then measured by the meter.</p>
                                <p>**Description of Operation:**</p>
                                <p>A common configuration is the full-wave bridge rectifier connected to a moving-coil instrument, often with a shunt resistor for range extension (as shown in Figure 2). The AC current to be measured flows into the bridge circuit. The diodes in the bridge rectify the AC current, converting both positive and negative halves of the input cycle into a unidirectional (but pulsating) current flowing through the moving-coil meter.</p>
                                <p>During the positive half-cycle of the input AC current, two diodes in the bridge are forward-biased, allowing current to flow through the meter in one direction. During the negative half-cycle, the other two diodes become forward-biased, again directing the current through the meter in the *same* direction as during the positive half-cycle. The meter's inertia causes its pointer to deflect based on the average value of this pulsating unidirectional current.</p>
                                <p>The instrument scale is typically calibrated in terms of the RMS value of a sine wave, based on the known relationship between the RMS and average values for a sine wave (\(V_{RMS} = V_{Avg} \times \frac{\pi}{2}\) or \(I_{RMS} = I_{Avg} \times \frac{\pi}{2}\)). For non-sinusoidal waveforms, the reading will be inaccurate because this relationship doesn't hold.</p>
                                <p>For current measurement, a shunt resistor is placed in parallel with the series combination of the bridge and meter to extend the range, similar to a DC ammeter shunt.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Maxwell's Bridge Derivation (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 1 shows a Maxwell's bridge, used to measure an unknown inductance (\(L_1\)) and its associated series resistance (\(R_1\)) by comparing them to a known capacitance (\(C_4\)) and resistances (\(R_2, R_3, R_4\)). At balance, the product of the impedances of opposite arms is equal:</p>
                                \[ Z_1 Z_4 = Z_2 Z_3 \]
                                <p>From Figure 1:</p>

                                    <li>\(Z_3 = R_3\) (Known non-inductive resistance)</li>
                                    <li>\(Z_4\) is \(R_4\) in parallel with \(C_4\). Its impedance is \( Z_4 = \frac{R_4 \times \frac{1}{j\omega C_4}}{R_4 + \frac{1}{j\omega C_4}} = \frac{\frac{R_4}{j\omega C_4}}{\frac{j\omega R_4 C_4 + 1}{j\omega C_4}} = \frac{R_4}{1 + j\omega R_4 C_4} \)</li>

                                \[ R_1 + j\omega L_1 = \frac{R_2 R_3}{R_4} (1 + j\omega R_4 C_4) \]
                                \[ R_1 + j\omega L_1 = \frac{R_2 R_3}{R_4} + j\omega \frac{R_2 R_3 R_4 C_4}{R_4} \]

                                <p>For this equation to hold, the real parts must be equal and the imaginary parts must be equal.</p>

                                <p>Cancel \(j\omega\) (assuming \(\omega \neq 0\)):</p>
                                \[ L_1 = R_2 R_3 C_4 \quad (2) \]
                                <p>Equations (1) and (2) give the expressions for the unknown resistance \(R_1\) and inductance \(L_1\) at balance in terms of the known components of the bridge.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers fundamental concepts in atomic structure, electron emission (thermionic emission and space charge), and energy band theory in different material types.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Charges in an atom (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>An atom is electrically neutral in its normal state, containing positively charged protons, negatively charged electrons, and neutral neutrons.</p>
                                <p>Any two of the following charges found in an atom:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Positive charge:** Carried by protons found in the nucleus.</li>
                                    <li>**Negative charge:** Carried by electrons orbiting the nucleus.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Electron Emission and Space Charge (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Definition of "work function":**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Work function (\(\Phi\)) is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the surface of a solid material, usually a metal, under standard conditions (e.g., at absolute zero temperature). It is typically measured in electron volts (eV).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Explanation:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(I) Formation of "space charge" in a vacuum diode:** In a vacuum diode, the cathode is heated to emit electrons (thermionic emission). These emitted electrons form a cloud of negative charge around the cathode. This cloud of electrons, called the space charge, repels further electrons from being emitted from the cathode and also repels electrons moving towards the anode, limiting the current flow for a given anode voltage. A sufficient positive voltage on the anode is required to overcome the space charge effect and draw a significant current.</li>
                                    <li>**(II) Process of thermionic emission and application:** Thermionic emission is the process where charge carriers, usually electrons, are emitted from a heated surface. When a material is heated to a sufficiently high temperature, some electrons within the material gain enough thermal energy to overcome the work function and escape from the surface into the surrounding vacuum or gas. This effect is pronounced in metals with low work functions or coated cathodes.</li>
                                    <li>**Application:** Thermionic emission is fundamental to the operation of vacuum tubes, such as vacuum diodes, triodes, tetrodes, pentodes, and the electron gun in Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Energy Band Diagrams (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">In solid materials, the atomic energy levels broaden and split into continuous bands due to the interaction between atoms. The most important bands are the valence band (where valence electrons reside) and the conduction band (where electrons can move freely to conduct current). The energy gap between these bands is called the forbidden energy gap (\(E_g\)) or band gap. The size of this gap determines the electrical conductivity of the material.</p>
                                <p>**(i) Conductors:**</p>

                                    <li>In conductors (like metals), the valence band and the conduction band overlap or are only separated by a very small energy gap.</li>
                                    <li>This means there are many electrons in the conduction band even at room temperature, or valence electrons can easily move into the conduction band because there is no significant energy barrier.</li>
                                    <li>These free electrons are readily available to carry current when a voltage is applied, resulting in high electrical conductivity.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>In insulators (like glass, rubber), there is a very large forbidden energy gap (\(E_g > 5 \mathrm{~eV}\)) between the valence band and the conduction band.</li>
                                    <li>The valence band is full, and the conduction band is empty.</li>
                                    <li>It requires a very large amount of energy (like a high voltage causing dielectric breakdown) for electrons to jump from the valence band to the conduction band.</li>
                                    <li>Therefore, very few free charge carriers are available to conduct current, resulting in extremely low electrical conductivity.</li>

                                    <li>In semiconductors (like silicon, germanium), there is a forbidden energy gap that is smaller than that of insulators (\(0 < E_g < 5 \mathrm{~eV}\)). For silicon, \(E_g \approx 1.1 \mathrm{~eV}\); for germanium, \(E_g \approx 0.7 \mathrm{~eV}\).</li>
                                    <li>At absolute zero temperature (0 K), the valence band is full, and the conduction band is empty, behaving like an insulator.</li>
                                    <li>At room temperature, thermal energy is sufficient to break some covalent bonds, allowing a small number of electrons to gain enough energy to jump from the valence band to the conduction band, creating electron-hole pairs.</li>
                                    <li>This results in a conductivity that is between that of conductors and insulators. The conductivity of semiconductors can be significantly increased by doping.</li>

                                <p class="answer-intro">An N-channel JFET consists of an N-type semiconductor channel with P-type regions diffused or implanted on opposite sides to form the gate. The operation relies on varying the effective width of the channel using a gate-source voltage, which in turn controls the current flow between the drain and source.</p>
                                <p>**Principle of Operation (Biased from two sources - \(V_{DD}\) and \(V_{GG}\)):**</p>
                                <p>In a two-source biasing setup:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A positive voltage \(V_{DD}\) is applied between the drain and source (\(V_{DS} > 0\)). This causes electrons to flow from the source (negative terminal) through the N-channel to the drain (positive terminal), constituting the drain current \(I_D\).</li>
                                    <li>A negative voltage \(V_{GG}\) is applied between the gate and source (\(V_{GS} < 0\)). This reverse-biases the PN junction between the P-type gate and the N-channel.</li>
                                    <li>The reverse bias voltage at the gate-channel junction creates a depletion region within the N-channel. This depletion region is devoid of free charge carriers and effectively narrows the conductive path of the channel.</li>
                                    <li>As the negative \(V_{GS}\) voltage is increased (made more negative), the reverse bias across the gate-channel junction increases, causing the depletion region to widen further and constrict the channel.</li>
                                    <li>This reduction in channel width increases the resistance of the channel, thereby decreasing the drain current \(I_D\) for a given \(V_{DS}\).</li>
                                    <li>If \(V_{GS}\) is made sufficiently negative, the depletion regions from either side can meet or nearly meet, closing off the channel and reducing the drain current to zero (or near zero). This \(V_{GS}\) voltage is called the pinch-off voltage (\(V_p\)).</li>
                                    <li>Conversely, making \(V_{GS}\) less negative (closer to 0V) reduces the depletion region width, widening the channel and increasing the drain current.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Thus, the JFET acts as a voltage-controlled resistor or current source, where the gate-source voltage \(V_{GS}\) controls the drain current \(I_D\).</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>From Figure 2, the gate is connected to a fixed voltage source \(V_{GG} = -2 \, \mathrm{V}\) through resistor \(R_G\). Since \(R_G\) is typically very large (to prevent gate current flow), there is negligible voltage drop across \(R_G\), so the gate voltage \(V_G = V_{GG} = -2 \, \mathrm{V}\).</li>
                                    <li>The source terminal is directly connected to ground (\(R_S = 0\)), so \(V_S = 0 \, \mathrm{V}\).</li>

                                    <li>**Drain voltage \(V_D\):** The voltage at the drain is \(V_{DD}\) minus the voltage drop across \(R_D\). From Figure 2, \(V_{DD} = 12 \, \mathrm{V}\) and \(R_D = 2 \, k\Omega\).
                                        \[ V_D = V_{DD} - I_D R_D = 12 \, \mathrm{V} - (2 \, \mathrm{mA}) \times (2 \, k\Omega) \]

                                <p>For this Q-point (\(V_{GS} = -2V, I_D = 2mA\)), check if the JFET is in the saturation region: \(V_{DS} = V_D - V_S = 8V - 0V = 8V\). We need \(V_{DS} \geq V_{GS} - V_p\). \(V_{GS} - V_p = -2V - (-4V) = 2V\). Since \(8V \geq 2V\), the JFET is operating in the saturation region as assumed for using Shockley's equation.</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Self Bias Configuration (Figure 3):**</p>
                                <p>Given \(I_{DSS} = 8 \, \mathrm{mA}\), \(V_p = -6 \, \mathrm{V}\). The Q-point is \(I_{DQ} = 4 \, \mathrm{mA}\). Assuming \(R_D = 3 R_S\). We need to determine \(R_S\) and \(R_D\).</p>
                                <p>In a self-bias configuration with the gate grounded through \(R_G\), \(V_G = 0 \, \mathrm{V}\) (since gate current is negligible, there is no voltage drop across \(R_G\)). The voltage at the source is \(V_S = I_D R_S\). The gate-source voltage is \(V_{GS} = V_G - V_S = 0 - I_D R_S = -I_D R_S\).</p>
                                <p>At the Q-point, \(V_{GSQ} = -I_{DQ} R_S\). We use Shockley's equation at the Q-point:</p>
                                \[ I_{DQ} = I_{DSS} \left( 1 - \frac{V_{GSQ}}{V_p} \right)^2 \]
                                <p>Substitute the known values and the expression for \(V_{GSQ}\):</p>
                                \[ 4 \, \mathrm{mA} = 8 \, \mathrm{mA} \left( 1 - \frac{-I_{DQ} R_S}{V_p} \right)^2 \]
                                \[ 4 \, \mathrm{mA} = 8 \, \mathrm{mA} \left( 1 - \frac{-(4 \, \mathrm{mA}) R_S}{-6 \, \mathrm{V}} \right)^2 \]
                                \[ 0.5 = \left( 1 - \frac{4 \times 10^{-3} R_S}{6} \right)^2 \]
                                \[ 0.5 = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1500} R_S \right)^2 \]
                                <p>Take the square root of both sides (we expect \(V_{GSQ}\) to be between \(V_p\) and 0V, so \(1 - V_{GSQ}/V_p\) is positive):</p>
                                \[ \sqrt{0.5} = 1 - \frac{R_S}{1500} \]
                                \[ 0.7071 \approx 1 - \frac{R_S}{1500} \]
                                \[ \frac{R_S}{1500} \approx 1 - 0.7071 = 0.2929 \]
                                \[ R_S \approx 0.2929 \times 1500 = 439.35 \, \Omega \]
                                <p>Using the relationship \(R_D = 3 R_S\):</p>
                                \[ R_D = 3 \times 439.35 \, \Omega = 1318.05 \, \Omega \]

                                <p>The value of resistor \(R_S\) is approximately \(439.35 \, \Omega\) and \(R_D\) is approximately \(1318.05 \, \Omega\).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) DC Load Line and Q-point (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The DC load line represents all possible operating points (\(I_C, V_{CE}\)) for the transistor circuit, independent of the transistor's characteristics. It is determined by the DC circuit components (\(V_{CC}, R_C, R_E\)). The Q-point (Quiescent point) is the actual operating point determined by the intersection of the load line and the transistor's characteristic curves (which are not drawn here).</p>
                                <p>The equation for the DC load line is derived from the voltage loop equation around the collector-emitter path:</p>
                                \[ V_{CC} = I_C R_C + V_{CE} + I_E R_E \]

                                <p>Rearranging to solve for \(I_C\):</p>
                                \[ I_C (R_C + R_E) \approx V_{CC} - V_{CE} \]
                                \[ I_C \approx \frac{V_{CC}}{R_C + R_E} - \frac{1}{R_C + R_E} V_{CE} \]
                                <p>This is a linear equation of the form \(I_C = m V_{CE} + c\), which defines a straight line on the \(I_C\)-\(V_{CE}\) plane. To draw the load line, we can find two points:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Y-intercept (when \(V_{CE} = 0\)):** \( I_C \approx \frac{V_{CC}}{R_C + R_E} \). This is the approximate saturation current.
                                        \[ I_{C,sat} \approx \frac{10 \, \mathrm{V}}{1 \, k\Omega + 0.56 \, k\Omega} = \frac{10 \, \mathrm{V}}{1.56 \, k\Omega} \approx 6.41 \, \mathrm{mA} \]
                                        So, point 1 is approximately \((V_{CE}=0, I_C=6.41 \, \mathrm{mA})\).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>**X-intercept (when \(I_C = 0\)):** \( V_{CE} = V_{CC} \). This is the cutoff voltage.
                                        \[ V_{CE,cutoff} = V_{CC} = 10 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                        So, point 2 is \((V_{CE}=10 \, \mathrm{V}, I_C=0)\).
                                    </li>
