(b) Figure 1 shows a circuit diagram of a permeameter used to test a ferro-magnetic specimen. The testing is done by reversing the current in the magnetising winding resulting in a deflection of 100 divisions on the galvanometer connected to coil X and 10 divisions on the galvanometer connected to coil Y. Each of the galvanometers have a constant of $25 \times 10^{-6}$ weber-turn per scale division. Coil X has 100 turns and effective area of $50 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ while coil Y has 10,000 turns and effective area of $5 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.

(i) flux density in the specimen;
(ii) flux density in the air;
(iii) magnetising force;
(iv) relative permeability of the specimen.
