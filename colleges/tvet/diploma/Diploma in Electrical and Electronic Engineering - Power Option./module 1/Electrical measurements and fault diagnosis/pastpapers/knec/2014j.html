                            <div class="answer-detail">
                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers fundamental concepts in electrical measurements, including unit systems, errors, and dimensional analysis.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Disadvantages of CGS system of units:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The magnitudes of some units are inconveniently small or large for practical electrical engineering applications (e.g., the abampere is very large).</li>
                                    <li>There are two distinct sets of units for electromagnetism (electrostatic units - ESU and electromagnetic units - EMU), which can be confusing and require conversion factors.</li>
                                    <li>Defining units based on hypothetical point charges or isolated magnetic poles in a vacuum can be less intuitive for practical use compared to definitions based on current and force (like in MKSA/SI).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Measurement Errors:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Gross Errors:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> These are human errors that result from carelessness, inexperience, or improper use of instruments or procedures. Examples include reading errors, incorrect recording of data, or connecting instruments improperly.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Minimization:</strong> Can be minimized by taking readings carefully, repeating measurements multiple times, using skilled personnel, and checking data against expected values.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Systematic Errors:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> These errors are consistent and repeatable under the same conditions. They are often caused by defects in instruments (instrumental errors), environmental conditions (environmental errors), or inherent flaws in the measurement method (methodical errors).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Minimization:</strong> Can be minimized by calibrating instruments regularly, controlling environmental factors (temperature, humidity, etc.), using standard procedures, and applying correction factors based on known systematic errors.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Dimensional Analysis of Eddy Current Loss:</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">We are given the expression \( W = f^x B_{max}^y d^z \rho^k \) and need to find the values of \(x, y, z, k\) using dimensional analysis in the MKSA system.</p>
                                <p>First, let's determine the dimensions of each quantity in the MKSA system (using M, L, T, I):</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>\(W\) (Power per unit length): Power is Energy/Time (\([ML^2T^{-2}] / [T] = [ML^2T^{-3}]\)). Power per unit length is \([ML^2T^{-3}] / [L] = [MLT^{-3}]\).</li>
                                    <li>\(f\) (Frequency): \([T^{-1}]\).</li>
                                    <li>\(B_{max}\) (Magnetic Flux Density): From \(F = I L B\), \(B = F / (IL)\). Force \(F = [MLT^{-2}]\), Current \(I = [I]\), Length \(L = [L]\). So \(B = [MLT^{-2}] / ([I][L]) = [MT^{-2}I^{-1}]\).</li>
                                    <li>\(d\) (Diameter/Length): \([L]\).</li>
                                    <li>\(\rho\) (Resistivity): From \(R = \rho L/A\), \(\rho = RA/L\). Resistance \(R = V/I\). Voltage \(V = W/Q = W/(IT)\). So \(R = [ML^2T^{-3}][T]/[I^2] = [ML^2T^{-3}I^{-2}]\). Area \(A = [L^2]\). Length \(L = [L]\). Thus, \(\rho = [ML^2T^{-3}I^{-2}][L^2]/[L] = [ML^3T^{-3}I^{-2}]\).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Now, equate the dimensions of both sides of the equation \( [W] = [f]^x [B_{max}]^y [d]^z [\rho]^k \):</p>
                                \[ [M^1L^1T^{-3}I^0] = ([T^{-1}])^x ([MT^{-2}I^{-1}])^y ([L])^z ([ML^3T^{-3}I^{-2}])^k \]
                                \[ [M^1L^1T^{-3}I^0] = [T^{-x}] [M^y T^{-2y} I^{-y}] [L^z] [M^k L^{3k} T^{-3k} I^{-2k}] \]
                                <p>Combine the exponents for each base dimension (M, L, T, I):</p>
                                <p>For M: \(1 = y + k\)</p>
                                <p>For L: \(1 = z + 3k\)</p>
                                <p>For T: \(-3 = -x - 2y - 3k\)</p>
                                <p>For I: \(0 = -y - 2k\)</p>

                                <p>Solve the system of linear equations:</p>
                                <p>From the I equation: \(y = -2k\)</p>
                                <p>Substitute \(y\) into the M equation: \(1 = (-2k) + k \implies 1 = -k \implies k = -1\).</p>
                                <p>Now find \(y\) using \(k = -1\): \(y = -2(-1) = 2\).</p>
                                <p>Substitute \(k = -1\) into the L equation: \(1 = z + 3(-1) \implies 1 = z - 3 \implies z = 4\).</p>
                                <p>Substitute \(y = 2\) and \(k = -1\) into the T equation: \(-3 = -x - 2(2) - 3(-1) \implies -3 = -x - 4 + 3 \implies -3 = -x - 1 \implies x = 2\).</p>

                                <p>The values of the constants are: \(x=2, y=2, z=4, k=-1\).</p>
                                <p>So the dimensionally correct expression is \( W = f^2 B_{max}^2 d^4 \rho^{-1} = \frac{f^2 B_{max}^2 d^4}{\rho} \).</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">This question tests the understanding of basic units and errors, and the important technique of dimensional analysis for verifying physical equations.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Factors affecting the performance of rectifier-type instruments:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Non-linear characteristics of the rectifier:** Diodes have non-linear voltage-current characteristics, especially at low voltages. This can cause distortion and affect accuracy, particularly for non-sinusoidal waveforms or at low signal levels.</li>
                                    <li>**Temperature variations:** The forward voltage drop and reverse leakage current of rectifiers are temperature-dependent. Changes in temperature can alter the rectifier's characteristics and introduce errors.</li>
                                    <li>**Frequency effects:** The capacitance of the rectifier junction and the inductance of the instrument coil can affect the rectification efficiency at higher frequencies, leading to frequency-dependent errors.</li>
                                    <li>**Waveform shape:** Rectifier instruments are typically calibrated on a sine wave and measure the average value (unless specifically designed otherwise). They are then scaled to read RMS for a sine wave. For non-sinusoidal waveforms, the relationship between average, RMS, and peak values is different, leading to inaccurate RMS readings unless a true RMS converter is used.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p class="answer-intro">A Q-meter measures the Q-factor of a coil by resonating it with a variable capacitor at a known frequency. To determine the self-capacitance (\(C_d\)) of the coil using the frequency doubling method, two resonance measurements are made at different frequencies.</p>
                                <p>At resonance, the inductive reactance equals the capacitive reactance:</p>
                                \[ \omega^2 L (C + C_d) = 1 \]
                                \[ L = \frac{1}{\omega^2 (C + C_d)} \]

                                    <figcaption>Figure 2: Measurement of Flux Density in a Ring Specimen (Ballistic Galvanometer Method)</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                                <p>**Description:**</p>
                                <p>The method uses a toroidal ring specimen made of the ferromagnetic material to be tested. A primary winding (magnetizing coil) with \(N_1\) turns is uniformly wound around the ring. A secondary winding (search coil) with \(N_2\) turns is wound over a small section of the ring. The search coil is connected to a ballistic galvanometer (or a fluxmeter).</p>
                                <p>1. The specimen is first demagnetized.</p>
                                <p>2. A steady current \(I_1\) is passed through the primary winding. This magnetizes the ring, creating a magnetic flux \(\Phi\) within it. This flux links with both coils.</p>
                                <p>3. The current \(I_1\) in the primary winding is then suddenly reversed. This causes the flux \(\Phi\) to reverse direction (from \(\Phi\) to \(-\Phi\)), resulting in a total change in flux of \(2\Phi\).</p>
                                <p>4. This rapid change in flux induces an electromotive force (e.m.f.) in the secondary winding. The induced e.m.f. causes a transient current to flow through the ballistic galvanometer, resulting in a deflection or "throw".</p>
                                <p>5. A ballistic galvanometer measures the total charge that passes through it, which is proportional to the change in flux linkages in the search coil.</p>
                                <p>6. By knowing the galvanometer's constant (charge per unit deflection) and the number of turns in the search coil, the change in flux can be calculated. Since the current was reversed, the total change in flux (\(2\Phi\)) is measured, allowing the flux \(\Phi\) to be determined.</p>
                                <p>7. The flux density \(B\) is then calculated by dividing the flux \(\Phi\) by the cross-sectional area \(A\) of the ring specimen (\(B = \Phi/A\)).</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Derivation of Expression for Flux Density:**</p>
                                <p>Let \(N_2\) be the number of turns in the search coil and \(\Phi\) be the flux in the core when the magnetizing current is \(I_1\). The initial flux linkage in the search coil is \(\Psi_1 = N_2 \Phi\). When the current is reversed, the flux reverses to \(-\Phi\), and the final flux linkage is \(\Psi_2 = N_2 (-\Phi) = -N_2 \Phi\).</p>
                                <p>The change in flux linkage is \( \Delta \Psi = \Psi_2 - \Psi_1 = -N_2 \Phi - (N_2 \Phi) = -2 N_2 \Phi \).</p>
                                <p>The induced e.m.f. in the search coil is \( e = -\frac{d\Psi}{dt} = -N_2 \frac{d\Phi}{dt} \).</p>
                                <p>The current through the ballistic galvanometer (resistance \(R_g\)) is \( i = e / R_{total} \), where \(R_{total}\) is the total resistance of the search coil circuit including the galvanometer.</p>
                                <p>The total charge \(Q\) passed through the galvanometer during the flux change is \( Q = \int i \, dt \). Assuming \(R_{total}\) is constant:</p>
                                \[ Q = \int \frac{e}{R_{total}} \, dt = \frac{1}{R_{total}} \int e \, dt = \frac{1}{R_{total}} \int -N_2 \frac{d\Phi}{dt} \, dt \]
                                \[ Q = -\frac{N_2}{R_{total}} \int_{t_1}^{t_2} d\Phi = -\frac{N_2}{R_{total}} (\Phi_2 - \Phi_1) = -\frac{N_2}{R_{total}} (-\Phi - \Phi) = \frac{2 N_2 \Phi}{R_{total}} \]
                                <p>The deflection \(\theta\) of a ballistic galvanometer is proportional to the charge \(Q\), i.e., \( Q = K \theta \), where \(K\) is the ballistic constant of the galvanometer (Coulombs per division or radian).</p>
                                \[ K \theta = \frac{2 N_2 \Phi}{R_{total}} \]
                                <p>From this, the flux \(\Phi\) is given by:</p>
                                \[ \Phi = \frac{K \theta R_{total}}{2 N_2} \]
                                <p>The flux density \(B\) is defined as flux per unit area:</p>
                                \[ B = \frac{\Phi}{A} \]
                                <p>Where \(A\) is the cross-sectional area of the ring specimen. Substituting the expression for \(\Phi\):</p>
                                \[ B = \frac{1}{A} \left( \frac{K \theta R_{total}}{2 N_2} \right) = \frac{K \theta R_{total}}{2 N_2 A} \]
                                <p>This is the expression for the flux density \(B\) in terms of measurable quantities and the ballistic galvanometer constant.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Resistance Measurement by Substitution Method:</strong></p>
                                <p>The substitution method for resistance measurement involves replacing the unknown resistor with a known standard resistor and adjusting conditions to get the same deflection on the detector (galvanometer in this case). The circuit typically involves a source, a variable resistor (or switch), the resistor under test, the standard resistor, and the detector.</p>

                                <p>Let \(R_s = 0.5 \mathrm{M}\Omega = 500 \mathrm{k}\Omega\) be the standard resistance.</p>
                                <p>Let \(R_x\) be the unknown resistance.</p>
                                <p>Let \(R_g = 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega\) be the galvanometer resistance.</p>
                                <p>Let \(R_c\) be the internal resistance of the source (and series resistance, if any, other than \(R_s\) or \(R_x\)).</p>
                                <p>Let \(V\) be the source voltage.</p>
                                <p>The current through the galvanometer is proportional to the voltage across it, which is determined by the total resistance in the circuit. Let the total resistance when the standard resistor is connected be \(R_{total, s} = R_c + R_s + R_g\). The current is \(I_s = V / (R_c + R_s + R_g)\).</p>
                                <p>When the unknown resistor is connected, the total resistance is \(R_{total, x} = R_c + R_x + R_g\). The current is \(I_x = V / (R_c + R_x + R_g)\).</p>
                                <p>The galvanometer deflection is proportional to the current. So, \(\theta_s \propto I_s\) and \(\theta_x \propto I_x\).</p>
                                <p>We are given \(\theta_s = 51\) divisions and \(\theta_x = 81\) divisions.</p>
                                <p>So, \(I_s = k \times 51\) and \(I_x = k \times 81\) for some proportionality constant \(k\).</p>
                                <p>Thus, \(I_x / I_s = 81 / 51\).</p>
                                <p>Substituting the expressions for current:</p>
                                \[ \frac{V / (R_c + R_x + R_g)}{V / (R_c + R_s + R_g)} = \frac{81}{51} \]
                                \[ \frac{R_c + R_s + R_g}{R_c + R_x + R_g} = \frac{81}{51} \]
                                <p>Assuming the source resistance \(R_c\) is negligible or constant and cancels out effectively in the substitution comparison, and the galvanometer resistance \(R_g\) is constant and part of the resistance in the galvanometer branch:</p>
                                \[ \frac{R_s + R_g}{R_x + R_g} = \frac{81}{51} \]
                                <p>Substitute values \(R_s = 500 \mathrm{k}\Omega\) and \(R_g = 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega\):</p>
                                \[ \frac{500 \mathrm{k}\Omega + 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega}{R_x + 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega} = \frac{81}{51} \]
                                \[ \frac{520 \mathrm{k}\Omega}{R_x + 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega} = \frac{81}{51} \]
                                <p>Solve for \(R_x\):</p>
                                \[ 51 \times 520 \mathrm{k}\Omega = 81 \times (R_x + 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega) \]
                                \[ 26520 \mathrm{k}\Omega = 81 R_x + 1620 \mathrm{k}\Omega \]
                                \[ 81 R_x = 26520 \mathrm{k}\Omega - 1620 \mathrm{k}\Omega \]
                                \[ 81 R_x = 24900 \mathrm{k}\Omega \]
                                \[ R_x = \frac{24900}{81} \mathrm{k}\Omega \]
                                \[ R_x \approx 307.41 \mathrm{k}\Omega \]

                                <p>The value of the unknown resistor is approximately \(307.41 \mathrm{k}\Omega\) or \(0.30741 \mathrm{M}\Omega\).</p>

                                    <li>**Description:** Eddy currents can be induced in conductive components of the bridge, particularly in coils, transformer cores, and even the shields or casings, when subjected to time-varying magnetic fields (as in AC bridges). These induced currents dissipate energy and affect the effective impedance of the components, leading to errors in measurement.</li>
                                    <li>**Precautions:** Use high-resistance materials for component cores (e.g., laminated iron or ferrite cores), avoid large conductive loops in the circuit layout, use braided conductors where necessary, and ensure proper shielding.</li>

                                    <li>**Description:** Stray conductances exist between bridge components, wiring, and ground due to imperfect insulation or leakage. These paths, effectively parallel to the intended impedances, allow small currents to flow, disturbing the balance condition and introducing errors, especially at higher frequencies or when measuring high impedances.</li>
                                    <li>**Precautions:** Use good quality insulating materials, keep wiring short and well-separated, use shielding where appropriate and connect shields strategically (e.g., to one terminal of the detector or source), and design the layout to minimize parasitic capacitances and associated leakage paths.</li>

                                <p>For the equation to hold, the real parts must be equal, and the imaginary parts must be equal:</p>

                                <p>Let's calculate the term \( \omega^2 R_4^2 C_4^2 \) first:</p>
                                \[ \omega^2 R_4^2 C_4^2 = (8000\pi)^2 \times (1500)^2 \times (0.8 \times 10^{-6})^2 \]
                                \[ = (64 \times 10^6 \pi^2) \times (2.25 \times 10^6) \times (0.64 \times 10^{-12}) \]
                                \[ \approx (64 \times 9.8696 \times 2.25 \times 0.64) \times 10^{6+6-12} \]
                                \[ \approx 904.78 \]
                                <p>Now calculate \(R_1\):</p>
                                \[ R_1 = \frac{\omega^2 R_4^2 C_4^2 \times R_2 R_3}{1 + \omega^2 R_4^2 C_4^2} = \frac{904.78 \times (300 \times 700)}{1 + 904.78} \]

                                \[ L_1 \approx 0.1854 \, \mathrm{mH} \]
                                <div class="key-point">Note: These calculated values correspond to a Q-factor \(Q = \omega L_1 / R_1 \approx (8000\pi \times 0.1854 \times 10^{-3}) / 209.76 \times 10^3 \approx 0.022 / 209.76 \approx 0.0001\), which is extremely low.

                                    <li>Hay's bridge is more suitable for measuring coils with high Q-factors (Q > 10). Maxwell's bridge becomes less accurate or requires impractically large standard capacitors when measuring high-Q coils.</li>

                                <p><strong>(c) Two-Wattmeter Method (3-Phase Power):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The two-wattmeter method is used to measure the total power in a three-phase system using two wattmeters connected to any two lines, with their current coils in series with the lines and voltage coils connected between the corresponding line and the third line.</p>
                                <p>The total power \(P_T\) is the sum of the readings of the two wattmeters: \( P_T = P_1 + P_2 \).</p>
                                <p>For a load with phase angle \(\phi\), the readings of the two wattmeters are given by:</p>
                                \[ P_1 = V_L I_L \cos(30^\circ - \phi) \]
                                \[ P_2 = V_L I_L \cos(30^\circ + \phi) \]
                                <p>Where \(V_L\) is the line voltage, \(I_L\) is the line current, and \(\phi\) is the phase angle of the load (angle between phase voltage and phase current). For a lagging power factor, \(\phi\) is positive.</p>
                                <p>The power factor (PF) is given by \( \cos \phi \). We are given \( \text{PF} = 0.4 \) lagging. Therefore, \( \phi = \arccos(0.4) \).</p>
                                <p>Calculate \(\phi\): \( \phi = \arccos(0.4) \approx 66.42^\circ \).</p>
                                <p>We are given the total power \( P_T = P_1 + P_2 = 30 \mathrm{kW} \).</p>

                                <p>The ratio of the wattmeter readings is related to the tangent of the phase angle:</p>
                                \[ \tan \phi = \sqrt{3} \frac{P_1 - P_2}{P_1 + P_2} \]
                                <p>We know \(P_1 + P_2 = 30 \mathrm{kW}\) and \( \tan \phi = \tan(66.42^\circ) \approx 2.291 \).</p>
                                <p>Substitute the values:</p>
                                \[ 2.291 = \sqrt{3} \frac{P_1 - P_2}{30} \]
                                \[ 2.291 \times 30 = \sqrt{3} (P_1 - P_2) \]
                                \[ 68.73 = 1.732 (P_1 - P_2) \]
                                \[ P_1 - P_2 = \frac{68.73}{1.732} \approx 39.68 \mathrm{kW} \quad (1) \]
                                <p>We have a system of two linear equations:</p>
                                <p>\( P_1 + P_2 = 30 \mathrm{kW} \quad (2) \)</p>
                                <p>\( P_1 - P_2 = 39.68 \mathrm{kW} \quad (1) \)</p>
                                <p>Add the two equations:</p>
                                \[ (P_1 + P_2) + (P_1 - P_2) = 30 + 39.68 \]
                                \[ 2 P_1 = 69.68 \]
                                \[ P_1 = \frac{69.68}{2} = 34.84 \mathrm{kW} \]
                                <p>Substitute \(P_1\) back into equation (2):</p>
                                \[ 34.84 + P_2 = 30 \]
                                \[ P_2 = 30 - 34.84 = -4.84 \mathrm{kW} \]

                                <p>Check the ratio: \( \frac{P_1 - P_2}{P_1 + P_2} = \frac{34.84 - (-4.84)}{30} = \frac{39.68}{30} \approx 1.323 \). And \( \frac{\tan \phi}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2.291}{1.732} \approx 1.323 \). The values are consistent.</p>
                                <p>When the power factor is less than 0.5 lagging (angle greater than 60 degrees), one of the wattmeters will have a negative reading. Here, \( \phi \approx 66.42^\circ \), which is greater than 60 degrees, so a negative reading is expected.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">The readings of the two wattmeters are approximately \(P_1 = 34.84 \mathrm{kW}\) and \(P_2 = -4.84 \mathrm{kW}\).</p>

                                    <li>**Degradation Failure:** A failure where the equipment performance gradually deteriorates over time until it no longer meets the required specifications, but it doesn't stop functioning immediately. Examples: reduced output power of a power supply, increasing noise level in an amplifier, gradual decrease in battery capacity.</li>
                                    <li>**Catastrophic Failure:** A failure that is sudden and complete, causing the equipment to stop functioning entirely and abruptly. Examples: a fuse blowing, a component short-circuiting or opening, a structural break.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>**Complete Failure:** The equipment ceases to perform its intended function altogether. This is similar to a catastrophic failure in its outcome, though the cause might be different (e.g., software crash leading to complete system halt).</li>
                                    <li>**Partial Failure:** The equipment continues to function but only delivers some of its intended performance, operating below the required standard or exhibiting specific faulty behavior. Examples: intermittent operation, reduced accuracy, only some features working, output distorted but still present. This is similar to a degradation failure reaching an unacceptable state.</li>

                                <p class="answer-intro">The relationship between reliability and cost is complex and typically involves balancing several cost factors. We can generally consider three main cost curves:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Production Cost Curve:** As reliability increases, the production cost generally increases sharply. Achieving higher reliability requires better quality components, more stringent manufacturing processes, stricter quality control, and potentially redundant systems, all of which add to the cost of manufacturing. This curve is typically convex and steepens significantly at very high reliability levels.</li>
                                    <li>**Design and Development Cost Curve:** Increasing reliability also leads to higher design and development costs. More complex design, extensive testing, simulation, and refinement are needed to identify potential failure modes and improve robustness. This curve is also generally convex, showing diminishing returns in reliability improvement for increasing design investment at higher levels.</li>
                                    <li>**Maintenance and Repair Cost Curve:** This cost category includes costs associated with diagnosing failures, replacing components, labor, downtime, and lost productivity due to equipment malfunction. As reliability increases, the frequency of failures decreases, leading to lower maintenance and repair costs. This curve is typically concave and decreases sharply as reliability improves, leveling off at very high reliability where failures are rare.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The total cost is the sum of these curves. The optimal reliability level from an economic perspective is where the total cost is minimized. This point represents a balance between the investment in achieving reliability (design/production costs) and the savings achieved by having higher reliability (lower maintenance costs).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Equipment Reliability Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">To determine the reliability of the equipment, we first need to calculate the total failure rate of the system. For a series system (where the failure of any component leads to the failure of the whole system), the total failure rate is the sum of the individual failure rates of its components.</p>
                                <p>First, convert percentage failure rates per 1000 hours to a fractional rate per hour or per 1000 hours (as a decimal).</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Transistors: \( \lambda_{transistor} = 0.01\% / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 0.01/100 / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 1 \times 10^{-4} / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 1 \times 10^{-7} / \text{hr} \)</li>
                                    <li>Resistors: \( \lambda_{resistor} = 0.04\% / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 0.04/100 / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 4 \times 10^{-4} / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 4 \times 10^{-7} / \text{hr} \)</li>
                                    <li>Capacitors: \( \lambda_{capacitor} = 0.03\% / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 0.03/100 / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 3 \times 10^{-4} / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 3 \times 10^{-7} / \text{hr} \)</li>
                                    <li>Soldered Connections: \( \lambda_{connection} = 0.01\% / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 0.01/100 / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 1 \times 10^{-4} / 1000 \text{ hrs} = 1 \times 10^{-7} / \text{hr} \)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Now calculate the total failure rate for each type of component based on the quantity:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Total transistor failure rate: \( \lambda_{total, transistor} = 10 \times \lambda_{transistor} = 10 \times 1 \times 10^{-7} / \text{hr} = 1 \times 10^{-6} / \text{hr} \)</li>
                                    <li>Total resistor failure rate: \( \lambda_{total, resistor} = 40 \times \lambda_{resistor} = 40 \times 4 \times 10^{-7} / \text{hr} = 16 \times 10^{-6} / \text{hr} = 1.6 \times 10^{-5} / \text{hr} \)</li>
                                    <li>Total capacitor failure rate: \( \lambda_{total, capacitor} = 20 \times \lambda_{capacitor} = 20 \times 3 \times 10^{-7} / \text{hr} = 6 \times 10^{-6} / \text{hr} \)</li>
                                    <li>Total connection failure rate: \( \lambda_{total, connection} = 50 \times \lambda_{connection} = 50 \times 1 \times 10^{-7} / \text{hr} = 5 \times 10^{-6} / \text{hr} \)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The total system failure rate (\(\lambda_{system}\)) is the sum of the total failure rates for each component type:</p>
                                \[ \lambda_{system} = \lambda_{total, transistor} + \lambda_{total, resistor} + \lambda_{total, capacitor} + \lambda_{total, connection} \]
                                \[ \lambda_{system} = (1 \times 10^{-6}) + (1.6 \times 10^{-5}) + (6 \times 10^{-6}) + (5 \times 10^{-6}) / \text{hr} \]
                                \[ \lambda_{system} = (1 + 16 + 6 + 5) \times 10^{-6} / \text{hr} \]
                                \[ \lambda_{system} = 28 \times 10^{-6} / \text{hr} = 2.8 \times 10^{-5} / \text{hr} \]

                                <p>The reliability \(R(t)\) for a time period \(t\) is given by the exponential reliability function \( R(t) = e^{-\lambda_{system} t} \), assuming a constant failure rate (often a simplification for electronic components in their useful life period).</p>

                                <p>**(i) Reliability for an operating period of 1000 hours:**</p>
                                <p>Here, \( t = 1000 \) hours.</p>
                                \[ R(1000) = e^{-(2.8 \times 10^{-5} / \text{hr}) \times 1000 \text{ hrs}} \]
                                \[ R(1000) = e^{-2.8 \times 10^{-2}} = e^{-0.028} \]
                                \[ R(1000) \approx 0.9724 \]
                                <p>The reliability for an operating period of 1000 hours is approximately 0.9724 or 97.24%.</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Reliability with a mean time between failure (MTBF) of 100,000 hours during the same period of operation (1000 hours):**</p>
                                <p>The MTBF is the reciprocal of the failure rate (\( \text{MTBF} = 1/\lambda_{system} \)). If the MTBF is given as 100,000 hours, this implies a failure rate of \( \lambda'_{system} = 1 / 100,000 \, \text{hr}^{-1} = 1 \times 10^{-5} / \text{hr} \).</p>
                                <p>Note that this failure rate (\(1 \times 10^{-5} / \text{hr}\)) is different from the one calculated from the component data (\(2.8 \times 10^{-5} / \text{hr}\)). The question seems to be asking for the reliability calculation using this *given* MTBF of 100,000 hours, for the same operating period \(t = 1000\) hours.</p>
                                <p>Using \( \lambda'_{system} = 1 \times 10^{-5} / \text{hr} \) and \( t = 1000 \) hours:</p>
                                \[ R(1000) = e^{-\lambda'_{system} t} = e^{-(1 \times 10^{-5} / \text{hr}) \times 1000 \text{ hrs}} \]
                                \[ R(1000) = e^{-1 \times 10^{-2}} = e^{-0.01} \]
                                \[ R(1000) \approx 0.99005 \]
                                <p>The reliability for an operating period of 1000 hours, given an MTBF of 100,000 hours, is approximately 0.9901 or 99.01%.</p>
                                <div class="key-point">Note: The question provides two ways to get a system failure rate (from component data and from a given MTBF). Part (i) uses the component data to calculate \(\lambda\), and Part (ii) provides a different MTBF which implies a different \(\lambda\). Both calculations are shown based on these distinct values.</div>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Understanding failure types and the economic considerations of reliability is crucial for designing and maintaining electrical and electronic systems.</p>

                                <p><strong>(e) Percentage Error of Series Resistors:</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">When resistors with tolerances are connected in series, the nominal total resistance is the sum of the nominal resistances. The maximum possible error in the total resistance is the sum of the individual absolute errors.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>

                                <p>The percentage error in the series connection is the maximum absolute error divided by the nominal total resistance, multiplied by 100%:</p>

                                \[ \% \text{Error} = \frac{6 \Omega}{120 \Omega} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Error} = \frac{1}{20} \times 100\% = 5\% \]

                                <p>The percentage error of the series combination is 5%.</p>
                                 <div class="key-point">Note: For components connected in series or parallel, if the individual component errors are given as percentages of their own nominal values, the percentage error of the total combination is generally *not* the simple sum or average of individual percentage errors. However, for series resistances, the percentage error of the sum is the sum of the absolute errors divided by the sum of the nominal values. In this specific case, because the individual percentage errors are the same (5%), the resulting percentage error for the series sum also happens to be 5%. This is a special case; if the percentages were different, the resulting percentage error would be different from the individual ones.</div>

                                    <li>**(i) Diffusion:** The movement of charge carriers (electrons and holes) from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, driven by the concentration gradient.

                                <p class="answer-intro">An NPN bipolar junction transistor (BJT) consists of three semiconductor layers: a p-type base sandwiched between two n-type layers, the emitter and the collector. It has two PN junctions: the emitter-base junction (EBJ) and the collector-base junction (CBJ).</p>

                                    <li>The emitter-base junction (EBJ) is forward-biased. This is achieved by applying a positive voltage to the base relative to the emitter (\(V_{BE} > 0\)). The forward bias causes a large number of free electrons from the n-type emitter to diffuse across the EBJ into the p-type base. Holes from the base also diffuse into the emitter, but the emitter is heavily doped compared to the base, so the electron injection from emitter to base is dominant.</li>
                                    <li>The collector-base junction (CBJ) is reverse-biased. This is achieved by applying a positive voltage to the collector relative to the base (\(V_{CB} > 0\)) or a sufficiently large positive voltage to the collector relative to the emitter (\(V_{CE} > V_{BE}\)). The reverse bias creates a depletion region at the CBJ.</li>

                                    <li>Only a small fraction (typically less than 5%) of these electrons recombine with holes in the base, forming the base current (\(I_B\)).</li>
                                    <li>The vast majority (typically more than 95%) of the electrons that reach the edge of the CBJ depletion region are swept across the reverse-biased CBJ into the collector due to the strong electric field. These electrons constitute the collector current (\(I_C\)).</li>
                                    <li>The total emitter current \(I_E\) is the sum of the base current \(I_B\) and the collector current \(I_C\): \(I_E = I_B + I_C\).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The collector current is approximately proportional to the base current (\(I_C = \beta I_B\)) and also strongly dependent on the emitter-base voltage (\(V_{BE}\)), allowing the transistor to amplify a small base current or base voltage signal into a larger collector current.</p>

                                    <li>**Reverse Bias Region (V<sub>D</sub> < 0):** When a negative voltage is applied to the anode relative to the cathode, the diode is reverse-biased. Only a very small current flows, called the reverse saturation current (\(I_S\)). This current is ideally constant with increasing reverse voltage but is dependent on temperature. \(I_S\) is typically in the microampere (\(\mu \mathrm{A}\)) or nanoampere (\(\mathrm{nA}\)) range.</li>
                                    <li>**Reverse Breakdown Region (V<sub>D</sub> < -V<sub>BR</sub>):** If the reverse voltage increases beyond a certain point, called the reverse breakdown voltage (\(V_{BR}\)), the current increases rapidly and steeply in the reverse direction. This can occur due to avalanche breakdown or Zener breakdown. This region is normally avoided in standard rectifying diodes but is the operating region for Zener diodes used in voltage regulation. Operating in this region without limiting the current can destroy the diode.</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) Transistor Differences and Precautions:</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Differences between Bipolar (BJT) and Unipolar (FET) Junction Transistors:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Charge Carriers:** BJTs (like NPN, PNP) use both majority and minority carriers (bipolar) for conduction. FETs (like JFET, MOSFET) use only one type of carrier (majority carriers - unipolar) for conduction in the channel.</li>
                                    <li>**Input Impedance:** BJTs are current-controlled devices (a small base current controls a larger collector current), and they have relatively low input impedance (especially the base terminal). FETs are voltage-controlled devices (a gate voltage controls the channel current), and they have very high input impedance (especially MOSFETs due to the insulated gate).</li>
                                    <li>**Control Mechanism:** In BJTs, the output current (\(I_C\)) is controlled by the input current (\(I_B\)) or voltage (\(V_{BE}\)). In FETs, the output current (\(I_D\)) is controlled by the input voltage (\(V_{GS}\)).</li>
                                    <li>**Terminal Names:** BJTs have Emitter, Base, and Collector. FETs have Source, Gate, and Drain.</li>
                                    <li>**Sensitivity:** MOSFETs are highly sensitive to static electricity.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Precautions while handling MOSFETs:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Always handle MOSFETs by the case and avoid touching the leads, especially the gate.</li>
                                    <li>Store and transport MOSFETs in conductive foam or tubes to prevent static charge build-up.</li>
                                    <li>Use a grounded wrist strap and work on a grounded mat when handling MOSFETs.</li>
                                    <li>Ensure all tools (soldering iron, tweezers, etc.) are properly grounded.</li>
                                    <li>Do not insert or remove MOSFETs from circuits while the power is on.</li>
                                    <li>Keep leads short to minimize inductance and susceptibility to noise/static.</li>

                                <p class="answer-intro">The circuit shown is a common-emitter amplifier with voltage divider bias. We need to determine the DC operating point (base current, collector current, and collector-emitter voltage).</p>
                                <p>Assume the transistor is silicon with \(V_{BE} \approx 0.7 \mathrm{~V}\).</p>
                                <p>First, calculate the base voltage (\(V_B\)) using the voltage divider formed by \(R_{B1}\) and \(R_{B2}\) and \(V_{CC}\). Assume the base current \(I_B\) is negligible compared to the current through the voltage divider (valid if \(R_{B2}\) is much smaller than \(\beta R_E\)).</p>
                                <p>\[ V_B = V_{CC} \times \frac{R_{B2}}{R_{B1} + R_{B2}} \]</p>
                                 <p>From the diagram: \(R_{B1} = 40 \mathrm{k}\Omega\), \(R_{B2} = 10 \mathrm{k}\Omega\), \(R_C = 2 \mathrm{k}\Omega\), \(R_E = 1 \mathrm{k}\Omega\), \(V_{CC} = 12 \mathrm{~V}\).</p>
                                 \[ V_B = 12 \mathrm{~V} \times \frac{10 \mathrm{k}\Omega}{40 \mathrm{k}\Omega + 10 \mathrm{k}\Omega} = 12 \mathrm{~V} \times \frac{10}{50} = 12 \mathrm{~V} \times 0.2 = 2.4 \mathrm{~V} \]
                                 <p>Now calculate the emitter voltage (\(V_E\)). We know \(V_B = V_{BE} + V_E\).</p>
                                 \[ V_E = V_B - V_{BE} = 2.4 \mathrm{~V} - 0.7 \mathrm{~V} = 1.7 \mathrm{~V} \]
                                 <p>Calculate the emitter current (\(I_E\)) using Ohm's law across \(R_E\):</p>
                                 \[ I_E = \frac{V_E}{R_E} = \frac{1.7 \mathrm{~V}}{1 \mathrm{~k}\Omega} = 1.7 \mathrm{~mA} \]
                                 <p>In the active region, \(I_C \approx I_E\). So, \(I_C \approx 1.7 \mathrm{~mA}\).</p>
                                 <p>We need \(\beta\) to find \(I_B\). \(\beta\) is not given in the OCR snippet for this question. Let's assume a typical \(\beta\) value, e.g., \(\beta=100\). If \(\beta\) was provided elsewhere in the paper, that value should be used.</p>
                                 <div class="key-point">Assuming \(\beta = 100\):</div>
                                 <p>The collector current is related to the base current by \(I_C = \beta I_B\). Therefore, \(I_B = I_C / \beta\).</p>
                                 \[ I_B = \frac{1.7 \mathrm{~mA}}{100} = 0.017 \mathrm{~mA} = 17 \mu\mathrm{A} \]
                                 <p>Let's check the validity of the voltage divider assumption: Current through \(R_{B2}\) is \(V_B / R_{B2} = 2.4 \mathrm{~V} / 10 \mathrm{k}\Omega = 0.24 \mathrm{~mA}\). This is much larger than \(I_B = 0.017 \mathrm{~mA}\), so the assumption is valid.</p>
                                 <p>Calculate the collector voltage (\(V_C\)) using Ohm's law across \(R_C\):</p>
                                 \[ V_C = V_{CC} - I_C R_C = 12 \mathrm{~V} - (1.7 \mathrm{~mA}) \times (2 \mathrm{~k}\Omega) = 12 \mathrm{~V} - 3.4 \mathrm{~V} = 8.6 \mathrm{~V} \]
                                 <p>Calculate the collector-emitter voltage (\(V_{CE}\)):</p>
                                 \[ V_{CE} = V_C - V_E = 8.6 \mathrm{~V} - 1.7 \mathrm{~V} = 6.9 \mathrm{~V} \]
                                 <p>Since \(V_{CE} > V_{BE}\) (\(6.9 \mathrm{~V} > 0.7 \mathrm{~V}\)) and the base voltage is above the emitter voltage, the transistor is operating in the active region, confirming our assumption.</p>

                                 <p>Summary of results (assuming \(\beta=100\)):</p>
                                <p>**(i) base current:** \( I_B \approx 17 \mu\mathrm{A} \)</p>
                                <p>**(ii) collector current:** \( I_C \approx 1.7 \mathrm{~mA} \)</p>
                                <p>**(iii) collector to emitter voltage:** \( V_{CE} \approx 6.9 \mathrm{~V} \)</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Ability to emit electrons:** The primary function is to produce a stream of electrons through thermionic emission (emission of electrons from a heated surface).

                                    <li>**Resistance to evaporation:** The cathode material should not evaporate excessively at the high temperatures required for emission to ensure a long lifespan for the tube.</li>
                                    <li>**Durability/Mechanical strength:** The cathode should be able to withstand the manufacturing process and potential minor shocks during operation.</li>
                                    <li>**Good conductor of heat:** To ensure uniform heating and efficient electron emission.</li>
                                    <li>**Compatibility with coating:** Often, cathodes are coated with materials like barium oxide or strontium oxide to lower the work function further. The base material (like nickel) must be compatible with these coatings.</li>

                                <p>Key functional blocks:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Electron Gun:** Generates a focused beam of electrons. It consists of a heated cathode (for thermionic emission), control grid (to control beam intensity), accelerating anodes (to accelerate the electrons to high velocity), and focusing anodes (to narrow the beam).</li>
                                    <li>**Deflection System:** Consists of two pairs of parallel plates: vertical (Y) deflection plates and horizontal (X) deflection plates. When a voltage is applied across a pair of plates, it creates an electric field that deflects the electron beam. The amount of deflection is proportional to the applied voltage.</li>
                                    <li>**Fluorescent Screen:** The inner surface of the CRO tube's front face is coated with a phosphor material. When the high-velocity electron beam strikes the phosphor, it emits light, creating a visible spot.</li>
                                    <li>**Vertical Amplifier (Y-amplifier):** Amplifies the input signal (the voltage waveform to be displayed) and applies it to the vertical deflection plates. It provides sensitivity control (Volts/division).</li>
                                    <li>**Horizontal Amplifier (X-amplifier):** Amplifies the signal applied to the horizontal deflection plates. In normal operation, the X-amplifier receives input from the time base generator. It provides sweep speed control (Time/division).</li>
                                    <li>**Time Base Generator (Sweep Generator):** Produces a sawtooth voltage waveform. This voltage, when amplified and applied to the horizontal deflection plates, causes the electron beam to sweep horizontally across the screen at a constant speed, then quickly return to the starting point. This provides the time axis for the display.</li>
                                    <li>**Trigger Circuit:** Synchronizes the horizontal sweep with the input signal. It detects a specific point (level and slope) on the input waveform and initiates the time base sweep. This ensures that the waveform display is stable and repeats at the same point on the screen.</li>
                                    <li>**Power Supply:** Provides the necessary DC voltages for the electron gun (high voltage for acceleration, lower voltages for grid/anodes) and the amplifiers.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>In operation, the input signal is amplified and applied to the vertical plates, causing vertical deflection proportional to the signal's instantaneous voltage. Simultaneously, the time base generator produces a horizontal sweep voltage, causing the beam to move horizontally with time. The combination of vertical and horizontal deflection traces the waveform of the input signal on the screen.</p>

                                <p>**Circuit Description:**</p>
                                <p>The circuit typically consists of a PNP transistor, an emitter resistor \(R_E\), a biasing network (like a voltage divider or a single resistor \(R_B\) connected to a negative voltage or ground) to set a fixed voltage at the base, and the load \(R_L\) connected in the collector circuit.</p>
                                <p>In the illustrated diagram (common configuration), the base is biased to a fixed voltage \(V_B\), often relative to the positive supply \(V_{CC}\). Alternatively, as shown, \(R_B\) and \(R_E\) form a bias network.</p>
                                <p>**Operation:**</p>
                                <p>Assuming the transistor is in the active region, the emitter-base junction is forward-biased. The base voltage \(V_B\) is set by the biasing network. The emitter voltage \(V_E\) is then approximately \(V_E = V_B + V_{EB}\), where \(V_{EB}\) is the emitter-base voltage (around 0.7V for silicon). Since the base voltage is fixed, the emitter voltage \(V_E\) is also relatively stable.</p>
                                <p>The emitter current \(I_E\) is determined by the voltage across \(R_E\) (\(V_{R_E}\)) and the resistance \(R_E\).</p>
                                \[ V_{R_E} = V_{CC} - V_E \]
                                \[ I_E = \frac{V_{R_E}}{R_E} = \frac{V_{CC} - V_E}{R_E} \]
                                <p>If the base voltage \(V_B\) is fixed relative to \(V_{CC}\) (e.g., by a voltage divider from \(V_{CC}\) to ground or a negative supply), and \(V_{EB}\) is constant, then \(V_E\) is fixed relative to \(V_{CC}\). This makes \(V_{CC} - V_E\) constant, resulting in a constant emitter current \(I_E\).</p>
                                <p>In the active region, the collector current \(I_C\) is approximately equal to the emitter current (\(I_C \approx I_E\)), especially if \(\alpha\) is close to 1. Therefore, the collector current \(I_C\) delivered to the load \(R_L\) is approximately constant, independent of the load resistance \(R_L\), as long as the transistor remains in the active region (i.e., \(V_{EC}\) remains large enough, ensuring \(V_C\) is sufficiently below \(V_E\)).</p>
                                <p>The current through \(R_L\) is \(I_C\). As long as the voltage across \(R_L\) (\(V_{RL} = I_C R_L\)) is not so large that it pushes the transistor into saturation (\(V_{EC}\) becomes too small), the circuit regulates the current.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Relationship between \(\beta\) and \(\alpha\) for a BJT:</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">In a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), the currents are related by definitions of current gains:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Common-base current gain (\(\alpha\)): The ratio of collector current to emitter current, \( \alpha = \frac{I_C}{I_E} \). This gain is typically slightly less than 1.</li>
                                    <li>Common-emitter current gain (\(\beta\)): The ratio of collector current to base current, \( \beta = \frac{I_C}{I_B} \). This gain is typically much greater than 1.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The total emitter current \(I_E\) is the sum of the base current \(I_B\) and the collector current \(I_C\):</p>
                                \[ I_E = I_B + I_C \]
                                <p>We want to show that \( \beta = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} \). We can start by expressing \(I_B\) in terms of \(I_C\) and \(I_E\).</p>
                                \[ I_B = I_E - I_C \]
                                <p>Now, substitute the definition of \(\alpha\) into this equation. From \( \alpha = \frac{I_C}{I_E} \), we have \( I_C = \alpha I_E \).</p>
                                \[ I_B = I_E - \alpha I_E \]
                                \[ I_B = I_E (1 - \alpha) \]
                                <p>Now use the definition of \(\beta = \frac{I_C}{I_B}\) and substitute the expressions for \(I_C\) and \(I_B\) in terms of \(I_E\) and \(\alpha\):</p>
                                \[ \beta = \frac{\alpha I_E}{I_E (1 - \alpha)} \]
                                <p>Cancel out \(I_E\) (assuming \(I_E \neq 0\), which is true in the active region):</p>
                                \[ \beta = \frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \]
                                <p>This derivation shows the relationship between the common-emitter current gain (\(\beta\)) and the common-base current gain (\(\alpha\)). Since \(\alpha\) is slightly less than 1, the denominator \(1-\alpha\) is a small positive number, resulting in \(\beta\) being much larger than \(\alpha\).</p>
