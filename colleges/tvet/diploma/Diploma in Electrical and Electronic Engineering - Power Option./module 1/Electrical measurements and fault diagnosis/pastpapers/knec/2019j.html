                                <p><strong>(a) Analog Multimeter and Zero-Beat Method (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Two precautions when using analogue multi range multi-meters:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Select the correct range:** Always start with the highest possible range for the quantity being measured (voltage or current) and then switch down to a lower range if necessary for a more accurate reading. This prevents damaging the meter by overranging.</li>
                                    <li>**Select the correct function:** Ensure the meter is set to measure the desired quantity (Voltage, Current, Resistance) and type (AC or DC). Incorrect function selection can damage the meter or the circuit.</li>
                                    <li>**Observe polarity (for DC measurements):** Connect the leads with the correct polarity when measuring DC voltage or current to ensure the needle deflects in the positive direction and to avoid damaging the meter.</li>
                                    <li>**Connect correctly for current measurement:** Always connect the ammeter in series with the circuit element through which the current is to be measured. Never connect an ammeter in parallel with a voltage source or load, as its low resistance will cause a short circuit.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Zero-beat method of frequency measurement with diagram:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The zero-beat method (or heterodyne method) measures an unknown frequency by comparing it with a known, adjustable frequency from a variable frequency oscillator (VFO). When the two frequencies are equal, a "zero beat" condition is detected.</p>

                                <p>**Description:** The unknown frequency signal and the signal from the VFO are fed into a mixer circuit. The mixer's output contains sum and difference frequencies. A low-pass filter selects the difference (beat) frequency. This beat frequency is amplified and sent to a zero-beat indicator (e.g., headphones, a sensitive meter). The VFO frequency is adjusted until the beat frequency is zero, which is indicated by minimum or zero output from the indicator. At this point, the unknown frequency is equal to the known VFO frequency, which is read from the calibrated dial of the VFO.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) De Sauty's Capacitor Bridge Derivation (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">De Sauty's bridge is a simple AC bridge used to measure an unknown capacitance by comparing it with a standard capacitor. It assumes the capacitors are ideal (no leakage or dielectric loss).</p>
                                <p>From Figure 1, the impedances are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>\(Z_1 = R_1 + \frac{1}{j\omega C_1}\) (Unknown impedance: resistance in series with capacitance)</li>
                                    <li>\(Z_2 = R_2\) (Known non-inductive resistance)</li>
                                    <li>\(Z_3 = R_3\) (Known non-inductive resistance)</li>
                                    <li>\(Z_4 = \frac{1}{j\omega C_4}\) (Known standard capacitance)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>At balance, \( Z_1 Z_4 = Z_2 Z_3 \).</p>
                                \[ \left(R_1 + \frac{1}{j\omega C_1}\right) \left(\frac{1}{j\omega C_4}\right) = R_2 R_3 \]
                                \[ \frac{R_1}{j\omega C_4} + \frac{1}{(j\omega)^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \]
                                <p>Since \( (j\omega)^2 = j^2 \omega^2 = -\omega^2 \):</p>
                                \[ \frac{R_1}{j\omega C_4} - \frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \]
                                <p>Rewrite \(\frac{1}{j\omega C_4}\) as \( -j \frac{1}{\omega C_4} \):</p>
                                \[ -j \frac{R_1}{\omega C_4} - \frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \]
                                <p>This form is not ideal for equating real and imaginary parts directly with a purely real RHS (\(R_2 R_3\)). Let's rearrange the balance equation \( Z_1 Z_4 = Z_2 Z_3 \) differently, or check the diagram again. The diagram shows \(Z_1 = R_1\) and \(Z_3 = C_1\). No, \(Z_1\) is R1 + jwL1 in many bridges, but here it's shown as an impedance labeled R1 and C1. Let's assume Z1 is R1 in series with C1, and Z4 is C4. Diagram shows Z1 arm as R1 in series with C1.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the arms are: Z1 = R1 (resistance), Z2 = R2 (resistance), Z3 = R3 (resistance), Z4 = R4 (resistance) + C4 (capacitance in series). No, the diagram looks like a Maxwell bridge or similar, but labeled R1, C1, R2, R3, C4. Let's re-examine the labels in the diagram carefully.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">The diagram shows Arm 1: R1 in series with C1. Arm 2: R2. Arm 3: R3. Arm 4: C4. This is NOT De Sauty's bridge circuit diagram. De Sauty's bridge typically has Z1 = R1 || C1, Z2 = R2, Z3 = R3, Z4 = R4 || C4 (comparing capacitors with dielectric loss) or Z1 = R1, Z2 = R2, Z3 = 1/jωC1, Z4 = 1/jωC4 (comparing ideal capacitors with resistances).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">The diagram *provided* is the circuit for a series-resistance capacitance bridge, or potentially a method to find R1 and C1. Let's derive the balance for the circuit *in the diagram* assuming it's intended for R1 and C1 in series (Z1), compared against R2, R3, and C4 (in Arm 4) and R2 (in Arm 2) and R3 (in Arm 3). The diagram shows C4 in Arm 4, and R2, R3 in Arms 2 & 3. Arm 1 has R1 and C1.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Based on the diagram, assuming it's a standard bridge layout: Arm 1 has R1 and C1 in series. Arm 2 has R2. Arm 3 has R3. Arm 4 has C4.</p>
                                <ul>
                                     <li>\(Z_1 = R_1 + \frac{1}{j\omega C_1}\)</li>
                                     <li>\(Z_2 = R_2\)</li>
                                     <li>\(Z_3 = R_3\)</li>
                                     <li>\(Z_4 = \frac{1}{j\omega C_4}\)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Balance equation: \(Z_1 Z_4 = Z_2 Z_3\)</p>
                                \[ \left(R_1 + \frac{1}{j\omega C_1}\right) \left(\frac{1}{j\omega C_4}\right) = R_2 R_3 \]
                                \[ \frac{R_1}{j\omega C_4} + \frac{1}{(j\omega)^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \]
                                \[ \frac{R_1}{j\omega C_4} - \frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \]
                                \[ -j \frac{R_1}{\omega C_4} - \frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \]
                                <p>This equation implies \(R_2 R_3\) must have an imaginary component for balance, which is not the case unless \(R_2\) or \(R_3\) are complex. This structure doesn't seem right for measuring R1 and C1.</p>

                                <p class="key-point">Let's re-examine the standard bridges. Could it be Schering bridge? No. Owen? No. Maxwell? No. Wien? No. Let's assume the standard De Sauty bridge form for comparing two capacitors is intended, using R2 and R3 as ratio arms, and comparing C1 (unknown) and C4 (standard).</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Let's assume the intended bridge for deriving expressions for R1 and C1 at balance is the one in the diagram, and the question is asking for the balance conditions of that specific circuit, even if it's mislabeled as "De Sauty's capacitor bridge". The diagram shows Arm 1 with \(R_1\) and \(C_1\) in series. Arm 2 with \(R_2\). Arm 3 with \(R_3\). Arm 4 with \(C_4\). The connections in the diagram look like a simple bridge comparing the impedance of Arm 1 (series R1, C1) with the impedance of Arm 4 (C4) using Arms 2 (R2) and 3 (R3) as ratio arms.</p>
                                <p>Balance equation: \( Z_1 Z_3 = Z_2 Z_4 \) (This is for adjacent arms; the diagram shows opposite arms Z1, Z4 and Z2, Z3 connected across the detector points)</p>
                                <p>So, \( Z_1 Z_4 = Z_2 Z_3 \) remains the correct balance equation based on the bridge layout.</p>
                                <ul>
                                     <li>\(Z_1 = R_1 + \frac{1}{j\omega C_1}\)</li>

                                \[ \frac{R_1}{j\omega C_4} + \frac{1}{(j\omega)^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \]
                                \[ \frac{R_1}{j\omega C_4} - \frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \]
                                \[ -j \frac{R_1}{\omega C_4} - \frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 + j0 \]
                                <p>Equating real and imaginary parts:</p>
                                <p>Real: \( -\frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \). This implies \(R_2\) or \(R_3\) must be negative or frequency/capacitance terms are complex, which is not the case. This equation cannot be balanced with positive \(R_2, R_3, C_1, C_4\) at a real frequency.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Conclusion: The circuit diagram provided is likely incorrect or mislabeled in the context of measuring R1 and C1 using only R2, R3, C4 as known standard components, if a standard bridge balance is expected.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume there is a typo in the diagram or question and it *is* a standard bridge intended to measure R1 and C1. A common bridge for this is the Series Resistance-Capacitance Bridge where Z1=R1+1/jωC1, Z2=R2, Z3=R3, Z4=R4 (all resistances except Z1). Balance: (R1+1/jωC1)R4 = R2R3. R1R4 + R4/jωC1 = R2R3. R1R4 - j R4/ωC1 = R2R3. R1R4=R2R3 and -j R4/ωC1=0 -> 1/ωC1=0 -> C1=infinity (short circuit). This doesn't work either.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Another Series R-C bridge type compares R1+1/jωC1 against R4+1/jωC4 using R2 and R3 as ratio arms. Z1Z4 = Z2Z3 -> (R1+1/jωC1)(R4+1/jωC4) = R2R3. This becomes complex.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's go back to the assumption that the diagram IS the intended bridge, and there's an issue with the expected outcome or the problem's formulation. However, if a derivation is asked for, the standard balance condition \(Z_1 Z_4 = Z_2 Z_3\) applies to the circuit shown.</p>

                                <p class="key-point">Let's reconsider the possibility that the diagram shows a different bridge, e.g., perhaps Z4 should be R4 in parallel with C4? That would be a Maxwell bridge type (measuring L1 and R1). Let's assume the diagram is exactly as shown and labeled.</p>
                                <p>The balance equation is \( (R_1 + \frac{1}{j\omega C_1}) (\frac{1}{j\omega C_4}) = R_2 R_3 \). As shown, this leads to \( -\frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} - j \frac{R_1}{\omega C_4} = R_2 R_3 \). Equating real and imaginary parts:</p>
                                \[ -\frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \]
                                \[ -\frac{R_1}{\omega C_4} = 0 \]
                                <p>The second equation implies \(R_1=0\) (unless \(\omega\) or \(C_4\) is infinite). The first implies \(R_2 R_3\) is negative, which is impossible for standard resistors. This bridge circuit, as drawn and with components in Arm 1 (R1, C1 series), Arm 2 (R2), Arm 3 (R3), Arm 4 (C4), CANNOT be balanced with standard passive components R2, R3, C4 to find R1 and C1.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Given that a derivation *is* requested, the most likely scenario is that the diagram is correct, and the problem expects the student to show that the bridge cannot be balanced, or expects a derivation of the balance condition equations even if they are physically impossible for positive components. Or there is a significant error in the diagram/problem statement.</p>

                                <p class="key-point">Assuming the derivation is the focus, the steps \( (R_1 + \frac{1}{j\omega C_1}) (\frac{1}{j\omega C_4}) = R_2 R_3 \) leading to \( -\frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} - j \frac{R_1}{\omega C_4} = R_2 R_3 \) are correct for the diagram shown. Since \(R_2 R_3\) is purely real, the imaginary part on the left must be zero, and the real part on the left must equal \(R_2 R_3\).</p>
                                <p>Imaginary part: \( -\frac{R_1}{\omega C_4} = 0 \implies R_1 = 0 \) (assuming \(\omega \neq 0, C_4 \neq \infty\)).</p>
                                <p>Real part: \( -\frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \). This requires \(\omega^2 C_1 C_4 R_2 R_3 = -1\). Since \(\omega^2, C_1, C_4, R_2, R_3\) are all positive for physical components, their product is positive. A positive number cannot equal -1. This confirms the bridge cannot be balanced as drawn with standard components.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume a potential typo in the *question text* and it should be measuring L1 and R1, and Arm 4 should be R4 || C4 (Maxwell Bridge). Derivation shown in Q5c November 2015 applies. But the diagram is explicitly R1-C1 series in Z1 and C4 in Z4. Let's stick to the diagram.</p>

                                <p>**(I) Derive the bridge equation at balance:**</p>
                                <p>Based on the diagram, the balance condition \(Z_1 Z_4 = Z_2 Z_3\) leads to:</p>
                                \[ (R_1 + \frac{1}{j\omega C_1}) \left(\frac{1}{j\omega C_4}\right) = R_2 R_3 \]
                                \[ -\frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} - j \frac{R_1}{\omega C_4} = R_2 R_3 \]
                                <p>For balance, equate real and imaginary parts:</p>
                                \[ \text{Real part:} \quad -\frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \]
                                \[ \text{Imaginary part:} \quad -\frac{R_1}{\omega C_4} = 0 \]
                                <p>These are the balance equations for the circuit shown in Figure 1.</p>

                                <p>**(II) Determine the value of \(R_1\) and \(L_1\):**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">From the imaginary part equation, \( -\frac{R_1}{\omega C_4} = 0 \), if \(\omega \neq 0\) and \(C_4 \neq \infty\), then \(R_1\) must be 0. If \(R_1=0\), the circuit in Arm 1 is just a capacitor \(C_1\).</p>
                                <p>From the real part equation, \( -\frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \), this equation cannot be satisfied by positive values of \(\omega, C_1, C_4, R_2, R_3\). This confirms the bridge cannot be balanced as drawn with standard components.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Since the bridge cannot be balanced to find R1 and C1 with positive component values, numerical values cannot be determined from balance conditions alone. The derivation reveals the physical impossibility of balance as drawn.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Also, the question asks for \(R_1\) and \(L_1\), but Arm 1 has \(R_1\) and \(C_1\), not \(L_1\). This further indicates a probable typo in the question asking for \(L_1\) instead of \(C_1\).</p>

                                <p>Summary based on diagram:</p>
                                <ul>
                                     <li>**(I) Bridge equation at balance:** \( -\frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} - j \frac{R_1}{\omega C_4} = R_2 R_3 \) leading to \( -\frac{1}{\omega^2 C_1 C_4} = R_2 R_3 \) and \( R_1 = 0 \).</li>
                                     <li>**(II) Value of \(R_1\) and \(L_1\):** \(R_1\) must be 0 for balance. \(L_1\) is not a component in this arm. The bridge cannot be balanced with positive R, C components.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">This question involves the derivation of balance conditions for an AC bridge, but the specific circuit diagram provided appears to represent a bridge that cannot be balanced with standard passive components, and the requested unknown quantity (\(L_1\)) does not seem to be present in the specified arm (\(R_1, C_1\) in series). The derivation steps are shown, highlighting the issues encountered when applying the balance principle to the diagram.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers key concepts in equipment reliability, the bathtub curve model, and calculations of reliability metrics from test data.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Reliability Definitions (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Availability:** The probability that an equipment is in an operable state at any given time when required for use. It is a measure of operational readiness and depends on both reliability (how often it fails) and maintainability (how quickly it can be repaired). Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR).</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Redundancy:** The inclusion of extra components, subsystems, or functions in a system that are not strictly necessary for normal operation but are available to perform the intended function if a primary component fails. Redundancy is a technique used to improve system reliability, as the system can continue to operate even after one or more component failures. Example: Having two power supplies in a system, where one can take over if the other fails.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Reliability Bathtub Curve Description (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The reliability bathtub curve is a graphical representation of the failure rate of a population of components or equipment over its lifespan. It illustrates how the likelihood of failure changes with time.</p>

                                <p>**Description:** The curve is typically divided into three main periods:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Infant Mortality Period (Early Failures):** This occurs at the beginning of the equipment's life. The failure rate starts high and decreases rapidly over time. Failures are usually due to manufacturing defects, weak components ("early failures" or "bugs"). Reliability improves as these initial problems are corrected.</li>
                                    <li>**Useful Life Period (Random Failures):** Follows the infant mortality period. The failure rate is relatively constant and low. Failures in this phase are typically random events, often caused by unexpected stresses or environmental factors, rather than the age of the equipment itself. This period is the target for the design life of most equipment, where reliability is modeled using a constant failure rate (\(\lambda\)).</li>
                                    <li>**Wear-out Period:** Occurs towards the end of the equipment's life. The failure rate increases rapidly with time. Failures are caused by aging, wear and tear, fatigue, and material degradation. These failures are often predictable based on the age of the components.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Reliability Calculations from Test Data (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Ten electronic devices were tested for 500 hours, and 2 failures occurred. This data allows calculation of reliability metrics.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Number of units tested \(N = 10\)</li>
                                    <li>Test duration \(T = 500\) hours</li>
                                    <li>Number of failures \(f = 2\)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Total operating time (device-hours) = \(N \times T = 10 \times 500 = 5000\) device-hours.</p>

                                <p>**(i) Mean Time to Failure (MTTF):**</p>
                                <p>MTTF is the average time a non-repairable item operates before failure. It is calculated as total operating time divided by the number of failures.</p>
                                \[ MTTF = \frac{\text{Total Operating Time}}{\text{Number of Failures}} = \frac{5000 \text{ device-hours}}{2 \text{ failures}} = 2500 \text{ hours/failure} \]

                                <p>**(ii) Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF):**</p>
                                <p>MTBF is the average time a repairable item operates between failures. If the devices are assumed to be repairable and put back into test after repair, the calculation is the same as MTTF in this context (total test time / number of failures). If they are non-repairable, only MTTF is applicable.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Assuming the question intends for these to be metrics of the population, and the test is characteristic of the useful life, \(MTBF \approx MTTF\).</p>
                                \[ MTBF \approx MTTF = 2500 \text{ hours/failure} \]

                                <p>**(iii) Failure rate (\(\lambda\)):**</p>
                                <p>Failure rate is the reciprocal of MTTF or MTBF (assuming constant failure rate).</p>
                                \[ \lambda = \frac{1}{MTTF} = \frac{\text{Number of Failures}}{\text{Total Operating Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ failures}}{5000 \text{ device-hours}} \]
                                \[ \lambda = 0.0004 \text{ failures/hour} \]
                                <p>Often expressed per 1000 hours: \( \lambda = 0.0004 \times 1000 = 0.4 \) failures per 1000 hours.</p>

                                <p>**(iv) Probability that a particular device will be operated at time equal to MTBF:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The probability of a device operating for a time \(t\) (its reliability \(R(t)\)) is given by \( R(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \), assuming a constant failure rate. We want to find \( R(t) \) when \( t = MTBF \). We know \( \lambda = 1/MTBF \).</p>
                                \[ R(MTBF) = e^{-\lambda \times MTBF} = e^{-(1/MTBF) \times MTBF} = e^{-1} \]
                                \[ R(MTBF) = e^{-1} \approx 0.36788 \]
                                <p>The probability that a device will be operating at time equal to MTBF is approximately 0.3679 or 36.79%. This means about 36.8% of devices are expected to survive up to the MTBF.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Reliability concepts and calculations are important for predicting the performance and lifespan of electronic devices and systems.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers key concepts in equipment reliability, the bathtub curve model, and calculations of reliability metrics from test data.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Reliability Definitions (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Availability:** The probability that an equipment is in an operable state at any given time when required for use. It is a measure of operational readiness and depends on both reliability (how often it fails) and maintainability (how quickly it can be repaired). Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR). (Same as Q2a(i))</p>
                                <p>**(ii) Redundancy:** The inclusion of extra components, subsystems, or functions in a system that are not strictly necessary for normal operation but are available to perform the intended function if a primary component fails. Redundancy is a technique used to improve system reliability, as the system can continue to operate even after one or more component failures. Example: Having two power supplies in a system, where one can take over if the other fails. (Same as Q2a(ii))</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Reliability Bathtub Curve Description (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The reliability bathtub curve is a graphical representation of the failure rate of a population of components or equipment over its lifespan. It illustrates how the likelihood of failure changes with time. (Same as Q2a(ii))</p>

                                <figcaption>Figure 3: Bathtub Curve (Failure Rate vs. Time - ASCII Art)</figcaption>
                                <p>**Description:** The curve is typically divided into three main periods:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Infant Mortality Period (Early Failures):** This occurs at the beginning of the equipment's life. The failure rate starts high and decreases rapidly over time. Failures are usually due to manufacturing defects, weak components ("early failures" or "bugs"). Reliability improves as these initial problems are weeded out.</li>
                                    <li>**Useful Life Period (Random Failures):** Follows the infant mortality period. The failure rate is relatively constant and low. Failures in this phase are typically random events, often caused by unexpected stresses or environmental factors, rather than the age of the equipment itself. This period is the target for the design life of most equipment, where reliability is modeled using a constant failure rate (\(\lambda\)).</li>
                                    <li>**Wear-out Period:** Occurs towards the end of the equipment's life. The failure rate increases rapidly with time. Failures are caused by aging, wear and tear, fatigue, corrosion, and material degradation. These failures are often predictable based on the age of the components.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Reliability Calculations from Test Data (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Ten electronic devices were tested for 500 hours, and 2 failures occurred. This data allows calculation of reliability metrics. (Same as Q2c)</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Number of units tested \(N = 10\)</li>
                                    <li>Test duration \(T = 500\) hours</li>
                                    <li>Number of failures \(f = 2\)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Total operating time (device-hours) = \(N \times T = 10 \times 500 = 5000\) device-hours.</p>

                                <p>**(i) Mean Time to Failure (MTTF):**</p>
                                \[ MTTF = \frac{\text{Total Operating Time}}{\text{Number of Failures}} = \frac{5000 \text{ device-hours}}{2 \text{ failures}} = 2500 \text{ hours/failure} \]

                                <p>**(ii) Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF):**</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Assuming the devices are repairable and put back into test, or this test represents the average performance over the population, MTBF \(\approx\) MTTF. In many contexts, MTTF is used for non-repairable items and MTBF for repairable ones.</p>
                                \[ MTBF \approx 2500 \text{ hours/failure} \]

                                <p>**(iii) Failure rate (\(\lambda\)):**</p>
                                \[ \lambda = \frac{1}{MTTF} = \frac{\text{Number of Failures}}{\text{Total Operating Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ failures}}{5000 \text{ device-hours}} = 0.0004 \text{ failures/hour} \]
                                <p>Or 0.4 failures per 1000 hours.</p>

                                <p>**(iv) Probability that a particular device will be operated at time equal to MTBF:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The reliability \(R(t)\) at time \(t = MTBF\) (assuming constant failure rate) is \( R(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \). Since \( \lambda = 1/MTBF \):</p>
                                \[ R(MTBF) = e^{-(1/MTBF) \times MTBF} = e^{-1} \approx 0.3679 \]
                                <p>The probability is approximately 0.3679 or 36.79%.</p>

                                <p>**(i) Four factors determining maintenance policy:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The choice of maintenance policy (e.g., reactive/corrective, preventive, predictive) depends on various factors:</p>

                                    <li>**Criticality of the equipment:** How essential is the equipment to the overall operation? Failure of critical equipment warrants a more proactive (preventive or predictive) policy.</li>
                                    <li>**Cost of failure:** The financial and non-financial consequences of equipment failure (e.g., lost production, repair costs, safety hazards, environmental damage). High failure costs favor policies that minimize unexpected breakdowns.</li>
                                    <li>**Cost of maintenance:** The cost of implementing different maintenance policies (e.g., cost of planned inspections, predictive monitoring equipment, reactive repairs, labor).</li>
                                    <li>**Failure patterns/Reliability characteristics:** Is the equipment prone to random failures (useful life) or wear-out failures (end of life)? Preventive/predictive maintenance is more effective for wear-out failures.</li>
                                    <li>**Age and condition of the equipment:** Older equipment may require more frequent or different types of maintenance.</li>
                                    <li>**Available resources:** Availability of skilled labor, tools, documentation, and spare parts influences what policies are feasible.</li>
                                    <li>**Safety and environmental impact:** Equipment whose failure poses significant safety or environmental risks requires policies that prioritize preventing failures.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) Maintainability, Availability, Unavailability Calculations (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) = 800 hours</li>
                                    <li>Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) = 12 hours</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(i) Maintainability for a time of 7 hours:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Maintainability \(M(t)\) is the probability that a failed system can be restored to working condition within a specified time \(t\). Assuming exponential repair times, \(M(t) = 1 - e^{-t/\text{MTTR}}\).</p>
                                \[ M(7) = 1 - e^{-7 \, \text{hours} / 12 \, \text{hours}} = 1 - e^{-0.5833} \]
                                \[ M(7) \approx 1 - 0.5581 = 0.4419 \]
                                <p>The maintainability for a time of 7 hours is approximately 0.4419 or 44.19%. This means there is about a 44.19% probability that a failed equipment will be repaired and returned to service within 7 hours.</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Availability:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Availability (\(A\)) is the long-term probability that the equipment is in an operational state. For repairable systems, it's calculated as \( A = \frac{MTBF}{MTBF + MTTR} \).</p>
                                \[ A = \frac{800 \, \text{hours}}{800 \, \text{hours} + 12 \, \text{hours}} = \frac{800}{812} \]
                                \[ A \approx 0.9852 \]
                                <p>The availability of the equipment is approximately 0.9852 or 98.52%.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) Unavailability:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Unavailability (\(U\)) is the probability that the equipment is NOT in an operational state when required. It is the complement of availability: \(U = 1 - A\).</p>
                                \[ U = 1 - A = 1 - 0.9852 = 0.0148 \]
                                <p>Alternatively, \( U = \frac{MTTR}{MTBF + MTTR} \).
                                \[ U = \frac{12 \, \text{hours}}{800 \, \text{hours} + 12 \, \text{hours}} = \frac{12}{812} \approx 0.0148 \]
                                <p>The unavailability of the equipment is approximately 0.0148 or 1.48%.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Function of Maintenance Tools (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Common tools used in electronic maintenance workshops have specific functions to aid in repair and troubleshooting.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Desoldering pump:** Used to remove molten solder from electrical connections, typically to disconnect components from a printed circuit board (PCB) or to correct soldering errors like solder bridges. It creates a vacuum to suck up the liquid solder.</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Long nose pliers:** Pliers with long, tapered jaws used for gripping, bending, holding, and manipulating small wires and components in confined spaces. They often have serrated jaws for better grip and sometimes integrated wire cutters near the pivot.</li>
                                    <li>**(iii) Logic probe:** A simple hand-held diagnostic tool used in digital circuits to indicate the logic state (high, low, or pulsing) at a specific point in the circuit. It typically has LED indicators for each state and can help trace signals and identify stuck-at faults.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>**(i) Three merits of oscilloscopes in maintenance:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Waveform Visualization:** They allow viewing the actual shape of a signal (voltage vs. time), which is crucial for analyzing AC signals, pulses, digital signals, distortion, noise, and timing relationships.</li>
                                    <li>**Measurement of Time-Varying Quantities:** Can measure parameters like frequency, period, pulse width, rise/fall times, phase shift, and duty cycle directly from the waveform display.</li>
                                    <li>**Simultaneous Measurement:** Can often display and compare two or more signals simultaneously (using multiple channels), facilitating analysis of relationships between different points in a circuit.</li>
                                    <li>**Non-Loading (High Input Impedance):** Typically have very high input impedance, especially when using a \(10\times\) probe, which minimizes the loading effect on the circuit being tested.</li>
                                    <li>**Signal Tracing:** Useful for following a signal through different stages of a circuit to pinpoint where it becomes incorrect.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Testing a coil using an ohmmeter:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">An ohmmeter measures resistance. A coil (inductor) is essentially a length of wire wound around a core. A basic check with an ohmmeter can verify the continuity of the wire and give an indication of its DC resistance.</p>
                                <p>**Procedure:**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Ensure the circuit containing the coil is powered off and any charge on connected capacitors is discharged. Ideally, disconnect at least one lead of the coil from the circuit to prevent measuring the resistance of other components in parallel paths.</li>
                                    <li>Set the multimeter to the resistance measurement function (Ohms). Choose a suitable range (usually start high and adjust down).</li>
                                    <li>Connect the two probes of the ohmmeter across the two terminals of the coil.</li>
                                    <li>Observe the reading. A functioning coil should show a low resistance reading (ideally close to the DC resistance of the wire used to wind the coil). This indicates continuity of the winding.</li>
                                    <li>If the reading is very high or "OL" (Over Limit), it indicates an open circuit in the coil winding (broken wire).</li>
                                    <li>If the reading is very close to zero (like a short circuit), it might indicate a shorted turn or a short between the coil terminals, although diagnosing shorted turns accurately often requires more sophisticated methods than a simple ohmmeter.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(c) Ammeter-Voltmeter Resistance Measurement Errors (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 3 shows the ammeter-voltmeter method with the voltmeter connected in parallel with the resistor R. This configuration is preferred for measuring low resistances, as the ammeter's internal resistance introduces less error compared to having the voltmeter measure the voltage across the series combination of the ammeter and R.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Voltmeter resistance \(R_V = 5000 \, \Omega\).</li>
                                    <li>Ammeter FSD current = 1 A.</li>
                                    <li>Ammeter accuracy = \( \pm 0.5 \% \) at full scale.</li>
                                    <li>Measured current \(I_m = 0.55 \, A\).</li>
                                    <li>Measured voltage \(V_m = 37.6 \, V\).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The ammeter measures the current \(I_m = 0.55 \, A\). The voltmeter measures the voltage \(V_m = 37.6 \, V\) across the resistor R.</p>

                                <p>**(i) Measured value of the resistor:**</p>
                                <p>The measured value is calculated directly from the meter readings:</p>
                                \[ R_{measured} = \frac{V_m}{I_m} = \frac{37.6 \, V}{0.55 \, A} \approx 68.364 \, \Omega \]

                                <p>**(ii) True value of the resistor:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">In this configuration (voltmeter in parallel with R), the ammeter measures the total current \(I_m\) which is the sum of the current through R (\(I_R\)) and the current through the voltmeter (\(I_V\)). \( I_m = I_R + I_V \).</p>
                                <p>The voltmeter measures the voltage across R, which is \(V_m\). The current through the voltmeter is \( I_V = \frac{V_m}{R_V} = \frac{37.6 \, V}{5000 \, \Omega} = 0.00752 \, A \).</p>
                                <p>The true current through the resistor R is \( I_R = I_m - I_V = 0.55 \, A - 0.00752 \, A = 0.54248 \, A \).</p>
                                <p>The true value of the resistor R is \( R_{true} = \frac{V_m}{I_R} = \frac{37.6 \, V}{0.54248 \, A} \approx 69.308 \, \Omega \).</

                                <p>**(iii) Error in ammeter reading:**</p>
                                <p>The ammeter accuracy is given as \( \pm 0.5\% \) of full scale (1A). The absolute error at full scale is \( \Delta I_{FS} = 0.005 \times 1 \, A = 0.005 \, A \). For an analog meter with full-scale accuracy, this absolute error is typically constant across the scale.</p>
                                <p>The true value of the current measured by the ammeter should be \(I_m = 0.55A\). The error in the ammeter reading is \( \pm 0.005 \, A \).</p>
                                <p>Absolute error in ammeter reading \( = \pm 0.005 \, A \).</p>

                                <p>**(iv) Percentage error in ammeter reading at 0.55 A:**</p>
                                <p>The percentage error based on the reading is \( \frac{\text{Absolute Error}}{\text{Reading}} \times 100\% \).</p>
                                \[ \% \text{Error at } 0.55A = \frac{\Delta I_{FS}}{I_m} \times 100\% = \frac{0.005 \, A}{0.55 \, A} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Error at } 0.55A \approx 0.00909 \times 100\% \approx 0.909 \% \]
                                <p>The percentage error in the ammeter reading at 0.55 A, relative to the reading itself, is approximately \( \pm 0.909 \% \). This is often called the percentage error of indication. The percentage error relative to full scale is 0.5%.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers atomic ionization, properties of silicon vs. germanium diodes, PN junction formation, and calculations involving current flow and energy in a semiconductor.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Ionization and Silicon vs. Germanium Diodes (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Two ways of ionizing an atom:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Ionization is the process by which an atom or molecule gains or loses electrons, becoming a charged ion.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**By Collision (Impact Ionization):** An atom can be ionized when it is struck by a high-energy particle (like an electron or another ion). If the incident particle has enough kinetic energy, it can knock out one or more electrons from the atom, creating a positive ion and free electron(s). This process occurs in gas discharges and semiconductor breakdown (avalanche effect).</li>
                                    <li>**By Photoionization:** An atom can absorb a photon (a particle of light) with sufficient energy. If the photon's energy is greater than the ionization energy of the atom, it can knock out an electron, leaving a positive ion. This occurs when materials are exposed to ultraviolet light or X-rays.</li>
                                    <li>**By Thermal Ionization:** At very high temperatures, atoms collide with each other with enough kinetic energy to cause ionization.</li>
                                    <li>**By Chemical Reaction:** In some chemical reactions (e.g., redox reactions), electrons can be transferred between atoms or molecules, forming ions.</li>
                                    <li>**By Strong Electric Field (Field Ionization):** A very strong external electric field can distort the potential barrier holding an electron in an atom, allowing the electron to tunnel out of the atom.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Two advantages of silicon over germanium diodes:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Higher Operating Temperature:** Silicon diodes can operate reliably at much higher temperatures (typically up to 150-175°C) compared to germanium diodes (typically up to 75-100°C). This is due to silicon's wider band gap.</li>
                                    <li>**Lower Reverse Saturation Current:** Silicon diodes have a significantly lower reverse saturation current (\(I_S\)) than germanium diodes. This makes silicon diodes behave more like ideal open circuits in reverse bias and less sensitive to temperature variations in the reverse direction.</li>
                                    <li>**Higher Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV) Rating:** Silicon diodes can withstand much higher reverse voltages before breaking down compared to germanium diodes.</li>
                                    <li>**Higher Power Handling Capability:** Generally, silicon diodes can handle higher currents and dissipate more power than germanium diodes of similar size.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>**Description:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When p-type and n-type semiconductors are joined, there is a high concentration of holes in the p-type material and a high concentration of free electrons in the n-type material.</li>
                                    <li>Due to this concentration gradient, holes from the p-side diffuse across the junction into the n-side, and free electrons from the n-side diffuse across the junction into the p-side.</li>
                                    <li>When a free electron diffuses into the p-side, it recombines with a hole. When a hole diffuses into the n-side, it recombines with a free electron.</li>
                                    <li>This diffusion and recombination process causes the region around the junction to be depleted of free charge carriers (both electrons and holes). This region is called the **depletion layer**.</li>
                                    <li>As electrons move from the n-side to the p-side, they leave behind positively charged donor impurity ions (\(N_D^+\)) in the n-type material near the junction.</li>
                                    <li>Similarly, as holes move from the p-side to the n-side, they leave behind negatively charged acceptor impurity ions (\(N_A^-\)) in the p-type material near the junction.</li>
                                    <li>These fixed, exposed ions create a built-in electric field across the depletion layer, directed from the positive ions in the n-region to the negative ions in the p-region. This electric field opposes further diffusion of majority carriers, and eventually, a state of equilibrium is reached where the diffusion current is balanced by the drift current caused by the built-in field. The potential difference across the depletion layer at equilibrium is called the built-in potential barrier.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) N-type Material Calculation (9 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">An N-type semiconductor has majority carriers (electrons) and minority carriers (holes). When a voltage is applied, current flows due to the drift of these carriers in the electric field.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Resistance of the N-type material \(R = 2 \, k\Omega = 2000 \, \Omega\).</li>
                                    <li>DC supply voltage \(V = 15 \, V\).</li>
                                    <li>Electronic charge \(e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C\).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Figure 4 shows the N-type material connected to a DC supply. The positive terminal is on the right, negative on the left.</p>
                                <p>**(i) Direction of electrons and holes inside the material:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">When a DC voltage is applied, an electric field is established inside the material, directed from the positive terminal to the negative terminal (from right to left in the diagram).</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Electrons:** Electrons are negative charge carriers. They will drift in the direction opposite to the electric field. So, electrons move from the negative terminal towards the positive terminal (from left to right in the diagram).</li>
                                    <li>**Holes:** Holes are positive charge carriers. They will drift in the direction of the electric field. So, holes move from the positive terminal towards the negative terminal (from right to left in the diagram).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="key-point">In an N-type material, electrons are the majority carriers, and holes are the minority carriers. The net current is the sum of the electron drift current and the hole drift current, but the electron current component is much larger.</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Calculations:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(I) Current through the material:** Use Ohm's Law \(I = V/R\).
                                        \[ I = \frac{15 \, V}{2000 \, \Omega} = 0.0075 \, A = 7.5 \, mA \]
                                        The current through the material is 7.5 mA.</li>
                                    <li>**(II) Number of electrons passing through a given point per second:**
                                        <p class="answer-intro">Current is the rate of flow of charge. \(I = \frac{dQ}{dt}\). The total charge passing a point per second is \(I\). This charge is carried by both electrons and holes. Assuming the question refers to the total number of *majority carriers* (electrons) needed to account for the *total current* if they were the only carriers (a common simplification in basic problems), we can relate the total charge flow to the number of electrons.</p>
                                        <p>Total charge passing per second = \(I = 7.5 \, mA = 7.5 \times 10^{-3} \, C/s\).
                                        Each electron carries a charge \(e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C\).
                                        Number of electrons passing per second \( n_e = \frac{\text{Total Charge per Second}}{\text{Charge per Electron}} \).</p>
                                        \[ n_e = \frac{7.5 \times 10^{-3} \, C/s}{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C/electron} \]
                                        \[ n_e = \frac{7.5}{1.6} \times 10^{-3 - (-19)} \, \mathrm{electrons/s} = 4.6875 \times 10^{16} \, \mathrm{electrons/s} \]
                                        <p>Approximately \(4.6875 \times 10^{16}\) electrons pass through a given point per second (contributing to the electron drift current part of the total current).</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>**(III) Electrical energy expended if the current is maintained for 30 mS:**
                                        <p class="answer-intro">Energy expended (Work done) is power times time. Power \(P = V \times I\). Time \(t = 30 \, mS = 30 \times 10^{-3} \, s\).</p>
                                        \[ \text{Energy} = P \times t = (V \times I) \times t \]
                                        \[ \text{Energy} = (15 \, V \times 7.5 \times 10^{-3} \, A) \times (30 \times 10^{-3} \, s) \]
                                        \[ \text{Energy} = (112.5 \times 10^{-3} \, W) \times (30 \times 10^{-3} \, s) \]
                                        \[ \text{Energy} = 3375 \times 10^{-6} \, J = 3.375 \times 10^{-3} \, J \]
                                        <p>The electrical energy expended is \(3.375 \, mJ\).</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers the analysis of a depletion MOSFET amplifier, BJT current gain relationships, BJT operating regions, and BJT common-collector configuration.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Depletion MOSFET Amplifier Analysis (14 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 1 shows an N-channel depletion MOSFET amplifier with voltage divider bias and a source resistor. The MOSFET parameters are \(I_{DSS} = 4 \, \mathrm{mA}\) and \(V_p = -5 \, \mathrm{V}\). Note: The question uses \(V_c\) and \(I_5\) which are likely typos and should refer to \(V_{GS}\) and \(I_D\), respectively.</p>
                                <p>From Figure 1: \(V_{DD} = 18 \, \mathrm{V}\), \(R_1 = 2.2 \, M\Omega\), \(R_2 = 1 \, M\Omega\), \(R_D = 3.3 \, k\Omega\), \(R_S = 1.5 \, k\Omega\). \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) form the voltage divider biasing the gate.</p>
                                <p>**(i) Gate bias voltage (\(V_G\)):**</p>
                                <p>The gate voltage is determined by the voltage divider \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) and \(V_{DD}\). Since the gate draws negligible DC current (\(I_G \approx 0\)), the voltage at the gate (\(V_G\)) is simply the voltage across \(R_2\).</p>
                                \[ V_G = V_{DD} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \]
                                \[ V_G = 18 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{1 \, M\Omega}{2.2 \, M\Omega + 1 \, M\Omega} = 18 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{1}{3.2} \]
                                \[ V_G = \frac{18}{3.2} \, \mathrm{V} = 5.625 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The gate bias voltage is \(V_G = 5.625 \, \mathrm{V}\).</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Gate-to-source voltage (\(V_{GS}\)):**</p>
                                <p>In this self-biased configuration (due to \(R_S\)), the source voltage \(V_S\) is the voltage drop across \(R_S\), \(V_S = I_D R_S\). The gate-source voltage is \(V_{GS} = V_G - V_S = V_G - I_D R_S\). We need to find \(V_{GS}\) and \(I_D\) at the DC operating point (Q-point). They are related by Shockley's equation:</p>
                                \[ I_D = I_{DSS} \left( 1 - \frac{V_{GS}}{V_p} \right)^2 \]
                                <p>We have two equations and two unknowns (\(I_D\) and \(V_{GS}\)):</p>
                                <p>1) \( V_{GS} = V_G - I_D R_S \quad (\text{Bias Equation}) \) -> \( V_{GS} = 5.625 \, V - I_D (1.5 \, k\Omega) \)</p>
                                <p>2) \( I_D = I_{DSS} \left( 1 - \frac{V_{GS}}{V_p} \right)^2 \quad (\text{Shockley's Equation}) \) -> \( I_D = 4 \, \mathrm{mA} \left( 1 - \frac{V_{GS}}{-5 \, V} \right)^2 = 4 \left( 1 + \frac{V_{GS}}{5} \right)^2 \, \mathrm{mA} \)</p>
                                <p>Substitute \( I_D = \frac{5.625 - V_{GS}}{1.5k} \) (from bias equation) into Shockley's equation:</p>
                                \[ \frac{5.625 - V_{GS}}{1.5 \times 10^3} = 4 \times 10^{-3} \left( 1 + \frac{V_{GS}}{5} \right)^2 \]
                                \[ \frac{5.625 - V_{GS}}{1.5} = 4 \left( 1 + 0.2V_{GS} \right)^2 \]
                                \[ 5.625 - V_{GS} = 6 (1 + 0.4V_{GS} + 0.04V_{GS}^2) \]
                                \[ 5.625 - V_{GS} = 6 + 2.4V_{GS} + 0.24V_{GS}^2 \]
                                \[ 0.24V_{GS}^2 + 2.4V_{GS} + V_{GS} + 6 - 5.625 = 0 \]
                                \[ 0.24V_{GS}^2 + 3.4V_{GS} + 0.375 = 0 \]
                                <p>Using the quadratic formula \( V_{GS} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):</p>
                                \[ V_{GS} = \frac{-3.4 \pm \sqrt{(3.4)^2 - 4(0.24)(0.375)}}{2(0.24)} = \frac{-3.4 \pm \sqrt{11.56 - 0.36}}{0.48} = \frac{-3.4 \pm \sqrt{11.2}}{0.48} \]
                                \[ V_{GS} = \frac{-3.4 \pm 3.3466}{0.48} \]
                                <p>Possible solutions:</p>
                                \[ V_{GS1} = \frac{-3.4 + 3.3466}{0.48} \approx -0.111 \, V \]
                                \[ V_{GS2} = \frac{-3.4 - 3.3466}{0.48} \approx -14.055 \, V \]
                                <p>Since \(V_p = -5V\), \(V_{GS}\) must be \(\ge V_p\) for the transistor to conduct. \(V_{GS1} \approx -0.111V\) is \(\ge -5V\), which is a valid operating point in the depletion mode. \(V_{GS2} \approx -14.055V\) is less than \(V_p\), which would mean \(I_D=0\), contradicting the circuit biasing. Thus, \(V_{GS} \approx -0.111 \, V\).</p>
                                <p>The gate-to-source voltage is approximately -0.111 V.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) Drain current (\(I_D\)):**</p>
                                <p>Using the bias equation \( I_D = \frac{V_G - V_{GS}}{R_S} \):</p>
                                \[ I_D = \frac{5.625 \, V - (-0.111 \, V)}{1.5 \, k\Omega} = \frac{5.736 \, V}{1.5 \times 10^3 \, \Omega} = \frac{5.736}{1.5} \, mA \]
                                \[ I_D \approx 3.824 \, mA \]
                                <p>Verify with Shockley's equation: \( I_D = 4 \, \mathrm{mA} \left( 1 + \frac{-0.111}{5} \right)^2 = 4 (1 - 0.0222)^2 = 4(0.9778)^2 = 4 \times 0.9560 \approx 3.824 \, \mathrm{mA} \).</p>
                                <p>The drain current is approximately 3.824 mA.</p>

                                <p>**(iv) Drain voltage (\(V_D\)):**</p>
                                <p>The voltage at the drain terminal is \(V_{DD}\) minus the voltage drop across \(R_D\).</p>

This voltage causes the electron beam to sweep horizontally across the screen at a constant speed from left to right, and then rapidly return to the starting point. This provides the time axis for displaying the input signal waveform. (Same as Q8a(i) Nov 2018)</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Trigger pulse generator (Trigger Circuit):** Synchronizes the start of the horizontal sweep with a specific point (e.g., a rising or falling edge at a particular voltage level) of the input signal (or an external signal). This ensures that the waveform display starts at the same point of the input signal cycle each time, creating a stable, non-moving display on the screen. (Same as Q8a(ii) Nov 2018)</li>

This signal is applied to the vertical deflection plates (Y-plates). The amplification allows the CRO to display signals with small amplitudes and provides the user with control over the vertical size (Volts/Div) of the displayed waveform.

                                <p>**Description:** The circuit consists of a series resistor \(R_S\) and a Zener diode connected in parallel (shunt) with the load \(R_L\). The Zener diode is connected in reverse bias. \(R_S\) limits the current flowing into the Zener and the load. When the input voltage \(V_{in}\) is greater than the Zener breakdown voltage \(V_Z\), the Zener diode enters the breakdown region and maintains a nearly constant voltage \(V_Z\) across its terminals and, therefore, across the parallel load \(R_L\). If \(V_{in}\) increases, the current through \(R_S\) increases; the Zener current \(I_Z\) increases while \(V_L\) remains nearly constant. If the load current \(I_L\) decreases (due to increasing \(R_L\)), \(I_Z\) increases to keep \(I_S\) constant (\(I_S = I_Z + I_L\)), maintaining \(V_L\) constant. Regulation is maintained as long as the Zener stays in breakdown (\(I_Z \ge I_{Z,min}\)) and its maximum current rating is not exceeded (\(I_Z \le I_{Z,max}\)). (Same as Q8c(ii) Nov 2018)</p>
