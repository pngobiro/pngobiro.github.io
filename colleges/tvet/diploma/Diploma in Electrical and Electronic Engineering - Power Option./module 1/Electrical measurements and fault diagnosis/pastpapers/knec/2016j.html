                            <div class="answer-detail">
                                <p class="answer-intro">This question focuses on the fundamental concepts of units and dimensions in electrical measurements, covering different systems like absolute, derived, electrostatic, electromagnetic, and LMTI.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Unit Definitions (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Absolute Unit:** A unit of measurement defined in terms of fundamental physical quantities (like length, mass, time, electric current) without the use of arbitrary proportionality constants or dependence on the properties of specific substances. Absolute units are derived directly from a system's base units. The SI system is an absolute system. Example: The joule (J) is an absolute unit of energy defined as kg⋅m²/s².</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Derived Unit:** A unit of measurement for a physical quantity that is defined as a combination of the fundamental units of a given system of units. Example: Velocity (m/s) is derived from length (m) and time (s). Force (Newton, N) is derived from mass (kg), length (m), and time (s) (N = kg⋅m/s²).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Dimensions in Electrostatic System of Units (ESU) (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The electrostatic system (ESU) is based on CGS (centimeter-gram-second) units and Coulomb's law, where the permittivity of vacuum (\(\epsilon_0\)) is taken as 1. The fundamental dimensions are Length (L), Mass (M), and Time (T).</p>
                                <p>Coulomb's Law: \( F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \). In ESU, \(k=1/\epsilon_0=1\), so \( F = \frac{q^2}{r^2} \). Force \(F\) has dimensions \([MLT^{-2}]\), and distance \(r\) has dimensions \([L]\).</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Charge (Q):** From \( F = \frac{Q^2}{L^2} \), \( Q^2 = F \times L^2 \).
                                        \[ [Q^2] = [MLT^{-2}] [L^2] = [ML^3T^{-2}] \]
                                        \[ [Q] = [M^{1/2}L^{3/2}T^{-1}] \]
                                        The ESU unit of charge is the statcoulomb or esu of charge.</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Current (I):** Current is the rate of flow of charge, \(I = Q/T\).
                                        \[ [I] = \frac{[Q]}{[T]} = \frac{[M^{1/2}L^{3/2}T^{-1}]}{[T]} = [M^{1/2}L^{3/2}T^{-2}] \]
                                        The ESU unit of current is the statampere or esu of current.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Advantages of the MKS System (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The MKS (Meter-Kilogram-Second) system formed the basis for the modern SI system. Advantages include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Coherence:** The MKS system is largely coherent, meaning derived units are formed using simple multiplication and division without arbitrary constants.</li>
                                    <li>**Practical Magnitudes:** The magnitudes of the base units (meter, kilogram, second) are convenient for many practical engineering applications compared to the CGS system.</li>
                                    <li>**Integration of Mechanics and Electromagnetism:** Unlike the split in CGS (ESU/EMU), MKS (and SI) provides a single, unified framework for both mechanics and electromagnetism, simplifying formulas (e.g., using \(\mu_0\) and \(\epsilon_0\)).</li>
                                    <li>**International Standard:** The SI system, based on MKS plus other base units, is the internationally recognized and adopted standard system of units, facilitating global communication and trade in science and engineering.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(d) Dimensions in LMTI System (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The LMTI system uses Length (L), Mass (M), Time (T), and Electric Current (I) as fundamental dimensions.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) EMF (Electromotive Force):** EMF is energy per unit charge (\(E = W/Q\)). Energy (Work, \(W\)) has dimensions \([ML^2T^{-2}]\). Charge \(Q\) has dimensions \([IT]\).
                                        \[ [EMF] = \frac{[ML^2T^{-2}]}{[IT]} = [ML^2T^{-3}I^{-1}] \]
                                        The dimension derivation \( \cdots=\frac{\text { cuork }}{\text { Ghangt }} \) in the OCR aligns with this definition.</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Magnetic Flux Density (B):** From the force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field, \(F = BIL\) (where B is perpendicular to I and L). Force \(F\) has dimensions \([MLT^{-2}]\). Current \(I\) has dimensions \([I]\). Length \(L\) has dimensions \([L]\).
                                        \[ [B] = \frac{[F]}{[I][L]} = \frac{[MLT^{-2}]}{[I][L]} = [MT^{-2}I^{-1}] \]
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(a) Types of Measurement Errors (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Environmental Errors:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Explanation:** Errors caused by external environmental conditions like changes in temperature, humidity, pressure, atmospheric pollution, or external magnetic/electrostatic fields. These conditions can affect the properties of the instrument or the test object (e.g., resistance changing with temperature).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Instrumental Errors:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Explanation:** Errors inherent in the measuring instrument itself due to its construction, calibration, or operation. Examples include friction in moving parts, incorrect spring tension, aging of components, or non-uniform scales.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(iii) Gross Errors:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Explanation:** Human errors resulting from mistakes by the observer, such as incorrect reading of the instrument, improper recording of data, miscalculation, or faulty connection of the instrument in the circuit. These are often due to carelessness or lack of experience.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(iv) Residual Errors (Random Errors):**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Explanation:** Small, random variations in measurements that remain even after systematic and gross errors have been minimized. They are caused by unpredictable fluctuations in the system, environment, or observation process. They cannot be eliminated but can be reduced by taking multiple measurements and averaging. The OCR's "Randim accientrats - Smult ang" likely refers to "Random accidental errors - Small magnitude".</li>

                                <p class="answer-intro">Detectors are used in AC bridges to indicate when the bridge is balanced (when the voltage across the detector is zero). Different detectors are suitable for different frequency ranges.</p>
                                <p>Three common detectors and their approximate frequency ranges:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Headphones (or Earphones):** Used for audio frequencies (typically 250 Hz to 4 kHz). The balance is indicated by minimum sound in the headphones. Simple and inexpensive.</li>
                                    <li>**Vibration Galvanometer:** Used for power frequencies (typically 5 Hz to 1000 Hz). A vibrating reed resonates at the AC frequency, and balance is indicated by minimum vibration amplitude (or deflection of a light spot). Highly sensitive at its resonant frequency.</li>
                                    <li>**Electronic Null Detectors (e.g., Amplifiers with Meters/CROs):** Used for a wide range of frequencies, including audio and radio frequencies (up to several MHz). An amplifier increases the sensitivity, and the output is displayed on a meter (like a sensitive voltmeter) or an oscilloscope. Balance is indicated by a minimum voltage reading or a minimum deflection/trace on the CRO.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Factors affecting precision of medium resistance measurement with Wheatstone Bridge (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The Wheatstone bridge is commonly used for precise measurement of medium resistances. Factors affecting its precision include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Temperature effects:** The resistance of the bridge arms (including the unknown resistor and the standard resistors) changes with temperature. Non-uniform temperature distribution or changes during the measurement can cause errors. Precision resistors used in bridges should have low temperature coefficients, and the bridge should be operated in a stable thermal environment or allowed to reach thermal equilibrium.</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Contact resistance:** Resistance introduced at the points where wires connect to terminals, where components are soldered, or within switches. These small resistances are in series with the bridge arms and can become significant when measuring medium or low resistances, affecting the balance condition. Clean connections, well-designed terminals, and minimizing the number of contact points help reduce this effect.</li>
                                    <li>**(iii) Thermo-electric effects:** When conductors of different materials are joined, temperature gradients can generate small voltages (Seebeck effect). These thermo-electric e.m.f.s can occur at junctions within the bridge circuits, especially if there are temperature differences, and can interfere with the null detection, particularly when measuring with sensitive galvanometers. Using materials with low thermo-electric properties or minimizing temperature gradients across the bridge helps.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Understanding the sources of errors and the characteristics of measurement tools like detectors and bridges is essential for performing accurate electrical measurements.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Points a service engineer should consider when fault finding (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Effective fault finding requires a systematic approach and consideration of various factors. Three important points include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Understanding the equipment's normal operation:** A service engineer must know how the equipment is supposed to work, the function of each major block or stage, and expected signals, voltages, or states at various test points. This knowledge allows them to identify deviations from normal behavior. (OCR's "history and" might relate to equipment history or documentation).</li>
                                    <li>**Information Gathering:** Collect all relevant information before starting. This includes the user's description of the problem, conditions under which the fault occurs, recent events (e.g., power surge, software update, physical impact), equipment history (previous repairs, known issues), and available documentation (user manual, service manual, circuit diagrams).</li>
                                    <li>**Systematic Troubleshooting Method:** Employ a logical and systematic method to isolate the fault, such as functional area testing, half-split method, signal tracing, or signal injection. Avoid randomly probing or replacing components. A systematic approach saves time and prevents further damage.</li>
                                    <li>**Safety Precautions:** Always prioritize safety. Ensure the equipment is safely disconnected from power (lockout/tagout), discharge capacitors, use insulated tools, and follow all relevant safety procedures to prevent electric shock or other hazards.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(d) Objectives of good maintenance (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>Good maintenance practices have both operational and cost-related objectives.</p>
                                <p>**Operational Objectives:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To ensure equipment is available and reliable when needed (maximize uptime).</li>
                                    <li>To maintain equipment performance and efficiency at optimal levels.</li>
                                    <li>To ensure equipment operates safely and compliantly with regulations.</li>
                                    <li>To extend the useful life of the equipment.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**Cost Objectives:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To minimize total maintenance costs (labor, parts, external services).</li>
                                    <li>To minimize costs associated with equipment failure (downtime, lost production, scrap, emergency repairs).</li>
                                    <li>To optimize resource utilization (labor, tools, parts inventory).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Effective maintenance is a combination of planned activities, skilled troubleshooting, and proper use of tools and documentation, aiming to optimize equipment performance and minimize overall costs.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question explores the concept of reliability, key reliability metrics, and calculations based on equipment test data.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Definition of Reliability (3 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>Reliability, as applied in electrical measurements or equipment in general, is the probability that an item will perform its intended function without failure for a specified period of time under specified environmental and operating conditions.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Importance of Reliability Metrics (5 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>These terms are important measures for assessing and predicting the performance and dependability of equipment over time:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):** (Interpretation based on OCR: "Trmir when thr mechime wru sinw the work." -> Time when the machine was doing the work) - More accurately, MTBF is the average time a repairable item operates before it fails. It is a measure of the reliability for repairable systems in their useful life period (constant failure rate). A higher MTBF indicates a more reliable system that operates longer between failures.</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Mean Time to Failure (MTTF):** (Interpretation based on OCR: "-To Somer The purpese wiven in peraed it failioro" -> To serve the purpose given in period of failure) - More accurately, MTTF is the average time a non-repairable item is expected to function before it fails. It is used for items that are discarded after failure (e.g., light bulbs, fuses) or for the first failure of a repairable system. It represents the expected lifespan before the first failure.</li>
                                    <li>**(iii) Availability:** (Interpretation based on OCR: "- the avallelbelity of a meqferce' to smere the sipurard porpose" -> the availability of a resource to serve the intended purpose) - More accurately, Availability is the probability that a repairable item is in an operational state at any given time. It depends on both how often it fails (MTBF or failure rate) and how quickly it can be repaired (MTTR - Mean Time To Repair). It's a measure of operational readiness.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Reliability Calculations from Test Data (12 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Ten pressure monitors were tested for 1200 hours. Failed units are replaced immediately, which is characteristic of test methodologies aiming to calculate MTBF (for repairable systems) or failure rate based on total operating time.</p>
                                <p>From the table, let's list the failure times for each unit:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Unit 1: Failed at 650 hrs (1 failure)</li>
                                    <li>Unit 2: Failed at 420 hrs (1 failure)</li>
                                    <li>Unit 3: Failed at 130 hrs and 725 hrs (2 failures)</li>
                                    <li>Unit 4: Failed at 585 hrs (1 failure)</li>
                                    <li>Unit 5: Failed at 630 hrs and 950 hrs (2 failures)</li>
                                    <li>Unit 6: Failed at 390 hrs (1 failure)</li>
                                    <li>Unit 7: No failure (0 failures) - Operated for 1200 hrs</li>
                                    <li>Unit 8: Failed at 880 hrs (1 failure)</li>
                                    <li>Unit 9: No failure (0 failures) - Operated for 1200 hrs</li>
                                    <li>Unit 10: Failed at 220 hrs and 675 hrs (2 failures)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Total number of failures = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 11 failures.</p>
                                <p>Total operating time for all units until the end of the test (1200 hours). Since failed units were replaced immediately, the total test time is 10 units * 1200 hours/unit = 12,000 device-hours.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">If units were NOT replaced, the total operating time would be the sum of the time each unit operated before its *last* failure or the end of the test. Since they *are* replaced, we use total accumulated operating hours.</p>
                                <p>Total number of device-hours = 10 units \(\times\) 1200 hours/unit = 12,000 device-hours.</p>

                                <p>**(i) MTBF:**</p>
                                <p>MTBF is calculated as the total operating time divided by the total number of failures during that time, for repairable systems.</p>
                                \[ MTBF = \frac{\text{Total Operating Time}}{\text{Total Number of Failures}} \]

                                <p>The failure rate (\(\lambda\)) is the reciprocal of MTBF (assuming a constant failure rate, typical for the useful life period). It is the number of failures per unit of time.</p>

                                \[ \lambda = \frac{11 \text{ failures}}{12,000 \text{ device-hours}} \approx 0.0009167 \text{ failures/hour} \]
                                <p>The failure rate can also be expressed per 1000 hours:</p>

                                \[ \lambda \approx 0.9167 \text{ failures per 1000 hours} \]

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question addresses inaccuracies in magnetic measurements, fault location methods in electronics, specific wattmeter errors, and the Hibbert magnetic standard.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Reasons for inaccuracies in magnetic measurements (3 marks):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Non-uniformity of magnetic field:** The magnetic field in the specimen or air gap may not be perfectly uniform, especially near edges or in complex shapes, leading to inaccurate measurements of average flux density.</li>
                                    <li>**Hysteresis effects:** Magnetic materials exhibit hysteresis, meaning the magnetization depends not only on the current magnetic field but also on the material's magnetic history. Measurements can be affected by residual magnetism or the path taken on the hysteresis loop.</li>
                                    <li>**Eddy currents:** Changing magnetic fields induce eddy currents in conductive magnetic specimens or surrounding structures. These currents dissipate energy and produce opposing magnetic fields, affecting the accuracy of measurements, especially with AC or changing fields.</li>
                                    <li>**Leakage flux:** Not all magnetic flux is confined to the intended path (e.g., the specimen). Some flux may leak into the surrounding air, leading to discrepancies between calculated and actual flux density in the specimen.</li>
                                    <li>**Loading effect of measuring instrument:** Connecting instruments like search coils or Hall effect sensors can slightly alter the magnetic field being measured.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Six methods of fault location in electronic systems (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Visual Inspection:** Examining the circuit board and components for obvious signs of damage, such as burnt components, broken traces, poor solder joints, swollen capacitors, or loose connections.</li>
                                    <li>**Component Swapping:** Replacing a suspected faulty component with a known good one to see if the problem is resolved. Most effective for common or easily accessible components.</li>
                                    <li>**Signal Tracing:** Using an oscilloscope or logic probe to follow a signal through the circuit, starting from the input, to identify where the signal is lost, distorted, or incorrect.</li>
                                    <li>**Signal Injection:** Injecting a known test signal (e.g., from a signal generator) at different points in the circuit, starting from the output and working backward, to see where the signal appears or is processed correctly.</li>
                                    <li>**Voltage/Current Measurement:** Measuring DC or AC voltages and currents at key points in the circuit and comparing them to expected values (often found in service manuals or circuit diagrams). Deviations indicate a fault in that area.</li>
                                    <li>**Resistance/Continuity Measurement:** Using a multimeter to check the resistance of components or paths on the board (usually with power off) or verifying continuity of traces and connections to identify open or short circuits.</li>
                                    <li>**Functional Area Testing:** Dividing the system into functional blocks and testing each block independently to isolate the faulty section (as described in Q2b).</li>
                                    <li>**Half-Split Method:** A systematic method of testing at points that divide the remaining circuit into halves to quickly narrow down the faulty area (as described in Q2b).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Wattmeter Errors (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Wattmeters measure electrical power. Errors can occur due to various factors related to their design and operation.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Eddy current errors:** Eddy currents can be induced in the metal parts (like the frame, covers, or even thick conductors) of the wattmeter by the alternating magnetic fields produced by the current and pressure coils. These eddy currents dissipate energy and produce their own magnetic fields, which can interact with the main fields, causing a torque error. This error is frequency-dependent and is more significant at higher frequencies. Using non-conductive or laminated materials for wattmeter parts helps minimize eddy currents.</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Stray magnetic field errors:** External magnetic fields from nearby conductors, equipment, or even Earth's magnetic field can interact with the magnetic fields produced by the wattmeter's current and pressure coils, introducing an erroneous torque on the moving system. This affects the meter's reading. Shielding the wattmeter with magnetic materials helps reduce the influence of stray fields.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p class="answer-intro">The Hibbert Magnetic Standard is used to produce a known change in magnetic flux linkage for calibrating ballistic galvanometers or fluxmeters. It consists of permanent magnets that create a strong magnetic field in an air gap, and a coil that is quickly moved through this field.</p>
                                <p>**Construction:**</p>
                                <p>The standard typically comprises:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Permanent Magnets:** Two powerful permanent magnets arranged to create a magnetic field.</li>
                                    <li>**Iron Core:** A soft-iron core positioned between the magnets to concentrate and shape the magnetic flux, creating a relatively uniform and strong field in the air gap.</li>
                                    <li>**Air Gap:** The space between the magnets (often structured by the iron core) where the uniform magnetic field is located.</li>
                                    <li>**Test Coil:** A coil with a known number of turns (\(N\)) designed to fit within the air gap and to be moved rapidly through it. It is usually cylindrical and attached to a rod or handle for easy manipulation.</li>
                                    <li>**Guide/Tube:** A non-magnetic tube or guide through which the coil moves, ensuring it passes through the air gap consistently.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The diagram shows the arrangement where the test coil can be plunged into or withdrawn from the region of strong flux in the air gap. The change in flux linkage is used for calibration (as described in detail in Q1c of the July 2015 paper).</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Understanding the sources of errors in magnetic measurements, having a repertoire of fault location techniques, being aware of instrument-specific errors like those in wattmeters, and knowing calibration standards are all vital aspects of electrical and electronic engineering practice.</p>

The V-I characteristic curve shows the forward bias region, reverse bias region (with small leakage current), and the reverse breakdown region.</p>
                                <p>**Description of Avalanche Breakdown on the V-I Curve:**</p>
                                <p>In the reverse bias region, when the reverse voltage is increased from 0V, only a very small reverse saturation current (\(I_S\)) flows. This current is due to minority carriers and is nearly constant with increasing reverse voltage. However, as the reverse voltage approaches the breakdown voltage (\(V_{BR}\)), minority carriers gain significant kinetic energy from the strong electric field in the depletion region.</p>
                                <p>At the breakdown voltage \(V_{BR}\), these high-energy carriers collide with atoms in the crystal lattice, causing impact ionization and generating new electron-hole pairs. The generated carriers are also accelerated and cause further collisions, leading to an avalanche multiplication effect. On the V-I characteristic curve, this is shown as a sharp, almost vertical increase in the reverse current at \(V_{BR}\). The voltage across the diode remains relatively constant at \(V_{BR}\) in this region, provided the external circuit limits the current to prevent damage. Operation in this region is used in Zener diodes for voltage regulation.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Silicon Diode Resistance Calculation (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">We are asked to determine the forward and reverse resistance of a silicon diode from given operating points. Note that the provided values for reverse current ("\(1.2/1 \, A\)") and forward current ("\(150.1 n \, A\)") seem incorrect or unusual based on typical diode behavior. A forward current of 1.5V would typically be in the mA range for silicon, and reverse current is usually much smaller (nA or µA). Also, "\(1.2/1 \, A\)" is ambiguous. Assuming a typo and interpreting "1.2/1 A" as 1.2 A for reverse current, and "150.1 n A" as 150.1 nA for forward current is also highly unlikely for silicon at 1.5V forward. Let's assume there's a typo and the forward current at 1.5V is meant to be in the mA range, and the reverse current at 12V is meant to be much smaller.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Given the likely errors in the provided current values, I will calculate the resistance using the provided numbers directly, but flag that they appear non-standard for a silicon diode.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">An N-channel JFET consists of an N-type semiconductor channel with P-type regions diffused or implanted on opposite sides to form the gate. The operation relies on varying the effective width of the channel using a gate-source voltage, which in turn controls the current flow between the drain and source.</p>
                                <p>**Principle of Operation (Biased from two sources - \(V_{DD}\) and \(V_{GG}\)):**</p>
                                <p>In a two-source biasing setup:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A positive voltage \(V_{DD}\) is applied between the drain and source (\(V_{DS} > 0\)). This causes electrons to flow from the source (negative terminal) through the N-channel to the drain (positive terminal), constituting the drain current \(I_D\).</li>
                                    <li>A negative voltage \(V_{GG}\) is applied between the gate and source (\(V_{GS} < 0\)). This reverse-biases the PN junction between the P-type gate and the N-channel.</li>
                                    <li>The reverse bias voltage at the gate-channel junction creates a depletion region within the N-channel. This depletion region is devoid of free charge carriers and effectively narrows the conductive path of the channel.</li>
                                    <li>As the negative \(V_{GS}\) voltage is increased (made more negative), the reverse bias across the gate-channel junction increases, causing the depletion region to widen further and constrict the channel.</li>
                                    <li>If \(V_{GS}\) is made sufficiently negative, the depletion regions from either side can meet or nearly meet, closing off the channel and reducing the drain current to zero (or near zero). This \(V_{GS}\) voltage is called the pinch-off voltage (\(V_p\)).</li>
                                    <li>Conversely, making \(V_{GS}\) less negative (closer to 0V) reduces the depletion region width, widening the channel and increasing the drain current.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Thus, the JFET acts as a voltage-controlled resistor or current source, where the gate-source voltage \(V_{GS}\) controls the drain current \(I_D\).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) JFET Biasing Calculations (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>Given \(I_{DSS} = 8 \, \mathrm{mA}\) and \(V_p = -4 \, \mathrm{V}\) for the JFET in part (i).</p>
                                <p>**(i) Fixed Bias Configuration (Figure 2):**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>From Figure 2, the gate is connected to a fixed voltage source \(V_{GG} = -2 \, \mathrm{V}\) through resistor \(R_G\). Since \(R_G\) is typically very large (to prevent gate current flow), there is negligible voltage drop across \(R_G\), so the gate voltage \(V_G = V_{GG} = -2 \, \mathrm{V}\).</li>
                                    <li>The source terminal is directly connected to ground (\(R_S = 0\)), so \(V_S = 0 \, \mathrm{V}\).</li>

                                    <li>**Gate-to-source voltage \(V_{GS}\):** \( V_{GS} = V_G - V_S = -2 \, \mathrm{V} - 0 \, \mathrm{V} = -2 \, \mathrm{V} \).</li>
                                    <li>**Drain current \(I_D\):** Use Shockley's equation: \( I_D = I_{DSS} \left( 1 - \frac{V_{GS}}{V_p} \right)^2 \).

                                    <li>**Drain voltage \(V_D\):** The voltage at the drain is \(V_{DD}\) minus the voltage drop across \(R_D\). From Figure 2, \(V_{DD} = 12 \, \mathrm{V}\) and \(R_D = 2 \, k\Omega\).
                                        \[ V_D = V_{DD} - I_D R_D = 12 \, \mathrm{V} - (2 \, \mathrm{mA}) \times (2 \, k\Omega) \]

                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>For this Q-point (\(V_{GS} = -2V, I_D = 2mA\)), check if the JFET is in the saturation region: \(V_{DS} = V_D - V_S = 8V - 0V = 8V\). We need \(V_{DS} \geq V_{GS} - V_p\). \(V_{GS} - V_p = -2V - (-4V) = 2V\). Since \(8V \geq 2V\), the JFET is operating in the saturation region as assumed for using Shockley's equation.</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Self Bias Configuration (Figure 3):**</p>
                                <p>Given \(I_{DSS} = 8 \, \mathrm{mA}\), \(V_p = -6 \, \mathrm{V}\). The Q-point is \(I_{DQ} = 4 \, \mathrm{mA}\). Assuming \(R_D = 3 R_S\). We need to determine \(R_S\) and \(R_D\).</p>
                                <p>In a self-bias configuration with the gate grounded through \(R_G\), \(V_G = 0 \, \mathrm{V}\) (since gate current is negligible, there is no voltage drop across \(R_G\)). The voltage at the source is \(V_S = I_D R_S\). The gate-source voltage is \(V_{GS} = V_G - V_S = 0 - I_D R_S = -I_D R_S\).</p>
                                <p>At the Q-point, \(V_{GSQ} = -I_{DQ} R_S\). We use Shockley's equation at the Q-point:</p>
                                \[ I_{DQ} = I_{DSS} \left( 1 - \frac{V_{GSQ}}{V_p} \right)^2 \]
                                <p>Substitute the known values and the expression for \(V_{GSQ}\):</p>
                                \[ 4 \, \mathrm{mA} = 8 \, \mathrm{mA} \left( 1 - \frac{-I_{DQ} R_S}{V_p} \right)^2 \]
                                \[ 4 \, \mathrm{mA} = 8 \, \mathrm{mA} \left( 1 - \frac{-(4 \, \mathrm{mA}) R_S}{-6 \, \mathrm{V}} \right)^2 \]
                                \[ 0.5 = \left( 1 - \frac{4 \times 10^{-3} R_S}{6} \right)^2 \]
                                \[ 0.5 = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1500} R_S \right)^2 \]
                                <p>Take the square root of both sides (we expect \(V_{GSQ}\) to be between \(V_p\) and 0V, so \(1 - V_{GSQ}/V_p\) is positive):</p>
                                \[ \sqrt{0.5} = 1 - \frac{R_S}{1500} \]
                                \[ 0.7071 \approx 1 - \frac{R_S}{1500} \]

                                <p>**(i) Three Bipolar Junction Transistor configurations:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Common Emitter (CE) Configuration:** The emitter terminal is common to both the input (base) and output (collector) circuits. Offers both current and voltage gain, with a 180° phase shift between input and output voltage. Widely used for amplification.</li>

                                    <li>**Common Collector (CC) Configuration:** The collector terminal is common to both the input (base) and output (emitter) circuits. Also known as an emitter follower. Offers current gain but no voltage gain (voltage gain is slightly less than 1). Primarily used for buffering and impedance matching.</li>

                                <p>**(ii) NPN Transistor Calculations:**</p>

                                        \[ I_B = I_E - I_C = 10 \, \mathrm{mA} - 9.67 \, \mathrm{mA} = 0.33 \, \mathrm{mA} \]

                                <p class="answer-intro">The circuit uses a voltage divider (\(R_1, R_2\)) to bias the base of the NPN transistor. Assume the base current \(I_B\) is small enough to be neglected compared to the current through the voltage divider (valid if \(R_2 \ll \beta R_E\)). We are given \(V_{BE} = 0.5 \, \mathrm{V}\) and \(I_C \simeq I_E\).</p>
                                <p>First, calculate the base voltage (\(V_B\)) using the voltage divider formula:</p>
                                \[ V_B = V_{CC} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \]
                                <p>From Figure 4: \(V_{CC} = 10 \, \mathrm{V}\), \(R_1 = 10 \, k\Omega\), \(R_2 = 2.2 \, k\Omega\), \(R_C = 1 \, k\Omega\), \(R_E = 560 \, \Omega = 0.56 \, k\Omega\).</p>
                                \[ V_B = 10 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{2.2 \, k\Omega}{10 \, k\Omega + 2.2 \, k\Omega} = 10 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{2.2}{12.2} \approx 1.8033 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The emitter voltage (\(V_E\)) is \(V_B\) minus the base-emitter voltage drop \(V_{BE}\):</p>
                                \[ V_E = V_B - V_{BE} = 1.8033 \, \mathrm{V} - 0.5 \, \mathrm{V} = 1.3033 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The emitter current (\(I_E\)) flows through \(R_E\):</p>

                                <p>We are given the assumption \(I_C \simeq I_E\).</p>
                                <ul>

                                <p>The collector voltage (\(V_C\)) is \(V_{CC}\) minus the voltage drop across \(R_C\):</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) DC Load Line and Q-point (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The DC load line represents all possible operating points (\(I_C, V_{CE}\)) for the transistor circuit, independent of the transistor's characteristics. It is determined by the DC circuit components (\(V_{CC}, R_C, R_E\)). The Q-point (Quiescent point) is the actual operating point determined by the intersection of the load line and the transistor's characteristic curves (which are not drawn here).</p>
                                <p>The equation for the DC load line is derived from the voltage loop equation around the collector-emitter path:</p>
                                \[ V_{CC} = I_C R_C + V_{CE} + I_E R_E \]
                                <p>Using the approximation \(I_E \simeq I_C\):</p>
                                \[ V_{CC} \approx I_C R_C + V_{CE} + I_C R_E \]
                                \[ V_{CC} \approx I_C (R_C + R_E) + V_{CE} \]
                                <p>Rearranging to solve for \(I_C\):</p>
                                \[ I_C (R_C + R_E) \approx V_{CC} - V_{CE} \]
                                \[ I_C \approx \frac{V_{CC}}{R_C + R_E} - \frac{1}{R_C + R_E} V_{CE} \]
                                <p>This is a linear equation of the form \(I_C = m V_{CE} + c\), which defines a straight line on the \(I_C\)-\(V_{CE}\) plane. To draw the load line, we can find two points:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Y-intercept (when \(V_{CE} = 0\)):** \( I_C \approx \frac{V_{CC}}{R_C + R_E} \). This is the approximate saturation current.
                                        \[ I_{C,sat} \approx \frac{10 \, \mathrm{V}}{1 \, k\Omega + 0.56 \, k\Omega} = \frac{10 \, \mathrm{V}}{1.56 \, k\Omega} \approx 6.41 \, \mathrm{mA} \]
                                        So, point 1 is approximately \((V_{CE}=0, I_C=6.41 \, \mathrm{mA})\).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>**X-intercept (when \(I_C = 0\)):** \( V_{CE} = V_{CC} \). This is the cutoff voltage.
                                        \[ V_{CE,cutoff} = V_{CC} = 10 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                        So, point 2 is \((V_{CE}=10 \, \mathrm{V}, I_C=0)\).
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
