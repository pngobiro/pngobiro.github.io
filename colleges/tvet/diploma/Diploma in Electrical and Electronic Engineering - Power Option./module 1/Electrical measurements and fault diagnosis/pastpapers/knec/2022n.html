                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers fundamental measurement definitions, dimensional analysis, 3-phase power measurement, and interpreting oscilloscope-like test data.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Measurement Definitions (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Unit:** A specific magnitude of a physical quantity that is defined and adopted as a standard for measuring the same physical quantity. Examples: meter (for length), kilogram (for mass), ampere (for current).</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Standard:** A fundamental reference used to define, realize, or reproduce a unit of measurement. Standards provide the basis for calibrating measuring instruments and ensuring measurement consistency. Examples: International prototype of the kilogram, cesium atomic clock.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Dimensions of Resistivity in LMTI System (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The LMTI system uses Length (L), Mass (M), Time (T), and Electric Current (I) as fundamental dimensions. Resistivity (\(\rho\)) is a material property related to resistance (R), length (l), and cross-sectional area (A) by the formula \( R = \frac{\rho l}{A} \). Rearrange to find \(\rho\): \( \rho = \frac{R A}{l} \).</p>
                                <p>We need the dimensions of resistance (R) in the LMTI system. Resistance is voltage divided by current (\(R = V/I\)). Voltage is energy per unit charge (\(V = W/Q\)). Energy (Work, W) has dimensions \([ML^2T^{-2}]\). Charge (Q) is current times time (\([IT]\)).</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>\([W] = [ML^2T^{-2}]\)</li>
                                    <li>\([Q] = [IT]\)</li>
                                    <li>\([V] = \frac{[W]}{[Q]} = \frac{[ML^2T^{-2}]}{[IT]} = [ML^2T^{-3}I^{-1}]\)</li>
                                    <li>\([R] = \frac{[V]}{[I]} = \frac{[ML^2T^{-3}I^{-1}]}{[I]} = [ML^2T^{-3}I^{-2}]\)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Now substitute the dimensions of R, A (\([L^2]\)), and l (\([L]\)) into the expression for \(\rho\):</p>
                                \[ [\rho] = \frac{[R] [A]}{[l]} \]
                                \[ [\rho] = \frac{[ML^2T^{-3}I^{-2}] [L^2]}{[L]} \]
                                \[ [\rho] = [M L^{2+2-1} T^{-3} I^{-2}] \]
                                \[ [\rho] = [ML^3T^{-3}I^{-2}] \]
                                <p>The dimensions of resistivity in the LMTI system are \( [ML^3T^{-3}I^{-2}] \).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Two-Wattmeter Method for 3-Phase Power (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The two-wattmeter method is a technique used to measure the total power delivered to a 3-phase, 3-wire load (balanced or unbalanced) using two wattmeters. Each wattmeter's current coil is inserted in series with one line (e.g., line R and line B), and its voltage coil is connected between the same line and the third line (line Y).</p>
                                <pre>
    Line R o----[Current Coil W1]----+---- Load R-N
           |                         |
    Line Y o-------------------------+---- Load Y-N
           |                         |
    Line B o----[Current Coil W2]----+---- Load B-N
           |                         |
           +----[Voltage Coil W1]----+
           |                         |
           +----[Voltage Coil W2]----+  (Connected to Line Y)

                                </pre>
                                <figcaption>Figure 5: Two-Wattmeter Method Connection Diagram (ASCII Art)</figcaption>
                                <p>**Description:** Wattmeter W1 measures the power \(P_1 = V_{RY} I_R \cos(\text{angle between } V_{RY} \text{ and } I_R)\). Wattmeter W2 measures the power \(P_2 = V_{BY} I_B \cos(\text{angle between } V_{BY} \text{ and } I_B)\). It can be shown mathematically (see Q5b in July 2017 or Q1c in July 2019) that the sum of these two readings, \(P_1 + P_2\), equals the total active power consumed by the 3-phase load, regardless of whether the load is balanced or unbalanced.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Crankshaft Sensor Test Results (Figure 1) (5 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 1 shows a waveform that indicates the rotational position or speed of a crankshaft. The pulses correspond to teeth or features on a wheel attached to the crankshaft. The time between pulses or groups of pulses relates to speed. The voltage levels represent the signal amplitude.</p>
                                <p>From Figure 1:</p>
                                <p>**(i) peak-to-peak voltage:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The waveform goes from a negative peak to a positive peak.</li>
                                    <li>Approximate negative peak voltage \(\approx -1.5 \, V\).</li>
                                    <li>Approximate positive peak voltage \(\approx +1.5 \, V\).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Peak-to-peak voltage \( V_{p-p} = V_{positive\_peak} - V_{negative\_peak} = 1.5 \, V - (-1.5 \, V) = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3.0 \, V \).</p>

                                <p>**(ii) rotational speed of the crankshaft in revolutions per minute (rpm):**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The waveform shows a pattern of pulses. A crankshaft position sensor often uses a missing tooth or a unique pattern to indicate one full revolution. In Figure 1, there is a gap after a sequence of pulses. Counting the number of pulses between the gaps (or unique feature) gives the number of pulses per revolution. Let's assume the gap indicates one revolution.</p>
                                <p>Count the number of pulses between the start of one gap and the start of the next. It looks like there are 18 pulses followed by a gap, then another 18 pulses and a gap. Let's assume there are 18 pulses per revolution.</p>
                                <p>Determine the time for one revolution from the graph. The time for one revolution is the time taken for 18 pulses plus the gap. Let's measure the time duration of one full cycle (18 pulses + gap). From the graph, the time axis is in milliseconds (ms). One full cycle (from the start of one pulse train to the start of the next) appears to span from approximately 0 ms to 60 ms (or from the beginning of the first pulse to the beginning of the pulse after the gap). Let's use the start of the first pulse to the start of the pulse after the gap as the time for one revolution.</p>
                                <p>Time for one revolution \( T_{rev} \approx 60 \, ms = 60 \times 10^{-3} \, s \).</p>
                                <p>Rotational speed in revolutions per second \( f_{rev} = \frac{1}{T_{rev}} = \frac{1}{60 \times 10^{-3} \, s} = \frac{1000}{60} \, \text{rev/s} \approx 16.67 \, \text{rev/s} \).</p>
                                <p>Convert to revolutions per minute (rpm): \( \text{Speed (rpm)} = f_{rev} \times 60 \, \text{seconds/minute} \).</p>
                                \[ \text{Speed (rpm)} \approx 16.67 \, \text{rev/s} \times 60 \, \text{s/min} = 1000 \, \text{rpm} \]
                                <p class="key-point">Note: The exact number of pulses per revolution and the precise timing might require careful reading of the graph. Assuming 18 pulses + gap = 1 revolution and time for one revolution = 60ms based on visual estimation from the provided image scale.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">This question tests fundamental definitions, dimensional analysis, knowledge of 3-phase power measurement, and the ability to interpret waveforms from sensor outputs.</p>

                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-2">
                            <div class="answer-detail">
                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers soldering methods, corrective maintenance, ammeter-voltmeter resistance measurement errors, and Maxwell's bridge calculations.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Soldering (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Two materials used in soldering:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Solder:** A metal alloy (e.g., Tin-Lead, Tin-Copper, Tin-Silver-Copper) used as filler material to join metal surfaces.</li>
                                    <li>**Flux:** A chemical cleaning agent used to remove oxidation and prevent further oxidation during soldering. Rosin-based or water-soluble fluxes are common.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Distinguish between silver and braze soldering:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Silver Soldering (Hard Soldering):** Uses silver-based filler alloys that melt at temperatures above 450°C (typically 600-800°C) but below the melting point of the base metals. It creates stronger joints than soft soldering and is used for joining metals like copper alloys, steel, and silver. Requires higher temperature heat sources like torches.</li>
                                    <li>**Braze Soldering (Brazing):** Uses filler alloys (often copper alloys like brass or bronze, melting above 450°C) that melt at higher temperatures than soft solders but below the melting point of the base metals. Similar to silver soldering but typically uses different filler metals. It also creates strong joints and is used for joining various metals.</li>
                                    <li>**Soft Soldering (Standard Electronic Soldering):** Uses tin-lead or lead-free alloys that melt below 450°C (typically 180-250°C). This is the common method for joining electronic components and wires. Joints are not as strong as hard soldering or brazing but are sufficient for electrical connections.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="key-point">The question distinguishes "silver" and "braze" soldering. Silver soldering *is* a type of brazing, often called silver brazing. The distinction might refer to the specific filler alloy composition or a specific temperature range within the broader category of brazing.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Corrective Maintenance (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Describe corrective maintenance:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Corrective maintenance, also known as reactive maintenance or breakdown maintenance, is a maintenance strategy that involves repairing equipment *after* it has failed or broken down. The primary goal is to restore the equipment to its normal operating condition as quickly as possible. This strategy is typically unplanned and executed in response to an unexpected failure. It often involves diagnosing the fault, locating the faulty component, repairing or replacing the component, and testing the equipment to ensure it functions correctly.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) State two demerits of the maintenance in b(i):**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Unplanned Downtime:** Failures occur unexpectedly, leading to unpredictable and potentially costly interruptions to operations.</li>
                                    <li>**Increased Repair Costs:** Emergency repairs often cost more than planned repairs due to urgency, overtime labor, and potential secondary damage caused by the initial failure.</li>
                                    <li>**Reduced Equipment Lifespan:** Allowing equipment to operate until failure can lead to more severe damage and may shorten its overall lifespan compared to addressing issues proactively.</li>
                                    <li>**Safety Risks:** Equipment failures can sometimes create hazardous situations for personnel.</li>
                                    <li>**Less Efficient Resource Utilization:** Reactive maintenance can lead to inefficient scheduling of maintenance staff and difficulty in ensuring necessary parts are immediately available.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Ammeter-Voltmeter Resistance Measurement Error Analysis (Figure 2) (11 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 2 shows the voltmeter-across-R connection for measuring resistance using the ammeter-voltmeter method. The ammeter measures the total current entering the parallel combination of R and the voltmeter. The voltmeter measures the voltage across R (and also across the voltmeter). The accuracy of the measurement is affected by the internal resistances of the meters.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ammeter internal resistance \(R_A = 0.01 \, \Omega\).</li>
                                    <li>Voltmeter internal resistance \(R_V = 2000 \, \Omega\).</li>
                                    <li>Ammeter reading \(I_m = 2 \, A\).</li>
                                    <li>Voltmeter reading \(V_m = 180 \, V\).</li>
                                    <li>Measured resistance \(R_{measured} = 90 \, \Omega\) (Given directly).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(i) current through voltmeter (\(I_V\)):**</p>
                                <p>The voltmeter measures the voltage across R, which is \(V_m = 180 \, V\). The current through the voltmeter is determined by its internal resistance \(R_V\).</p>
                                \[ I_V = \frac{V_m}{R_V} = \frac{180 \, V}{2000 \, \Omega} = 0.09 \, A \]

                                <p>**(ii) current through resistor R:**</p>
                                <p>The ammeter measures the total current \(I_m = 2 \, A\). This current splits into the current through R (\(I_R\)) and the current through the voltmeter (\(I_V\)). \( I_m = I_R + I_V \).</p>
                                \[ I_R = I_m - I_V = 2 \, A - 0.09 \, A = 1.91 \, A \]

                                <p>**(iii) voltage across resistor R:**</p>
                                <p>The voltmeter is connected directly across R, so the voltage across R is the voltmeter reading \(V_m\).</p>
                                \[ V_R = V_m = 180 \, V \]
                                <p class="key-point">Note: While \(V_R\) is \(V_m\), we can calculate the true value of R from \(V_R\) and \(I_R\).</p>

                                <p>**(iv) percentage error in the measurement:**</p>
                                <p>The measured resistance is given as \(R_{measured} = 90 \, \Omega\). This matches the value calculated directly from meter readings (\( V_m / I_m = 180V / 2A = 90\Omega \)). This measured value is the apparent resistance.</p>
                                <p>The true value of R is calculated using the true voltage across R (\(V_R = V_m\)) and the true current through R (\(I_R\)).</p>
                                \[ R_{true} = \frac{V_R}{I_R} = \frac{180 \, V}{1.91 \, A} \approx 94.241 \, \Omega \]
                                <p>The percentage error in the measurement is the difference between the measured value and the true value, relative to the true value.</p>
                                \[ \% \text{Error} = \frac{R_{measured} - R_{true}}{R_{true}} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Error} = \frac{90 \, \Omega - 94.241 \, \Omega}{94.241 \, \Omega} \times 100\% = \frac{-4.241}{94.241} \times 100\% \approx -4.50 \% \]
                                <p>The measured resistance is 4.50% lower than the true value due to the voltmeter's loading effect.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Maxwell's Inductance-Capacitance Bridge (Figure 3) (5 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 3 shows Maxwell's bridge. At balance, \(R_1 = R_2 R_3 / R_4\) and \(L_1 = R_2 R_3 C_4\) (Derived in Q2a July 2021).</p>
                                <p>Given values from Figure 3:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>\(R_2 = 300 \, \Omega\)</li>
                                    <li>\(R_3 = 700 \, \Omega\)</li>
                                    <li>\(R_4 = 1500 \, \Omega\)</li>
                                    <li>\(C = 0.8 \, pF = 0.8 \times 10^{-12} \, F\) (labeled as C, but likely C4 in the formula context)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>**(i) resistance \(R_1\):**</p>
                                \[ R_1 = \frac{R_2 R_3}{R_4} = \frac{300 \, \Omega \times 700 \, \Omega}{1500 \, \Omega} = \frac{210000}{1500} \, \Omega = 140 \, \Omega \]

                                <p>**(ii) inductance L:**</p>
                                <p class="key-point">The question asks for inductance "L". The formula derives \(L_1\). Assuming "L" refers to \(L_1\).</p>
                                \[ L_1 = R_2 R_3 C_4 = 300 \, \Omega \times 700 \, \Omega \times (0.8 \times 10^{-12} \, F) \]
                                \[ L_1 = 210000 \times 0.8 \times 10^{-12} \, H = 168000 \times 10^{-12} \, H = 0.168 \times 10^{-6} \, H \]
                                \[ L_1 = 0.168 \, \mu H \]
                                <p class="key-point">Note: The unit for C4 is given as pF (picofarad), which is 10⁻¹² F. The value calculated for L1 (0.168 µH) is very small. If C4 was intended to be µF (10⁻⁶ F) as in other papers, L1 would be 0.168 H. Given the label "0.8 pF" in the OCR/image, the calculation is based on pF.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Reliability Definitions (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Availability:** The probability that an equipment is in an operable state at any given time when required for use. It is a measure of operational readiness and depends on both reliability (how often it fails) and maintainability (how quickly it can be repaired). Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR).</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Redundancy:** The inclusion of duplicate or alternative components, subsystems, or functions in a system that are not strictly necessary for normal operation but are available to perform the intended function if a primary component fails. This increases the overall system reliability because the system can continue to operate even if a single component fails, as long as a redundant path or component is available. Example: Having two power supplies in a system, where one can take over if the other fails.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) Reliability Bathtub Curve Description (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The reliability bathtub curve is a graphical representation of the failure rate of a population of components or equipment over its lifespan. It illustrates how the likelihood of failure changes with time.</p>

                                <p>**Description:** The curve is typically divided into three main periods:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Infant Mortality Period (Early Failures):** This occurs at the beginning of the equipment's life. The failure rate starts high and decreases rapidly over time. Failures are usually due to manufacturing defects, weak components ("early failures" or "bugs"). Reliability improves as these initial problems are corrected.</li>
                                    <li>**Useful Life Period (Random Failures):** Follows the infant mortality period. The failure rate is relatively constant and low. Failures in this phase are typically random events, often caused by unexpected stresses or environmental factors, rather than the age of the equipment itself. This period is the target for the design life of most equipment, where reliability is modeled using a constant failure rate (\(\lambda\)).</li>
                                    <li>**Wear-out Period:** Occurs towards the end of the equipment's life. The failure rate increases rapidly with time. Failures are caused by aging, wear and tear, fatigue, and material degradation. These failures are often predictable based on the age of the components.</li>

                                <p>**(i) Mean Time to Failure (MTTF):**</p>
                                <p>MTTF is the average time a non-repairable item operates before failure. It is calculated as total operating time divided by the number of failures.</p>
                                \[ MTTF = \frac{\text{Total Operating Time}}{\text{Number of Failures}} = \frac{5000 \text{ device-hours}}{2 \text{ failures}} = 2500 \text{ hours/failure} \]

                                <p>**(ii) Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF):**</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Assuming the devices are repairable and put back into test, or this test represents the average performance over the population, MTBF \(\approx\) MTTF. In many contexts, MTTF is used for non-repairable items and MTBF for repairable ones. Given only total failures over a period, MTTF is the appropriate term, but MTBF is often used interchangeably in this type of problem.</p>
                                \[ MTBF \approx 2500 \text{ hours/failure} \]

                                <p>**(iii) Failure rate (\(\lambda\)):**</p>
                                <p>Failure rate is the reciprocal of MTTF or MTBF (assuming constant failure rate).</p>
                                \[ \lambda = \frac{1}{MTTF} = \frac{\text{Number of Failures}}{\text{Total Operating Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ failures}}{5000 \text{ device-hours}} \]
                                \[ \lambda = 0.0004 \text{ failures/hour} \]
                                <p>Often expressed per 1000 hours: \( \lambda = 0.0004 \times 1000 = 0.4 \) failures per 1000 hours.</p>

                                <p>**(iv) Probability that a particular device will be operated at time equal to MTBF:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The probability of a device operating for a time \(t\) (its reliability \(R(t)\)) is given by \( R(t) = e^{-\lambda t} \), assuming a constant failure rate. We want to find \( R(t) \) when \( t = MTBF \). We know \( \lambda = 1/MTBF \).</p>
                                \[ R(MTBF) = e^{-\lambda \times MTBF} = e^{-(1/MTBF) \times MTBF} = e^{-1} \]
                                \[ R(MTBF) = e^{-1} \approx 0.36788 \]
                                <p>The probability that a device will be operating at time equal to MTBF is approximately 0.3679 or 36.79%. This means about 36.8% of devices are expected to survive up to the MTBF.</p>

                                    <li>**Input Signal:** The AC or pulse signal whose frequency is measured.</li>

                                    <li>**Time Base:** A stable crystal oscillator providing a precise time reference.</li>
                                    <li>**Flip-flop / Divider:** Generates the exact time interval (gate time) by dividing down the high frequency from the time base.</li>

                                    <li>**Decade Counters:** Count the number of pulses from the input signal that pass through the main gate while it is open.</li>

                                <p>The process starts with resetting the counters. The gate control unit opens the main gate for the gate time (e.g., 1 second). The shaper pulses from the input signal pass through the gate and are counted by the decade counters. After the gate time, the gate closes, stopping the count. The final count in the counters is transferred to the display. The displayed number represents the frequency in units corresponding to the gate time (e.g., counts per second = Hz). The counters are then reset for the next measurement.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Rectifier Instrument Measurement Error (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">A rectifier instrument with a moving coil meter responds to the average value of the rectified waveform. Its scale is calibrated to read the RMS value for a sine wave based on the relationship between average and RMS for a sine wave (\( V_{rms,sine} = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{2}} V_{peak,sine} \) and \( V_{avg,FWRsine} = \frac{2 V_{peak,sine}}{\pi} \), so \( V_{rms,sine} = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{\pi V_{avg,FWRsine}}{2} = \frac{\pi^2}{4\sqrt{2}} V_{avg,FWRsine} \approx 1.11 V_{avg,FWRsine} \). Or \(V_{avg,HWRsine} = V_{peak}/\pi \), so \(V_{rms,sine} = V_{avg,HWRsine} \times \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}} \)). For a full-wave rectifier, the average is \(2V_{peak}/\pi\). The meter reads the average value and the scale is marked \(1.11 \times V_{avg}\).</p>
                                <p>Let \(V_{avg,rectified}\) be the average value of the full-wave rectified waveform being measured. The instrument scale deflection is proportional to \(V_{avg,rectified}\). The scale is calibrated to read \(V_{rms,reading} = 1.11 \times V_{avg,rectified}\) (assuming full-wave rectification). The instrument indicates 2.22 V.</p>
                                <p>So, \( V_{rms,reading} = 2.22 \, V \). This implies the average value of the rectified triangular wave is \( V_{avg,rectified} = \frac{2.22 \, V}{1.11} = 2 \, V \).</p>
                                <p>Now consider a triangular waveform. Let the peak value be \(V_{peak,tri}\). The average value of a full-wave rectified triangular wave is the same as the average value of the original triangular wave, which is half the peak value.</p>
                                \[ V_{avg,rectified} = V_{avg,tri} = \frac{V_{peak,tri}}{2} \]
                                <p>We have \( V_{avg,rectified} = 2 \, V \).</p>
                                \[ 2 \, V = \frac{V_{peak,tri}}{2} \implies V_{peak,tri} = 4 \, V \]

                                <p>The RMS value of a triangular waveform is \( V_{rms,tri} = \frac{V_{peak,tri}}{\sqrt{3}} \).</p>

                                <p>**(i) average value of voltage:** This refers to the average value of the rectified triangular waveform, which the meter deflection is proportional to.
                                \( V_{avg,rectified} = 2 \, V \). (As determined from the reading and calibration factor).</p>

                                <p>**(ii) peak value of voltage:** This refers to the peak value of the original triangular waveform.
                                \( V_{peak,tri} = 4 \, V \). (As determined from the average value).</p>

                                <p>**(iii) r.m.s value of voltage:** This refers to the true RMS value of the original triangular waveform.
                                \[ V_{rms,tri} = \frac{V_{peak,tri}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4 \, V}{\sqrt{3}} \approx \frac{4}{1.732} \, V \approx 2.309 \, V \]
                                </p>

                                <p>**(iv) error in the reading:**</p>
                                <p>The instrument indicates \(V_{rms,reading} = 2.22 \, V\). The true RMS value of the triangular wave is \(V_{rms,tri} \approx 2.309 \, V\).
                                Error = Measured value - True value</p>
                                \[ \text{Error} = V_{rms,reading} - V_{rms,tri} \approx 2.22 \, V - 2.309 \, V = -0.089 \, V \]
                                <p>The reading error is approximately -0.089 V. The percentage error (relative to the true value) is \( \frac{-0.089}{2.309} \times 100\% \approx -3.85\% \).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Four merits of electrostatic instruments (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>Electrostatic instruments use the electrostatic force between charged plates and are primarily used for voltage measurements, especially high voltages.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Measure AC and DC voltages:** They respond to the instantaneous value of voltage, so they can be used for both AC and DC measurements. For AC, they measure the RMS value.</li>
                                    <li>**Very high input impedance:** They draw almost no current from the circuit being measured (only a small initial charging current and negligible leakage), thus they have minimal loading effect.</li>
                                    <li>**Suitable for high voltages:** They are well-suited for measuring very high voltages directly.</li>
                                    <li>**Frequency independent (within practical limits):** Their operation is based on electrostatic forces, not electromagnetic induction, making their readings largely independent of frequency.</li>
                                    <li>**Low power consumption:** Due to minimal current draw.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Average absolute error is the sum of the absolute errors divided by the number of measurements.</p>

                                <p>Relative error is the ratio of the absolute error (often the average absolute error or the maximum absolute error) to the mean value. Using the average absolute error:</p>
                                \[ \text{Relative Error} = \frac{\overline{\Delta T}}{\bar{T}} = \frac{0.0375 \, s}{2.005 \, s} \approx 0.01870 \]
                                <p>The percentage relative error is: \( 0.01870 \times 100\% = 1.87 \% \).</p>
                                <p>The relative error is approximately 0.0187, or 1.87%.</p>

Unlike a standard ballistic galvanometer, which measures charge from a transient current pulse, a flux meter's deflection is made directly proportional to the change in flux linkage, regardless of the speed of the flux change or the circuit resistance.</p>

                                <p>**Description of Operation:**</p>
                                <p>A flux meter is essentially a moving-coil instrument with two key modifications compared to a standard galvanometer:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>**Very Low (Ideally Zero) Controlling Torque:** The spring control is intentionally very weak or eliminated entirely. This allows the coil to rotate freely and remain at its deflected position after the flux change, unlike a standard galvanometer where the spring brings the pointer back to zero.</li>
                                    <li>**High Electrical Damping:** The resistance of the moving coil circuit (coil resistance plus external search coil resistance) is made very low. This results in very high electrical damping.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>When a change in magnetic flux linkage (\(\Delta\Psi = N\Delta\Phi\)) occurs in a search coil connected to the flux meter, an e.m.f. is induced. This induced e.m.f. drives a current through the low-resistance circuit. The interaction of this current with the magnetic field of the flux meter's permanent magnet produces a torque on the moving coil. Due to the absence of a significant controlling torque, this torque causes the coil to rotate. The high electrical damping ensures that the coil's movement is heavily damped, and it quickly settles at a new position. The total angular deflection (\(\theta\)) of the coil is directly proportional to the total change in flux linkage (\(\Delta\Psi\)), i.e., \(\theta \propto N\Delta\Phi\). The meter scale is calibrated to read the change in flux linkage directly. The low controlling torque ensures that the final deflection is independent of the speed at which the flux changes, making it ideal for measuring flux in magnetic circuits where flux changes may not be rapid.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Understanding measurement errors, statistical analysis of data, and the operation of specialized instruments like the flux meter are important skills in electrical measurements.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Vacuum Tube Valves (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Diode:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Description:** A vacuum tube diode is the simplest type of vacuum tube, consisting of two electrodes: a heated cathode and an anode (plate) sealed in a vacuum. The cathode emits electrons via thermionic emission when heated.</li>
                                    <li>**Operation:** When the anode is made positive relative to the cathode, it attracts the emitted electrons, and current flows through the vacuum from cathode to anode. When the anode is made negative relative to the cathode, it repels the electrons, and no current flows. Thus, a vacuum diode acts as a rectifier, allowing current flow in only one direction.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Triode:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Description:** A vacuum tube triode has three electrodes: a heated cathode, an anode, and an additional electrode called the control grid placed between the cathode and the anode. The grid is typically made of fine wire mesh.</li>
                                    <li>**Operation:** Electrons emitted by the cathode travel towards the anode (if the anode is positive). The control grid, being placed in the path of the electron flow, can control the number of electrons reaching the anode. By applying a small negative voltage to the grid relative to the cathode, the grid repels electrons and reduces the anode current. A more negative grid voltage reduces the anode current further, potentially cutting it off completely. A less negative (or slightly positive) grid voltage increases the anode current. Thus, a small voltage change on the grid can cause a large change in anode current and, consequently, a large voltage change across a load resistor in the anode circuit, enabling voltage amplification.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Forward Bias Region:** In the forward direction (anode positive relative to cathode), the Zener diode behaves like a normal p-n junction diode. Current starts flowing significantly when the forward voltage exceeds the knee voltage (\(V_K\), typically around 0.7V for silicon).</li>
                                    <li>**Reverse Bias Region:** In the reverse direction (anode negative relative to cathode), a very small reverse saturation current (\(I_S\)) flows initially. As the reverse voltage increases, this current remains low until the voltage reaches the Zener breakdown voltage (\(V_Z\)).</li>
                                    <li>**Reverse Breakdown Region:** When the reverse voltage reaches \(V_Z\), the diode enters the breakdown region. The voltage across the Zener diode remains remarkably constant at \(V_Z\) despite a significant increase in the reverse current. This constant voltage characteristic in the reverse breakdown region makes the Zener diode suitable for voltage regulation. The current in this region must be limited by external circuitry (like a series resistor) to prevent the diode from being destroyed by excessive power dissipation.</li>

                                <p><strong>(c) Transistor Circuit DC Bias Calculation (Figure 4) (9 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 4 shows an NPN BJT amplifier circuit with fixed bias (or base bias). The base is biased through resistor \(R_B\) from \(V_{CC}\). The emitter is connected directly to ground (\(R_E = 0\)). We need to determine the DC bias voltages and currents, assuming \(V_{BE} = 0.7 \, \mathrm{V}\).</p>
                                <p>From Figure 4: \(V_{CC} = 10 \, \mathrm{V}\), \(R_B = 470 \, k\Omega\), \(R_C = 2 \, k\Omega\), \(R_E = 1 \, k\Omega\). Note: The diagram shows \(R_E = 1k\Omega\), but it is in series with the emitter to ground. In a *fixed bias* circuit, \(R_E\) is typically 0. The diagram appears to be a combination of fixed bias (bias resistor from \(V_{CC}\)) and emitter bias (resistor \(R_E\) to ground). This is sometimes called emitter feedback bias if the base resistor is connected to the collector, but here it's connected to \(V_{CC}\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's analyze the circuit as drawn, which includes \(R_B\) from \(V_{CC}\) to base, \(R_C\) from \(V_{CC}\) to collector, and \(R_E\) from emitter to ground. This is a combined fixed bias and emitter bias.</p>
                                <p>We have the condition \(V_{BE} = 0.7 \, V\).</p>
                                <p>Voltage loop from \(V_{CC}\) through \(R_B\) to Base, across B-E junction, through \(R_E\) to Ground:</p>
                                \[ V_{CC} = I_B R_B + V_{BE} + I_E R_E \]
                                <p>We know \(I_E = I_B + I_C\), and \(I_C = \beta I_B\), so \(I_E = I_B + \beta I_B = I_B (1+\beta)\). Substitute \(I_E\) in the loop equation:</p>
                                \[ V_{CC} = I_B R_B + V_{BE} + I_B (1+\beta) R_E \]
                                \[ V_{CC} - V_{BE} = I_B [R_B + (1+\beta) R_E] \]
                                \[ I_B = \frac{V_{CC} - V_{BE}}{R_B + (1+\beta) R_E} \]
                                <p>We need \(\beta\) to calculate \(I_B\). \(\beta\) is not given. The problem states "Taking \(Vbe=0.7V\) and \(I_C = I_E\)". If \(I_C = I_E\), then \(I_B = I_E - I_C = 0\). This implies \(\beta = I_C/I_B\) is infinite, which is impossible. The condition \(I_C = I_E\) is usually an approximation that \(I_B\) is negligible compared to \(I_C\) and \(I_E\), meaning \(\alpha = I_C/I_E \approx 1\), or \(\beta\) is very large. Given the order of questions, it is more likely that we are expected to calculate \(V_B, V_E, I_E\), then \(I_B\), \(V_C, V_{CE}\) using the circuit components and \(V_{BE}=0.7V\), and perhaps the approximation \(I_C \simeq I_E\) is intended for simplicity in calculating voltage drops, *or* it's a constraint given to help solve, meaning \(\alpha=1\) exactly, which is unphysical but possible in a simplified problem.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the intent of "Taking \(Vbe=0.7V\) and \(I_C = I_E\)" is that we use \(V_{BE}=0.7V\) and \(I_C = I_E\) as exact conditions for the Q-point. \(I_C = I_E\) implies \(I_B = I_E - I_C = 0\). If \(I_B = 0\), then from the base-emitter loop equation \(V_{CC} = I_B R_B + V_{BE} + I_E R_E\), we get \(V_{CC} = 0 \times R_B + V_{BE} + I_E R_E \implies V_{CC} = V_{BE} + I_E R_E\).</p>
                                \[ I_E = \frac{V_{CC} - V_{BE}}{R_E} \]
                                <p>Using \(V_{CC}=10V\), \(V_{BE}=0.7V\), \(R_E=1k\Omega\):</p>
                                \[ I_E = \frac{10 \, V - 0.7 \, V}{1 \, k\Omega} = \frac{9.3 \, V}{1000 \, \Omega} = 0.0093 \, A = 9.3 \, mA \]
                                <p>If \(I_C = I_E\), then \(I_C = 9.3 \, mA\) and \(I_B = 0\). Let's calculate the voltages based on this.</p>

                                <p>**(i) \(V_{B}\) (Base voltage):**</p>
                                <p>With \(I_B = 0\), there is no voltage drop across \(R_B\). So \(V_B\) would be equal to \(V_{CC}\) if \(R_B\) connects directly to \(V_{CC}\) and base, which it does. However, this contradicts \(V_B = V_{BE} + I_E R_E\) unless \(R_E\) is connected directly to ground (which it is in the diagram, R_E=1k to ground). Let's assume the loop equation \(V_{CC} = I_B R_B + V_{BE} + I_E R_E\) is correct. If \(I_B=0\) and \(I_E=9.3mA\), \(10V = 0 \times 470k + 0.7V + 9.3mA \times 1k\Omega = 0.7V + 9.3V = 10V\). This is consistent.</p>
                                <p>So, with \(I_B=0\), \(V_B\) can be found from \(V_B = V_{BE} + V_E = V_{BE} + I_E R_E\).</p>
                                \[ V_B = 0.7 \, V + 9.3 \, mA \times 1 \, k\Omega = 0.7 \, V + 9.3 \, V = 10 \, V \]
                                <p>The base voltage \(V_B\) is 10 V. (This means the base is at \(V_{CC}\), which happens if \(I_B=0\)).</p>

                                <p>**(ii) \(V_{E}\) (Emitter voltage):**</p>
                                \[ V_E = I_E R_E = 9.3 \, mA \times 1 \, k\Omega = 9.3 \, V \]
                                <p>The emitter voltage \(V_E\) is 9.3 V.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) \(I_{E}\) (Emitter current):**</p>
                                <p>Calculated from the loop: \( I_E = 9.3 \, mA \).</p>

                                <p>**(iv) \(I_{B}\) (Base current):**</p>
                                <p>Given \(I_C = I_E\). Since \(I_E = I_B + I_C\), \(I_E = I_B + I_E\), which implies \(I_B = 0\).
                                Check this with the base loop \(V_{CC} = I_B R_B + V_B\). \(10V = 0 \times 470k + 10V\). This is consistent.</p>
                                <p>The base current \(I_B\) is 0 A.</p>

                                <p>**(v) \(V_{C}\) (Collector voltage):**</p>
                                <p>The collector voltage \(V_C\) is \(V_{CC}\) minus the voltage drop across \(R_C\).</p>
                                \[ V_C = V_{CC} - I_C R_C \]
                                <p>Using \(I_C = I_E = 9.3 \, mA\) as given:</p>
                                \[ V_C = 10 \, V - (9.3 \, mA) \times (2 \, k\Omega) = 10 \, V - (9.3 \times 10^{-3} \, A) \times (2 \times 10^3 \, \Omega) \]
                                \[ V_C = 10 \, V - 18.6 \, V = -8.6 \, V \]
                                <p>The collector voltage \(V_C\) is -8.6 V.</p>

                                <p>**(vi) \(V_{CE}\) (Collector-to-emitter voltage):**</p>
                                \[ V_{CE} = V_C - V_E = -8.6 \, V - 9.3 \, V = -17.9 \, V \]
                                <p>The collector-to-emitter voltage \(V_{CE}\) is -17.9 V.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Note: \(V_{CE} = -17.9V\) and \(V_{BE} = 0.7V\). For an NPN transistor to be in the active region, \(V_{CE}\) must be positive and greater than \(V_{BE}\), and the EBJ must be forward biased (\(V_{BE} \approx 0.7V\)). Here, \(V_{BE}=0.7V\) suggests forward bias of EBJ, but \(V_{CE}\) is negative, and \(V_C < V_E\). This indicates the transistor is in the saturation region, which contradicts using \(I_C = \beta I_B\) (implicitly assumed when deriving the loop equation) or \(I_C = I_E\). The condition \(I_C = I_E\) exactly forcing \(I_B=0\) is highly unusual for a bias calculation problem and likely leads to an unphysical operating point unless \(R_B\) is infinite or not present.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Assuming the problem intended the transistor to be in the active region with a typical \(\beta\) (e.g. 100) and the approximation \(I_C \simeq I_E\) is a guide, the calculations would be different (as shown in Q8c July 2021). However, strictly following "Taking \(Vbe=0.7V\) and \(I_C = I_E\)", the calculated values are \(V_B = 10V, V_E = 9.3V, I_E = 9.3mA, I_B = 0A, V_C = -8.6V, V_{CE} = -17.9V\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Given the explicit instruction "Taking \(Vbe=0.7V\) and \(I_C = I_E\)", these are the results obtained, despite leading to a seemingly incorrect operating region.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">This question involves performing DC bias analysis for a BJT amplifier circuit, but the specified conditions lead to unusual calculated values, possibly indicating a non-standard problem formulation or a typo.</p>
