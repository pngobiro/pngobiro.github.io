\section*{SECTION A: ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS}

\section*{Answer any THREE questions from this section.}
1. (a) (i) Describe the following standards with respect to measurements:
(I) secondary;
(II) working.
(ii) A standard cell has a voltage rating of 1.018500 V and internal resistance of $500 \Omega$. If the insulation resistance between its terminals is $5 \mathrm{M} \Omega$, determine the:
(I) current drain due to insulation resistance;
(II) difference between the rated voltage and the drop due to internal resistance.
(b) Derive the dimensional equation of "work done" in MLT system of units.
(c) A voltmeter having a sensitivity of $1,000 \Omega / \mathrm{V}$ reads 100 V on its 150 V scale when connected across an unknown resistor in series with a milliammeter. Neglecting the milliammeter resistance, determine the percentage error due to the loading effect of the voltmeter when the milliammeter reads 5 mA .
2. (a) (i) State one source of error in wattmeters when used in measurements.
(ii) With the aid of a labelled block diagram, describe the heterodyne method of frequency measurement.
(b) A solenoid, 1.2 m long, is uniformly wound with 800 turns. A search coil of mean diameter 30 mm , wound with 50 turns, is placed at the centre of the solenoid and connected to a ballistic galvanometer. The total resistance of the search-coil circuit is $2000 \Omega$. When a current of 5 A through the solenoid is reversed, the deflection on the galvanometer scale is 85 divisions.
Taking $\mu_{0}=4 \pi \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{H} / \mathrm{m}$, determine the ballistic constant of the galvanometer in coulombs/unit deflection.
3. (a) (i) Define reliability with respect to engineering systems.
(ii) Sketch, on the same axis, the curves showing the manufacturing cost against reliability and explain the shape of each curve.
(b) Outline the procedure of assessing the reliability of an equipment.
(c) In a test of 400 diodes, 5 failed over a 1,000 hour period. For the diodes, determine the:
(i) failure rate;
(ii) mean time to fail.
4. (a) (i) State any two possible causes of open circuit fault in carbon composition resistors.
(ii) Figure 1 shows a schematic block diagram of a d.c motor speed control system. Explain the effect of an open circuit fault in the feedback line and how it can be verified.
