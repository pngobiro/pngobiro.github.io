                                <p><strong>(a) Feedback Signals and DC Motor Speed Control (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Distinction between modifying and sustaining feedback signals:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Modifying feedback signals:** These are signals from a measurement or sensor that represent the actual output or condition of the system and are fed back to be compared with the desired input or reference. The comparison generates an error signal that is used to *modify* the system's input or parameters to reduce the error. These are characteristic of negative feedback systems used for control and regulation (e.g., speed feedback in a motor control system, voltage feedback in a power supply).</li>
                                    <li>**Sustaining feedback signals:** These are signals that are fed back in such a way as to *sustain* or reinforce the existing condition or oscillation in the system. These are characteristic of positive feedback systems, often used in oscillators or regenerative circuits, where a portion of the output is fed back in phase with the input to sustain oscillation.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Effect and location procedure for open circuit fault in feedback line (Figure 1):**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 1 shows a closed-loop DC motor speed control system where the tachogenerator provides negative feedback proportional to motor speed.</p>
                                <p>**(I) Effect of an open circuit fault in the feedback line:** If the feedback line is open, the comparator receives no actual speed feedback signal (or it receives a constant signal like 0V if pulled to ground or a reference). The comparator then perceives a large error equal to the difference between the input speed reference (desired speed) and the perceived feedback (e.g., 0V). This large error signal is amplified by the controller and power amplifier, causing the motor to accelerate to its maximum speed (limited by the supply voltage and motor characteristics) regardless of the desired speed setting. The control loop is broken, and the system is no longer regulated.</p>
                                <p>**(II) Procedure of locating the fault and expected results:**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>**Observation:** Observe the motor behavior. If it runs at maximum speed uncontrollably when power is on, it strongly suggests a feedback issue.</li>
                                    <li>**Check Input Reference:** Verify the input speed reference signal is present and can be varied (e.g., measure voltage at the input reference terminal).</li>
                                    <li>**Check Tachogenerator Output:** Measure the output voltage of the tachogenerator (usually at the tachogenerator terminals) while the motor is running. This voltage should be proportional to the motor's speed.</li>
                                    <li>**Check Feedback Line Continuity:** With power OFF, disconnect the feedback wire at both ends (at the tachogenerator and the comparator input). Measure the resistance of the feedback wire using a multimeter. An open circuit will show a very high or infinite resistance (OL).</li>
                                    <li>**Check Comparator Input:** If the wire shows continuity, check the voltage at the comparator input terminal where the feedback line connects, while the system is powered and running. If the tachogenerator output is present but this point shows 0V (or unexpected level), the open circuit is in the wiring or connection between the tachogenerator output and the comparator input.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>**Expected Results:** If the feedback line is open, the multimeter continuity check will show infinite resistance. When the system is powered, the tachogenerator might show a voltage proportional to speed at its terminals, but the voltage at the comparator input terminal connected to the feedback line will be disconnected and likely floating or pulled to a different potential, not showing the speed-proportional feedback.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Circuit Diagram Elements for Repair (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>A circuit diagram (schematic) is a crucial tool for repair and maintenance. Four elements it contains that assist this are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Component Identifiers and Values:** Labels for each component (e.g., R1, C2, Q5, IC1) and their nominal values (e.g., \(10k\Omega\), \(47\mu F\), LM741, 2N2222) make it easy to identify and find components on the physical board and determine replacement parts.</li>
                                    <li>**Component Interconnections:** Lines representing wires or PCB traces show how components are electrically connected, allowing signal paths and power distribution to be traced.</li>
                                    <li>**Test Points and Expected Voltages/Waveforms:** Specific points in the circuit may be labeled as test points (TP) with indicated DC voltages or expected AC waveforms/amplitudes in a working circuit. These provide diagnostic checkpoints.</li>
                                    <li>**Functional Blocks/Stages:** Complex circuits are often broken down into logical functional blocks (e.g., Power Supply, Oscillator, Amplifier Stage, Filter). The diagram shows how these blocks connect, aiding in isolating the faulty section.</li>
                                    <li>**Power Supply Connections:** Indications of voltage rails (e.g., +VCC, -VEE, GND) and how they connect to components.</li>
                                    <li>**Pin Numbers for ICs and Transistors:** Pinout information for multi-pin components.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Reliability/Maintainability Calculations (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Given the repair rate and mean time between failure for an equipment. We can calculate other maintainability and availability metrics.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Repair rate (\(\mu\)) = 0.6</li>
                                    <li>Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) = 15,000 hours.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Assuming the repair rate unit is repairs per hour, then MTTR = \(1/\mu\).</p>

                                <p>**(i) failure rate:**</p>
                                <p>The failure rate (\(\lambda\)) is the reciprocal of the MTBF, assuming a constant failure rate (useful life period).</p>
                                \[ \lambda = \frac{1}{MTBF} = \frac{1}{15000 \, \text{hours}} \approx 6.667 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{failures/hour} \]

                                <p>**(ii) mean time to repair:**</p>
                                <p>The Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) is the reciprocal of the repair rate (\(\mu\)).</p>
                                \[ MTTR = \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{0.6 \, \text{repairs/unit time}} \approx 1.667 \, \text{unit time/repair} \]
                                <p class="key-point">The unit of time for the repair rate (0.6) is not specified. Assuming it's repairs per hour, then MTTR is in hours.</p>
                                <p>Assuming repair rate is 0.6 repairs/hour, MTTR \(\approx 1.667\) hours.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) unavailability:**</p>
                                <p>Unavailability (\(U\)) is the long-term probability that the equipment is NOT operational. \( U = \frac{MTTR}{MTBF + MTTR} \).</p>
                                \[ U = \frac{1.667 \, \text{hours}}{15000 \, \text{hours} + 1.667 \, \text{hours}} = \frac{1.667}{15001.667} \approx 0.0001111 \]

                                <p>**(iv) availability:**</p>
                                <p>Availability (\(A\)) is the long-term probability that the equipment is operational. \( A = 1 - U \) or \( A = \frac{MTBF}{MTBF + MTTR} \).</p>
                                \[ A = 1 - 0.0001111 = 0.9998889 \]
                                <p>or</p>
                                \[ A = \frac{15000}{15000 + 1.667} \approx 0.9998889 \]

                                    <li>**Pressure coil inductance:** The voltage coil (pressure coil) is assumed to be purely resistive, but it has some inductance. This causes a small phase shift between the voltage applied to the pressure coil and the current through it, leading to errors, especially at low power factors or high frequencies.</li>
                                    <li>**Power consumption of the coils:** Both the current coil and the pressure coil consume a small amount of power. This power is added to the power being measured, introducing an error. The error depends on how the pressure coil is connected (on the supply side or load side).</li>
                                    <li>**Eddy currents:** Alternating magnetic fields induce eddy currents in metal parts of the wattmeter, creating opposing magnetic fields and affecting the deflecting torque. This error is frequency-dependent.</li>
                                    <li>**Stray magnetic fields:** External magnetic fields can interact with the fields produced by the wattmeter coils, creating an erroneous torque.</li>
                                    <li>**Friction:** Friction in the bearings of the moving system introduces a retarding torque, affecting accuracy, especially at low power levels.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Amplitude Modulated (AM) Signal (8 marks):</strong></p>

                                <p>Substituting these into the definition of \(m\):</p>

                                    <li>**(i) Production Cost:** The cost of manufacturing the equipment. This increases as reliability increases because higher reliability requires better quality components, more stringent manufacturing processes, and tighter quality control, which are more expensive. The curve slopes upward and is typically convex (cost increases more rapidly at higher reliability).</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Design and Development Cost:** The cost incurred during the design and engineering phases. This also increases with target reliability as more effort is needed for analysis, testing, simulation, and selecting reliable architectures (e.g., redundancy). The curve slopes upward and is typically convex.</li>
                                    <li>**(iii) Maintenance and Repair Cost:** The costs associated with failures, including diagnosis, parts, labor, downtime, and lost productivity. As reliability increases (fewer failures), these costs decrease significantly. The curve slopes downward and is typically concave (cost decreases less rapidly at higher reliability).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The sum of these costs (Production + Design + Maintenance/Repair) results in a total cost curve that is typically U-shaped. The minimum point of the total cost curve indicates the economically optimal level of reliability.</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Explain preventive maintenance:**</p>
                                <p>Preventive maintenance is a proactive maintenance strategy where maintenance tasks are performed at predetermined intervals or according to specified criteria (e.g., time-based, usage-based) while the equipment is still operating, in order to reduce the likelihood of failure or degradation of performance. Its goal is to prevent breakdowns by addressing potential issues before they cause significant problems. Examples include scheduled inspections, lubrication, cleaning, and component replacements based on expected lifespan (e.g., replacing filters, belts, or capacitors after a certain operating time).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Effects of Faults in Regulated DC Power Supply (Figure 2) (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Figure 2 shows a typical linear regulated DC power supply consisting of a transformer, rectifier, filter capacitor (C1), IC regulator, and output capacitor (C2).</p>
                                <p>**(i) Diode D1 open circuit:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>D1 is one of the diodes in the bridge rectifier. If D1 opens, the bridge rectifier will effectively become a half-wave rectifier circuit (using D2 and D3, or D4 depending on connection).</li>
                                    <li>**Effect:** The output of the bridge will be pulsating DC from only half of the AC cycle. The ripple frequency will be the same as the input frequency (e.g., 50 Hz or 60 Hz) instead of double (e.g., 100 Hz or 120 Hz). The average voltage after the rectifier will be lower.</li>
                                    <li>**Symptom:** The voltage across C1 will have a much larger ripple amplitude and a lower average value. The IC regulator might fail to maintain a stable output voltage if its input voltage drops too low during parts of the cycle, resulting in a regulated output with significant ripple or a lower average value.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Capacitor C1 short circuit:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>C1 is the main filter capacitor after the rectifier. If it shorts out, it creates a very low resistance path across the output of the rectifier.</li>
                                    <li>**Effect:** This will essentially short-circuit the rectifier's output terminals. A large current will flow from the transformer secondary through the rectifier diodes and C1. This large current will likely blow a fuse (if present) or damage the transformer secondary winding and/or the rectifier diodes. The IC regulator will receive no voltage or a very low/shorted voltage at its input.</li>
                                    <li>**Symptom:** No output voltage from the entire power supply. Blown fuse, possible smell of burning, rectifier diodes or transformer may be hot or damaged.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(iii) Terminal 3 of the IC regulator open to ground:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Terminal 3 is typically the "Ground" or "Adjust" terminal of a 3-terminal regulator IC (like a 78xx or LM317). It provides the reference for the output voltage. For fixed regulators (like 78xx), it's directly connected to ground. For adjustable regulators (like LM317), it's connected to ground via a resistor.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Effect (Assuming 78xx type where terminal 3 is Ground):** If the ground connection is open, the regulator loses its reference. The internal feedback loop requires this terminal to be at ground potential relative to the output voltage regulation. Without a stable ground reference, the regulator cannot function correctly.</li>
                                    <li>**Symptom:** The output voltage will likely be unregulated and much higher than the rated voltage, potentially rising close to the input voltage (\(V_{in}\) to the IC). This can damage the connected load. Or, the regulator might simply shut down or produce unstable output depending on the IC design.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(iv) Capacitor C2 open circuit:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>C2 is the output filter capacitor after the IC regulator. Its function is to smooth out any remaining high-frequency ripple or transient voltages from the regulator output and improve load transient response.</li>
                                    <li>**Effect:** If C2 is open, the filtering of high-frequency components at the output is reduced or eliminated. The regulator's transient response to sudden changes in load current might also be degraded.</li>
                                    <li>**Symptom:** The output DC voltage may appear stable for steady loads, but closer inspection with an oscilloscope will reveal more high-frequency noise or ripple, and potentially larger voltage dips or overshoots when the load current changes rapidly. The DC voltage level should remain correct.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(d) Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) Calculation (3 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The repair rate (\(\mu\)) is the number of repairs completed per unit of time. It is the reciprocal of the Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).</p>
                                <p>Given: Repair rate \( \mu = 0.5 \).</p>
                                \[ MTTR = \frac{1}{\mu} \]
                                \[ MTTR = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \, \text{time units} \]
                                <p>Since the unit for the repair rate (0.5) is not specified (e.g., repairs/hour, repairs/day), the unit for MTTR will be the reciprocal of that unit. Assuming the repair rate is in repairs/hour, then MTTR is in hours.</p>
                                <p>Assuming repair rate is 0.5 repairs/hour, the MTTR is 2 hours. (Same as Q4d July 2021)</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Effective maintenance requires understanding common faults, their causes, and their effects on circuit or system operation, as well as quantifying maintainability using metrics like repair rate and MTTR.</p>

                                <p>**Description:** Silicon is a group IV element with 4 valence electrons. A trivalent impurity atom (group III element) has only 3 valence electrons. When a trivalent atom substitutes a silicon atom in the crystal lattice, it forms covalent bonds with three neighboring silicon atoms. The bond with the fourth silicon atom is incomplete, as the trivalent atom can only share 3 electrons, while the silicon atom has 4 electrons to share. This deficiency of an electron in the covalent bond creates a "hole". These holes are free to move throughout the crystal lattice, acting as positive charge carriers. The trivalent impurity atoms, having accepted an electron to complete three bonds, become fixed negative ions in the lattice. In a p-type semiconductor, holes are the majority carriers, and electrons are the minority carriers.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Rutherford's atomic structure (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Ernest Rutherford proposed a model of the atom based on the results of his gold foil scattering experiment (Geiger-Marsden experiment).</p>
                                <p>**Explanation:** Rutherford's model, sometimes called the nuclear model, described the atom as having:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A very small, dense, positively charged **nucleus** located at the center of the atom. This nucleus contains most of the atom's mass (attributed to protons and neutrons, although neutrons were discovered later).</li>
                                    <li>Negatively charged **electrons** orbiting around the nucleus in definite paths, much like planets orbiting the sun.</li>
                                    <li>The atom is mostly **empty space**, as evidenced by the fact that most alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil without deflection.</li>
                                    <li>The total positive charge of the nucleus is equal to the total negative charge of the orbiting electrons, making the atom electrically neutral.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This model replaced the earlier plum-pudding model but had limitations, particularly in explaining why orbiting electrons (which are accelerating charges) did not lose energy and spiral into the nucleus according to classical physics.</p>

                                <p>**(i) Three parameters for semiconductor diode specifications:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Maximum Forward Current (\(I_F\)):** The maximum average current the diode can safely handle in the forward-biased direction without overheating or damage.</li>

                                    <li>**Maximum Power Dissipation (\(P_D\)):** The maximum power the diode can dissipate safely, usually a product of forward voltage and current, or reverse voltage and leakage current (in breakdown, \(P_D = V_Z \times I_Z\)).</li>
                                    <li>**Reverse Saturation Current (\(I_S\) or \(I_R\)):** The small leakage current in the reverse-biased direction (specified at a certain reverse voltage).</li>

                                <p>**Description:** The circuit consists of a series resistor \(R_S\) connected between the unregulated input voltage \(V_{in}\) and the Zener diode, which is connected in parallel (shunt) with the load \(R_L\). The Zener diode is connected in reverse bias. \(R_S\) limits the current flowing into the Zener and the load. When the input voltage \(V_{in}\) is greater than the Zener breakdown voltage \(V_Z\), the Zener diode enters the breakdown region and maintains a nearly constant voltage \(V_Z\) across its terminals and, therefore, across the parallel load \(R_L\). If \(V_{in}\) increases, the current through \(R_S\) increases; the Zener current \(I_Z\) increases while \(V_L\) remains nearly constant. If the load current \(I_L\) decreases (due to increasing \(R_L\)), \(I_Z\) increases to keep \(I_S\) constant (\(I_S = I_Z + I_L\)), maintaining \(V_L\) constant. Regulation is maintained as long as the Zener stays in breakdown (\(I_Z \ge I_{Z,min}\)) and its maximum current rating is not exceeded (\(I_Z \le I_{Z,max}\)). (Same as Q8c(ii) Nov 2018)</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) DC Power Supply Performance Metrics (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Given information about a DC power supply's output voltage under different load conditions and its ripple.</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>No load output voltage (\(V_{NL}\)) = 60 V</li>
                                    <li>Full load output voltage (\(V_{FL}\)) = 56 V</li>
                                    <li>Ripple component RMS voltage (\(V_{ripple,rms}\)) = 1.25 V rms</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(i) Percentage voltage regulation:**</p>
                                <p>Voltage regulation is a measure of how well a power supply maintains a constant output voltage as the load changes. It is usually expressed as the percentage change in output voltage from no load to full load, relative to the full load voltage.</p>
                                \[ \% \text{Voltage Regulation} = \frac{V_{NL} - V_{FL}}{V_{FL}} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Voltage Regulation} = \frac{60 \, V - 56 \, V}{56 \, V} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Voltage Regulation} = \frac{4 \, V}{56 \, V} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{14} \times 100\% \approx 7.143 \% \]

                                <p>**(ii) Percentage ripple:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Percentage ripple is a measure of the amount of AC voltage superimposed on the DC output voltage. It's typically the ratio of the RMS ripple voltage to the DC output voltage, expressed as a percentage.</p>
                                <p>The DC output voltage can be taken as the full load voltage \(V_{FL}\) if the ripple is measured at full load, or the average DC voltage. Assuming the ripple is measured at full load, the DC output voltage reference is \(V_{FL}\).</p>
                                \[ \% \text{Ripple} = \frac{V_{ripple,rms}}{V_{dc}} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Ripple} = \frac{1.25 \, V_{rms}}{56 \, V} \times 100\% \]
                                \[ \% \text{Ripple} \approx 0.02232 \times 100\% \approx 2.232 \% \]

                                    <li>Accelerating potential \(V_a = 2 \, kV = 2000 \, V\).</li>
                                    <li>Time taken for acceleration = \(0.25 \, \mu S = 0.25 \times 10^{-6} \, s\). (Note: Time for acceleration is usually very short, this value might be for transit through some region, but the question states "accelerated ... in a time of").</li>
                                    <li>Mass of electron \(m = 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, kg\).</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>Assume the electron starts with negligible initial velocity from the cathode.</p>
                                <p>**(i) Velocity of the electron:**</p>
                                <p>The velocity (\(v\)) after acceleration by \(V_a\) is found from the kinetic energy gained (\( \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \)) equaling the potential energy lost (\(e V_a\)).</p>
                                \[ \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = e V_a \]
                                \[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2 e V_a}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C) \times (2000 \, V)}{9.1 \times 10^{-31} \, kg}} \]
                                \[ v = \sqrt{\frac{6.4 \times 10^{-16}}{9.1 \times 10^{-31}}} = \sqrt{0.70329 \times 10^{15}} = \sqrt{7.0329 \times 10^{14}} \]
                                \[ v \approx 2.652 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m/s} \]

                                <p>**(ii) Acceleration of the electron:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Acceleration (\(a\)) is the change in velocity divided by the time taken. Assuming linear acceleration over the given time.</p>
                                \[ a = \frac{\text{Final Velocity} - \text{Initial Velocity}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{v - 0}{t_{accel}} \]
                                \[ a = \frac{2.652 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m/s}}{0.25 \times 10^{-6} \, s} \]
                                \[ a = \frac{2.652}{0.25} \times 10^{7 - (-6)} \, \mathrm{m/s}^2 = 10.608 \times 10^{13} \, \mathrm{m/s}^2 \]
                                \[ a \approx 1.061 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{m/s}^2 \]
                                <p class="key-point">Note: This assumes the 0.25 µS is the actual time taken to accelerate from rest to the final velocity, which occurs within the electron gun region. This might be an oversimplification depending on the specific electron gun design.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) Loss in potential energy:**</p>
                                <p>The loss in potential energy is equal to the charge multiplied by the potential difference it falls through.</p>
                                \[ \text{Loss in PE} = e V_a = (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C) \times (2000 \, V) = 3.2 \times 10^{-16} \, J \]

                                <p>**(iv) Gain in kinetic energy:**</p>
                                <p>According to the work-energy theorem, the gain in kinetic energy is equal to the work done by the electric field, which is equal to the loss in potential energy (assuming no other forces like friction are doing work). Starting from rest (initial KE = 0), the gain in KE is equal to the final KE.</p>
                                \[ \text{Gain in KE} = \text{Final KE} - \text{Initial KE} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 - 0 \]
                                \[ \text{Gain in KE} = 3.2 \times 10^{-16} \, J \]
                                <p>The gain in kinetic energy is \(3.2 \times 10^{-16} \, J\).</p>

                                    <li>**Sensitivity to Electrostatic Discharge (ESD):** Especially MOSFETs, the thin gate oxide is easily damaged by static electricity, requiring careful handling. While BJTs can also be damaged by ESD, MOSFETs are generally more sensitive.</li>
                                    <li>**Lower Transconductance:** FETs typically have lower transconductance (\(g_m = \Delta I_D / \Delta V_{GS}\)) compared to the transconductance (\(g_m = \Delta I_C / \Delta V_{BE}\) or \(g_m = I_C/V_T\)) of BJTs for the same operating current.

                                    <li>**Limited Current Driving Capability:** Power BJTs can generally handle larger currents and powers compared to FETs of similar size, making BJTs often preferred for high-power switching or amplification applications.</li>

The drain is connected to a negative voltage relative to the source (\(V_{DS} < 0\)) to cause holes to flow from source to drain.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A negative voltage \(V_{DS}\) is applied between the drain and source. This causes holes (majority carriers in the P-channel) to flow from the source (positive terminal) through the channel to the drain (negative terminal), constituting the drain current \(I_D\). The current direction is usually shown as flowing from drain to source (conventional current, positive direction).</li>
                                    <li>A positive voltage \(V_{GS}\) is applied between the gate and source. This reverse-biases the PN junction between the N-type gate and the P-channel.</li>
                                    <li>The reverse bias voltage creates a depletion region within the P-channel, depleted of free charge carriers. This narrows the conductive path of the channel.</li>
                                    <li>As the positive \(V_{GS}\) voltage is increased (made more positive), the reverse bias across the gate-channel junction increases, widening the depletion region and further constricting the channel.</li>
                                    <li>If \(V_{GS}\) is made sufficiently positive, the depletion regions can meet, closing off the channel and reducing \(I_D\) to zero. This \(V_{GS}\) voltage is called the pinch-off voltage (\(V_p\)), which is positive for a P-channel JFET.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The P-channel JFET acts as a voltage-controlled resistor or current source, where the positive \(V_{GS}\) controls the negative \(I_D\) (or positive conventional \(I_D\) flowing S to D).</p>

                                \[ V_B = V_{CC} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \]
                                \[ V_B = 12 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{4.7 \, k\Omega}{20 \, k\Omega + 4.7 \, k\Omega} = 12 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{4.7}{24.7} \]

                                <p>The emitter current \(I_E\) is approximately 1.5834 mA.</p>

                                <p>**(iii) \(I_{B}\) (Base current):** Using the approximation \(I_C \simeq I_E\), the base current \(I_B = I_E - I_C\) is very small compared to \(I_E\) and \(I_C\). The exact value depends on the transistor's \(\beta\), where \(I_B = I_E / (1+\beta)\). Without knowing \(\beta\), we cannot calculate the exact value of \(I_B\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the intended calculation requires a typical \(\beta\). Given the marks, let's assume \(\beta \approx 100\). Then \(I_B = I_E / (1+\beta) = 1.5834mA / 101 \approx 0.01568mA = 15.68 \mu A\).</p>
