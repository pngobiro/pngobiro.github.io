                                <p>**(ii) Operation of a multicellular-type electrostatic voltmeter with diagram:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Electrostatic voltmeters measure voltage based on the electrostatic force between charged conductors. The multicellular type uses multiple sets of fixed and movable vanes to increase the deflecting torque and sensitivity, making it suitable for lower voltages than the single-cell type.</p>

                                <p>**Description:** The voltmeter consists of several sets of fixed metal vanes (F) and movable metal vanes (M). The movable vanes are mounted on a central spindle, which is controlled by a spring and bearings and carries the pointer. The fixed vanes are connected to one terminal of the voltage source, and the movable vanes are connected to the other terminal. When a voltage is applied, the fixed and movable vanes become oppositely charged (or acquire charges proportional to the potential difference). An electrostatic force of attraction is exerted between the charged vanes. Since there are multiple sets of vanes and large surface areas facing each other across narrow air gaps, the force is significant even for moderate voltages. This force produces a deflecting torque on the movable system. The torque is proportional to the square of the applied voltage (\(V^2\)). This deflecting torque is opposed by a controlling torque from a spring. The movable system deflects until the deflecting torque is balanced by the controlling torque. The deflection is proportional to \(V^2\), resulting in a non-linear scale (cramped at lower voltages, spread out at higher voltages). Because they draw almost no current (only leakage and initial charging current), they are useful for measuring high voltages and in circuits where loading must be minimized.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Multi-range DC Milliammeter Shunt Calculation (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">To extend the range of a DC milliammeter, shunt resistors are connected in parallel with the meter. The shunt diverts excess current, allowing the meter to measure a fraction of the total current corresponding to its full-scale deflection (FSD).</p>
                                <p>Given:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Meter internal resistance \(R_m = 50 \, \Omega\).</li>
                                    <li>Meter FSD current \(I_m = 2 \, mA = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, A\).</li>
                                    <li>Current ranges \(I\): 10 mA, 50 mA, 100 mA, 500 mA.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>For each range, the shunt resistor \(R_{sh}\) is calculated such that when the total current \(I\) equals the range maximum, the current through the meter is \(I_m\). The current through the shunt is \(I_{sh} = I - I_m\).</p>
                                <p>Since the meter and shunt are in parallel, the voltage across them is equal: \( V_m = V_{sh} \).
                                \[ I_m R_m = I_{sh} R_{sh} \]
                                \[ I_m R_m = (I - I_m) R_{sh} \]
                                \[ R_{sh} = \frac{I_m R_m}{I - I_m} \]

                                <p>Calculate \(R_{sh}\) for each range:</p>

                                        \[ R_{sh,10mA} = \frac{(2 \times 10^{-3}) \times 50}{(10 \times 10^{-3}) - (2 \times 10^{-3})} = \frac{100 \times 10^{-3}}{8 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5 \, \Omega \]

                                    <li>**Range 0 - 100 mA:** \( I = 100 \, mA = 100 \times 10^{-3} \, A \). \(I_m = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, A\).

                                </ul>
                                <p>The values of the shunt resistors for the ranges 10 mA, 50 mA, 100 mA, and 500 mA are \(12.5 \, \Omega\), approximately \(2.083 \, \Omega\), approximately \(1.020 \, \Omega\), and approximately \(0.201 \, \Omega\) respectively.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Oscilloscope Display of AM Wave (5 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">An amplitude modulated (AM) wave is a high-frequency carrier wave whose amplitude is varied in proportion to a lower-frequency modulating signal.

                                <p>The sketch should show a high-frequency sine wave (the carrier) whose amplitude varies over time. The outer boundary of the peaks (upper envelope) and the outer boundary of the troughs (lower envelope) should trace the shape of the modulating signal (often a sine wave itself). The vertical axis represents the instantaneous amplitude, and the horizontal axis represents time.</p>

                                <p>From the displayed waveform, the modulation index \(m\) can be determined by measuring the maximum amplitude of the modulated wave (\(V_{max}\), from the center axis to the highest point of the envelope) and the minimum amplitude of the modulated wave (\(V_{min}\), from the center axis to the lowest point of the envelope).</p>
                                \[ m = \frac{V_{max} - V_{min}}{V_{max} + V_{min}} \]

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers equipment failure types, the bathtub reliability curve, calculating system reliability from component data, and environmental effects on equipment.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Failure Types and Failure Rate Curve (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>**(i) Distinction between sudden failure and complete failure:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Sudden Failure:** A failure that is unexpected and abrupt, with little or no warning signs. It typically leads to the equipment ceasing to function immediately (often also catastrophic). Example: A fuse blowing, a transistor shorting out suddenly.</li>
                                    <li>**Complete Failure:** The equipment totally stops performing its intended function. This is a state of failure where the equipment provides no output or cannot fulfill its primary purpose at all. It can be the result of a sudden failure (e.g., power supply failure) or the final state of a degradation failure. Example: A radio producing no sound or not tuning to any station.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p class="key-point">Note: Complete failure describes the *state* of the equipment, while sudden failure describes the *manner* in which the state was reached. A sudden failure often results in a complete failure.</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Failure rate versus time curve (Bathtub Curve) and performance description:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The failure rate versus time curve is the Bathtub Curve (see Q3c in July 2015 or Q1a in November 2016 for sketch and description). It shows the probability of failure per unit time over the equipment's lifespan.</p>
                                <p>Performance description across the curve:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Infant Mortality (Early Life):** Failure rate is high and decreasing. Performance is initially unpredictable due to "bugs" and manufacturing defects. Equipment reliability improves as these early failures are weeded out.</li>
                                    <li>**Useful Life (Mid-Life):** Failure rate is low and relatively constant. Performance is stable and predictable. Reliability is at its best during this period. Failures are random and not age-related.</li>
                                    <li>**Wear-out Period (End of Life):** Failure rate is increasing rapidly. Performance degrades as components age, wear out, or fatigue. The equipment becomes less reliable and requires more frequent maintenance or replacement.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Equipment Reliability Calculations from Component Data (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">To determine the reliability of an equipment based on its components connected in series, we first need to calculate the total failure rate of the system. The failure rate contribution of each component type is its failure rate multiplied by the quantity and weighting factor.</p>
                                <p>From Table 1 (Figure 4):</p>
                                <ul>

                                </ul>
                                <p>Total equipment failure rate per 1000 hours (\( \lambda_{equipment, \%/1000hrs} \)) is the sum of individual contributions:</p>
                                \[ \lambda_{equipment, \%/1000hrs} = 0.75 + 1.0 + 0.4 + 0.75 + 12.0 + 6.0 + 11.25 \]
                                \[ \lambda_{equipment, \%/1000hrs} = 32.15 \text{ % per 1000 hours} \]
                                <p>Convert to failures per hour: \( \lambda_{equipment} = \frac{32.15 / 100}{1000} \, \text{failures/hour} = \frac{0.3215}{1000} = 3.215 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{failures/hour} \).</p>

                                <p>**(i) Failure rate of the equipment:**</p>
                                <p>The failure rate is \(3.215 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{failures/hour}\) or \(32.15 \, \text{% per 1000 hours}\). </p>

                                <p>**(ii) Mean time between failure (MTBF):**</p>
                                <p>MTBF is the reciprocal of the failure rate (assuming a constant failure rate, appropriate for the useful life period).</p>
                                \[ MTBF = \frac{1}{\lambda_{equipment}} = \frac{1}{3.215 \times 10^{-4}} \, \text{hours/failure} \]
                                \[ MTBF \approx 3109.18 \, \text{hours/failure} \]

                                <p>**(iii) Reliability for an operating period of 1,000 hours:**</p>
                                <p>The reliability \(R(t)\) for a time \(t\) is given by \( R(t) = e^{-\lambda_{equipment} t} \).</p>
                                <p>Here \(t = 1000\) hours. It's easier to use the failure rate per 1000 hours directly.</p>
                                \[ R(1000) = e^{-(\lambda_{equipment, \%/1000hrs} / 100)} \]
                                \[ R(1000) = e^{-(32.15 / 100)} = e^{-0.3215} \]
                                \[ R(1000) \approx 0.7249 \]
                                <p>The reliability of the equipment for an operating period of 1,000 hours is approximately 0.7249 or 72.49%.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Corrosion:** High humidity can accelerate the corrosion of metal parts, including component leads, PCB traces, connectors, and chassis.</li>
                                    <li>**Insulation Degradation:** Moisture can reduce the insulation resistance between conductors, potentially leading to leakage currents, short circuits, or malfunction, especially in high-voltage circuits or on PCBs.</li>
                                    <li>**Component Damage:** Some components (e.g., electrolytic capacitors, semiconductors) can be adversely affected by moisture absorption or reactions, leading to degraded performance or failure.</li>
                                    <li>**Dust Adhesion:** Humidity causes dust particles to stick to surfaces, which can trap moisture and contaminants, exacerbating corrosion and potentially causing tracking or short circuits.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p class="answer-intro">Reflow soldering is a common process used to attach surface-mount components (SMDs) to printed circuit boards (PCBs). It involves using solder paste (a mixture of solder powder and flux) applied to the pads, placing components onto the paste, and then heating the assembly to melt and reflow the solder, creating the connections.</p>
                                <p>**Description:**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>**Solder Paste Application:** Solder paste is accurately applied to the designated pads on the PCB using a stencil and a squeegee, or through jet printing.</li>
                                    <li>**Component Placement:** Electronic components (SMDs) are precisely placed onto the solder paste deposits on the pads using automated pick-and-place machines. The paste's stickiness holds the components in place.</li>
                                    <li>**Preheating:** The entire assembly is slowly heated in a preheating zone of a reflow oven. This evaporates volatile solvents from the solder paste, activates the flux (which cleans the surfaces), and brings the components and PCB to a uniform temperature to minimize thermal shock in the next stage.</li>
                                    <li>**Reflow:** The assembly moves into the reflow zone, where the temperature is rapidly increased above the melting point of the solder alloy. The solder paste melts, and the surface tension of the molten solder pulls the components into alignment with the pads ("self-alignment") and forms reliable solder joints.</li>
                                    <li>**Cooling:** The assembly moves into a cooling zone, where the temperature is gradually reduced. The molten solder solidifies, creating the permanent electrical and mechanical connections. Rapid cooling can lead to thermal stress.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(b) Audio Amplifier Gain Test (8 marks):</strong></p>

The attenuator might be before the amplifier to precisely control the input level, or at the output to reduce a high output voltage before the oscilloscope input. A dummy load (resistive) might be connected to the amplifier output if the amplifier requires or is specified for a certain load impedance, instead of just connecting it directly to the oscilloscope (which has high impedance).

                                <p>**(ii) Procedure for the test:**</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>**Connect Setup:** Connect the signal generator, attenuator (if used), amplifier, dummy load (if used), and oscilloscope as shown in the diagram.</li>
                                    <li>**Configure Signal Generator:** Set the generator to produce a sinusoidal waveform at a standard audio test frequency (e.g., 1 kHz). Set the initial output amplitude to a low value.</li>
                                    <li>**Set Attenuator:** If using a switched attenuator, set it to a known attenuation level.</li>
                                    <li>**Configure Oscilloscope:** Turn on the oscilloscope. Set the input coupling to AC. Adjust the vertical sensitivity (Volts/Div) and horizontal timebase (Time/Div) controls to view the signal.</li>
                                    <li>**Measure Input Voltage:** Connect the oscilloscope probe to the input of the amplifier (after the attenuator, if used). Adjust scope settings for a clear waveform. Measure and record the input voltage amplitude (e.g., peak-to-peak or RMS) as \(V_{in}\).</li>
                                    <li>**Measure Output Voltage:** Move the oscilloscope probe to the output of the amplifier (across the dummy load, if used). Adjust scope settings. Ensure the output waveform is a clean sine wave without clipping or distortion. If distorted, reduce the input voltage amplitude from the generator (and/or adjust the attenuator) until the output is clean. Measure and record the output voltage amplitude (using the same type of measurement, peak-to-peak or RMS, as for \(V_{in}\)) as \(V_{out}\).</li>
                                    <li>**Calculate Gain:** Calculate the voltage gain \(A_v = V_{out} / V_{in}\). For accurate testing, ensure the amplifier is operating within its specified linear range (no clipping or excessive distortion).</li>

                                <p>**(ii) Description of how the test is carried out:**</p>
                                <p>Most digital multimeters have a diode test function (often indicated by a diode symbol on the rotary switch). This function typically applies a small voltage across the diode and measures the resulting voltage drop or indicates open/short circuit.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Set the multimeter to the "diode test" function.</li>
                                    <li>Connect the red lead (positive terminal) of the multimeter to the anode of the diode and the black lead (negative terminal) to the cathode. This is the **forward bias** connection. A functioning diode should show a voltage reading (typically around 0.5V to 0.7V for silicon, 0.2V to 0.3V for germanium, or the specific forward voltage drop of the diode type). The multimeter is indicating the forward voltage drop across the conducting diode.</li>
                                    <li>Reverse the leads: connect the red lead to the cathode and the black lead to the anode. This is the **reverse bias** connection. A functioning diode should show an "OL" (Over Limit) or "1" indication on the display, indicating a very high resistance (open circuit), meaning no significant current is flowing in reverse bias below the multimeter's test voltage.</li>
                                    <li>If the multimeter reads close to 0V in both directions, the diode is likely short-circuited. If it reads "OL" or "1" in both directions, the diode is likely open-circuited.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Visual inspection and testing with basic instruments like multimeters and oscilloscopes are fundamental skills in electronic fault diagnosis and repair, complementing knowledge of circuit operation and component behavior.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Dimensional equation for pole strength in c.g.s. electromagnetic units (emu) (8 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">In the c.g.s. electromagnetic system (emu), the unit of magnetic pole strength is defined based on the force between two magnetic poles. The force \(F\) between two magnetic poles \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) separated by a distance \(r\) in vacuum is given by \( F = k \frac{p_1 p_2}{r^2} \). In emu, the proportionality constant \(k = 1/\mu_0\) is taken as 1 (since \(\mu_0\) is dimensionless and equal to 1). So, \( F = \frac{p^2}{r^2} \) for \(p_1 = p_2 = p\).</p>
                                <p>Force \(F\) has dimensions \([MLT^{-2}]\). Distance \(r\) has dimensions \([L]\).</p>
                                <p>From \( F = \frac{p^2}{L^2} \), we have \( p^2 = F \times L^2 \).</p>
                                \[ [p^2] = [MLT^{-2}] [L^2] = [ML^3T^{-2}] \]
                                <p>To find the dimension of \(p\), take the square root:</p>
                                \[ [p]_{emu} = [M^{1/2}L^{3/2}T^{-1}] \]
                                <p>This is the dimensional equation for magnetic pole strength in the c.g.s. electromagnetic units.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Definition of "standard" in measurements (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>As used in measurements, a "standard" is a fundamental reference used to define or realize a unit of measurement for a physical quantity. It represents a specific magnitude of a quantity used for comparison to measure other quantities of the same kind. Standards provide the basis for calibration and ensuring consistency and traceability of measurements within a system or across different locations/times. Examples include the international prototype of the kilogram (historically), the atomic clock (for the second), or a standard resistor (for resistance).</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Dimensional equation for mechanical energy (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Mechanical energy (like kinetic energy or potential energy) is the capacity to do work. Since energy and work are dimensionally equivalent, we can derive the dimensions of energy from the definition of work or from common energy formulas.</p>
                                <p>From work \(W = F \times d\), dimensions are \([MLT^{-2}] \times [L] = [ML^2T^{-2}]\).</p>
                                <p>From kinetic energy \(KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2\). Mass \(m\) has dimensions \([M]\). Velocity \(v\) has dimensions \([LT^{-1}]\).
                                \[ [\text{Energy}] = [M] \times ([LT^{-1}])^2 \]
                                \[ [\text{Energy}] = [M] \times [L^2T^{-2}] \]
                                \[ [\text{Energy}] = [ML^2T^{-2}] \]
                                <p>The dimensional equation for mechanical energy is \( [ML^2T^{-2}] \).</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Reasons for Routine Maintenance Tasks (6 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>Routine maintenance involves scheduled tasks to keep equipment in good working order and prevent failures.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(i) Lubrication:** To reduce friction and wear between moving parts (e.g., in motors, bearings, gears). Proper lubrication prevents overheating, reduces power consumption, minimizes wear, and extends the lifespan of mechanical components.</li>
                                    <li>**(ii) Cleaning:** To remove dirt, dust, grease, and contaminants from the equipment surfaces and internal components. Accumulation of dirt can cause overheating, reduce insulation resistance leading to leakage or shorts, interfere with moving parts, and accelerate corrosion. Cleaning ensures proper operation and prevents component damage.</li>
                                    <li>**(iii) Re-alignment:** To ensure that interconnected components (e.g., motor and pump, pulleys and belts) are correctly positioned and oriented relative to each other. Misalignment can cause excessive vibration, noise, wear on bearings and couplings, and reduced efficiency. Re-alignment restores smooth operation and prevents premature component failure.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Corrective Maintenance and Fault Location (10 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p>Corrective maintenance is performed after a fault has occurred to restore equipment to a working state. The two main phases mentioned are detection and location.</p>
                                <p>**(i) Two assumptions in the half-split method of locating a fault:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">The half-split method is a fault isolation technique where testing is performed at points that divide the circuit into roughly equal halves.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Assumption 1: The system can be meaningfully divided into functional blocks or sections.** The method relies on being able to isolate and test parts of the system independently.</li>
                                    <li>**Assumption 2: The fault is located in only one section (or at a specific interface).** If there are multiple unrelated faults, the half-split method might not efficiently isolate the problem.</li>
                                    <li>**Assumption 3: A test point divides the *potential* location of the fault into two possibilities (before the test point or after it).** A successful test means the fault is after that point; an unsuccessful test means the fault is before or at that point.</li>
                                    <li>**Assumption 4: The test at the split point is reliable and indicates whether the input to the next section is correct.**</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>**(ii) Phases of corrective maintenance tasks:**</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**(I) Fault Detection:** This is the phase where it is identified that a fault has occurred. This might be triggered by a failure indicator (e.g., alarm light), abnormal performance observed by the operator, or failure of the equipment to start or operate correctly. The goal is to recognize that a problem exists.</li>
                                    <li>**(II) Fault Location:** Once a fault is detected, this phase involves diagnosing where the fault is physically located within the equipment. This is done using troubleshooting techniques like visual inspection, voltage/current measurements, signal tracing/injection, component testing, and using service manuals or fault charts to narrow down the possibilities to a specific component, circuit board, or sub-assembly. The goal is to pinpoint the source of the failure.</li>
                                    <p>Other phases of corrective maintenance include: Fault Isolation (confirming the exact faulty component/location), Repair (replacing the faulty component, fixing connections, etc.), and Verification/Testing (confirming that the repair was successful and the equipment is fully functional).</p>

                                <p>Let's use the relationship that the total charge \(Q\) is proportional to the maximum throw \(\theta_{max}\). The constant of proportionality depends on the galvanometer's parameters. The steady deflection sensitivity \(S_i = \theta/I_{steady} = NBA/K\). The charge sensitivity \(S_Q = \theta_{max}/Q = S_i \times (2\pi/T_n) / \sqrt{1 - (D/(2\sqrt{JK}))^2}\) for underdamped case, or \(S_Q \approx S_i \times (2\pi/T_n)\) if damping is small.

                                <p class="answer-intro">The damping constant \(D\) is related to the damping ratio \(\zeta\). For critical damping, \(\zeta = 1\). The damping ratio is defined as \( \zeta = \frac{D}{2\sqrt{JK}} \). For any given damping (not necessarily critical), \(D\) is the coefficient of the velocity term in the equation of motion. We need more information (like logarithmic decrement from oscillations) or the circuit resistance to determine the damping constant if it's not critically damped.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">The question asks for "the damping constant" without specifying a damping condition (like critical damping, or providing data for measuring damping). If the question implies critical damping (which is often aimed for in measurement instruments), \(D_{critical} = 2\sqrt{JK}\). However, it asks for the resistance to add for critical damping in part (iv), suggesting the inherent damping is not critical.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Without additional information about the galvanometer's inherent damping (e.g., due to air friction, electrical resistance of the coil and circuit before adding resistance), the specific damping constant \(D\) cannot be determined from \(J\) and \(K\) alone.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Assuming the question implicitly intends to ask for the damping constant *needed for* critical damping, then \(D = D_{critical} = 2\sqrt{JK}\). However, this is usually calculated in part (iv) in relation to resistance. Let's assume there's insufficient information to calculate the inherent damping constant \(D\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">If the question assumes it *is* critically damped, then \(D = 2\sqrt{JK}\), but then (iv) makes no sense. Let's assume it's asking for the inherent \(D\) and we need more data.</p>
                                <p>Given the context, it's possible the question intends to ask for the *critical damping constant* \(D_{critical}\) in (iii) and then relate it to resistance in (iv). Let's calculate \(D_{critical}\).</p>
                                \[ D_{critical} = 2\sqrt{JK} = 2\sqrt{(0.55 \times 10^{-5}) \times (47 \times 10^{-6})} \]
                                \[ D_{critical} = 2\sqrt{25.85 \times 10^{-11}} = 2\sqrt{2.585 \times 10^{-10}} \]
                                \[ D_{critical} = 2 \times 1.6078 \times 10^{-5} \approx 3.2156 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{Nm \, s/rad} \]

                                <p>**(iv) Value of resistor to be added in series to give critical damping:**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Electrical damping in a moving coil galvanometer is proportional to the circuit resistance. The total damping constant \(D_{total}\) is the sum of inherent mechanical/air damping \(D_m\) and electrical damping \(D_e\). \( D_e = \frac{(NBA)^2}{R_{total}} \), where \(R_{total}\) is the total resistance of the coil circuit.</p>
                                <p>For critical damping, \( D_{total} = D_{critical} = 2\sqrt{JK} \). So, \( D_m + D_e = 2\sqrt{JK} \).
                                \[ D_m + \frac{(NBA)^2}{R_{coil} + R_{ext}} = 2\sqrt{JK} \]
                                <p>Where \(R_{coil}\) is the resistance of the galvanometer coil circuit without the added resistor, and \(R_{ext}\) is the added series resistor. Without knowing the inherent mechanical damping \(D_m\) or the coil resistance \(R_{coil}\), we cannot find \(R_{ext}\) uniquely.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">It's possible the question assumes \(D_m\) is negligible, and critical damping is achieved solely by electrical damping. In that case, \( D_e = 2\sqrt{JK} \).</p>
                                \[ \frac{(NBA)^2}{R_{total}} = 2\sqrt{JK} \]
                                \[ R_{total} = \frac{(NBA)^2}{2\sqrt{JK}} \]
                                <p>We need \(NBA\). \(NBA = 120 \times 0.18 \times (900 \times 10^{-6}) = 120 \times 0.18 \times 9 \times 10^{-4} = 194.4 \times 10^{-4} = 0.01944 \, \mathrm{Wb \, m^2 \, turn/m^2} \). Units seem mixed, should be Wb-turns or Tm²-turns. \(NBA\) is magnetic flux linkage per unit current in the field coil, or torque per unit current in the moving coil? The formula \(T=NBIA\) uses \(B\) as flux density. So \(NBA\) should be Torque/Current, units Nm/A.</p>
                                <p>Let's re-evaluate \(NBA\): \(N=120\), \(B=0.18\mathrm{Wb/m}^2\), \(A=900\mathrm{mm}^2 = 900 \times 10^{-6}\mathrm{m}^2\). \(NBA = 120 \times 0.18 \times 900 \times 10^{-6} = 19440 \times 10^{-6} = 0.01944\). Unit is Nm/A? Yes, \(T=NBIA\), so \(NBA = T/I\). Dimensions \([ML^2T^{-2}L^{-1}][A^{-1}] = [MLT^{-2}A^{-1}]\). This is wrong.</p>
                                <p>Let's use the electrical damping formula \( D_e = G^2 / R_{total} \), where \(G\) is the galvanometer constant (torque per unit current or flux linkage per unit angle - need to be careful). \(G = NBA\). So \( D_e = (NBA)^2 / R_{total} \). This seems dimensionally incorrect unless units are handled carefully. \(G\) is Torque/Current (Nm/A). Electrical damping \(D_e\) (Nm s/rad) is \( G^2/R \) if G is Emf/Angular velocity (Vs/rad). Or \(G = NBA\) is Torque/Current (Nm/A). In SI, \(G\) [Nm/A] = [Wb].</p>
                                <p>Let's assume the correct electrical damping formula is \( D_e = (NBA)^2 / R_{total} \) where \(NBA\) is Torque/Current in Nm/A, and \(R_{total}\) is in Ohms.</p>

                                <p>Electrical damping constant \(D_e = G_{emf}^2 / R_{total}\). \(G_{emf}\) is back emf per angular velocity. $V_{emf} = NBA \frac{d\theta}{dt}$ ? No, that's if magnetic field is changing. Back emf in moving coil is proportional to velocity. \(e = k \frac{d\theta}{dt}\). \(k = NBA\) if \(B\) is flux density? Yes, for generator action. \(e=NB\ell v\). For rotation, \(v = r \omega\). $e=NBA\omega$ where A is area vector, omega is angular velocity vector? No.</p>
                                <p>Let's assume the damping formula is \( D_e = (NBA)^2 / R_{total} \) where \(NBA\) is the flux linkage constant per unit current? No, \(NBA\) is in Wb-turns. Back emf constant is related to torque constant. $k_e = k_t = NBA$. Let's assume \(NBA\) as calculated is the torque constant (Nm/A) or back emf constant (Vs/rad). Let's use \(G=NBA = 0.01944\). Then \(D_e = G^2/R\)? This does not seem right dimensionally.</p>
                                <p>Correct formula for electrical damping constant \(D_e\) (in Nm s/rad) in terms of coil properties: \(D_e = (NBA)^2 / R_{total}\) if \(NBA\) is the torque constant in Nm/A? No, if G is in Nm/A, $D_e=G^2/R$ is $ (Nm/A)^2 / \Omega = N^2m^2/A^2 \Omega$. No. If G is in Vs/rad, $D_e=G^2/R$ is $(Vs/rad)^2 / \Omega = V^2s^2/rad^2 \Omega$. Still wrong.</p>
                                <p>Let's use the damping ratio \(\zeta = \frac{D}{2\sqrt{JK}}\). Critical damping when \(\zeta = 1\), so \(D_{total} = 2\sqrt{JK}\).
                                Assume total damping \(D_{total} = D_m + D_e\). Let \(R_{coil}\) be the galvanometer coil resistance. \(R_{total} = R_{coil} + R_{ext}\).

                                \(D_e = \frac{(NB)^2 A_{eff}^2}{R_{total}}\)? No.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's revisit the dimension of \(D\). Damping coefficient is Force/(velocity) or Torque/(angular velocity). Units Nm s/rad. Let's use \(D_e = G^2/R_{total}\) where G is Nm/A or Vs/rad. 1 Wb = 1 Vs. Torque constant $k_t = NBA$ (Nm/A or Wb-turns). Back emf constant $k_e = NBA$ (Vs/rad). In SI, $k_t = k_e$. So $G = NBA = 0.01944$ in Wb-turns or Vs/rad or Nm/A. Let's assume $G = 0.01944$ Vs/rad.</p>
                                \[ D_e = \frac{G^2}{R_{total}} = \frac{(0.01944 \, \mathrm{Vs/rad})^2}{R_{total}} \]
                                <p>This formula gives \(D_e\) in \(V^2s^2/rad^2\Omega\), which is not \(Nm s/rad\). There must be a units issue or a missing constant/formula.</p>

                                <p>Given that standard tables often relate damping to resistance, let's trust the structure \(D_e = \frac{(NBA)^2}{R_{total}}\) and assume \(NBA\) as calculated \(0.01944\) is the constant relating current and torque or velocity and voltage correctly for this formula to give \(D_e\) in Nm s/rad. Its units would need to be \( \sqrt{Nm s/rad \times \Omega} = \sqrt{Nm s \Omega / rad} \). This doesn't match Wb-turns.</p>
                                <p>Let's assume the formula is \( D_e = \frac{(NBA)^2}{R_{total}} \) where \(NBA\) is in Wb-turns or Vs/rad, and the unit conversion makes it work out. Let's assume \(NBA = 0.01944\) Vs/rad. Then \(D_e = (0.01944)^2 / R_{total} \, (Vs/rad)^2/\Omega = V^2s^2/rad^2\Omega\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">There is a significant discrepancy in units/formulas from standard sources if \(NBA\) is used directly as \(G\) in \(D_e = G^2/R\). Standard electrical damping comes from the back emf opposing motion, which is proportional to velocity. This back emf drives a current in the coil circuit, leading to power dissipation and damping torque. The back emf is \(e = NBv_p\) where \(v_p\) is perp velocity. For rotation, \(v_p \propto d\theta/dt\). So \(e = G_{emf} \frac{d\theta}{dt}\). Damping torque \(T_d = e i = e (e/R_{total}) = e^2/R_{total}\). So \(T_d = \frac{G_{emf}^2}{R_{total}} (\frac{d\theta}{dt})^2\)? No, damping torque is proportional to velocity, \(T_d = D_e \frac{d\theta}{dt}\). So \(D_e = \frac{G_{emf}^2}{R_{total}}\). Yes, this is the correct structure, and $G_{emf}=NBA$ with B as flux density is correct for angular velocity. So $G_{emf} = 0.01944$ Vs/rad. Then $D_e$ units are $(Vs/rad)^2/\Omega = V^2s^2/rad^2\Omega$. This unit seems wrong for damping constant.</p>

                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the question implicitly assumes the galvanometer has some inherent damping and some coil resistance \(R_{coil}\), and adding series resistance \(R_{ext}\) means \(R_{total} = R_{coil} + R_{ext}\). We want \(D_m + D_e(R_{total}) = 2\sqrt{JK}\). If \(D_m = 0\), \(D_e(R_{total}) = 2\sqrt{JK}\). Then \(R_{total} = (NBA)^2 / (2\sqrt{JK}) \approx 11.75 \Omega\).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">If the question means that by adding resistance, we achieve critical damping, and the inherent damping is negligible, then the total resistance must be \(R_{critical} = \frac{(NBA)^2}{2\sqrt{JK}} \approx 11.75 \Omega\). The resistance to be added in series is \(R_{ext} = R_{critical} - R_{coil}\). We don't have \(R_{coil}\). Or maybe the question is flawed.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume a possible reinterpretation: Maybe "damping constant" in (iii) refers to the *required* electrical damping constant for critical damping (assuming Dm=0), i.e., \(D_e = 2\sqrt{JK}\). Then (iv) asks for the resistance to achieve this damping. Let's try this interpretation.</p>
                                <p>**(iii) Damping constant (assuming required \(D_e\) for critical damping with \(D_m=0\)):**</p>
                                \[ D_e = 2\sqrt{JK} = D_{critical} \approx 3.2156 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{Nm \, s/rad} \]

                                <p>**(iv) Value of resistor to be added in series to give critical damping:**</p>
                                <p>Using the formula \( D_e = G_{emf}^2 / R_{total} \), where \(G_{emf} = NBA = 0.01944\) Vs/rad. We need \(R_{total}\) such that \(D_e = D_{critical}\).
                                \[ D_{critical} = \frac{(NBA)^2}{R_{total}} \]
                                \[ R_{total} = \frac{(NBA)^2}{D_{critical}} = \frac{(0.01944 \, \mathrm{Vs/rad})^2}{3.2156 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{Nm \, s/rad}} \]
                                \[ R_{total} = \frac{0.0003779 \, \mathrm{V^2s^2/rad^2}}{3.2156 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{Nm \, s/rad}} \]
                                <p>Units: \( \frac{V^2s^2}{rad^2} \frac{rad}{Nm s} = \frac{V^2s}{rad Nm} \). This is not Ohms. Something is fundamentally wrong with the units or the formula used. However, if we assume the structure is correct and results are expected in Ohms, we calculate the numerical value.</p>
                                \[ R_{total} \approx \frac{0.0003779}{0.000032156} \approx 11.75 \, \Omega \]
                                <p>This is the total resistance needed. If the galvanometer coil has some resistance \(R_{coil}\), the added resistance \(R_{ext} = R_{total} - R_{coil}\). Since \(R_{coil}\) is not given, we cannot find the added resistance.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the question implies adding resistance *increases* damping (which is physically incorrect for standard electrical damping proportional to 1/R) or there's a special setup. Given the numerical value of 11.75 Ohms comes up as a total resistance, and it's a common type of calculation, it's likely the question intended this as the total resistance for critical damping (assuming Dm=0). However, asking for "resistor to be added in series" implies R_ext > 0 and there's an existing R_coil.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's assume the question implies that the *existing* circuit resistance is very low, and we need to *increase* it by adding resistance to achieve critical damping. This would be the case if the electrical damping were proportional to R, not 1/R. This is not standard.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Given the inconsistency, I will state the required total resistance for critical damping (assuming Dm=0) and highlight the ambiguity.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Assuming (iii) asks for D_critical and (iv) asks for the total resistance for critical damping (assuming Dm=0).</p>

                                <p>**(iii) Damping constant (Critical damping constant \(D_{critical}\)):** \( D_{critical} \approx 3.2156 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{Nm \, s/rad} \)</p>
                                <p>**(iv) Value of resistor to be added in series to give critical damping:**</p>
                                <p>Assuming inherent mechanical damping is negligible (\(D_m=0\)) and electrical damping is \( D_e = \frac{(NBA)^2}{R_{total}} \) where \(NBA = 0.01944\) Vs/rad, the total resistance required for critical damping is \( R_{total} = \frac{(NBA)^2}{2\sqrt{JK}} = \frac{(0.01944)^2}{3.2156 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 11.75 \, \Omega \). This is the total resistance of the circuit (coil + external). The resistance to be added in series is \(R_{ext} = R_{total} - R_{coil}\). As \(R_{coil}\) is not given, the added resistance cannot be determined. If \(R_{coil}\) were negligible, the added resistance would be approx 11.75 \( \Omega \).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Due to the issues with the formula/units and the missing coil resistance, a definitive numerical answer for the added resistor cannot be provided based *solely* on standard physics principles and the given data.</p>

                                <p>**Description:** Silicon is a group IV element with 4 valence electrons. A trivalent impurity atom (group III element) has only 3 valence electrons. When a trivalent atom substitutes a silicon atom in the crystal lattice, it forms covalent bonds with three neighboring silicon atoms. The bond with the fourth silicon atom is incomplete, as the trivalent atom can only share 3 electrons, while the silicon atom has 4 electrons to share. This deficiency of an electron in the covalent bond creates a "hole". These holes are free to move throughout the crystal lattice, acting as positive charge carriers. The trivalent impurity atoms, having accepted an electron to complete three bonds, become fixed negative ions in the lattice. In a p-type semiconductor, holes are the majority carriers, and electrons are the minority carriers.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Rutherford's atomic structure (4 marks):</strong></p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Ernest Rutherford proposed a model of the atom based on the results of his gold foil scattering experiment (Geiger-Marsden experiment).</p>
                                <p>**Explanation:** Rutherford's model, sometimes called the nuclear model, described the atom as having:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A very small, dense, positively charged **nucleus** located at the center of the atom. This nucleus contains most of the atom's mass (attributed to protons and neutrons, although neutrons were discovered later).</li>
                                    <li>Negatively charged **electrons** orbiting around the nucleus in definite paths, much like planets orbiting the sun.</li>
                                    <li>The atom is mostly **empty space**, as evidenced by the fact that most alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil without deflection.</li>
                                    <li>The total positive charge of the nucleus is equal to the total negative charge of the orbiting electrons, making the atom electrically neutral.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This model replaced the earlier plum-pudding model but had limitations, particularly in explaining why orbiting electrons (which are accelerating charges) did not lose energy and spiral into the nucleus according to classical physics.</p>

                                    <li>**Maximum Power Dissipation (\(P_D\)):** The maximum power the diode can dissipate safely, usually a product of forward voltage and current, or reverse voltage and leakage current (in breakdown, \(P_D = V_Z \times I_Z\)).</li>
                                    <li>**Reverse Saturation Current (\(I_S\) or \(I_R\)):** The small leakage current in the reverse-biased direction (specified at a certain reverse voltage).</li>

                                    <li>**Operating Temperature Range:** The range of ambient or junction temperatures over which the diode is specified to operate reliably.</li>

                                \[ V_G = V_{DD} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \]
                                \[ V_G = 18 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{1 \, M\Omega}{2.2 \, M\Omega + 1 \, M\Omega} = 18 \, \mathrm{V} \times \frac{1}{3.2} \]
                                \[ V_G = \frac{18}{3.2} \, \mathrm{V} = 5.625 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The gate bias voltage is \(V_G = 5.625 \, \mathrm{V}\). The question labels this as \(V_0\), so \(V_0 = 5.625 \, \mathrm{V}\).</p>

                                <p>**(ii) Gate-to-source voltage (\(V_{GS}\)):**</p>
                                <p>In a self-biased configuration (which this is, as it has \(R_S\) and the source is not directly grounded or connected to a separate voltage), the source voltage is \(V_S = I_D R_S\). The gate-source voltage is \(V_{GS} = V_G - V_S = V_G - I_D R_S\). We need to find \(V_{GS}\) and \(I_D\) simultaneously using Shockley's equation and the bias equation.</p>
                                \[ I_D = I_{DSS} \left( 1 - \frac{V_{GS}}{V_p} \right)^2 \]
                                <p>Substitute \(I_{DSS}=4mA\) and \(V_p=-5V\): \( I_D = 4 \left( 1 - \frac{V_{GS}}{-5} \right)^2 = 4 \left( 1 + \frac{V_{GS}}{5} \right)^2 \).
                                Substitute \(I_D = (V_G - V_{GS}) / R_S\): \( \frac{5.625 - V_{GS}}{1.5k} = 4 \times 10^{-3} \left( 1 + \frac{V_{GS}}{5} \right)^2 \).
                                \[ \frac{5.625 - V_{GS}}{1.5} = 4 \left( \frac{5 + V_{GS}}{5} \right)^2 = 4 \frac{(5 + V_{GS})^2}{25} \]
                                \[ 5.625 - V_{GS} = 1.5 \times \frac{4}{25} (25 + 10V_{GS} + V_{GS}^2) \]
                                \[ 5.625 - V_{GS} = 0.24 (25 + 10V_{GS} + V_{GS}^2) \]
                                \[ 5.625 - V_{GS} = 6 + 2.4V_{GS} + 0.24V_{GS}^2 \]
                                \[ 0.24V_{GS}^2 + 2.4V_{GS} + V_{GS} + 6 - 5.625 = 0 \]
                                \[ 0.24V_{GS}^2 + 3.4V_{GS} + 0.375 = 0 \]
                                <p>Use the quadratic formula \( V_{GS} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), with \(a=0.24\), \(b=3.4\), \(c=0.375\).</p>
                                \[ V_{GS} = \frac{-3.4 \pm \sqrt{(3.4)^2 - 4(0.24)(0.375)}}{2(0.24)} \]
                                \[ V_{GS} = \frac{-3.4 \pm \sqrt{11.56 - 0.36}}{0.48} = \frac{-3.4 \pm \sqrt{11.2}}{0.48} = \frac{-3.4 \pm 3.3466}{0.48} \]
                                <p>Two possible solutions:</p>
                                \[ V_{GS1} = \frac{-3.4 + 3.3466}{0.48} = \frac{-0.0534}{0.48} \approx -0.111 \, V \]
                                \[ V_{GS2} = \frac{-3.4 - 3.3466}{0.48} = \frac{-6.7466}{0.48} \approx -14.055 \, V \]
                                <p>For an N-channel depletion MOSFET with \(V_p=-5V\), the operating \(V_{GS}\) must be between \(V_p\) (-5V) and the positive bias limit (where the gate-source junction becomes forward-biased, typically +0.7V). \(V_{GS} \approx -0.111V\) is in the depletion region (\(-5V < -0.111V < 0V\)), which is a valid operating point for an N-channel depletion MOSFET. \(V_{GS} \approx -14.055V\) is more negative than \(V_p\), which would mean \(I_D=0\), inconsistent with the circuit biasing. Therefore, the correct \(V_{GS}\) is approximately -0.111 V.</p>
                                <p>The question uses \(V_c\) for gate-to-source voltage, so \(V_c = V_{GS} \approx -0.111 \, V\).</p>

                                <p>**(iii) Drain current (\(I_D\)):**</p>
                                <p>Using the bias equation \(I_D = (V_G - V_{GS}) / R_S\):</p>
                                \[ I_D = \frac{5.625 \, V - (-0.111 \, V)}{1.5 \, k\Omega} = \frac{5.625 + 0.111}{1.5} \, mA = \frac{5.736}{1.5} \, mA \]
                                \[ I_D \approx 3.824 \, mA \]
                                <p>Alternatively, using Shockley's equation: \( I_D = 4 \, \mathrm{mA} \left( 1 + \frac{-0.111}{5} \right)^2 = 4 (1 - 0.0222)^2 = 4(0.9778)^2 = 4 \times 0.956 \approx 3.824 \, \mathrm{mA} \). The results match.</p>
                                <p>The question uses \(I_5\) for drain current, so \(I_5 = I_D \approx 3.824 \, mA\).</p>

                                <p>**(iv) Drain voltage (\(V_D\)):**</p>
                                <p>The voltage at the drain is \(V_{DD}\) minus the voltage drop across \(R_D\):</p>
                                \[ V_D = V_{DD} - I_D R_D = 18 \, \mathrm{V} - (3.824 \, \mathrm{mA}) \times (3.3 \, k\Omega) \]
                                \[ V_D = 18 \, \mathrm{V} - (3.824 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{A}) \times (3.3 \times 10^3 \, \Omega) = 18 \, \mathrm{V} - 12.6192 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                \[ V_D \approx 5.381 \, \mathrm{V} \]
                                <p>The drain voltage is approximately 5.381 V.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Check saturation: \(V_{DS} = V_D - V_S = 5.381 - (3.824mA \times 1.5k\Omega) = 5.381 - 5.736 = -0.355V\). This negative \(V_{DS}\) indicates the transistor is in the linear (triode) region, not saturation, which contradicts the assumption made when using Shockley's equation in this bias configuration (usually designed for saturation). There might be an issue with the circuit values or parameters provided if the intention was active region operation.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Assuming the question intended the transistor to be in saturation, and requiring calculations based on standard formulas, the calculated Q-point is \(V_{GS} \approx -0.111V, I_D \approx 3.824mA, V_D \approx 5.381V\), but it operates in the linear region based on these values. Let's state the results as calculated and note the region of operation.</p>

                                <p class="key-point">Based on these calculated values, \(V_{DS} = V_D - V_S = 5.381V - (3.824mA \times 1.5k\Omega) = 5.381V - 5.736V = -0.355V\). For saturation, N-channel depletion MOSFET requires \(V_{DS} \ge V_{GS} - V_p = -0.111V - (-5V) = 4.889V\). Since \(V_{DS} < 4.889V\), the transistor is in the linear (triode) region.</p>

                                <p>**(i) Properties of capacitors suitable for power supply filters (3 marks):**</p>
                                <p class="answer-intro">Capacitors are used as filters in DC power supplies (after rectification) to smooth out the pulsating DC voltage and reduce ripple. Properties that make them suitable include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>**Ability to store electrical charge:** They can store energy during the peaks of the rectifier output voltage and discharge during the valleys, smoothing the output.</li>
                                    <li>**Low impedance to AC signals:** Capacitors offer low impedance to the AC ripple component, effectively shunting it away from the load.</li>
                                    <li>**High impedance to DC signals:** Ideally, capacitors block DC current, preventing the filter from affecting the DC voltage level significantly (in a shunt filter configuration).</li>
                                    <li>**Appropriate Capacitance Value:** The capacitance value must be large enough to effectively filter the lowest ripple frequency. Electrolytic capacitors are often used due to their high capacitance in a relatively small size.</li>
                                    <li>**Sufficient Voltage Rating:** The capacitor's voltage rating must be higher than the peak voltage it will be subjected to.</li>

                                <figcaption>Figure 14: Zener Diode Voltage Regulator Circuit (ASCII Art)</figcaption>
                                <p>**Description:** The circuit consists of a series resistor \(R_S\) and a Zener diode connected in parallel (shunt) with the load \(R_L\). The Zener diode is connected in reverse bias. \(R_S\) limits the current flowing into the Zener and the load. When the input voltage \(V_{in}\) is greater than the Zener breakdown voltage \(V_Z\), the Zener diode enters the breakdown region and maintains a nearly constant voltage \(V_Z\) across its terminals and, therefore, across the parallel load \(R_L\). If \(V_{in}\) increases, the current through \(R_S\) increases; the Zener current \(I_Z\) increases while \(V_L\) remains nearly constant. If the load current \(I_L\) decreases (due to increasing \(R_L\)), \(I_Z\) increases to keep \(I_S\) constant (\(I_S = I_Z + I_L\)), maintaining \(V_L\) constant. Regulation is maintained as long as the Zener stays in breakdown (\(I_Z \ge I_{Z,min}\)) and its maximum current rating is not exceeded (\(I_Z \le I_{Z,max}\)).</p>
