                        <p>A view of an object is known technically as a projection. Orthographic projection is a system of drawing views of an object using perpendicular projectors from the object to the projection plane. The object is positioned in such a way that the principal face is parallel to the projection plane. The projected view describes the exact shape of the object as seen in a specified direction. There are three planes for an orthographic projection:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text">Frontal plane - plane on which the front view is projected.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text">Horizontal plane - plane on which the top or bottom view is projected.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">3.</span><span class="item-text">profile plane - plane on which the end view is projected.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Once the views are projected onto the respective planes, the planes are opened out so that they lie on the same plane. This produces a number of separate two-dimensional inter-related views which represent faces that are mutually at right angles to each other. Several views of an object can therefore be shown simultaneously on a single drawing paper.</p>
                        <p>Figure 2.1 shows how views of an object are obtained by using projectors. If the planes of projection are parallel to the principal faces of the object, they form a glass box. Note that the object has three principal dimensions: width, height and depth. These are fixed terms used for dimensions in these directions regardless of the shape of the object. Since it is required to show the views of a solid or 3D object on flat sheet of paper, it is necessary to unfold the planes so that they all lie in the same plane. Since the glass box has six sides, we can have six views of the object as shown in figure 2.2.</p>

                        <p>The mental process of reading a reading a drawing in order to obtain the views is known as visualizing the views. Figure 2.3 shows the process of visualization.</p>
                         <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_09_6fb61757ca32036071cag-19-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the mental process of visualizing a 3D object from its 2D orthographic views (Front, Top, Side)." class="content-image">

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.3 Types of Orthographic Projections</h3>
                        <p>Orthographic projection uses two main principle planes of projection; the frontal plane and the vertical plane. These planes intersect to produce four quadrants or angles as shown in figure 2.4. The object to be drawn is imagine to be placed in one of these quadrants and orthographic views of it are projected onto these planes. In practice, only the first and third angles are used since views in the second and fourth quadrants may overlap.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_09_6fb61757ca32036071cag-20-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the intersection of frontal and vertical projection planes, creating four quadrants or angles (First, Second, Third, Fourth)." class="content-image">

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2.3.1 First Angle Orthographic Projection</h4>
                        <p>Figure 2.5 shows an object positioned in the First quadrant. Views of the have been drawn on the plane using projectors. The view on the frontal plane is called the elevation, that on the horizontal plane the plan and that on the profile plane the end view, end elevation or side elevation. The observer always looks through the object and to the planes of projection. To obtain the views, the horizontal and profile planes are opened out (or rabatted) about the line of intersection with the profile plane.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_09_6fb61757ca32036071cag-21-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating First Angle Orthographic Projection, showing an object in the first quadrant and how the views are projected onto and then unfolded from the planes." class="content-image">

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2.3.2 Third Angle Orthographic Projection</h4>
                        <p>This is done by positioning the object in the third quadrant and projecting the views onto the planes as shown in figure 2.6. Since the planes now come between the observer and the object, they are imagined to be transparent and the object is viewed through them. The views are the same in both systems and the only ultimate difference between the two systems is the arrangement of the views.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_09_6fb61757ca32036071cag-22-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating Third Angle Orthographic Projection, showing an object in the third quadrant and how the views are projected onto the transparent planes and then unfolded." class="content-image">

                        <p>Since two systems of projection, <span class="math-inline">$1^{\text {st }}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$3^{r d}$</span> angle are approved internationally, it is necessary to indicate on the drawing which system has been used. This is done by a symbol consisting of the an elevation and end view of a frustum of a cone. This symbols are shown in figures 2.5 and 2.6.</p>

                        <p>It may not be necessary to show all the six views to completely describe an object. Two views are sometimes enough to completely describe an object. This convention is particularly applied to symmetrical objects with less features. If a view does not shows any additional features to the first two views, it should be excluded. If only two views are necessary and the top view and right side view are equally descriptive, the combination chosen is that which spaces best on the paper.</p>

                        <p>An engineering drawing must be properly dimensioned in order to convey the designers intent to the end user. Dimensions provide the information needed to specify the size and location of every feature on the object. A properly dimensioned drawing helps ensure that the part produced in the manufacturing phase matches the part you asked for. There are a few simple guidelines to be followed when dimensioning a drawing and these guidelines cover the majority of cases you will encounter. Before we can begin to go over the rules for dimensioning, we must learn a little bit about the anatomy of a dimension. Figure 2.15 shows a dimensioned view of an object.</p>

                         <p>Most drawings are made to full size, but if the size of an object makes it impossible to draw to full size, it can be drawn in proportion, that is to a uniform scale. The ratio of reduction or enlargement often depends upon the relative sizes of the object and of the sheet of paper upon which the drawing is to be made. Scales can be classified into 5:</p>

                        <p>The scale used must be stated on the drawing as a ratio for example 1:2 which means half full size and each division on a metric scale equals 2 mm with the calibration numbering at 20-unit intervals. Drawings can also be drawn in an enlarged form for example <span class="math-inline">$2: 1$</span> which means the drawing has been drawn twice the full size. Scale multipliers and divisors of 2,5 and 10 are recommended for most commonly used scales eg.</p>

                         <p>It is important to be able to find the true length of a line in some aspects of Engineering Drawing, particularly in the development, or laying out in a plane, of sheet metals. In orthographic
                        projection, the projection of a line will only show its true length if the line is parallel to the plane on which it is projected. When a line is not parallel to one of the normal planes of projection, two methods may be used to find its true length:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Exercise</h3>
                        <p>Referring to figure 2.17, A is on the frontal plane, B is on the profile plane and C is on the horizontal plane. Find the true lengths of the lines AB and BC and the true distance AC . Also find the true inclinations of <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{AB}, \mathrm{BC}$</span> and AC to the horizontal plane. Use first angle projection.</p>

                        <p>The line may be moved until it is parallel to a principle plane, or an auxiliary plane may be used which is parallel to the plan or elevation of the line. On the plan (figure 2.18), End A of the line is held stationary and end B is revolved until the line is parallel to the vertical plane. In one view, B moves along a circle while in the other, it moves along a straight line. There are two positions of the circle depending on the direction of rotation of B.</p>
                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Triangulation Method</h3>
                        <p>To find the true length by triangulation, the plan length A'C' of the line is set off at right angles to the difference in vertical heights of the ends of the line in elevation. The hypotenuse A" <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{C}^{\prime}$</span> of the right angled triangle formed is the true length of the line</p>
