                        <p>A screw thread is a helical groove which is cut, rolled, or sometimes cast on a cylinder or cylindrical hole. The threads are parallel to each other with those on the cylinder (screw) being external, and those in the hole (nut) being internal. Tapered threads are formed on a cone or in a conical hole. The form of the groove varies with different threads depending on the use. Threads may be right- or left-handed and single or multi-start. Screw threads have three main applications:</p>

The thread run out (incompletely formed threads) are represented by thin lines at <span class="math-inline">$30^{\circ}$</span> to the major diameter. On the circular view, the major diameter appears as a complete thick circle and the minor diameter as a thin circle with a gap as shown in figure 7.7.

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>Most engineering products are composed of separate parts held together by some means of fastening. Threaded have advantage over permanent methods (riveting and welding) in that they are easily disassembled. Threaded fasteners have descriptive names with five types being the most common;</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. Bolt;</h3>
                        <p>A bolt, has an integral head on one end and a thread on the other end and is passed through clearance holes in two parts and draws them together by means of a nut screwed on the threaded end. It comes in a variety of head forms, the most common being the hexagonal head and the square head. On the sectional view, the nut and bolt are not sectioned even though the section plane passes through them. If the details being joined are of a soft material, a plain washer may be placed under the nut and sometimes under the bolt head as well to prevent damage when the nut is tightened.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. Stud;</h3>
                        <p>A stud is a rod threaded on each end. The fastener passes through a clearance hole in one part and screws into a tapped hole in the other. A nut then draws the parts together. The stud is used when through bolts are not suitable for parts that must be removed frequently such as a cylinder head. They are also used in situations where there is insufficient space on one side of the assembly for bolt heads or nuts</p>

                        <p>A cap screw passes through a clearance hole in one piece and screws into a tapped hole in the other. The head, which is an integral part of the screw draws the parts together as the screw enters the tapped hole. A hexagonal head cap screw is similar to a bolt except that it generally has a greater length of thread.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4. Machine Screw</h3>
                        <p>Is a small fastener used with a nut to function in the same way as a bolt or without a nut to function as cap screw. machine screws are used in a limited number of diameter sizes. These come in ten standardized head shapes which except for the hexagonal head, are available in slotted form or with cross recesses. The size of the recess varies with the size of the screw. The hexagonal machine screw is not made with a cross recess but may be optionally slotted.</p>
