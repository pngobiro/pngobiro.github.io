                        <p>the ellipse occurs so frequently on isometric drawings that an approximate method using circular arcs is often used to draw it. This is done by drawing an isometric square with sides equal to the diameter of the circle. The long diagonal is drawn and either B or D is joined to the midpoints of opposite sides. Where these lines cross the long diagonal are two arc centers. The other centers are corners B and D on the short diagonal. When drawing a cylinder, the centers of the other end are obtained by drawing isometric lines thru' centers <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{B}, \mathrm{D}, \mathrm{X}$</span> and Y and marking off the length L of the cylinder to obtain centers <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{B}^{\prime}, \mathrm{D}^{\prime}, \mathrm{X}^{\prime}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{Y}^{\prime}$</span>.

                         <p>Oblique projection is a method of producing a pictorial view of an object. In oblique, the projectors are parallel to each other but oblique to the projection plane as opposed to isometric projection where the projectors are parallel and normal to the projection plane. The principal face is kept parallel to the projection plane.</p>
                        <p>In oblique drawing, surfaces that are parallel to the principal face appear as true shapes while lines which are perpendicular to the principal surfaces are drawn at a receding angle, <span class="math-inline">$30^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}$</span> or <span class="math-inline">$60^{\circ}$</span>. The receding angle to be used depends on the shape of the object and location of its significant</p>

                        <p>When the receding lines are drawn with their true lengths, the object appears distorted. The degree of distortion may be decreased by decreasing the the length of receding lines. Scales of <span class="math-inline">$\frac{1}{2}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$\frac{3}{4}$</span> full size are commonly used. When the receding lines are true lengths (drawn to full scale), the oblique drawing is called a cavalier projection.</p>
