\section*{PROBLEM SOLVING}

A problem is a difficult matter, question or task that requires a solution. It is something hard to understand, accomplish or deal with.
Problem solving is the process through which people find answers, actions or courses that effectively remove or deal with a difficult situation.

\section*{PROBLEM AREAS AND CAUSES OF PROBLEMS}
1. At school- problem can result from poor academic performance, others are caused by disciplinary problems and interpersonal relationships among student and staff
2. At home- domestic violence can be a problem. Lack of basic needs e.g. food and clothing. Teenagers can become rebellious and become a problem to parents
3. Relationships-some problems arise from the way we relate with other people, these are people who are judgmental and critical and who always find fault with others some are arrogant and create problems for others and others lack courtesy.
4. The way we perceive ourselves-when we suffer from self image it leads to low self esteem and lack of confidence.
5. Financial problems- those who are poor lack basic needs like clothing, food and shelter, health and education. those with lots of money misuse their money on drugs and alcohol
6. Natural calamities like earthquake. This problem is often unexpected and causes a lot of suffering to people.
