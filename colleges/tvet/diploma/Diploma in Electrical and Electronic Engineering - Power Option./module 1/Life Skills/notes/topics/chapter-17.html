                        <p>The initial effect of alcohol makes one feel stimulated, become talkative and more active. As some continue taking more alcohol, mood and social behavior changes, some people become depressed and remorseful; others become belligerent (become abusive or violent)</p>
                        <p>Depressive drunks may slow down, stumble, loudly confess their sins and failures and slur in words.
