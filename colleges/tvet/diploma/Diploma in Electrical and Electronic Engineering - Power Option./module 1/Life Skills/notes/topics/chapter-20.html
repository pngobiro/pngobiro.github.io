                        <p>UNCRC was developed in 1989. In 1990, Kenya Government ratified the Convection of the Right of the Child being the 20th Country.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Reporting procedures of UNCRC</h3>
                        <p>Each country after signing and ratifying the UN Convection is under an obligation to report to UNCRC committee, which is charged with monitoring compliance with, and implementation of UNCRC.</p>
                        <p>A country is supposed to give a report 2 years after signing and every 5 years thereafter. The report should be a representative of all stakeholders. In case of conflicting views from civil society a supplementary report should be forwarded to the committee while resolving the conflict.</p>
                        <p>Kenya was late in sending the report in 1992, having ratified the convection in 1990. No report was forwarded after 5 years i.e. 1997 as required by UNCRC committee. Kenya sent a combined report in 1998 that is after 7 years.</p>
                        <p>A lot has been done in Kenya towards domesticating UNCRC resulting to children's Act 2002 that translates UNCRC into a legislature item in Kenya</p>
