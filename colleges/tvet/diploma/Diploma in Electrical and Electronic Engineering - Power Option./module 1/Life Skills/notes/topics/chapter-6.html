                        <p>Human beings at anyone point in life encounter challenges or experience problems. It is important for other members of the society to understand what the person is going through, demonstrate care and concern and provide support to the affected person. The facilitator is expected to expose participants to relevant scenarios that will enable them practice the skill of empathy.</p>
                        <p>Empathy is the ability to understand what the other person is experiencing and to be able to communicate this feeling in time.</p>
                        <p>The ability to understand, imagine and appreciate a challenging situation another person is going through thereby assisting him/her to come up with a solution is demonstration of empathy.</p>
                        <p>Empathy brings joy to both the giver and the receiver.</p>
                        <p>We can help people explore and cope with their feelings if we are able to see situations from their perspective.</p>
