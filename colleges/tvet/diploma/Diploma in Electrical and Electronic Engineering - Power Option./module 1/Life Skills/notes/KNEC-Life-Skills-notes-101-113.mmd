\section*{UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD (UNCRC}

UNCRC was developed in 1989. In 1990, Kenya Government ratified the Convection of the Right of the Child being the 20th Country.

\section*{Reporting procedures of UNCRC}

Each country after signing and ratifying the UN Convection is under an obligation to report to UNCRC committee, which is charged with monitoring compliance with, and implementation of UNCRC.

A country is supposed to give a report 2 years after signing and every 5 years thereafter. The report should be a representative of all stakeholders. In case of conflicting views from civil society a supplementary report should be forwarded to the committee while resolving the conflict.

Kenya was late in sending the report in 1992, having ratified the convection in 1990. No report was forwarded after 5 years i.e. 1997 as required by UNCRC committee. Kenya sent a combined report in 1998 that is after 7 years.
