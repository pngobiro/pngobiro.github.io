                        <h4>Answer</h4>
                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-1">
                            <p class="answer-intro">This question covers concepts in electrochemistry, acid-base chemistry, wave physics, and thermodynamics (gas laws).</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Electrochemistry:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Conductance of an Electrolyte (G):</strong> Conductance is the measure of how easily electric current flows through an electrolyte. It is the reciprocal of electrical resistance (R). $G = 1/R$. The SI unit is Siemens (S). For electrolytes, it depends on the concentration, type, and mobility of ions, as well as temperature.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Faraday's First Law of Electrolysis:</strong> The mass (m) of a substance deposited or liberated at any electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity (Q) passed through the electrolyte. Mathematically, $m \propto Q$, or $m = ZQ$, where Z is the electrochemical equivalent of the substance. Since $Q = It$ (current $\times$ time), $m = ZIt$.</li>
                                <li><strong>(iii) Calculation:</strong>
                                    <p>Cells are in series, so the same quantity of electricity (Q) passes through each.</p>
                                    <p>Faraday's laws imply that the mass deposited/liberated is proportional to the chemical equivalent weight (E = Molar Mass / Valency factor, n).</p>
                                    <p>$\frac{m_{Cu}}{E_{Cu}} = \frac{m_{Ag}}{E_{Ag}} = \frac{m_{I}}{E_{I}}$</p>
                                    <p>Equivalent weights (approximate atomic masses: Cu=63.5, Ag=108, I=127):</p>
                                    <p>Copper (Cu$^{2+}$ from CuSO$_4$): $n=2$, $E_{Cu} = 63.5 / 2 = 31.75$</p>
                                    <p>Silver (Ag$^{+}$ from AgNO$_3$): $n=1$, $E_{Ag} = 108 / 1 = 108$</p>
                                    <p>Iodine (I$^{-}$ from KI, liberates I$_2$): $2I^- \rightarrow I_2 + 2e^-$. The species liberated is I$_2$. The equivalent weight of Iodine element (I) is $127/1 = 127$. When I$_2$ is formed, 2 Faradays liberate 1 mole of I$_2$ (mass 2x127). So, 1 Faraday liberates 1 mole of I atoms (mass 127). Thus, $E_I = 127$.</p>
                                    <p>Given $m_{Cu} = 0.75 \, \text{g}$.</p>
                                    <p>For Silver: $\frac{0.75}{31.75} = \frac{m_{Ag}}{108} \implies m_{Ag} = \frac{0.75 \times 108}{31.75} \approx 2.55 \, \text{g}$</p>
                                    <p>For Iodine: $\frac{0.75}{31.75} = \frac{m_{I}}{127} \implies m_{I} = \frac{0.75 \times 127}{31.75} \approx 3.00 \, \text{g}$</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Acid-Base Chemistry:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Acid vs. Base:</strong>
                                    <br><strong>Acid (Arrhenius):</strong> A substance that produces hydrogen ions (H$^+$) or hydronium ions (H$_3$O$^+$) when dissolved in water. (e.g., HCl)
                                    <br><strong>Base (Arrhenius):</strong> A substance that produces hydroxide ions (OH$^-$) when dissolved in water. (e.g., NaOH)
                                    <br><strong>Acid (Brønsted-Lowry):</strong> A proton (H$^+$) donor.
                                    <br><strong>Base (Brønsted-Lowry):</strong> A proton (H$^+$) acceptor.
                                    <br><strong>Acid (Lewis):</strong> An electron pair acceptor.
                                    <br><strong>Base (Lewis):</strong> An electron pair donor.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Nature of Na$_2$HPO$_4$ Solution:</strong>
                                    <p>Na$_2$HPO$_4$ (Disodium hydrogen phosphate) dissolves to give Na$^+$ ions and HPO$_4^{2-}$ ions.</p>
                                    <p>The HPO$_4^{2-}$ ion is amphiprotic, meaning it can act as both an acid (donating H$^+$) and a base (accepting H$^+$):</p>
                                    <p>As acid: HPO$_4^{2-} \rightleftharpoons$ H$^+$ + PO$_4^{3-}$ (Associated pK$_a$ is pK$_{a3}$ = 12.7)</p>
                                    <p>As base: HPO$_4^{2-}$ + H$^+$ $\rightleftharpoons$ H$_2$PO$_4^{-}$ (Associated pK$_a$ is pK$_{a2}$ = 7.20)</p>
                                    <p>To determine the nature of the solution, we compare the strength of HPO$_4^{2-}$ as an acid (K$_{a3}$) and as a base (K$_b$).</p>
                                    <p>K$_{a3} = 10^{-12.7}$</p>
                                    <p>The K$_b$ for HPO$_4^{2-}$ corresponds to the reaction HPO$_4^{2-} + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_2PO_4^- + OH^-$. This K$_b$ is related to the K$_a$ of its conjugate acid (H$_2$PO$_4^-$), which is K$_{a2}$.</p>
                                    <p>$K_b = K_w / K_{a2} = 10^{-14} / 10^{-7.20} = 10^{-6.8}$</p>
                                    <p>Comparing K$_{a3}$ ($10^{-12.7}$) and K$_b$ ($10^{-6.8}$), we see that K$_b$ > K$_{a3}$.</p>
                                    <p>Therefore, the hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO$_4^{2-}$) is a stronger base than it is an acid. The solution will be **basic (alkaline)**.</p>
                                    <p>Alternatively, the pH of an amphiprotic salt solution is approximately pH $\approx (\text{pK}_{a,acid} + \text{pK}_{a,base})/2$. Here, the relevant pK values are pK$_{a2}$ and pK$_{a3}$. pH $\approx (7.20 + 12.7) / 2 = 19.9 / 2 = 9.95$. Since pH > 7, the solution is basic.</p>
                                    <p class="key-point">The question mentions pK values 2.15, 7.20, 12.7 corresponding to pK$_{a1}$, pK$_{a2}$, pK$_{a3}$. These are the acidity constants for H$_3$PO$_4$, H$_2$PO$_4^-$, and HPO$_4^{2-}$ respectively.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Wave Physics and Gas Laws:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Longitudinal vs. Transverse Waves:</strong>
                                    <br><strong>Longitudinal Waves:</strong> The particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the direction of wave propagation. They consist of compressions and rarefactions. Example: Sound waves in air.
                                    <br><strong>Transverse Waves:</strong> The particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. They consist of crests and troughs. Example: Light waves, waves on a string.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Single-Slit Diffraction:</strong>
                                    <p>When light waves pass through a narrow slit (width comparable to the wavelength), they spread out (diffract). If this diffracted light falls on a screen, an interference pattern is observed.</p>
                                    <p>Description: A central bright fringe (maximum intensity) is observed directly opposite the slit. On either side of the central maximum, there are alternating dark fringes (minima) and progressively weaker bright fringes (secondary maxima). The central maximum is wider and much brighter than the secondary maxima.</p>
                                    <p>Cause: According to Huygens' principle, every point on the wavefront within the slit acts as a source of secondary wavelets. These wavelets interfere constructively and destructively in different directions, creating the observed pattern.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Equilibrium and Framework Analysis:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Conditions for Equilibrium (Coplanar Forces):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>The vector sum of all forces acting on the body must be zero. This implies the sum of horizontal components is zero ($\sum F_x = 0$) and the sum of vertical components is zero ($\sum F_y = 0$).</li>

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Framework Analysis (Figure 1):</strong>
                                    <p>Assumptions: Framework is rigid, pivot is frictionless, members are weightless unless specified, forces act at joints.</p>
                                    <p>Let the pivot point be O. Let the length of one side of the equilateral triangle be L. The angles in equilateral triangles are 60°.</p>
                                    <p>The 20 kN force acts vertically downwards at a horizontal distance of L from O.</p>
                                    <p>The force P acts vertically downwards at a horizontal distance of 2L from O.</p>
                                    <p>The reaction force R at the pivot O has horizontal ($R_x$) and vertical ($R_y$) components.</p>
                                    <p>For equilibrium, apply the conditions:</p>
                                    <p>1. $\sum F_x = 0$: There are no external horizontal forces shown other than possibly $R_x$. Therefore, $R_x = 0$.</p>
                                    <p>2. $\sum F_y = 0$: $R_y - 20 \, \text{kN} - P = 0 \implies R_y = 20 + P$</p>
                                    <p>3. $\sum M_O = 0$: Take moments about the pivot O. Clockwise moments are positive.</p>
                                    <p>Moment due to 20 kN force = $20 \times L$ (Clockwise)</p>
                                    <p>Moment due to force P = $P \times (2L)$ (Clockwise)</p>
                                    <p>The question seems incomplete as there are no counter-balancing forces or moments shown to achieve equilibrium unless P is an upward force or there's another force missing. Let's re-examine the diagram. FIG 1 shows the 20kN force acting 1 triangle length horizontally from the pivot. P acts 2 triangle lengths horizontally from the pivot. R is the reaction at the pivot. There's a 10kN force acting horizontally to the right at the top joint (height $\sqrt{3}/2 L$).</p>
                                    <p>Revised Equilibrium Conditions:</p>
                                    <p>1. $\sum F_x = 0$: $R_x + 10 = 0 \implies R_x = -10 \, \text{kN}$ (Acts to the left)</p>
                                    <p>2. $\sum F_y = 0$: $R_y - 20 - P = 0 \implies R_y = 20 + P$</p>
                                    <p>3. $\sum M_O = 0$: (Clockwise positive)</p>
                                    <p>Moment from 20 kN = $20 \times L$</p>
                                    <p>Moment from P = $P \times (2L)$</p>
                                    <p>Moment from 10 kN = $10 \times (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}L)$ (Anticlockwise, so negative)</p>
                                    <p>$\sum M_O = 20L + 2PL - 10(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}L) = 0$</p>
                                    <p>Assuming L is non-zero, divide by L:</p>
                                    <p>$20 + 2P - 5\sqrt{3} = 0$</p>
                                    <p>$2P = 5\sqrt{3} - 20$</p>
                                    <p>$2P \approx 8.66 - 20 = -11.34$</p>
                                    <p>$P \approx -5.67 \, \text{kN}$</p>
                                    <p>The negative sign indicates that the force P required for equilibrium must act **upwards**, contrary to the arrow shown in the diagram. If the diagram is taken literally with P acting down, the system is not in equilibrium under these forces. Assuming the question requires finding the downward P that *would* cause a specific reaction, or if P's direction is actually upward despite the arrow, let's assume P is the magnitude and the direction shown is correct but leads to non-equilibrium or P must be upward.</p>
                                    <p class="key-point">Re-interpreting: Maybe P is a force needed to *lift* the bridge section against the 20kN load and the 10kN horizontal force. If P is the applied lifting force (upward), then:</p>
                                    <p>$\sum F_y = R_y - 20 + P = 0 \implies R_y = 20 - P$</p>
                                    <p>$\sum M_O = 20L - P(2L) - 10(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}L) = 0$</p>
                                    <p>$20 - 2P - 5\sqrt{3} = 0$</p>
                                    <p>$2P = 20 - 5\sqrt{3} \approx 20 - 8.66 = 11.34$</p>
                                    <p>$P \approx 5.67 \, \text{kN}$ (Upward lifting force)</p>
                                    <p>Let's proceed assuming P = 5.67 kN upwards is the intended meaning.</p>
                                    <p>Reaction R: $R_x = -10 \, \text{kN}$ (to the left)</p>
                                    <p>$R_y = 20 - P = 20 - 5.67 = 14.33 \, \text{kN}$ (upwards)</p>
                                    <p>Magnitude of R: $|R| = \sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2} = \sqrt{(-10)^2 + (14.33)^2} = \sqrt{100 + 205.35} = \sqrt{305.35} \approx 17.47 \, \text{kN}$</p>
                                    <p>Direction of R: Angle $\alpha$ with the negative x-axis (or horizontal left): $\tan \alpha = \frac{|R_y|}{|R_x|} = \frac{14.33}{10} = 1.433$</p>
                                    <p>$\alpha = \arctan(1.433) \approx 55.1^{\circ}$ above the horizontal to the left.</p>

                            <p><strong>(b) Simple Pendulum:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Showing SHM for Small Oscillations:</strong>
                                    <p>A simple pendulum consists of a point mass (bob) 'm' suspended by a massless, inextensible string of length 'L' from a fixed support.</p>
                                    <p>When displaced by an angle $\theta$ from the vertical, the forces acting on the bob are tension (T) along the string and gravity (mg) vertically downwards.</p>
                                    <p>Resolve gravity into components: $mg \cos\theta$ along the string (balances tension for small angles) and $mg \sin\theta$ perpendicular to the string, acting towards the equilibrium position (restoring force).</p>
                                    <p>Restoring Force, $F_{restore} = -mg \sin\theta$ (negative sign indicates it opposes displacement).</p>
                                    <p>According to Newton's second law, $F = ma$. The acceleration 'a' is tangential.</p>
                                    <p>$ma = -mg \sin\theta$</p>
                                    <p>$a = -g \sin\theta$</p>
                                    <p>For Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), the acceleration must be directly proportional to the displacement and directed towards the equilibrium position ($a \propto -x$).</p>
                                    <p>The displacement along the arc is $x = L\theta$.</p>
                                    <p>For **small angles** $\theta$ (in radians), $\sin\theta \approx \theta$.</p>
                                    <p>Substituting this approximation: $a \approx -g \theta$</p>
                                    <p>Since $x = L\theta$, then $\theta = x/L$.</p>
                                    <p>$a \approx -g (x/L) = -(g/L)x$</p>
                                    <p>This equation is in the form $a = -\omega^2 x$, where $\omega^2 = g/L$. Since acceleration 'a' is proportional to the negative of the displacement 'x', the motion is Simple Harmonic for small oscillations.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Period of Oscillation (T):</strong>
                                    <p>From the SHM equation $a = -\omega^2 x$, we identified the angular frequency $\omega = \sqrt{g/L}$.</p>
                                    <p>The period of oscillation T is related to the angular frequency by $T = 2\pi / \omega$.</p>
                                    <p>Substituting the value of $\omega$:</p>
                                    <p>$T = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{g/L}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$</p>
                                    <p>This is the expression for the period of a simple pendulum for small oscillations.</p>
                                </li>

                                            Work done by gravity = $(m_1 + m_2) g \times d$
                                            Change in KE = Work done by non-conservative forces + Work done by gravity

                                            Alternatively: Energy Input = Energy Output
                                            Initial KE + Work done by Gravity = Work done against Resistance
                                            $\frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)V^2 + (m_1+m_2)g d = R d$

                                            $750 \times 43.60 + 14715 d = 700000 d$

                                            $32700 = 685285 d$
                                            $d = \frac{32700}{685285} \approx 0.0477 \, \text{m} = 47.7 \, \text{mm}$

                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-3">
                            <p class="answer-intro">This question focuses on workshop safety specific to sheet metal work and the practical procedures for forming and joining sheet metal, including development.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Sheet Metal Safety Precautions:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Handle Edges Carefully:</strong> Sheet metal edges, especially after cutting, are extremely sharp. Always wear appropriate cut-resistant gloves when handling sheets or components. Deburr sharp edges where possible.</li>
                                <li><strong>Use Tools Correctly:</strong> Use snips, shears, and bending machines correctly. Keep fingers clear of cutting blades and bending brakes. Ensure machine guards are in place. Use mallets (wood/plastic) rather than steel hammers for shaping to avoid damaging the metal surface or causing excessive noise/vibration.</li>
                                <li><strong>Secure Workpiece:</strong> When cutting, drilling, or punching, ensure the sheet metal is securely clamped or held to prevent slipping, which can cause injury or damage the workpiece.</li>
                                <li><strong>Wear Eye Protection:</strong> Always wear safety glasses or a face shield to protect eyes from flying metal chips or particles, especially during cutting, drilling, or grinding operations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Maintain Good Housekeeping:</strong> Keep the work area clean of scrap metal pieces, which can cause cuts or tripping hazards. Dispose of scrap properly.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Procedure for Making a Wired Edge:</strong></p>
                            <p>A wired edge is used to strengthen and stiffen the edge of a sheet metal component (like the top rim of the cylinder in Fig 2) and provide a smooth, safe finish.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Marking and Folding:</strong> Mark a line parallel to the edge where the wire will be placed. The distance from the edge should be approximately 2.5 times the diameter of the wire to be used, plus a small allowance. Fold this edge allowance up using a folding bar or brake, typically to 90 degrees initially.</li>
                                <li><strong>Placing the Wire:</strong> Cut a piece of suitable gauge wire (e.g., galvanized steel wire) to the required length (circumference for a cylinder). Place the wire snugly into the fold created in step 1.</li>
                                <li><strong>Closing the Edge (Tucking):</strong> Using a mallet and appropriate stakes (like a hatchet stake or bick iron), carefully hammer the folded edge down over the wire, starting from one end and working along the length. Ensure the metal is tucked tightly around the wire.</li>
                                <li><strong>Finishing:</strong> Continue hammering gently to fully enclose the wire and create a smooth, rounded, reinforced edge. Check for uniformity and tightness.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>(c) Making the Cylinder (Figure 2):</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>(i) Procedure:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Development and Marking Out:</strong> Calculate the required dimensions for the main body (rectangle) and the circular base. The rectangle's length is the circumference ($\pi \times \text{Diameter}$) plus an allowance for the lap joint (seam B). The rectangle's height is the cylinder height plus allowances for the wired top edge and the bottom joint (e.g., knocked-up or paned-down seam allowance). Mark these shapes onto the sheet metal.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Cut out the rectangular body and the circular base using snips or shears.</li>
                                <li><strong>Forming the Cylinder Body:</strong> Roll the rectangular piece into a cylindrical shape using bending rolls (slip rolls). Ensure the edges for the lap joint overlap correctly.</li>
                                <li><strong>Making the Lap Joint (Seam B):</strong> Clean the overlapping edges thoroughly. Apply flux. Using a soldering iron or torch, heat the joint and apply solder to create a strong, sealed seam. Wipe off excess flux.</li>
                                <li><strong>Preparing the Top Edge:</strong> Create the wired edge along the top rim as described in part (b).</li>
                                <li><strong>Forming the Bottom Joint:</strong> Prepare the bottom edge of the cylinder body and the edge of the circular base for the chosen type of seam (e.g., flanging the cylinder edge inwards and the base edge outwards slightly for a knocked-up seam).</li>
                                <li><strong>Assembling the Bottom:</strong> Fit the base onto the cylinder body. Using stakes and a mallet, form the bottom seam (e.g., knock up the flanges together). This joint might also be soldered for water-tightness if required.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cleaning and Finishing:</strong> Clean the entire cylinder, removing any flux residue, burrs, or marks.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><strong>(ii) Development Sketch:</strong></p>
                            <p>The development is the flat pattern that can be cut and folded to make the object.</p>

Constructing objects like cylinders involves developing the flat pattern, cutting, forming, and joining using techniques like soldering and seaming.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Three Types of Radiations:</strong> Commonly emitted from radioactive decay:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Alpha ($\alpha$) radiation: Consists of alpha particles (Helium nuclei, $^4_2$He).</li>
                                        <li>Beta ($\beta$) radiation: Consists of beta particles (high-energy electrons, $e^-$ or $\beta^-$, or positrons, $e^+$ or $\beta^+$).</li>
                                        <li>Gamma ($\gamma$) radiation: Consists of high-energy photons (electromagnetic radiation).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Identification of Radiations:</strong> Radiations can be identified and distinguished based on their properties, particularly their behavior in electric and magnetic fields, and their penetrating power:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Electric/Magnetic Fields:</strong> Alpha particles (positive charge) are deflected in one direction, Beta particles (negative charge, usually) are deflected more strongly in the opposite direction, and Gamma rays (no charge) are undeflected.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Penetrating Power:</strong> Alpha particles are least penetrating (stopped by paper or a few cm of air). Beta particles are more penetrating (stopped by a few mm of aluminum). Gamma rays are most penetrating (require thick lead or concrete for significant attenuation).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Ionizing Power:</strong> Alpha particles cause intense ionization over a short range. Beta particles cause less intense ionization over a longer range. Gamma rays cause the least intense ionization but penetrate furthest.</li>
                                    </ul>
