                            <p class="answer-intro">This question deals with the principles and practices of marking out, using vernier calipers, and riveting.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Marking Out Objectives and Datum:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Objectives of Marking Out (Three):</strong> (Similar to July 2016 Q2b)
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>To transfer dimensions and shapes accurately from a drawing onto the workpiece surface.</li>
                                        <li>To provide clear guidelines for subsequent machining or fabrication operations (cutting, drilling, bending).</li>
                                        <li>To ensure the finished part conforms to the required size and shape specifications.</li>
                                        <li>To help position the workpiece correctly for machining.</li>
                                        <li>To minimize material wastage by accurate layout.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Datum Explained:</strong> In marking out and dimensioning, a datum is a theoretically exact reference point, line, plane, or surface from which measurements are taken and dimensions are established. It serves as the origin or base for locating other features accurately and consistently. Using datums ensures that measurement errors are not cumulative and that features are correctly positioned relative to each other or to a key reference surface. Examples: A machined flat edge, a centre line, the corner of a block.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><strong>(i) Factors Determining Choice of Rivet (Four):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Materials Being Joined:</strong> Rivet material should be compatible (similar electrochemical potential to avoid galvanic corrosion) and strong enough for the base materials.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Strength Requirements:</strong> The required shear and tensile strength of the joint dictates the rivet material (e.g., steel, aluminium alloy), diameter, and number of rivets.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Type of Loading:</strong> Whether the joint is primarily in shear or tension influences rivet selection and joint design.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Head Style:</strong> Choice depends on application requirements (e.g., snap head for general use, countersunk for flush finish, pan head for higher strength).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Whether both sides of the joint are accessible (for solid rivets) or only one side (requiring blind rivets like pop rivets).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Corrosion Environment:</strong> Rivet material must resist corrosion in the service environment.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cost and Appearance.</strong></li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Procedure for Riveting a Lap Joint:</strong> A lap joint involves overlapping the two plates to be joined.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Overlap the plates by the required amount. Mark the positions for the rivet holes. Drill or punch holes through both plates simultaneously or separately but ensuring alignment. Deburr the holes.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Rivet Insertion:</strong> Insert the correct type and size of rivet through the aligned holes.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Support:</strong> Place the pre-formed head of the rivet on a suitable support (dolly or rivet set).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Upsetting:</strong> Form the second head on the tail end of the rivet using appropriate tools (hammer and snap for solid rivets, riveting gun for specific types, pop rivet tool for blind rivets). Ensure the rivet swells to fill the hole and clamps the plates tightly together.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> Check the formed head for correct shape and size, and ensure the joint is tight.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                                        <li><strong>Secure Workpiece:</strong> Always clamp the workpiece securely to the drill table using vices, clamps, or fixtures. Never hold small workpieces by hand.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Wear Eye Protection:</strong> Always wear safety glasses or a face shield to protect eyes from flying chips (swarf).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Clothing and Hair:</strong> Avoid loose clothing, gloves, ties, or jewelry that could get caught in the rotating spindle or drill bit. Tie back long hair.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Correct Speed and Feed:</strong> Use the appropriate drilling speed and feed rate for the material being drilled and the drill bit size.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Remove Chuck Key:</strong> Always remove the chuck key immediately after tightening or loosening the chuck.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Chip Removal:</strong> Stop the machine before clearing chips from the hole or table; use a brush, not hands.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Keep Hands Clear:</strong> Keep hands away from the rotating spindle and cutting tool during operation.</li>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question involves constructing orthographic views (Plan, End Elevation) and the surface development for a truncated cylinder, given its front elevation.</p>
                             <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>Draw Given Elevation:</strong> Accurately copy the Front Elevation from Figure 3, showing the cylinder diameter, height, and the oblique cutting plane.</li>
                                 <li><strong>(b) Construct Plan View:</strong>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Project the diameter downwards to draw the circular base in the Plan, centered below the Elevation.</li>
                                         <li>Divide the base circle (Plan) into 12 equal segments (0-11). Project these points up to the base line in the Elevation.</li>
                                         <li>Draw vertical element lines from these base points up the cylinder surface in the Elevation, intersecting the cutting plane. Mark intersection points (0'-11').</li>
                                         <li>Project points 0'-11' vertically down to the corresponding radial lines (0-11) in the Plan.</li>
                                         <li>Draw a smooth ellipse through these points in the Plan, representing the top cut surface.</li>

                                          <li>Project heights horizontally from the Front Elevation.</li>
                                          <li>Project widths (depths) from the Plan using 45° projection or measurement. The width is the cylinder diameter.</li>
                                          <li>Draw the rectangular outline of the cylinder in the End Elevation.</li>
                                          <li>Project the intersection points 0'-11' from both Front Elevation (heights) and Plan (depths) to plot the elliptical curve of the cut surface in the End Elevation.</li>

                                          <li>Draw a baseline equal to the cylinder circumference ($\pi \times D$). Divide into 12 equal segments.</li>
                                          <li>Draw vertical lines (element lines) at each division point.</li>
                                          <li>Transfer the true height of each generator (from base to cut plane) from the Front Elevation to the corresponding element line on the development.</li>
                                          <li>Draw a smooth curve connecting the top points. The resulting shape is the development of the lateral surface.</li>
