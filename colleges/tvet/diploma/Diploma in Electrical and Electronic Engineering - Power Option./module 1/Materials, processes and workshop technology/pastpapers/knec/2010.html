                                    <p class="key-point">Note: If the condensed water also cooled to 80°C, the energy released would be $m_s L_v + m_s c_w (100-80)$, leading to a smaller mass of steam required. Using $c_w = 4200 \, J/kgK$, $Q_{steam} = m_s (2260000 + 4200 \times 20) = m_s (2344000)$. Then $m_s = 60000 / 2344000 \approx 0.0256$ kg or 25.6 g. The simpler assumption is usually expected unless stated otherwise.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum:</strong></p>
                            <p>In the absence of external forces, the total linear momentum of a closed system remains constant. In simpler terms, for a collision occurring between object 1 and object 2 in an isolated system, the total momentum of the two objects before the collision is equal to the total momentum of the two objects after the collision.</p>
                            <p>Mathematically: $m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2$ (for separate final velocities) or $m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = (m_1 + m_2) V$ (if they move together after impact).</p>

                                <li class="step"><strong>Ensure Safety:</strong> Before approaching the victim, ensure the power source is turned off or the victim is safely separated from the live conductor using a non-conductive object (e.g., dry wood, rubber). Do not touch the victim directly if they are still in contact with the source.</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Check Responsiveness and Breathing:</strong> Tap the victim and shout to check for response. Look, listen, and feel for normal breathing for no more than 10 seconds. If unresponsive and not breathing normally, call for emergency medical help immediately (or ask someone else to).</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Position the Victim:</strong> Lay the victim flat on their back on a firm surface.</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Open the Airway:</strong> Use the head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver. Place one hand on the forehead and push down gently while lifting the chin upward with the fingers of the other hand. This lifts the tongue away from the back of the throat.</li>

                            <p>Electroplating is a process that uses electric current to reduce dissolved metal cations so that they form a thin coherent metal coating on an electrode (the object to be plated, which acts as the cathode). It is used for corrosion protection, improving appearance, increasing hardness, or enhancing conductivity.</p>
                            <p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The object to be plated (cathode) and an electrode made of the plating metal (anode) are immersed in an electrolyte solution containing ions of the plating metal.</li>
                                <li>A DC power source is connected, with the negative terminal to the object (cathode) and the positive terminal to the anode.</li>
                                <li>Current flows through the solution. Metal ions from the electrolyte are attracted to the cathode, gain electrons (reduction), and deposit onto the object's surface.</li>

                            <p><strong>(ii) Seam Welding:</strong></p>
                            <p>Seam welding is a variation of resistance spot welding used to create a continuous, leak-tight weld seam between two overlapping pieces of sheet metal. Instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes are used.</p>
                            <p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Two overlapping metal sheets are passed between two rotating wheel electrodes.</li>
                                <li>Pressure is applied through the wheels to hold the sheets together.</li>
                                <li>Electric current is passed through the wheels and the workpiece. Heat is generated at the interface between the sheets due to resistance ($I^2R$).</li>
                                <li>The current is often pulsed. Each pulse creates a small spot weld (nugget). As the wheels rotate and the workpiece moves, these spots overlap, forming a continuous seam.</li>
                                <li>The speed of the wheels and the timing of the current pulses determine the overlap and the quality of the seam.</li>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question covers the theory of pure torsion in circular shafts and its application in calculating stress and power transmission.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) (i) Assumptions in the Theory of Pure Torsion:</strong></p>
                            <p>The derivation of the torsion formula relies on the following assumptions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The material of the shaft is homogeneous and isotropic (uniform properties in all directions).</li>
                                <li>The shaft is initially straight and has a uniform circular cross-section.</li>
                                <li>The shaft is subjected to pure torsion, meaning the applied torque is constant along the shaft's length, and there are no axial or bending loads.</li>
                                <li>Cross-sections remain plane and circular after twisting (they do not warp).</li>
                                <li>Radial lines remain straight after twisting (they rotate but do not curve).</li>
                                <li>The twist along the shaft is uniform.</li>
                                <li>Stresses induced are within the elastic limit of the material (Hooke's Law applies to shear).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(a) (ii) Shear Stress Proportionality to Radius:</strong></p>
                            <p>Consider a circular shaft of radius R subjected to a torque T, causing an angle of twist $\theta$ over a length L. Let G be the modulus of rigidity.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>From the assumption that radial lines remain straight, the shear strain ($\gamma$) at any radius $r$ (where $r \le R$) is proportional to the radius.</li>
                                <li>Consider a point P on the surface (radius R) rotating through an angle $\phi$. A point Q at radius $r$ rotates through the same angle $\phi$.</li>
                                <li>The arc length moved by P is $R\phi$. The arc length moved by Q is $r\phi$.</li>
                                <li>The shear strain at the surface is $\gamma_{max} = \frac{\text{Arc length}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{R\theta}{L}$ (where $\theta$ is the angle of twist in radians over length L).</li>
                                <li>Similarly, the shear strain at radius $r$ is $\gamma = \frac{r\theta}{L}$.</li>
                                <li>From the ratio of strains: $\frac{\gamma}{\gamma_{max}} = \frac{r\theta/L}{R\theta/L} = \frac{r}{R}$. So, $\gamma = \gamma_{max} \frac{r}{R}$.</li>
                                <li>Within the elastic limit, shear stress ($\tau$) is proportional to shear strain ($\gamma$) according to Hooke's Law for shear: $\tau = G\gamma$.</li>
                                <li>Therefore, the shear stress at radius $r$ is $\tau = G\gamma = G (\gamma_{max} \frac{r}{R})$.</li>
                                <li>Let the maximum shear stress at the surface (radius R) be $\tau_{max} = G\gamma_{max}$.</li>
                                <li>Substituting, $\tau = \tau_{max} \frac{r}{R}$.</li>
                                <li>Since $\tau_{max}$ and R are constants for a given torque and shaft, this shows that the shear stress $\tau$ at any point is directly proportional to its radial distance $r$ from the center of the shaft ($\tau \propto r$).</li>
                            </ol>

                             <p class="answer-intro">This question covers concepts in nuclear physics (fission, fusion, isotopes), power generation comparison, and calorimetry involving phase changes.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Nuclear Fission vs. Fusion:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Nuclear Fission:</strong> The process where the nucleus of a heavy atom (like Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239) is split into two or more smaller nuclei, often triggered by neutron bombardment. This process releases a significant amount of energy, additional neutrons (which can cause a chain reaction), and radioactive byproducts. It is the principle behind current nuclear power reactors and atomic bombs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Nuclear Fusion:</strong> The process where two or more light atomic nuclei (like isotopes of hydrogen - deuterium and tritium) combine to form a heavier nucleus (like helium). This process releases even larger amounts of energy per unit mass than fission and produces fewer long-lived radioactive wastes. It is the energy source of stars (including the Sun) and is the basis for hydrogen bombs and ongoing research for fusion power reactors. Fusion requires extremely high temperatures and pressures to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between nuclei.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Isotope Definition and Examples:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Isotope:</strong> Isotopes are atoms of the same chemical element that have the same number of protons (same atomic number, Z) but different numbers of neutrons (different mass number, A). Since they have the same number of electrons (equal to protons in a neutral atom), they have nearly identical chemical properties but differ in mass and nuclear stability (some isotopes may be radioactive).</li>
                                <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Hydrogen Isotopes:</strong> Protium ($^1$H, 1 proton, 0 neutrons), Deuterium ($^2$H or D, 1 proton, 1 neutron), Tritium ($^3$H or T, 1 proton, 2 neutrons - radioactive).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Carbon Isotopes:</strong> Carbon-12 ($^{12}$C, 6 protons, 6 neutrons - stable), Carbon-13 ($^{13}$C, 6 protons, 7 neutrons - stable), Carbon-14 ($^{14}$C, 6 protons, 8 neutrons - radioactive, used in carbon dating).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Uranium Isotopes:</strong> Uranium-235 ($^{235}$U, 92 protons, 143 neutrons - fissile), Uranium-238 ($^{238}$U, 92 protons, 146 neutrons - fertile, more abundant).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Merits and Demerits of Nuclear Power Generation:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Merits:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Nuclear reactors do not directly emit CO2 or other greenhouse gases during operation, making it a clean energy source in terms of climate change mitigation.</li>
                                        <li><strong>High Power Output & Density:</strong> A small amount of nuclear fuel produces a vast amount of energy, leading to high power output from relatively small plants compared to some renewables. High capacity factor (runs most of the time).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Reliable Baseload Power:</strong> Nuclear power plants can operate continuously for long periods (1-2 years between refueling), providing a stable and reliable source of baseload electricity, unlike intermittent renewables like solar or wind.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Fuel Availability:</strong> Uranium reserves are geographically diverse and estimated to last for many decades, potentially centuries with breeder reactors or thorium cycles.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Demerits:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Radioactive Waste:</strong> Produces long-lived, highly radioactive waste that requires secure, long-term storage and disposal, posing environmental and security challenges.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Accident Risk & Safety Concerns:</strong> Although rare, severe accidents (e.g., Chernobyl, Fukushima) can have catastrophic environmental and health consequences. Requires stringent safety protocols and high security.</li>
                                        <li><strong>High Initial Cost & Long Construction Time:</strong> Building nuclear power plants is extremely expensive and takes many years, involving complex engineering and regulatory hurdles.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Nuclear Proliferation Risk:</strong> The technology and materials used in nuclear power (especially fuel enrichment and reprocessing) can potentially be diverted for weapons production.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Public Perception:</strong> Negative public perception, often fueled by safety concerns and waste issues, can hinder development.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                            <p class="key-point">Let's recheck the algebra:</p>

                            <p>The maximum current a cable can safely carry continuously without exceeding its temperature rating is affected by:</p>
                            <ul>

                                <li><strong>Insulation Type and Temperature Rating:</strong> Insulation materials have maximum operating temperatures. Higher-rated insulation allows the conductor to get hotter, thus potentially carrying more current.</li>
                                <li><strong>Ambient Temperature:</strong> Higher surrounding temperatures reduce the cable's ability to dissipate heat, lowering its current carrying capacity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Installation Method (Grouping, Enclosure):</strong> Cables bundled together or installed in conduit or enclosed spaces dissipate heat less effectively than single cables in free air, reducing their capacity (derating factors apply). Burial depth and soil thermal resistivity also affect underground cables.</li>
                                <!-- <li><strong>Number of Current-Carrying Conductors:</strong> In multi-core cables or conduits, mutual heating reduces the capacity per conductor.</li> -->

                            <p><strong>(b) Precautions Against Being Struck by Lightning:</strong></p>
                            <p>During a thunderstorm:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Seek Substantial Shelter Immediately:</strong> Get inside a large, enclosed building (house, office, shop) or a hard-top vehicle with windows closed. Avoid small sheds, open garages, covered porches, tents, or picnic shelters.</li>
                                <li><strong>Avoid High Ground and Isolated Objects:</strong> Do not be the tallest object in an open area. Stay away from isolated tall trees, poles, or towers. Avoid hilltops and open fields.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stay Away from Water:</strong> Exit pools, lakes, and beaches immediately. Do not take a bath or shower. Avoid handling plumbing or faucets.</li>
                                <li><strong>Avoid Conductive Materials and Structures:</strong> Stay away from metal fences, clotheslines, power lines, metal pipes, and machinery. Avoid contact with electrical appliances, corded phones, and computers during the storm.</li>
                                <li><strong>If Caught Outdoors (Last Resort):</strong> If shelter is impossible, crouch down low in a ball-like position with feet together, head tucked, and hands over ears. Minimize contact with the ground. Do not lie flat.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Properties of Engineering Materials:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Hardness:</strong> A material's resistance to scratching, abrasion, indentation, or penetration. Hard materials (like diamond, tool steel) resist surface wear and deformation, while soft materials (like lead, copper) are easily scratched or indented.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Resistivity (Electrical Resistivity, $\rho$):</strong> An intrinsic property of a material that quantifies how strongly it opposes the flow of electric current. It is the resistance of a unit length of the material with a unit cross-sectional area. Low resistivity indicates a good conductor.
                                    <br><strong>SI Unit:</strong> Ohm-meter ($\Omega \cdot \text{m}$).</li>
                                <li><strong>(iii) Electrical Conductivity ($\sigma$):</strong> The reciprocal of resistivity ($\sigma = 1/\rho$). It measures how easily electric current can flow through a material. High conductivity indicates a good conductor.
                                    <br><strong>SI Unit:</strong> Siemens per meter (S/m).</li>

                            <p><strong>(d) Rightward Welding Technique:</strong></p>
                            <p>Also known as backhand welding, this is an oxy-acetylene welding technique primarily used for welding steel plates thicker than about 5 mm.</p>
                            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The welding torch is held in the right hand (for a right-handed welder) and the filler rod in the left.</li>
                                <li>Welding progresses from left to right along the joint.</li>
                                <li>The torch flame is pointed backward (to the right), towards the completed weld bead. The filler rod is held between the flame and the finished weld.</li>
                                <li>The flame preheats the joint ahead of the molten pool and also protects the solidifying weld metal behind the pool from oxidation.</li>
                                <li>The angle of the torch and filler rod to the workpiece is typically around 30-40° and 40-50° respectively.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Better Penetration and Fusion:</strong> Suitable for thicker materials due to more concentrated heat and slower cooling.</li>
                                <li><strong>Improved Weld Quality:</strong> The flame protects the cooling weld, potentially reducing oxidation and porosity. Often results in a neater appearance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Economical for Thicker Plates:</strong> Can be faster than leftward technique on thicker materials as larger filler rods can be used, and often requires a smaller V-preparation (e.g., 60° included angle compared to 80-90° for leftward).</li>
                                <!-- <li><strong>Less Distortion:</strong> Sometimes cited as causing less distortion on thicker plates.</li> -->

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question requires geometric constructions: drawing an ellipse using the rectangular method and constructing a triangle with specific properties, followed by inscribing a circle.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Ellipse Construction (Rectangular Method):</strong></p>
                            <p>This method, also known as the 'trammel' or 'bounding box' method, involves constructing a rectangle around the ellipse and dividing it into sections to plot points on the ellipse curve.</p>
                            <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Draw the major axis (length 110 mm) and minor axis (length 70 mm) perpendicular to each other and bisecting each other at the center O.</li>
                                <li>Construct a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the axes and pass through the ends of the major and minor axes. The rectangle dimensions will be 110 mm x 70 mm.</li>
                                <li>Divide the semi-major axis (OA = 55 mm) into a number of equal parts (e.g., 4 or 5 parts). Label points 1, 2, 3, 4 from O towards A.</li>
                                <li>Divide the vertical side of the rectangle adjacent to OA (AE = 35 mm) into the same number of equal parts. Label points 1', 2', 3', 4' from E towards A.</li>
                                <li>Draw lines from the top end of the minor axis (B) to points 1, 2, 3, 4 on the semi-major axis OA.</li>
                                <li>Draw lines from the bottom end of the minor axis (B') through points 1', 2', 3', 4' on the vertical side AE, extending them to intersect the corresponding lines drawn in step 5 (line from B to 1 intersects line from B' through 1', etc.).</li>
                                <li>The points of intersection lie on the ellipse.</li>
                                <li>Repeat this process for the other three quadrants of the rectangle.</li>
                                <li>Draw a smooth curve connecting all the plotted points, including the ends of the major and minor axes, to form the ellipse.</li>

                            <p><strong>(b) Triangle Construction and Inscribed Circle:</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>(i) Constructing the Triangle:</strong></p>
                            <p>Given: Perimeter = 180 mm. Side ratio = 3:5:7.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Calculate side lengths:</strong> Total ratio parts = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.
                                    Length per part = Perimeter / Total parts = 180 mm / 15 = 12 mm.
                                    Side lengths:
                                    Side 1 (a) = 3 parts * 12 mm/part = 36 mm
                                    Side 2 (b) = 5 parts * 12 mm/part = 60 mm
                                    Side 3 (c) = 7 parts * 12 mm/part = 84 mm
                                    (Check: 36 + 60 + 84 = 180 mm. Also, check triangle inequality: 36+60 > 84 (96>84), 36+84 > 60 (120>60), 60+84 > 36 (144>36). A triangle can be formed.)</li>
                                <li><strong>Construction:</strong>
                                    - Draw the longest side (c = 84 mm) as the base, label endpoints P and Q.
                                    - Set compass radius to side a (36 mm). Place compass point at P and draw an arc.
                                    - Set compass radius to side b (60 mm). Place compass point at Q and draw another arc intersecting the first arc. Label the intersection point R.
                                    - Join P to R and Q to R to form the triangle PQR with sides 84mm, 36mm, 60mm.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>(ii) Inscribing a Circle:</strong></p>
                            <p>The inscribed circle (incircle) touches all three sides of the triangle. Its center (incenter) is the intersection point of the angle bisectors.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Bisect two angles:</strong> Choose any two angles of the triangle PQR (e.g., angle P and angle Q).
                                    - To bisect angle P: Place compass point at P, draw an arc intersecting sides PQ and PR. From these intersection points, draw two more arcs inside the triangle that intersect each other. Draw a line from P through this intersection point - this is the angle bisector of P.
                                    - Repeat the process to bisect angle Q.</li>
                                <li><strong>Locate the Incenter:</strong> The point where the two angle bisectors intersect is the incenter (I). (The third angle bisector would also pass through this point).</li>
                                <li><strong>Find the Radius:</strong> Construct a perpendicular line from the incenter (I) to any one side of the triangle (e.g., PQ). The length of this perpendicular line is the radius (r) of the inscribed circle. (Place compass at I, draw arcs intersecting PQ. From these points, draw arcs below PQ that intersect. Join I to this intersection point).</li>
                                <li><strong>Draw the Inscribed Circle:</strong> Place the compass point at the incenter (I), set the radius to r (the perpendicular distance), and draw the circle. It should touch all three sides of the triangle tangentially.</li>
                            </ol>
