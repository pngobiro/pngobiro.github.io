                            <p class="answer-intro">This question addresses electrical safety regulations, workshop layout, electric shock rescue, and fire extinguisher types.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Factory's Act and Workshop Layout:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Purpose of Factory's Act (Electricity Special Regulation):</strong> The primary purpose is to ensure the safety of persons working with or near electrical equipment in industrial settings (factories, workshops, etc.). It sets minimum standards for the installation, maintenance, operation, and use of electrical systems and apparatus to prevent dangers such as electric shock, burns, fire, and explosion arising from electricity.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Factors in Designing Workshop Layout (Four Factors):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Workflow/Process Sequence:</strong> Arrange machines and workstations logically to match the sequence of operations, minimizing material movement and backtracking.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Space Requirements:</strong> Allow adequate space around machines for safe operation, maintenance access, material handling, and operator movement. Consider space for storage of raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Safety and Health:</strong> Position machines to minimize hazards (e.g., sparks away from flammable materials), ensure clear walkways and emergency exits, provide adequate lighting and ventilation, and consider noise levels.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Material Handling:</strong> Plan efficient routes and methods for moving materials (e.g., use of trolleys, conveyors, cranes), minimizing distances and obstructions.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Flexibility/Future Expansion:</strong> Consider potential changes in production or future expansion when planning the layout.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Utilities Access:</strong> Ensure convenient access to power supplies, compressed air, water, etc., for machines and workstations.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Rescuing an Electric Shock Victim in Contact with Live Conductor:</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Priority is rescuer safety FIRST. Do NOT touch the victim directly.</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Break Electrical Contact Safely:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Immediately switch off the power supply at the source (main switch, breaker, socket) if it can be done quickly and safely.</li>
                                        <li>If the power cannot be switched off immediately, use a dry, non-conductive object (e.g., wooden broom handle, dry plank of wood, rubber mat, dry rope) to push or pull the victim away from the live conductor, OR push/pull the conductor away from the victim. Stand on a dry insulating surface if possible (e.g., rubber mat, dry wood).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Assess the Victim (After ensuring safety):</strong> Once clear of the electrical source, check for responsiveness (tap and shout) and normal breathing (look, listen, feel).</li>
                                <li><strong>Call for Emergency Help:</strong> Shout for help. Call emergency medical services immediately (or have someone else call).</li>
                                <li><strong>Provide First Aid:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If unresponsive and not breathing normally, start CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) immediately if trained.</li>
                                        <li>If breathing normally but unresponsive, place the victim in the recovery position.</li>
                                        <li>Treat any visible burns with cool running water (after ensuring they are no longer in shock) and cover loosely with a sterile dressing.</li>
                                        <li>Keep the victim warm and monitor their condition until professional help arrives.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>(c) Fire Extinguisher Types, Uses, and Colours:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Foam Extinguisher:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Use:</strong> Primarily used for Class A fires (solids like wood, paper) and Class B fires (flammable liquids like petrol, oil, paint). The foam forms a blanket, smothering the fire and cooling the fuel. <strong>Not suitable for live electrical fires</strong> (foam is water-based and conductive).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Colour (Traditional UK/EU):</strong> Cream. (Modern EN3 Standard: Red body with Cream band).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Vaporizing Liquid Extinguisher (Halon/Halon Replacement):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Use:</strong> Historically, Halon extinguishers were very effective on Class B, C, and electrical fires as the gas interfered with the chemical reaction of fire and left no residue. However, due to their ozone-depleting properties, Halon production is banned under the Montreal Protocol. Modern replacements (e.g., Halotron, FM-200, Novec 1230 - often called 'Clean Agents') are used for similar applications, especially protecting sensitive electronic equipment (computer rooms, aircraft) where residue is undesirable. They work by chemical inhibition or cooling.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Colour (Traditional Halon - UK):</strong> Emerald Green. Clean Agent replacements often have a Green band on a Red body (EN3) or specific manufacturer colours.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="answer-conclusion">Electrical safety involves regulations and safe rescue procedures. Workshop layout impacts efficiency and safety. Knowing fire extinguisher types and their appropriate use is crucial.</p>

                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-2">
                            <p class="answer-intro">This question covers material substitution (plastic for metal), polishing, metal properties, and characteristics/applications of specific materials.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Plastics, Polishing:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Plastic Replacing Metal Application & Advantages:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Application Example:</strong> Car Bumpers and Body Panels. Traditionally made of steel, many modern car bumpers, fenders, and trim pieces are made from engineering plastics (like Polypropylene, ABS, Polycarbonate blends).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Advantages (Any Two):</strong>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Weight Reduction:</strong> Plastics are significantly lighter than steel, contributing to improved fuel efficiency and vehicle handling.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Corrosion Resistance:</strong> Plastics do not rust or corrode like steel, improving longevity and appearance, especially in harsh weather conditions.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Design Flexibility & Cost:</strong> Plastics can be easily molded into complex aerodynamic shapes, integrating features like grilles or light housings, often at a lower manufacturing cost (via injection molding) compared to stamping and assembling metal parts.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Impact Absorption:</strong> Engineered plastics can be designed to absorb impact energy effectively in low-speed collisions, often returning to their original shape.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Other examples: Plumbing pipes (PVC/PEX replacing copper/lead/steel), appliance housings, electrical enclosures, gears in light-duty applications.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Factors in Selecting Polish (Three):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Material Being Polished:</strong> Different materials (metals, plastics, wood, paint) require polishes with appropriate abrasives and chemical compositions to avoid damage (e.g., harsh abrasive on soft plastic vs. metal polish).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Desired Level of Finish:</strong> Polishes range from coarse cutting compounds (removing heavy scratches) to medium polishing compounds (removing lighter scratches, restoring shine) to fine finishing polishes (producing a high gloss, mirror-like finish). The initial condition and desired final appearance dictate the choice.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Type of Defect to Remove:</strong> Specific polishes are formulated to remove particular defects like oxidation, swirl marks, light scratches, or water spots.</li>

                            <p>A snap head rivet is a common type with a rounded head. Riveting joins parts permanently.</p>
                             <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Align the two pieces of metal to be joined. Drill or punch matching holes through both pieces, slightly larger than the rivet shank diameter. Deburr the holes.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> Insert the snap head rivet through the aligned holes so the pre-formed snap head rests against one side.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Support:</strong> Place the pre-formed head onto a rivet set (a tool with a matching concave depression) or a solid surface (dolly) to support it.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Upsetting (Forming Second Head):</strong> Use a hammer and another tool called a snap (which also has a concave depression matching the desired finished head shape) on the tail end of the rivet. Strike the snap tool firmly with the hammer. This action causes the tail end of the rivet shank to deform, shorten, and expand radially to fill the hole tightly, while forming a second rounded (snap) head that matches the first one. Initial blows might use the flat face of the hammer or a different tool to start forming the head before finishing with the snap tool.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Result:</strong> The two formed heads clamp the metal pieces tightly together.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Pitch (P):</strong> The distance between adjacent thread forms measured parallel to the thread axis.</li>

                                        <li>For a <strong>single-start thread</strong> (most common), the lead is equal to the pitch (L = P).</li>

Multi-start threads provide faster axial movement per revolution.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Brazing stronger than soldering.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Heat Source:</strong> Gas welding (typically Oxy-acetylene) uses heat from the combustion of fuel gas with oxygen. Arc welding uses heat generated by an electric arc struck between an electrode and the workpiece.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Arc welding generally produces higher temperatures concentrated in a smaller area compared to gas welding flames (though oxy-acetylene flame is very hot, arc temperatures are higher).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Gas welding requires gas cylinders, regulators, hoses, and a torch. Arc welding requires a power source (AC/DC welder), electrode holder/gun, earth clamp, and cables (plus shielding gas/flux depending on process).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Application/Control:</strong> Gas welding often offers finer heat control, suitable for thin materials or brazing/soldering. Arc welding processes are generally faster and more suitable for thicker materials and structural work. Different arc processes (Stick, MIG, TIG) offer varying levels of control and suitability for different materials.</li>

                             <p class="answer-intro">This question involves constructing an isometric view from orthographic projections and sketching common workshop tools.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Isometric View Construction:</strong></p>
                            <p>Requires constructing an isometric view from the given orthographic views (Figure 3, assume Third Angle: Plan Above Front Elevation), ensuring corner N is the lowest point. Six dimensions must be added to the isometric view.</p>
                            <p><strong>Analysis of Views (Figure 3):</strong></p>
                             <ul>
                                 <li>Identify the Front Elevation and Plan views.</li>
                                 <li>Determine the object's shape: Looks like a base plate with an upright section containing curves and possibly a hole or slot.</li>
                                 <li>Locate corner N on both views.</li>
                                 <li>Extract overall Width, Height, and Depth dimensions.</li>
                             </ul>
                             <p><strong>Isometric Construction Steps:</strong></p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>Orient Axes:</strong> Set up isometric axes originating from corner N as the lowest point. Determine the directions corresponding to Width, Depth, and Height based on the orthographic views and the position of N.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Construct Basic Shape:</strong> Draw the main block or bounding box corresponding to the overall dimensions starting from N.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Transfer Features:</strong> Carefully transfer all features (curves, holes, steps, ribs) from the Front Elevation and Plan onto the isometric framework. Use the ellipse construction method for circles/curves on isometric planes. Measure distances along the isometric axes.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Refine Lines:</strong> Complete the object outline, darkening visible lines and erasing construction lines. Omit hidden lines.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Dimensioning:</strong> Add six major dimensions directly onto the isometric view using standard isometric dimensioning techniques (dimension lines and text aligned with isometric planes). Choose important overall dimensions and key feature sizes/locations.</li>
                             </ol>
