                            <p class="answer-intro">This question covers marking out tools (punches, square, caliper) and the principle/use of vernier calipers.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Centre Punch vs. Dot Punch Distinction:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Centre Punch:</strong> Has a conical point ground to a steeper angle, typically 90 degrees. Its primary use is to create a larger, wider indentation to accurately locate the centre of a hole before drilling, providing a guide for the drill bit to start without wandering.</li>
                                <li><strong>Dot Punch:</strong> Has a conical point ground to a sharper angle, typically 60 degrees. It is used to make smaller, sharper indentations, often to permanently mark scribed layout lines, making them more visible, or to mark points along a line without creating an indentation too large for subsequent accurate work or drilling guidance.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Key Difference:</strong> Point angle (90° for centre punch vs. 60° for dot punch) and primary application (drill starting vs. marking lines).</p>

                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Vernier Caliper Accuracy and Precautions:</strong></p>
                             <p class="key-point">Corrected label from (b) to (c) based on context.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Obtaining 0.02 mm Accuracy:</strong> This accuracy (least count) is achieved through the principle of the vernier scale. A standard metric vernier scale for 0.02 mm accuracy typically has 50 divisions on the sliding vernier scale that correspond exactly in length to 49 divisions on the main scale (where main scale divisions are 1 mm apart).
                                    <br>The difference in length between one main scale division (1 mm) and one vernier scale division (49/50 mm = 0.98 mm) is $1 - 0.98 = 0.02 \, \text{mm}$.
                                    <br>Therefore, when the vernier scale slides, each of its divisions represents a movement of 0.02 mm relative to the main scale markings, allowing measurements to be read to this precision by identifying which vernier division aligns perfectly with a main scale division.
                                    <br>(Alternatively, sometimes 25 vernier divisions span 24 mm, giving a least count of 1mm - (24/25)mm = 1/25mm = 0.04mm? No, common is 50 div over 49mm for 0.02mm, or 25 div over 24.5mm? Check common designs. Another common 0.02mm design: Main scale has 0.5mm subdivisions. Vernier has 25 divisions spanning 24.5mm (49 half-mm marks). Vernier div = 24.5/25 = 0.49mm. Smallest main div = 0.5mm. Least Count = 0.5 - 0.49 = 0.01mm? No, something is wrong. Let's stick to the 50 div over 49 mm explanation)
                                    <br>Revisiting: A common 0.02mm vernier has 50 divisions on the vernier scale spanning 49 mm on the main scale. Least Count = (Value of 1 Main Scale Division) - (Value of 1 Vernier Scale Division) = 1 mm - (49/50) mm = 1/50 mm = 0.02 mm. The reading is taken by adding the main scale reading (mm before vernier zero) to the value of the aligning vernier mark (aligning division number x 0.02 mm).</li>

                                <li><strong>(ii) Precautions in Using Vernier Caliper (Four):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> Ensure the workpiece and the caliper jaws/measuring surfaces are clean before taking a measurement to avoid errors.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Check Zero Setting:</strong> Close the jaws fully and check if the zero mark on the vernier scale aligns perfectly with the zero mark on the main scale. If not, note the zero error or adjust if possible.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Correct Application of Jaws:</strong> Apply the jaws squarely to the surfaces being measured. Use the appropriate jaws (external, internal) for the dimension. Apply gentle, consistent pressure; avoid forcing the jaws.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Avoid Parallax Error:</strong> View the scales directly from above (perpendicularly) when reading the main and vernier scales to avoid misinterpreting the alignment.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Handle with Care:</strong> Avoid dropping or knocking the instrument. Store it carefully in its protective case when not in use. Do not use it as a hammer or scribe.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Locking Screw:</strong> Use the locking screw gently to hold the reading while removing the caliper from the workpiece, but re-check the reading after locking as it can sometimes shift slightly.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                                          <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> A marking out tool consisting of two adjustable points (trammel heads) mounted on a long beam (wood or metal). One point is typically a sharp scriber, the other can be a scriber or pencil holder. The distance between the points can be set accurately along the beam.</li>
                                          <li><strong>Uses:</strong> Scribing large circles or arcs beyond the capacity of standard dividers; transferring large measurements accurately during layout on large sheets.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Earthing (Grounding):</strong> Connecting the metal casings of equipment to earth. If a fault makes the casing live, current flows to earth, tripping a protective device (fuse/breaker) and disconnecting power. (See July 2014 Q1b).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Insulation:</strong> Using materials with high electrical resistance (insulators like rubber, plastic) to cover live conductors (wires) or enclose equipment (casings), preventing accidental contact.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Double Insulation:</strong> Providing two layers of insulation (basic + supplementary) on appliances, eliminating the need for earthing by ensuring the outer casing cannot become live even if basic insulation fails. (See July 2014 Q1b).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Fuses and Circuit Breakers (Protective Devices):</strong> Devices designed to automatically interrupt the current flow if it exceeds a safe level (due to overload or short circuit), preventing overheating, fire, and reducing the duration of potential shock currents.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Residual Current Devices (RCDs/RCCBs):</strong> Detect small leakage currents flowing to earth (e.g., through a person) and trip very quickly, disconnecting the supply before a fatal shock can occur. Offer much higher protection against shock than fuses/breakers alone.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Reduced/Low Voltage Systems:</strong> Using lower operating voltages (e.g., 110V centre-tapped, 24V) in hazardous environments significantly reduces the potential severity of an electric shock. (See July 2014 Q1b).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Using isolating switches or procedures (like Lockout/Tagout - LOTO) to completely disconnect equipment from the power supply before maintenance or repair work begins.</li>

                            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Copy Elevation & Plan:</strong> Accurately redraw the given Front Elevation and Plan from Figure 3. Note the base size, height, apex position, and the 30° cutting plane in the Elevation. Label base vertices (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) in the Plan and apex O. Project base vertices to Elevation.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Complete Truncated Plan:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Project the points where the cutting plane intersects the slant edges (O-1, O-2, O-3, O-4) in the Elevation vertically down onto the corresponding slant edges in the Plan view. Label these intersection points (e.g., 1', 2', 3', 4').</li>
                                        <li>Connect points 1', 2', 3', 4' in the Plan with straight lines. This polygon represents the cut surface as seen from above.</li>
                                        <li>Determine visibility: The base square (1-2-3-4) and the cut polygon (1'-2'-3'-4') are visible. The parts of the slant edges between the base and the cut are also visible. Use solid lines for visible edges and dashed for hidden (if any, unlikely in plan).</li>

                                        <li>Connect these points in the End Elevation to show the cut shape. Determine visibility (solid/dashed lines).</li>

                                         <li>Draw projection lines perpendicular to the cutting plane line (at 30°) in the Elevation, extending from points 1', 2', 3', 4'.</li>

                                         <li>Measure these true lengths O-1', O-2', etc., along the corresponding radial lines O'-1, O'-2, etc., in the development, starting from O'. Label points 1', 2', 3', 4'.</li>
                                         <li>Connect points 1', 2', 3', 4' with straight lines. Connect 1-1', 2-2', 3-3', 4-4'.</li>
                                         <li>The shape bounded by 1-2-3-4-1 (base curve/lines) and 1'-2'-3'-4'-1' (top cut curve/lines) and the side lines 1-1', etc., is the development of the frustum's lateral surface. Optionally add the base square and true shape cut polygon attached.</li>

                                         <li>The two fixed points M and N are called the <strong>Foci</strong> (singular: Focus) of the ellipse.</li>
                                     </ul>
                                 </li>
                                 <li><strong>(i) Plotting the Path (Ellipse):</strong> This can be done using several methods based on the definition:
                                     <ul>
                                         <li><strong>String Method (Conceptual):</strong> Fix pins at M and N. Take a loop of string of length (MN + 120) = (95 + 120) = 215 mm. Place the loop around the pins and pull it taut with a pencil point P. Move the pencil while keeping the string taut; it will trace the ellipse.</li>

                                                 <li>Draw line segment MN = 95 mm.</li>
                                                 <li>Choose a radius $r_1$ (e.g., 30 mm). Calculate $r_2 = 120 - r_1 = 120 - 30 = 90$ mm.</li>

                                                 <li>Repeat with different pairs of radii $r_1$ and $r_2$ such that $r_1 + r_2 = 120$ mm and $r_1 > (120-95)/2 = 12.5$ mm and $r_1 < 120 - 12.5 = 107.5$ mm (approximately). Choose enough points to define the curve. (e.g., r1=40, r2=80; r1=50, r2=70; r1=60, r2=60 [gives points on major axis]; r1=70, r2=50, etc.).</li>
                                                 <li>Also plot the ends of the major axis: the distance from center to end is half the constant sum = 120/2 = 60 mm. The center O is the midpoint of MN. Ends are 60mm from O along the line MN extended.</li>
