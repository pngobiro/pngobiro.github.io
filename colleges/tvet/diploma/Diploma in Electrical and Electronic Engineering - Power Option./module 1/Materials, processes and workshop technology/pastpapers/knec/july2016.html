                            <p><strong>(b) Mouth-to-Mouth Resuscitation Procedure:</strong></p>
                             <p>(Repeated from Q3a(ii) of 2010 & Q1d Nov 2015)</p>
                             <p class="key-point">Modern guidelines prioritize chest compressions (CPR) and calling emergency services. This describes the traditional method.</p>
                            <ol class="step-by-step">
                                <li class="step"><strong>Ensure Safety:</strong> Check the scene. Turn off power or safely remove the victim from the electrical source using a non-conductive object (dry wood, rubber). Do not touch the victim if they are still live.</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Check Response & Breathing:</strong> Tap and shout. Check for normal breathing (look, listen, feel for no more than 10 seconds). Call for emergency medical help immediately.</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Position Victim:</strong> Lay the victim flat on their back on a firm surface.</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Open Airway:</strong> Use the head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver (one hand on forehead pushing down, fingers of other hand under chin lifting up).</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Give Breaths:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Pinch the victim's nose closed.</li>
                                        <li>Take a normal breath and make a complete seal over the victim's mouth with yours.</li>
                                        <li>Give one breath lasting about 1 second, watching for the chest to rise.</li>
                                        <li>If the chest rises, remove your mouth, allow the chest to fall.</li>
                                        <li>Give a second breath.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Continue Breaths:</strong> If the victim has signs of circulation (pulse, coughing, movement) but is not breathing normally, continue giving rescue breaths at a rate of 1 breath every 5-6 seconds (10-12 per minute) until help arrives or breathing restarts. If no signs of circulation, start CPR (chest compressions and breaths).</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>(c) Material Properties Explained:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Ductility:</strong> The ability of a material to undergo significant plastic deformation under tensile stress before fracture. It is typically characterized by the ability to be drawn out into a thin wire. E.g., Copper, Aluminium, Mild Steel.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Malleability:</strong> The ability of a material to undergo significant plastic deformation under compressive stress without fracture. It is typically characterized by the ability to be hammered or rolled into thin sheets. E.g., Gold, Lead, Copper, Aluminium.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(d) Electroplating Process:</strong></p>
                             <p>(Repeated from Q3b(i) 2010, Q2d July 2014, Q2b(i) Nov 2015)</p>
                             <p>Electroplating is a process that uses an electric current to deposit a thin layer of one metal onto another object (the workpiece or substrate).</p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> The workpiece (substrate) must be thoroughly cleaned to remove grease, dirt, and oxides.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Setup:</strong> An electrolytic cell is prepared containing an electrolyte solution (which has dissolved ions of the plating metal).</li>
                                 <li><strong>Electrodes:</strong> The cleaned workpiece is made the cathode (connected to the negative terminal of a DC power supply). The anode (connected to the positive terminal) is typically made of the metal being plated (e.g., a copper anode for copper plating).</li>
                                 <li><strong>Electrolysis:</strong> When the DC current flows, positive metal ions from the electrolyte are attracted to the cathode (workpiece).</li>
                                 <li><strong>Deposition:</strong> At the cathode, these metal ions gain electrons (are reduced) and deposit onto the workpiece surface as a solid metal coating.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Anode Reaction:</strong> Simultaneously, if using an active anode, metal atoms from the anode lose electrons (are oxidized) and dissolve into the electrolyte, replenishing the ions.</li>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question covers soldering materials, oxy-acetylene equipment, fasteners and joints (washers, rivets), and sheet metal seams.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Solders and Flux:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Categories of Solders (Two):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Soft Solders:</strong> Low melting point alloys (below 450°C), typically based on tin and lead (traditional) or lead-free compositions (tin-copper, tin-silver, tin-bismuth). Used for electronics, plumbing, sheet metal seams.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Hard Solders (Brazing Alloys):</strong> Higher melting point alloys (above 450°C but below the base metal melting point), often copper-based (brass), silver-based ('silver solder'), or aluminium-based. Used for stronger joints in structural applications, tool joining, refrigeration.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Requirements of a Good Soldering Flux (Two):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Must be chemically active at soldering temperature to remove oxides from base metals.</li>
                                        <li>Should provide a protective layer to prevent re-oxidation during heating.</li>
                                        <li>Should promote wetting of the base metal by the molten solder.</li>
                                        <li>Its residue should ideally be non-corrosive and easily removable after soldering (or be safely left in place if designated 'no-clean').</li>
                                        <li>Should have a melting/activation temperature compatible with the solder being used.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Oxy-Acetylene Gas Cylinders:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Oxygen Cylinder:</strong> Typically a tall, seamless steel cylinder painted black (traditional UK/older standard) or white/blue (modern international). Contains highly compressed gaseous oxygen (up to 150-200 bar or 2200-3000 psi). Has a right-hand threaded valve outlet. Must be handled carefully as pure oxygen supports combustion vigorously.</li>
                                <li><strong>Acetylene Cylinder:</strong> Typically a shorter, wider steel cylinder painted maroon (traditional UK/older standard) or brown/yellow (modern international). Acetylene gas is unstable under high pressure, so it is dissolved in a solvent (usually acetone) absorbed within a porous, monolithic filler material inside the cylinder. Max filling pressure is much lower (around 15-17 bar or 250 psi). Has a left-hand threaded valve outlet and often incorporates safety devices like fusible plugs. Requires careful handling (stored upright, avoid shocks).</li>

                            <p><strong>(c) Washers and Rivet Failure:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Functions of Washers (Two):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Distribute the load of a threaded fastener (bolt head or nut) over a larger surface area, preventing damage to the component surface.</li>
                                        <li>Provide a smooth bearing surface for the nut or bolt head to turn against during tightening.</li>
                                        <li>Span oversized or slotted holes.</li>
                                        <li>Prevent loosening (e.g., spring washers, lock washers).</li>
                                        <li>Act as a spacer or shim.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Ways a Rivet Joint May Fail (Two):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Shearing of the Rivet:</strong> The rivet itself breaks due to shear stress across its cross-section when the plates pull laterally.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Tearing of the Plate (at the Edge):</strong> The plate material tears out between the rivet hole and the edge of the plate if the edge distance is insufficient.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Tearing of the Plate (Between Rivets):</strong> The plate material tears along the line of rivets if the pitch (distance between rivets) is too small or the plate too thin.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Bearing/Crushing Failure:</strong> The plate material around the rivet hole or the rivet shank itself crushes due to excessive bearing stress (compressive force between rivet and plate).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Tensile Failure of the Plate:</strong> The plate itself breaks in tension across a line of holes if the overall cross-section is reduced too much.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(d) Sketches of Self-Secured Joints:</strong></p>
                            <p>Requires freehand sketches illustrating how these sheet metal seams are formed.</p>
                             <ul>
                                 <li><strong>(i) Paned-Down Joint:</strong> Used for joining bottoms to cylindrical or rectangular bodies. One edge (e.g., cylinder bottom) is flanged outwards, the other (e.g., base disc) has an edge folded up. They are fitted together, and the flange/fold is hammered down flat ('paned') against the body, often over a stake.

                                 <li><strong>(ii) Grooved Seam (Lock Seam):</strong> Used for joining flat sheets edge-to-edge or forming longitudinal seams on cylinders. Both edges are folded (one up, one down), hooked together, and then flattened tightly using a hand groover tool or machine, creating an interlocking seam.

                                 <li><strong>(iii) Knocked-Up Bottom Joint:</strong> Similar application to paned-down but often considered stronger. The bottom edge of the body is flanged *outwards*. The edge of the base disc is flanged *upwards*. The base fits inside the body flange. Both flanges are then hammered ('knocked up') vertically against the body wall using suitable stakes.

                                <li><strong>Seam:</strong> A joint formed by fastening two edges of sheet metal together, typically by folding, interlocking, soldering, welding, or riveting, to create a continuous surface or enclosure. Examples include grooved seams, lap seams, and corner seams.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Distinction: An edge is the border of a single piece; a seam is where two edges are joined together.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Facing:</strong> A lathe operation used to machine the end face of a workpiece flat and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The cutting tool is fed radially (across the end face) from the centre outwards or vice versa, while the workpiece rotates in the chuck. It is often the first operation performed to establish a true reference surface or achieve a specific length.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Knurling:</strong> A process used to create a patterned texture (usually diamond or straight lines) on the surface of a cylindrical workpiece. It is not a cutting operation but a forming operation. A special knurling tool, consisting of one or more hardened patterned wheels (knurls), is pressed hard against the rotating workpiece, displacing the metal to form the raised pattern. Knurling improves grip or enhances appearance.</li>

                             <p class="answer-intro">This question involves orthographic projection and finding the true shape of a section for a truncated cone, based on the provided elevation (Figure 1).</p>
                             <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>Redraw Elevation:</strong> Accurately copy the given Front Elevation from Figure 1, showing the base, the taper, and the cutting plane X-X. Determine the full height and base diameter from the drawing. Find or project the apex of the original cone.</li>
                                 <li><strong>(a) Construct Plan View:</strong>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Project the base diameter vertically downwards from the Elevation to draw the circular base in the Plan, centred below the Elevation.</li>
                                         <li>The cutting plane X-X is horizontal in this case. Therefore, the plan view of the cut surface will simply be a circle. Project the diameter of the cut at section X-X in the Elevation downwards to draw this smaller circle concentrically within the base circle in the Plan.</li>
                                     </ul>
                                 </li>
                                 <li><strong>(b) Construct End Elevation (View E):</strong> (Assuming a view from the right, drawn to the left in First Angle projection, or view from left drawn to right).
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Project heights horizontally from the Front Elevation (base height, cut height X-X, apex height if relevant).</li>
                                         <li>Project widths (diameters) from the Plan using 45° projection or measurement. The base width is the base diameter. The width at section X-X is the diameter of the cut circle.</li>
                                         <li>Draw the outline of the cone (frustum) in the End Elevation using these projected heights and widths. It will look identical to the Front Elevation in this case since the object is symmetrical and the cut is horizontal.</li>

                                 <li><strong>(c) Construct True Shape at X-X:</strong>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Since the cutting plane X-X shown in the Elevation is horizontal (perpendicular to the axis of the cone and parallel to the base), the true shape of the cut surface is simply a circle.</li>
                                         <li>The diameter of this circle is the width of the cone at the level X-X as seen in the Elevation (or Plan).</li>
                                         <li>Draw a circle with this diameter separately and label it as "True Shape at X-X".</li>

                                 <li>**Cabinet Rule:** The length of the receding lines is drawn at **half** the true depth dimension.</li>

                                 <li><strong>Orientation:</strong> Determine which orthographic view best represents the front face when Face A is the lowest. Position this face parallel to the drawing plane.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Draw Front Face:</strong> Draw the chosen front face (containing Face A at the bottom) true size and shape using the Width and Height dimensions from the orthographic views.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Draw Receding Lines:</strong> From each significant corner/vertex of the front face, draw receding lines backward at the chosen angle (e.g., 45°).</li>
                                 <li><strong>Mark Half Depth:</strong> Measure HALF the object's true depth along each receding line. Mark these points.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Draw Back Face(s):</strong> Connect the ends of the receding lines (marked at half depth) with lines parallel to the corresponding lines on the front face to construct the rear features of the object.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Add Details:</strong> Include any holes, slots, curves, or other features shown in the orthographic views, projecting them onto the front face and then receding back at half depth. Remember that circles on receding faces become ellipses, but in oblique, circles on the front face remain true circles.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Final Lines:</strong> Darken all visible object lines. Hidden lines are usually omitted in oblique projections.</li>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question deals with the intersection of two dissimilar pipes (likely cylinders) and requires constructing the plan view, the curve of intersection in both views, and the surface developments of both pipes using Third Angle Projection.</p>
                            <p><strong>Understanding Third Angle Projection:</strong> Plan is ABOVE Front Elevation, Right End View is to the RIGHT.</p>
                            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Redraw Elevation:</strong> Copy the given Front Elevation accurately, showing the diameters, lengths, and angle of intersection of the two pipes.</li>
                                <li><strong>(a) Construct Plan View:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Draw the Plan view directly above the Front Elevation.</li>
                                        <li>Project the diameters and lengths from the Elevation. The main (larger?) pipe will likely appear as a rectangle in the Plan. The intersecting (smaller?) pipe will also appear rectangular, overlapping the main pipe at the correct position based on the Elevation.</li>
                                        <li>The intersection line in the Plan will be derived by projecting points from the intersection curve found in the Elevation (see step b).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(b) Construct Curve of Intersection:</strong> This is the most critical part.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Use element/generator lines. Divide the end profile (circle) of the intersecting pipe (imagine its end view or use the Plan view if appropriate) into equal segments (e.g., 12).</li>
                                        <li>Draw element lines along the surface of the intersecting pipe parallel to its axis in both Elevation and Plan views, corresponding to these divisions.</li>
                                        <li>Where these element lines on the intersecting pipe meet the surface of the main pipe in one view (e.g., Plan), project these intersection points to the corresponding element lines in the other view (Elevation).</li>
                                        <li>Alternatively, use cutting planes parallel to the axis of one pipe and perpendicular to the other. Find the intersection of these planes with both pipes in auxiliary views or directly in the Plan/Elevation.</li>
                                        <li>Plot the series of intersection points found in both the Elevation and Plan views.</li>
                                        <li>Draw smooth curves connecting these points in both views to represent the line/curve of intersection. This curve will likely be complex, possibly elliptical or saddle-shaped depending on the view.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(c) Construct Development of Both Pipes:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Main Pipe:</strong> Develop as a rectangle (width = circumference $\pi D_{main}$, height = length). Mark the positions where the intersecting pipe joins. Determine the true shape of the hole created by the intersection (using true lengths of intersecting elements) and draw this shape onto the development rectangle.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Intersecting Pipe:</strong> Develop as a rectangle (width = circumference $\pi D_{intersecting}$, height = its length up to the intersection). Draw element lines on the development corresponding to the divisions used earlier. Measure the true length of each element line from the end of the pipe up to the point where it intersects the main pipe (these lengths can be taken from the Elevation if it shows true lengths, or found by projection). Plot these varying lengths on the corresponding element lines in the development rectangle. Draw a smooth curve through the endpoints. This shaped end represents the cut required to fit against the main pipe.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
