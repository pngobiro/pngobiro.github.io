                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Thermal Burns:</strong> Contact with hot surfaces (machines, engines, welded parts), hot liquids/steam (scalds), open flames (welding, forge), friction.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Electrical Burns:</strong> Passage of electric current through the body, or from arc flash heat.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Chemical Burns:</strong> Contact with corrosive substances (acids, alkalis, solvents).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Radiation Burns:</strong> Overexposure to UV radiation (welding arcs without protection), intense infrared, or ionizing radiation.</li>

                                <li><strong>(ii) First Aid Procedure for Burns and Scalds (Thermal):</strong>
                                    <ol class="step-by-step">
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Ensure Safety:</strong> Make sure the source of the burn is removed or neutralized (stop the burning process).</li>
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Cool the Burn Immediately:</strong> Hold the affected area under cool (not ice cold) running water for at least 10-20 minutes, or until the pain subsides. This helps reduce tissue damage and pain.</li>
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Remove Constrictions:</strong> Gently remove any rings, watches, belts, or tight clothing from the burned area before it starts to swell. Do not remove clothing stuck to the burn.</li>
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Cover the Burn:</strong> Cover the burn loosely with a sterile, non-fluffy dressing (like sterile gauze or cling film/plastic wrap - do not wrap tightly). This protects against infection and reduces pain by keeping air off the surface.</li>
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Keep Warm:</strong> Keep the casualty warm with a blanket, as cooling a large burn area can lead to hypothermia, but do not place blankets directly on the burn itself.</li>
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Seek Medical Attention:</strong> Seek professional medical help for all but very minor superficial burns. Seek immediate help for large burns, deep burns, electrical/chemical burns, burns on face/hands/feet/genitals, or if the casualty is an infant/elderly person or shows signs of shock.</li>
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Do NOT:</strong> Do not apply ointments, creams, butter, or lotions. Do not burst blisters. Do not use adhesive dressings directly on the burn.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                     <p class="key-point">Treatment for chemical burns involves flushing with copious amounts of water (after brushing off dry chemicals). Electrical burns always require immediate medical evaluation.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                             <p class="answer-conclusion">Covers fundamental workshop safety rules for tools and tidiness, common electrical hazards, fire classification, causes of burns, and standard first aid treatment for thermal burns.</p>

                            <p><strong>(c) Micrometer Description and Care:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Describe a Micrometer:</strong> A precision measuring instrument used for making accurate measurements of small distances or thicknesses, typically external dimensions (though internal and depth versions exist). It works on the principle of a precisely machined screw thread. Turning a calibrated thimble advances a spindle towards a fixed anvil. The measurement is read from a combination of a main scale on the sleeve (barrel) and a vernier/circular scale on the thimble, allowing readings typically to 0.01 mm or 0.001 inch accuracy. A ratchet stop is usually included to ensure consistent measuring pressure.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Care and Maintenance Measures for Micrometer (Two):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Cleanliness:</strong> Keep the micrometer clean, especially the measuring faces (anvil and spindle). Wipe them clean before and after use.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Check Zero Setting:</strong> Regularly check the zero reading by closing the measuring faces carefully (using the ratchet). Adjust if necessary using the C-spanner provided.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Proper Handling:</strong> Avoid dropping or mishandling. Do not overtighten using the thimble; always use the ratchet stop for final closure to ensure consistent pressure.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store the micrometer in its protective case when not in use, preferably with the measuring faces slightly apart. Keep it away from moisture and excessive temperature changes.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Lubrication:</strong> Occasionally apply a drop of light, high-quality oil to the spindle thread if required by manufacturer instructions.</li>
                                    </ol>

                             <p class="answer-intro">This question covers the main components of a lathe, specific lathe operations, and safety measures for drilling machines.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Principal Parts of a Lathe Machine (Four):</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Bed:</strong> The foundation providing rigid support and accurately machined ways for other parts.</li>
                                <li><strong>Headstock:</strong> Contains the main spindle, drive mechanism (motor, gears/belts), and holds the workpiece (via chuck/faceplate).</li>
                                <li><strong>Tailstock:</strong> Slides on the bed opposite the headstock; supports the end of long workpieces or holds tools for axial operations (drilling, reaming).</li>
                                <li><strong>Carriage Assembly:</strong> Moves along the bed ways and consists of:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Saddle:</strong> Slides along the bed ways.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cross-slide:</strong> Moves perpendicular to the lathe axis (across the bed) mounted on the saddle, controls radial tool movement/diameter.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Compound Rest (Top Slide):</strong> Mounted on the cross-slide, can be swiveled to any angle for turning tapers or specific angles, carries the tool post.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Apron:</strong> Attached to the front of the saddle, contains gears and controls for engaging automatic feeds (longitudinal/cross) and thread cutting via the leadscrew/feed rod.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Tool Post:</strong> Mounted on the compound rest, securely holds the cutting tool.</li>
                                <li><strong>Leadscrew and Feed Rod:</strong> Transmit motion from the headstock gear train to the carriage for automatic feeds and thread cutting.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>(b) Lathe Operations Explained with Sketches:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Step Turning:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Creating multiple cylindrical sections of different diameters on a single workpiece. This involves turning one diameter for a specific length, then changing the tool position (or using a different tool) to turn another section to a different diameter for another specific length, creating a 'step' between the diameters.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Sketch:</strong> Show a workpiece rotating. Show a turning tool cutting along the diameter for a certain length, then withdrawn and repositioned (or a different tool used) to cut a smaller/larger diameter adjacent to the first, creating a distinct step. Indicate tool feed direction (axial) and workpiece rotation.</li>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question requires constructing an oblique pictorial view from the given orthographic views (Figure 2), with a specified face (A) oriented as the front view. The type of oblique (Cavalier or Cabinet) is not specified; Cavalier (full depth) is often assumed if not stated, but Cabinet (half depth) is also common.</p>
                            <p><strong>Analysis of Views (Figure 2):</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Identify the Front Elevation (containing Face A) and the other view (likely Plan or End Elevation).</li>
                                <li>Determine the shape of the hinge block: Likely a block with hinge knuckles (cylindrical sections with holes for a pin) and possibly mounting holes or flanges.</li>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Orientation:</strong> Position the drawing axes so that Face A is drawn true shape in the frontal plane. Receding axes go back at an angle (e.g., 45°).</li>
                                <li><strong>Draw Front Face (A):</strong> Draw Face A true size and shape using Width and Height dimensions from the orthographic views.</li>
                                <li><strong>Draw Receding Lines:</strong> From corners and key points on the front face, draw parallel receding lines at the chosen angle (e.g., 45°).</li>
                                <li><strong>Mark Full Depth:</strong> Measure the object's true Depth along these receding lines. Mark these points.</li>
                                <li><strong>Draw Back Features:</strong> Connect the ends of the receding lines to form the back edges and surfaces, drawing lines parallel to the corresponding front face lines.</li>
                                <li><strong>Add Details:</strong> Construct cylindrical features (hinge knuckles), holes, etc., remembering that circles on the front face are true circles, while circles on receding or angled faces become ellipses (though often simplified to circles in basic oblique drawings).</li>
                                <li><strong>Refine:</strong> Darken visible lines. Omit hidden lines typically.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p class="key-point">If Cabinet projection was intended, Step 4 would involve marking HALF the true depth along receding lines.</p>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question involves determining the curve of intersection between two intersecting cylinders of unequal diameter meeting at an angle, completing the orthographic views, and developing the surface of one cylinder.</p>
                            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Copy Elevation:</strong> Accurately redraw the given incomplete Front Elevation from Figure 3, showing the main cylinder (A?), the intersecting cylinder (B) at 30°, and their diameters.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Construct Complete Plan:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Draw the Plan view (assuming below Elevation for First Angle, or above for Third Angle).</li>
                                        <li>Project the main cylinder (A) down as a circle.</li>
                                        <li>Project the intersecting cylinder (B) down. In the Plan view, it will appear as an ellipse since it's viewed at an angle relative to its axis (unless its axis is vertical). The width of this ellipse will be the diameter of cylinder B, and its length will depend on the projection. The centerline of cylinder B in the plan will be aligned under its centerline in the elevation.</li>
                                        <li>The curve of intersection in the Plan will be determined by projecting points from the Elevation (see next step).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(i) Construct Complete Front Elevation (Curve of Intersection):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Use element lines. Divide the profile (circle) of the smaller cylinder (B) in an auxiliary view (or its projected elliptical shape in the plan) into equal segments (e.g., 12).</li>
                                        <li>Draw element lines parallel to cylinder B's axis in both Elevation and Plan views.</li>
                                        <li>Find where these element lines pierce the surface of the main cylinder (A). This is easiest seen in the Plan view where cylinder A is a circle. Mark where element lines on cylinder B cross the circle of cylinder A.</li>
                                        <li>Project these piercing points from the Plan view vertically up to intersect the corresponding element lines on cylinder B in the Front Elevation.</li>
                                        <li>Plot the series of intersection points found in the Front Elevation. Connect these points with a smooth curve, paying attention to visibility (some parts of the curve might be hidden behind cylinder B). This completes the elevation. Project these points back to the Plan to complete the intersection curve there.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                 <li><strong>(iii) Surface Development of Cylinder B:</strong>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Draw a baseline equal to the circumference of cylinder B ($\pi \times D_B$). Divide this baseline into the same number of equal segments (e.g., 12) used for the element lines.</li>
                                         <li>Draw element lines perpendicular to the baseline at each division point.</li>
                                         <li>Measure the true length of each element line on cylinder B from a reference end (e.g., the free end) up to the point where it intersects cylinder A. These lengths can be taken directly from the Front Elevation if cylinder B's axis is parallel to the viewing plane, otherwise true lengths need to be determined.</li>
                                         <li>Plot these varying true lengths on the corresponding element lines in the development layout.</li>
                                         <li>Draw a smooth curve connecting the endpoints. The resulting shape is the development of cylinder B's lateral surface, shaped to fit against cylinder A.</li>

                                <li><strong>(i) Regular Heptagon in Circle (Radius 40 mm):</strong> Constructing an exact regular heptagon (7 sides) using only compass and straightedge is impossible. However, accurate approximations exist. A common method:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Draw the circle (Radius R=40 mm) and a diameter.</li>
                                        <li>Construct a perpendicular bisector to the diameter (a vertical diameter).</li>
                                        <li>Set compass radius to R (40mm). Place point at one end of the horizontal diameter, draw arc intersecting the circle above and below.</li>
                                        <li>Connect these two intersection points with a chord. The distance from the center to the midpoint of this chord is R * sqrt(3)/2. Alternatively, half the side length of the inscribed hexagon is R/2 = 20mm? No, this isn't right.</li>
                                        <li>**Approximate Method:** Draw circle R=40. Draw radius OA. Construct perpendicular bisector of OA, meeting circle at P. Length AP is a good approximation of the heptagon side length. Step off length AP around the circle 7 times. Connect vertices.</li>
                                         <li>**Another Approximation:** Draw vertical radius OC. Set compass to R=40. From bottom end of vertical diameter (D), draw arc cutting circle at E, F. Line EF intersects OC at G. Length EG (or FG) is approx side length. Step off EG around circle.</li>
                                     </ol>
                                     <p class="key-point">Since exact construction is impossible, an accurate approximation method should be used and potentially noted.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Construct Angle A ($67.5^{\circ}$):</strong> This angle is half of 135°, or $45° + 22.5°$. Construct a 90° angle. Bisect it to get 45°. Bisect the 45° angle again to get 22.5°. Add the 45° and 22.5° sections together. Alternatively, construct 90°, bisect (45°), bisect remaining angle between 45° and 90° (gives 67.5°).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Construct Triangle:</strong> Draw vertex A with angle 67.5°. Mark off AB = 52 mm along one arm and AC = 52 mm along the other arm. Join B to C to complete the isosceles triangle.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Circumscribe Circle:</strong> Construct the perpendicular bisectors of any two sides (e.g., AB and AC). The point where they intersect is the Circumcenter (O). Set compass radius to OA (or OB or OC, they are equal). Draw the circle centered at O passing through A, B, and C.</li>
