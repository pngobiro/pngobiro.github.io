                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Electroplating:</strong> (Repeated from Q2d of July 2014 & Q3b(i) of 2010) A process using electrolysis to deposit a thin layer of one metal (e.g., chromium, nickel, zinc, gold) onto the surface of another object (usually metallic) to improve appearance, corrosion resistance, hardness, or conductivity. The object acts as the cathode, an anode (often of the plating metal) is used, and both are immersed in an electrolyte solution containing ions of the plating metal while a DC current is passed.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Enamelling (Vitreous Enamelling):</strong> A process where a glassy coating (enamel frit - powdered glass mixed with pigments and fluxes) is applied to a metal surface (typically steel, cast iron, aluminium, or copper) and fused to it by firing at high temperatures (typically 750-850°C). This creates a hard, smooth, durable, corrosion-resistant, and often decorative surface. Used for cookware, appliances, signage, jewelry, and architectural panels.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Procedure for Bending a Metal Rod in Forging:</strong></p>
                            <p>Forging involves shaping metal, usually heated, using compressive forces (hammering, pressing).</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Heating:</strong> Heat the section of the metal rod to be bent to the appropriate forging temperature (e.g., bright red/orange heat for steel) in a forge or furnace. This makes the metal plastic and easier to deform.</li>
                                <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Place the heated rod securely on an anvil or a suitable bending jig/tool. Position it so the force can be applied effectively to create the desired bend.</li>
                                <li><strong>Applying Force:</strong> Use a hammer (e.g., sledgehammer or hand hammer depending on rod size) or a bending tool/press to apply force to the rod. For a simple bend over the anvil's edge (horn or heel), strike the overhanging portion downwards. For sharper bends or specific shapes, specialized bending forks or jigs might be used.</li>
                                <li><strong>Shaping:</strong> Apply controlled blows or pressure, gradually forming the bend. Reheat the rod as necessary if it cools too much before the bend is complete. Check the angle or shape against a template or drawing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Finishing/Cooling:</strong> Once the desired bend is achieved, the rod can be finished (e.g., smoothed, straightened) if needed and then allowed to cool (air cooling or quenching, depending on the material and desired properties).</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p><strong>(d) Labelled Diagram of an Anvil:</strong></p>
                             <p>Requires a sketch showing the main parts of a blacksmith's anvil.</p>
                             <ul>

                                         <li><strong>Horn (or Bick):</strong> The conical tapered end used for shaping curves, rings, and scrolls.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Heel:</strong> The flat, often unhardened, square end opposite the horn.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Step:</strong> A small step down between the face and the heel, sometimes used for cutting.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Hardie Hole:</strong> A square hole in the heel used to hold various anvil tools (hardies) like cutting or shaping stakes.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Pritchel Hole:</strong> A smaller round hole near the Hardie hole, used for punching holes in metal (allows the punch to pass through).</li>
                                         <li><strong>Body/Waist:</strong> The main mass of the anvil below the face.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Feet/Base:</strong> Provides stability, often with holes for bolting down.</li>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question covers mechanical fasteners, compares soldering and brazing, and deals with vernier scale reading and the use/care of files.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Fasteners and Joining Methods:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Applications of Mechanical Fasteners (Any Two):</strong> Mechanical fasteners (like bolts, nuts, screws, rivets, pins, clips) are used to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Assemble components together in machines, structures, and products (e.g., bolting engine parts, screwing furniture together).</li>
                                        <li>Allow for disassembly and reassembly of parts for maintenance or repair.</li>
                                        <li>Join dissimilar materials where welding or adhesives might be unsuitable.</li>
                                        <li>Provide temporary or permanent joints in construction and manufacturing.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Differences Between Soldering and Brazing (Four Differences):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Soldering uses filler metals (solders) that melt below 450°C, while brazing uses filler metals (brazing alloys) that melt above 450°C (but still below the melting point of the base metals).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Filler Metal Composition:</strong> Solders are typically tin-lead, tin-silver, tin-copper alloys. Brazing alloys are often copper-based (like brass - copper-zinc), silver-based, or aluminium-based alloys.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Joint Strength:</strong> Brazed joints are generally much stronger than soldered joints due to the higher melting point alloys and better diffusion into the base metal.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Capillary Action:</strong> Both rely on capillary action, but the mechanisms and joint clearances can differ. Brazing typically requires tighter clearances for optimal capillary flow and strength compared to general soldering.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Heat Source:</strong> Soldering often uses soldering irons, torches, or ovens. Brazing requires higher temperatures, typically using torches (oxy-fuel), furnaces, or induction heating.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Soldering is common for electronics, plumbing (copper pipes with specific solders), and sheet metal seams. Brazing is used for stronger joints in plumbing, refrigeration, tool manufacturing (carbide tips), and structural components.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Vernier Scale Reading (25.44 mm):</strong></p>
                            <p>Assumes a standard metric vernier caliper with a least count of 0.02 mm (common type).</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Main Scale Reading:</strong> Find the largest whole millimeter mark on the main scale that is visible to the left of the vernier scale's zero mark. In this case, it will be 25 mm.</li>
                                <li><strong>Vernier Scale Reading:</strong> Look along the vernier scale to find the division line that perfectly aligns with any line on the main scale. For a reading ending in .44 mm on a 0.02 mm least count vernier, the aligning line will be the 22nd division on the vernier scale (since $22 \times 0.02 \, \text{mm} = 0.44 \, \text{mm}$).</li>
                                <li><strong>Total Reading:</strong> Add the main scale reading and the vernier scale reading: $25 \, \text{mm} + 0.44 \, \text{mm} = 25.44 \, \text{mm}$.</li>
                                <li><strong>Drawing:</strong> The sketch should show the main scale with the 25 mm mark visible just before the vernier zero. The vernier scale should be positioned such that its 22nd division line aligns perfectly with a main scale line (e.g., the 25 + 22*0.02 = 25.44 aligns with main scale 25+22=47 approx? No, vernier 22 aligns with some main scale line). The vernier scale usually has markings 0, 1, 2... up to 10, representing 0.00, 0.10, 0.20 mm etc., with subdivisions for 0.02mm. The alignment should be at the 22nd mark after 0.</li>

                                        <li><strong>Use a File Card/Brush:</strong> Clean the file frequently during use with a file card (wire brush) to remove pinned metal chips (pinning) that clog the teeth and reduce cutting efficiency.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Store Properly:</strong> Do not throw files together in a drawer or toolbox where teeth can damage each other. Store them separately in racks, cloth rolls, or plastic sleeves.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Use Correctly:</strong> Apply pressure only on the forward stroke. Avoid dragging the file backward under pressure. Do not use a file as a hammer or pry bar. Use the right file type and cut for the job.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Keep Dry and Rust-Free:</strong> Avoid exposing files to moisture. Lightly oiling after use can help prevent rust, especially in humid environments (ensure oil is removed before next use if necessary). Fit a proper handle securely onto the tang before use for safety and control.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                <li><strong>(ii) Procedure for Fabricating an Open Box (Tinplate):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Design and Development:</strong> Determine the required dimensions of the box (length, width, height). Draw the development (flat pattern or net) of the box on paper, including the base and the four sides, plus allowances (flaps/tabs) for joining the corners (e.g., folded seams, soldered joints) and potentially for hemming the top edges.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Marking Out:</strong> Transfer the development pattern accurately onto the tinplate sheet using a scriber, engineer's square, and rule. Ensure marking blue is used if necessary for visibility. Mark fold lines clearly (often with dotted lines or light scratches).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> Carefully cut out the marked pattern using tin snips or bench shears. Notch the corners where the flaps are located.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Folding:</strong> Fold up the four sides along the marked fold lines using a folding bar or bending brake to form right angles with the base. Fold the corner joining flaps/tabs.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Joining Corners:</strong> Secure the corners using the chosen method. If using folded seams, interlock the flaps and hammer them flat. If soldering, clean the flaps, apply flux, clamp or hold the corner square, and apply solder using a soldering iron. Repeat for all four corners.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Edge Finishing (Optional):</strong> Hem the top edges (fold them over once or twice) for safety and stiffness if required by the design.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Clean the finished box, removing any flux residue, burrs, or marking lines.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><strong>F:</strong> Column / Pillar (Main vertical support)</li>
                                <li><strong>G:</strong> Base (Heavy bottom part for stability, mounts to bench)</li>
