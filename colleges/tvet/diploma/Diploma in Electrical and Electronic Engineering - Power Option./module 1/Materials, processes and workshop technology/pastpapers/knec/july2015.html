                                <li><strong>(i) Hardness:</strong> A material's resistance to surface indentation, scratching, or abrasion. It measures the ability to resist localized plastic deformation on the surface.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Toughness:</strong> A material's ability to absorb energy and deform plastically before fracturing. It combines strength and ductility and indicates resistance to fracture under impact or shock loading.</li>

                            <p>Distinction: Hardness relates to surface resistance, while toughness relates to the ability to absorb energy before breaking (often related to impact resistance).</p>

                            <p><strong>(d) Copper Alloys and Aluminium Extraction:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Copper Alloys (Any Two):</strong>
                                    <ul>

                                <li><strong>(ii) Extraction of Aluminium (Hall-Héroult Process):</strong>
                                    <p>Aluminium is primarily extracted from its ore, Bauxite (hydrated aluminium oxide, Al$_2$O$_3 \cdot n$H$_2$O), via electrolysis.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Purification (Bayer Process):</strong> Bauxite is first purified to obtain pure aluminium oxide (Alumina, Al$_2$O$_3$). Bauxite is treated with hot concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, which dissolves the alumina but not impurities like iron oxides. The solution is filtered, cooled, and seeded to precipitate pure aluminium hydroxide, which is then heated (calcined) to produce pure alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Electrolysis (Hall-Héroult):</strong> Pure alumina has a very high melting point (~2050°C). To lower the melting point for electrolysis, alumina is dissolved in molten Cryolite (Na$_3$AlF$_6$) at around 950-1000°C. This electrolysis occurs in a large steel cell lined with carbon (acting as the cathode) and having large carbon blocks suspended in the molten mixture (acting as anodes).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Reactions:</strong> A high electric current is passed through the molten mixture.
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>At the Cathode (-): Aluminium ions gain electrons and are reduced to molten aluminium metal, which collects at the bottom of the cell. $Al^{3+} + 3e^- \rightarrow Al(l)$</li>
                                                <li>At the Anode (+): Oxide ions lose electrons (oxidize). They react with the carbon anode to form carbon dioxide (and some carbon monoxide). $2O^{2-} \rightarrow O_2 + 4e^-$; followed by $C(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g)$. The carbon anodes are gradually consumed and need periodic replacement.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Molten aluminium is tapped off periodically from the bottom of the cell.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                        <li><strong>Sleeve Main Scale:</strong> The main scale on the sleeve is typically marked in millimetres (upper line) and half-millimetres (lower line). To show 2.96 mm, the edge of the thimble must have passed the '2' mm mark and the next half-millimetre mark (2.5 mm). So, the visible main scale reading is 2.5 mm.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Thimble Scale:</strong> The thimble scale is typically divided into 50 divisions, where each division represents 0.01 mm. To get the remaining 0.46 mm (since 2.96 - 2.5 = 0.46), the thimble must be rotated so that the 46th division (marked '46') aligns with the main datum line on the sleeve.</li>

                                        <li>Ensure the blade is mounted correctly with teeth pointing forward (away from the handle) and tensioned properly (firm but not overtight).</li>
                                        <li>Secure the workpiece firmly in a vice before starting to cut.</li>
                                        <li>Start the cut carefully, possibly using a thumb guide or a small file notch, applying light pressure.</li>
                                        <li>Use long, steady strokes utilizing most of the blade length, applying pressure only on the forward (cutting) stroke and relieving pressure on the return stroke.</li>
                                        <li>Avoid excessive speed or pressure, which can overheat or break the blade. Use cutting fluid where appropriate.</li>
                                        <li>Keep hands away from the blade during operation.</li>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question covers joining techniques (soldering, welding), mechanical fasteners, and welding specifics.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Soldering and Flux:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Soldering Definition:</strong> A process of joining two or more metal items by melting and flowing a filler metal (solder) into the joint. The solder has a lower melting point than the base metals being joined. The base metals are heated but not melted. Soldering is typically used for electrical connections or creating seals, using solders that melt below 450°C (soft soldering).</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Functions of Flux (Two Functions):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Removes oxides and other surface contaminants from the base metals, allowing the molten solder to 'wet' and bond effectively with the surfaces.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Forms a protective barrier over the heated joint area, preventing re-oxidation of the surfaces during the soldering process.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Improving Flow:</strong> Reduces the surface tension of the molten solder, helping it flow easily into the joint by capillary action.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                                 <li><strong>(i) Bolt and Nut:</strong> Sketch should show a bolt (threaded shaft with a head, e.g., hexagonal head) passing through clearance holes in parts to be joined, and a nut (internally threaded fastener) screwed onto the bolt's thread to clamp the parts together. A washer might also be shown under the nut or bolt head.</li>
                                 <li><strong>(ii) Stud:</strong> Sketch should show a headless fastener threaded at both ends. One end is screwed into a tapped hole in one component, and the other component is placed over the protruding threaded end, secured with a nut (and possibly washer).</li>

                                        <li>Provides strong, permanent joints, often as strong as or stronger than the base metal.</li>
                                        <li>Can create leak-proof joints required for pressure vessels or fluid containment.</li>

                                <li><strong>(ii) Welding Positions (Any Three):</strong> Standard positions define the orientation of the workpiece and weld axis relative to the horizontal plane:

                                        <li><strong>Flat Position (1G/1F):</strong> Welding performed from the upper side of the joint; the face of the weld is approximately horizontal. (Easiest position).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Horizontal Position (2G/2F):</strong> For a groove weld (G), the weld axis is horizontal. For a fillet weld (F), the weld axis is horizontal on a vertical surface or the underside of a horizontal surface.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Vertical Position (3G/3F):</strong> The weld axis is predominantly vertical. Welding can be performed upwards (uphill) or downwards (downhill).</li>

                             <p class="answer-intro">This question involves working with the geometry of a truncated cone shown in elevation. It requires constructing auxiliary orthographic views (plan, end elevation), the true shape of the cut surface, and the surface development of the remaining frustum.</p>
                            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>Redraw Elevation:</strong> Accurately copy the given Front Elevation from Figure 2, noting the base diameter, height (or apex position), and the cutting plane.</li>
                                 <li><strong>(a) Construct Plan View:</strong>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Project the base diameter downwards to draw the circular base in the Plan. Centre it below the Elevation's centre line.</li>
                                         <li>The cutting plane is shown as a line in the Elevation. To find its shape in the Plan (an ellipse), divide the base circle (Plan) into equal segments (e.g., 12). Project these points up to the base line in the Elevation.</li>
                                         <li>Draw generator lines from the cone's apex (or extended apex) through these base points in the Elevation. Mark where these generators intersect the cutting plane line.</li>
                                         <li>Project these intersection points vertically down to intersect the corresponding radial lines in the Plan.</li>
                                         <li>Draw a smooth elliptical curve through these points in the Plan.</li>
                                     </ul>
                                 </li>
                                 <li><strong>(b) Construct End Elevation:</strong> (Assuming a view from the right, drawn to the left in First Angle, or view from left drawn to right).
                                      <ul>
                                          <li>Project heights horizontally from the Elevation.</li>
                                          <li>Project widths (diameters at various heights) from the Plan, typically using a 45° projection line or by direct measurement.</li>
                                          <li>Draw the outline of the cone in the End Elevation (triangular profile).</li>
                                          <li>Project the points on the cutting plane from both the Elevation (for height) and Plan (for width/depth) to plot the elliptical cut shape in the End Elevation. Draw a smooth curve.</li>
                                      </ul>
                                 </li>
                                 <li><strong>(c) Construct True Shape of Cut Surface:</strong>
                                      <ul>
                                          <li>Draw projection lines perpendicular to the cutting plane line in the Elevation.</li>
                                          <li>Establish a datum line (X1-Y1) parallel to the cutting plane line.</li>
                                          <li>Measure the perpendicular widths of the cut ellipse in the Plan view (relative to its centre line).</li>
                                          <li>Transfer these widths onto the corresponding projection lines from the Elevation, measuring from the datum line X1-Y1.</li>
                                          <li>Draw a smooth curve (ellipse) through the plotted points.</li>
                                      </ul>

                                 <li><strong>(d) Construct Surface Development of Frustum:</strong>
                                      <ul>
                                          <li>Find the true slant height (L) of the original cone (from apex to base edge).</li>
                                          <li>Draw an arc with radius L. Determine the sector angle $\alpha = (R_{base}/L) \times 360^{\circ}$. Mark out this sector and divide its arc into the same number of segments (e.g., 12) as the Plan base. Draw radial lines from the development apex (O').</li>
                                          <li>Determine the true lengths from the apex to each point on the cutting plane intersection (these may need projection if not directly on edge generators in elevation).</li>
                                          <li>Measure these true lengths along the corresponding radial lines in the development, starting from O'.</li>
                                          <li>Draw a smooth curve connecting these points on the radial lines.</li>
                                          <li>The area between the base arc (radius L) and the top curve represents the developed lateral surface of the frustum.</li>

                             <p class="answer-intro">This question requires constructing an isometric view from given orthographic views (Front Elevation and Top Plan, assumed based on Third Angle layout), ensuring a specific corner (X) is the lowest point in the isometric drawing.</p>
                            <p><strong>Understanding Third Angle Projection:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Object imagined in the third quadrant (behind and below projection planes).</li>
                                <li>Plan (Top View) is ABOVE the Front Elevation.</li>
                                <li>End Elevation from the Right is drawn to the RIGHT of the Front Elevation.</li>
                                <li>End Elevation from the Left is drawn to the LEFT of the Front Elevation.</li>
                            </ul>
                             <p><strong>Analysis of Figure 3:</strong></p>
                             <ul>
                                 <li>Figure 3 shows a Front Elevation and a view above it (Plan).</li>
                                 <li>The object appears to be a base block with features cut out or added.</li>
                                 <li>Front Elevation shows height and width, including steps or slots.</li>
                                 <li>Plan shows width and depth, indicating the shape from above, including any angled surfaces or cutouts.</li>
                                 <li>Corner X is identified, likely on the front, bottom edge based on the view layout.</li>
                             </ul>
                             <p><strong>Isometric Construction Steps:</strong></p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>Orient Axes:</strong> Position the isometric axes (vertical, 30° left, 30° right) such that corner X, identified from the Front Elevation and Plan, is the origin/lowest point.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Overall Dimensions:</strong> Extract the overall Width, Depth, and Height from the given views.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Base Construction:</strong> Start drawing from corner X, laying out the base shape according to the Plan view dimensions along the Width and Depth isometric axes.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Build Vertically:</strong> Use heights from the Front Elevation to build up the features from the base plane along the vertical isometric axis.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Transfer Features:</strong> Carefully transfer shapes, steps, slots, and any angled surfaces from the Front Elevation and Plan onto the corresponding isometric planes. Ensure lines are drawn parallel to the main isometric axes unless they represent non-isometric lines (like angled surface edges).</li>
                                 <li><strong>Connect Points:</strong> Join the constructed points to form the complete object outline.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Refine:</strong> Check all connections and proportions. Darken visible object lines. Hidden lines are usually omitted in isometric views unless essential for clarity.</li>
                             </ol>
