                            <p class="answer-intro">This question covers general workshop safety, metal finishing, material properties and classification, and micrometer reading.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Workshop Safety Measures (Four):</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as safety glasses, sturdy footwear, gloves when needed.</li>
                                <li>Maintain good housekeeping: keep floors clear, tools stored properly, clean up spills immediately.</li>
                                <li>Use machine guards correctly and ensure they are in place before operating machinery.</li>
                                <li>Operate machines only after proper training and authorization.</li>
                                <li>Avoid loose clothing, jewelry, or untied long hair near moving machinery.</li>
                                <li>Report faulty equipment or unsafe conditions immediately.</li>
                                <li>Know the location and use of emergency stops and first aid facilities.</li>
                                <li>Use tools only for their intended purpose.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Metal Finishing Processes:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Enameling (Vitreous Enamelling):</strong> (Repeated from Nov 2015 Q2b) A process where a layer of powdered glass frit is applied to a metal surface (usually steel or cast iron) and fused to it by firing at high temperatures (750-850Â°C). This creates a hard, smooth, durable, corrosion-resistant, and often decorative glassy coating.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Electroplating:</strong> (Repeated from Nov 2018 Q1a, Nov 2015 Q2b, etc.) A process using electrolysis to deposit a thin layer of one metal onto another object. The object is the cathode, an anode (often of the plating metal) is used, and both are immersed in an electrolyte solution containing ions of the plating metal while a DC current is passed. Used for corrosion protection, appearance, or improving surface properties.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Material Properties and Classification:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Properties of Engineering Materials (Any Four):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Mechanical Properties: Strength (Tensile, Compressive, Shear), Hardness, Toughness, Ductility, Malleability, Elasticity, Stiffness, Fatigue Resistance, Creep Resistance.</li>
                                        <li>Physical Properties: Density, Melting Point, Thermal Conductivity, Electrical Conductivity/Resistivity, Coefficient of Thermal Expansion, Magnetic Properties.</li>
                                        <li>Chemical Properties: Corrosion Resistance, Reactivity.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Non-metals vs. Alloys Distinction:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Non-metals:</strong> Chemical elements that generally lack metallic properties (like luster, high conductivity, malleability). They are often insulators or semiconductors, can be gases, liquids, or brittle solids at room temperature.
                                            <br><em>Example:</em> Carbon (in diamond/graphite form), Sulfur, Phosphorus, Silicon, Oxygen, Rubber, Plastic, Wood, Glass.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Alloys:</strong> A mixture composed primarily of a metal and combined with one or more other elements (which can be metals or non-metals). Alloys are created to enhance properties like strength, hardness, or corrosion resistance compared to the pure base metal.
                                            <br><em>Example:</em> Steel (Iron + Carbon), Brass (Copper + Zinc), Bronze (Copper + Tin), Stainless Steel (Iron + Chromium + Nickel + Carbon), Duralumin (Aluminium + Copper + Magnesium + Manganese).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Distinction: Non-metals are elements lacking metallic characteristics. Alloys are mixtures based on a metal, designed to achieve specific properties.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(d) Micrometer Reading Sketch (5.54 mm):</strong></p>
                             <ul>
                                 <li><strong>Main Scale Reading:</strong> Thimble edge past 5 mm mark and past the 0.5 mm mark after it. Visible main scale = 5.5 mm.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Thimble Scale Reading:</strong> Remaining amount = $5.54 - 5.5 = 0.04 \, \text{mm}$. The thimble division aligning with the datum line is '4'.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Sketch:</strong> Show sleeve with 5 mm and 5.5 mm marks visible. Show thimble positioned past 5.5 mm mark, with the '4' mark on its scale aligned with the sleeve datum line.</li>

The tailstock quill can be fed manually using a handwheel. Can be offset for turning slight tapers.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Headstock:</strong> (Repeated from Nov 2016 Q2c) Located at one end of the bed (usually left), it contains the main spindle which rotates the workpiece.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Function:</strong> Houses the drive mechanism (motor, gears, belts) to provide various spindle speeds. The spindle holds the workpiece securely using devices like chucks, collets, or faceplates. It provides the power and rotation for the machining operations.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Turning:</strong> The fundamental lathe operation of removing material from the outside diameter of a rotating workpiece to reduce its diameter, produce cylindrical or tapered shapes, or create specific profiles. A cutting tool is fed parallel to the axis of rotation (longitudinal feed).</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Drilling:</strong> Creating a hole along the axis of rotation of a workpiece mounted in the lathe chuck. A drill bit is held stationary in the tailstock chuck or spindle and fed axially into the rotating workpiece using the tailstock handwheel.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Types of Grinding Machines (Two Common):</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Bench Grinder:</strong> A common workshop machine with abrasive wheels mounted on a motor spindle, used for sharpening tools (chisels, drill bits), deburring, or general shaping/smoothing of metal parts held by hand against a tool rest.</li>
                                <li><strong>Surface Grinder:</strong> A precision machine tool used to produce very flat surfaces with a fine finish. The workpiece is held on a reciprocating or rotating table (often magnetic), and a rotating abrasive wheel grinds the surface.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cylindrical Grinder:</strong> Used to grind external or internal cylindrical surfaces and shoulders accurately. The workpiece rotates between centres or in a chuck while the rotating grinding wheel traverses along it or plunges in.</li>
                                <li><strong>Pedestal Grinder:</strong> Similar to a bench grinder but mounted on a floor stand (pedestal).</li>
                            </ul>

                             <p><strong>(d) Bench Drilling Machine Parts (Fig. 1 Labels A-E):</strong></p>

                             <ul>
                                 <li><strong>A: Chuck Key Hole/Chuck:</strong> Assuming A points to the chuck (holds the drill bit) or the key hole used to tighten it. Function: Securely holds the drill bit.</li>
                                 <li><strong>B: Spindle/Quill:</strong> The rotating shaft that holds the chuck and moves vertically. Function: Rotates the cutting tool and provides feed motion.</li>
                                 <li><strong>C: Feed Lever Handle(s):</strong> Used to manually lower and raise the spindle/quill. Function: Control the drilling feed rate.</li>
                                 <li><strong>D: Table:</strong> Supports the workpiece. Function: Provide a stable platform for the workpiece, often adjustable in height.</li>
                                 <li><strong>E: Column/Pillar:</strong> The main vertical support structure. Function: Supports the head and table, provides rigidity.</li>
                             </ul>
                              <p class="key-point">Exact identification depends on precisely where the label lines point on the actual Figure 1.</p>

Often a single main view (e.g., front elevation showing the clamp open or partially closed) is sufficient, possibly with a section view if internal details need clarification (though not explicitly asked for).</li>
                                 <li><strong>Draw Main Component:</strong> Start by drawing the C-frame in the chosen orientation.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Add Screw:</strong> Draw the threaded screw engaged in the tapped hole of the frame. Show it partially screwed in.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Add Handle:</strong> Draw the handle inserted through the head of the screw.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Add Swivel Pad:</strong> Draw the swivel pad attached to the end of the screw.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Ensure all parts are drawn in their correct assembled positions relative to each other.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Sectioning (Optional):</strong> If internal details are complex, a section view through the screw/frame might be useful, but usually not required for a basic assembly drawing unless requested.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Balloons/Item Numbers:</strong> Add balloon callouts (circles with numbers inside, connected by leader lines) pointing to each distinct part in the assembly view.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Overall Dimensions (Optional):</strong> Sometimes key assembly dimensions (like maximum opening) are added, but often dimensions are left off assembly drawings, referring back to part drawings. (Instructions don't ask for dimensions here).</li>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question involves determining the lines of intersection between a cylinder and a square pyramid intersecting at right angles, and completing the associated orthographic views.</p>
                            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Copy Given Views:</strong> Accurately redraw the incomplete Front Elevation and Plan views provided in Figure 4, showing the relative positions and dimensions of the cylinder and pyramid. Establish the projection type used (assume First or Third Angle based on typical conventions if not stated).</li>
                                <li><strong>(b) Determine Line of Intersection:</strong> This is the core task. Since a curved surface (cylinder) intersects flat surfaces (pyramid faces), the intersection lines will be curves.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Method: Use Cutting Planes or Element Lines.</strong>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Cutting Planes Parallel to Cylinder Base:</strong> Imagine horizontal cutting planes passing through the intersection zone. Each plane cuts a circle on the cylinder and a square (or smaller square towards apex) on the pyramid. Find the intersection points of these circles and squares in the Plan view. Project these points up to the corresponding cutting plane level in the Elevation.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Element Lines on Cylinder:</strong> Divide the cylinder profile (Plan view circle) into equal segments (e.g., 12). Draw element lines along the cylinder surface parallel to its axis in both Plan and Elevation. Find where each element line pierces the flat faces of the pyramid (this might require finding the intersection of a line with a plane in 3D space, projectable in the views). Plot these piercing points in both views.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Plotting:</strong> Systematically find multiple intersection points using the chosen method. Connect these points with smooth curves in both the Elevation and Plan views. Pay close attention to visibility (which part of the curve is in front/behind or above/below other surfaces).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(a) Complete Elevation and Plan:</strong> Once the intersection curves are plotted, complete the views by showing which lines are visible and which are hidden. Draw the full outlines of both solids, stopping lines where they meet the intersection curve or become hidden. Use solid lines for visible edges and dashed lines for hidden edges.</li>
                                <li><strong>(c) Complete End Elevation:</strong> (Assuming Right End View drawn to the right in Third Angle, or Left End View drawn to the right in First Angle).
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Project heights horizontally from the completed Front Elevation.</li>
                                         <li>Project depths from the completed Plan view (using 45-degree projection or measurement).</li>
                                         <li>Draw the end view outlines of both the cylinder and the pyramid.</li>
                                         <li>Project the points defining the lines of intersection from both the Front Elevation (heights) and Plan (depths) to accurately plot the intersection curves in the End Elevation. Determine visibility and draw solid/hidden lines accordingly.</li>
                                     </ul>
                                </li>
