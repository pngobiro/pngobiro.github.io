                            <p class="answer-intro">This question covers material properties, surface finishing, filing techniques, and aluminium extraction.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Material Properties Explained:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Hardness:</strong> (Repeated from July 2015 Q1c & July 2014 Q2a) A material's resistance to scratching, abrasion, indentation, or penetration by another harder material. It relates to wear resistance.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Malleability:</strong> (Repeated from July 2016 Q1c) The ability of a material to deform plastically under compressive stress without fracturing. It is commonly characterized by the ability to be hammered or rolled into thin sheets.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Finishing Processes:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Reasons for Finishing (Two):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Protection:</strong> To protect the underlying material from corrosion, wear, abrasion, or environmental degradation (e.g., painting, plating, anodizing).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Appearance/Aesthetics:</strong> To improve the visual appeal of the product (e.g., polishing, painting, texturing, decorative plating).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Improved Functionality:</strong> To provide specific surface properties like reduced friction (lubricious coatings), increased hardness (case hardening), improved electrical insulation, or better adhesion.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Cleaning/Hygiene:</strong> To provide a smooth, easily cleanable surface (e.g., enamel on cookware, stainless steel polish).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Lacquering vs. Enamelling Distinction:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Lacquering:</strong> Applying a thin layer of lacquer (a clear or coloured coating, typically solvent-based, made from resins like nitrocellulose or acrylic) that dries by solvent evaporation to form a hard, protective film. It's generally applied at room temperature or slightly elevated temperatures and provides moderate protection and aesthetic enhancement, often used on wood or metal.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Enamelling (Vitreous Enamelling):</strong> Applying a layer of powdered glass frit (mixed with pigments) to a metal surface and firing it at high temperatures (750-850°C). The glass melts, fuses to the metal, and solidifies upon cooling to form a hard, durable, glassy, corrosion-resistant coating. Provides much higher durability and heat resistance than lacquer. (See also Nov 2015 Q2b).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Distinction: Key differences are the coating material (resin vs. glass), application temperature (low vs. high temperature firing), and resulting properties (lacquer is less durable/heat resistant than enamel).</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Techniques of Filing (Assuming Cross and Draw Filing):</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Cross Filing:</strong> The file is pushed diagonally across the workpiece surface (e.g., at roughly 45° to the edge). On the next pass, the direction is changed to be diagonal in the opposite direction, creating a cross-hatched pattern. This method is used for rapid material removal and achieving a reasonably flat surface.</li>
                                <li><strong>Draw Filing:</strong> The file is held with both hands (one on the handle, one on the file tip) perpendicular to the direction of motion. It is then pushed and pulled along the length of the workpiece surface without lifting. This technique produces a finer finish than cross filing and is used for final smoothing, straightening edges, and removing marks left by cross filing. It removes less material per stroke.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(d) Extraction of Aluminium by Electrolysis (Labelled Diagram):</strong></p>
                            <p>(Repeated from July 2015 Q1d)</p>
                            <p>The process is the Hall-Héroult process.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Purified Alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$) is dissolved in molten Cryolite (Na$_3$AlF$_6$) in a large electrolysis cell.</li>
                                <li>The cell has a carbon lining acting as the cathode (-).</li>
                                <li>Carbon blocks suspended in the melt act as anodes (+).</li>
                                <li>High current passes through the melt (~1000°C).</li>
                                <li>Aluminium ions (Al$^{3+}$) are reduced at the cathode to molten aluminium.</li>
                                <li>Oxide ions (O$^{2-}$) are oxidized at the anode, reacting with the carbon to form CO$_2$.</li>

                            <p><strong>(b) Reasons for Using Cutting Fluid with High Speed Tools (Two):</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> High-speed cutting generates significant heat at the tool-workpiece interface. Cutting fluid absorbs and carries away this heat, preventing the tool from overheating (which can cause softening, rapid wear, or failure) and preventing thermal damage to the workpiece.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lubrication:</strong> Reduces friction between the cutting tool face and the chip, and between the tool flank and the newly machined surface. This reduces cutting forces, lowers heat generation, improves surface finish, and reduces tool wear (especially built-up edge formation).</li>
                                <li><strong>Chip Removal:</strong> Helps flush away chips from the cutting zone, preventing them from interfering with the cutting action or damaging the surface finish.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Lathe Machine Part Functions:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Bed:</strong> The main foundation and structural base of the lathe. It provides a rigid platform and accurately machined guideways (ways) upon which the carriage, tailstock, and other components slide. Its rigidity and accuracy are crucial for precision machining.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Headstock:</strong> Located at one end of the bed (usually the left), it houses the main spindle, the drive mechanism (motor, gears, belts) to rotate the spindle, and often the gear train for selecting spindle speeds and controlling feeds for threading. The spindle holds the workpiece via a chuck or faceplate.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(d) Sketches of 'Left Hand' Lathe Cutting Tools:</strong></p>
                            <p>"Left Hand" typically means the tool cuts when fed from right to left (towards the headstock). Sketches should show the tool bit shape, particularly the cutting edge angles.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Facing Tool (Left Hand):</strong> Designed to cut on the end face of the workpiece. The main cutting edge is angled to allow the tool to feed radially outwards from the center when facing. A left-hand facing tool would typically have its main cutting edge angled such that it cuts effectively as it moves towards the operator when facing the end near the tailstock. Often has a sharp point or small nose radius.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Roughing Tool (Left Hand):</strong> Designed for rapid removal of material along the diameter (turning). Often has a larger nose radius than a finishing tool for strength and may have chipbreaker geometry. The side cutting edge angle is oriented to lead into the cut when feeding leftwards.</li>
                                <li><strong>(iii) Finishing Tool (Left Hand):</strong> Designed to produce a smooth surface finish and accurate final dimension. Typically has a smaller side cutting edge angle and often a larger nose radius than a pointed roughing tool (but smaller than a round nose rougher) to smooth the surface. Cuts are light.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h4>Answer</h4>
                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-3">
                            <p class="answer-intro">This question deals with measurement concepts (tolerance, fits), basic measuring tools (steel rule, vernier callipers), and hand tool usage (hacksaw).</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Tolerance Definition:</strong></p>
                            <p>(Repeated from July 2016 Q2c) Tolerance is the total permissible variation allowed in the size or dimension of a manufactured part. It is the difference between the maximum and minimum permissible limits of size (upper limit - lower limit). Tolerance defines the acceptable range of inaccuracy for a dimension.</p>

                            <p><strong>(b) Fits and Steel Rule Functions:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Categories of Fits (Three):</strong> Fit refers to the degree of tightness or looseness between two mating parts (e.g., a shaft and a hole) resulting from the difference in their sizes before assembly. Based on the relationship between the tolerance zones of the hole and shaft:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Clearance Fit:</strong> Always results in a clearance (gap) between the mating parts when assembled (largest shaft is smaller than the smallest hole). Allows relative motion (e.g., sliding, rotation).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Interference Fit (Press Fit):</strong> Always results in an interference (overlap) between the mating parts before assembly (smallest shaft is larger than the largest hole). Requires force or temperature difference to assemble, resulting in a tight, fixed joint.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Transition Fit:</strong> May result in either a clearance or an interference depending on the actual sizes of the mating parts within their tolerance zones. Used where accurate location is needed but assembly/disassembly without excessive force is desired.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Functions of a Steel Rule (Three):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Measuring lengths and dimensions directly with moderate accuracy (typically to 0.5mm or 1/64 inch).</li>
                                        <li>Setting or transferring measurements to other tools like dividers or calipers.</li>
                                        <li>Providing a straight edge for drawing or scribing straight lines.</li>
                                        <li>Checking surfaces for flatness over short distances (using the edge).</li>
                                    </ol>

                                <li><strong>(i) Factors for Selecting Hacksaw Blade (Two):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Material Being Cut:</strong> Harder materials require blades made of harder material (e.g., High-Speed Steel - HSS, Bi-Metal) and often finer teeth. Softer materials can use less expensive blades (e.g., High Carbon Steel) and coarser teeth.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Thickness/Cross-Section of Material:</strong> The number of teeth per inch (TPI) should be chosen so that at least two or three teeth are in contact with the workpiece thickness at any time. Use finer TPI (e.g., 24-32 TPI) for thin sections (sheet metal, tubing) and coarser TPI (e.g., 14-18 TPI) for thicker sections (solid bars).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Type of Frame:</strong> Ensure the blade length matches the hacksaw frame.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Desired Finish/Cutting Speed:</strong> Coarser teeth cut faster but leave a rougher finish; finer teeth cut slower but leave a smoother finish.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Safety Precautions When Using Hacksaw (Three):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Ensure the workpiece is securely clamped in a vice to prevent movement during cutting.</li>
                                        <li>Mount the blade correctly with teeth pointing forward (away from the handle) and ensure proper tension (firm but not overtightened, check frame instructions).</li>
                                        <li>Use steady, controlled strokes, applying pressure only on the forward stroke and using most of the blade length. Avoid excessive force or speed.</li>
                                        <li>Keep hands and fingers clear of the blade and the workpiece edges during operation.</li>
                                        <li>Wear safety glasses to protect eyes from flying chips.</li>
                                        <li>If a blade breaks, stop immediately and replace it carefully, ensuring the replacement is correctly tensioned.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                             <p class="answer-intro">This question covers metal joining methods (mechanical and thermal), sheet metal seams, fabrication machines, and grinding safety.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Metal Joining Processes Described:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Riveting:</strong> A method of creating a permanent mechanical joint between two or more pieces of material (usually metal plates) using rivets. Holes are drilled or punched through the overlapping parts. A rivet (a metal pin with a pre-formed head on one end) is inserted through the holes. The plain end (tail) of the rivet is then deformed (upset) using a hammer or a riveting gun to form a second head, securely clamping the parts together.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Bolting:</strong> A method of creating a non-permanent (demountable) mechanical joint using bolts and nuts. A bolt (a threaded fastener with a head) is passed through clearance holes in the parts to be joined. A nut (an internally threaded fastener) is then screwed onto the protruding thread of the bolt. Tightening the nut clamps the parts together. Washers are often used under the bolt head and/or nut.</li>

                            <p>Key distinctions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Soft soldering uses filler metals melting below 450°C; Brazing uses filler metals melting above 450°C (but below base metal melting point).</li>
                                <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Brazed joints are significantly stronger than soft soldered joints.</li>
                                <li><strong>Filler Metals:</strong> Soft solders are typically tin-based alloys; Brazing alloys are typically copper, silver, or aluminium based.</li>
                                <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Soft soldering for electronics, light sheet metal, some plumbing; Brazing for stronger structural joints, plumbing, tool tipping.</li>

                                 <li><strong>(ii) Slip Joint (Not a standard self-secured seam, maybe means a simple overlap or specific type?):</strong> If referring to a simple ducting slip joint, one pipe end is slightly smaller (crimped) to slide inside the larger end of the next section, often secured with screws or tape, not truly self-secured by folding. If referring to a type of folded seam used for adjustability or sliding, needs clarification. Assuming a simple folded edge connection: Two edges folded, one slips into the other's fold.

                                        <li><strong>Eye Protection:</strong> ALWAYS wear safety glasses or a full face shield to protect against flying sparks, abrasive particles, and fragments from the wheel or tool.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Wheel Condition Check:</strong> Before starting, visually inspect the grinding wheel for cracks or damage. Perform a 'ring test' (tap gently with a non-metallic handle) on larger wheels – a good wheel sounds clear, a cracked one sounds dull. Ensure the wheel is rated for the grinder's speed.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Tool Rest Adjustment:</strong> Adjust the tool rest so it is close to the wheel (typically 1-3 mm gap) and slightly below the wheel centerline. This prevents the tool from being jammed between the rest and the wheel. Ensure the rest is securely tightened.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Proper Grinding Technique:</strong> Hold the tool firmly against the tool rest. Apply gradual pressure. Keep the tool moving across the face of the wheel to ensure even wear and prevent overheating of the tool tip. Cool the tool frequently in water (if appropriate for the tool steel) to prevent loss of temper.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Wheel Guards:</strong> Ensure all guards are securely in place and properly adjusted. Stand to one side of the wheel when starting the grinder, not directly in line.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Avoid Side Grinding:</strong> Do not grind on the side of a standard bench grinding wheel unless it is specifically designed for side grinding.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                                          <li>This requires finding the true lengths of the pyramid's slant edges and base edges.</li>
                                          <li>Use radial line development. Find the true length of a slant edge (e.g., by rotating an edge in the plan until it's parallel to the view line for the elevation, then project up to find true length in elevation, or use Pythagoras if height and base diagonal/2 are known).</li>
                                          <li>Using the true slant edge length as radius, draw an arc from an apex point O'.</li>
                                          <li>Step off the base side lengths (true lengths) along this arc using compasses. Since it's a square base, step off four equal lengths.</li>
                                          <li>Connect the endpoints on the arc back to the apex O' to form the four triangular faces of the pyramid.</li>
                                          <li>Determine the true shape of the intersection lines on each pyramid face (where the prism cuts through). This involves finding the true distances from the apex along the slant edges (or element lines on the faces) to the intersection points.</li>
                                          <li>Transfer these true distances onto the corresponding lines in the development.</li>
                                          <li>Connect these points on the development to show the shape of the hole or cut needed to accommodate the intersecting prism.</li>
                                          <li>Add the square base attached to one of the base edges in the development if full development is required.</li>

                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-7">
                             <p class="answer-intro">This question involves constructing the locus of a point on a mechanism and constructing a regular hexagon within a given circle.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Locus Construction (Slider-Crank Variation):</strong></p>
                            <p>This mechanism is a variation of the slider-crank mechanism. Crank OA rotates about fixed point O. Link AB connects the crank pin A to a slider B, which moves along the straight path XY passing through O.</p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>Redraw the Mechanism:</strong> Draw the fixed point O, the path XY passing through O, the crank OA in its initial position (as shown or choose one, e.g., horizontal right), and the link AB connecting A to a point B on XY. Mark the midpoint M of AB. Note the lengths OA and AB from the figure.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Divide Crank Rotation:</strong> Divide the circular path of point A (circle centered at O with radius OA) into a number of equal divisions, representing equal time intervals for one revolution (e.g., 12 divisions, 30° each). Label these points A0, A1, A2,... A12=A0.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Plot Slider Positions:</strong> For each position of A (A0, A1, A2,...), determine the corresponding position of B on the line XY. To do this, set the compass radius to the length of the link AB. Place the compass point at the current position of A (e.g., A1) and draw an arc intersecting the line XY. This intersection point is the corresponding position of B (B1). Repeat for all positions A0 to A11.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Plot Midpoint Positions:</strong> For each pair of corresponding points (A0, B0), (A1, B1), (A2, B2), etc., find the midpoint M. This can be done by construction (bisecting the line segment A_i B_i) or measurement. Label these midpoints M0, M1, M2,... M11.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Draw the Locus:</strong> Draw a smooth curve connecting the plotted midpoint positions M0, M1, M2,... M11 back to M0. This curve is the required locus of the midpoint M for one full revolution of the crank OA. The locus will likely be an oval or elliptical shape.</li>
                             </ol>

                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>Draw Circle:</strong> Draw the circle with center O and radius R = 40 mm.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Mark Starting Point:</strong> Choose any point P on the circumference as the first vertex.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Step off Radius:</strong> Set the compass radius to the radius of the circle (R = 40 mm). The side length of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle is equal to the circle's radius.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Mark Vertices:</strong> Place the compass point at P and draw an arc intersecting the circle. This is the second vertex (Q). Move the compass point to Q and draw another arc intersecting the circle (R). Continue this process around the circle (S, T, U). The sixth arc should intersect back at the starting point P.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Connect Vertices:</strong> Join the consecutive vertices P-Q-R-S-T-U-P with straight lines using the ruler to form the regular hexagon inscribed in the circle.</li>
