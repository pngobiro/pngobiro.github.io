                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Types of Electrical Hazards (Any Three):</strong>
                                    <ul>

                                        <li>Explosions (ignition of flammable atmospheres by sparks).</li>
                                        <li>Arc Flash/Blast (sudden release of energy due to an arc fault).</li>
                                        <li>Static Electricity hazards.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Effects of Exposure to Hazardous Substances (Any Three):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Skin irritation, burns, or dermatitis (e.g., from solvents, acids).</li>
                                        <li>Respiratory problems, asthma, or lung damage (e.g., from dust, fumes, vapors).</li>
                                        <li>Poisoning (systemic effects) if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed (e.g., lead, mercury, certain solvents).</li>
                                        <li>Eye irritation or damage (e.g., from splashes, fumes).</li>
                                        <li>Allergic reactions or sensitization.</li>
                                        <li>Long-term effects like cancer or organ damage (carcinogens, toxins).</li>
                                        <li>Asphyxiation (displacement of oxygen by gases like CO2, nitrogen).</li>
                                    </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Minimizing Electrical Hazards:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Double Insulation:</strong> This safety measure, often found on portable appliances (indicated by a square within a square symbol), uses two layers of insulation â€“ basic insulation and supplementary insulation. This eliminates the need for an earth connection, as even if the basic insulation fails, the supplementary layer prevents the outer casing from becoming live.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Earthing (Grounding):</strong> Connecting the metal casings of electrical equipment to the earth via a low-resistance conductor (earth wire). If a fault causes a live wire to touch the casing, a large current flows to earth, tripping a protective device (fuse or circuit breaker) and disconnecting the power supply, thus preventing electric shock from touching the faulty appliance.</li>
                                <li><strong>(iii) Safe Voltages (Reduced Low Voltage Systems):</strong> Using voltages significantly lower than standard mains voltage (e.g., 110V centre-tapped to earth, providing 55V to earth, or even lower voltages like 12V or 24V) in hazardous environments (like construction sites, damp locations) or for certain portable tools. This reduces the potential severity of an electric shock if contact occurs.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Factory's Act Safety Precautions (Two for each):</strong></p>
                             <p class="key-point">Note: The specific wording might vary based on the exact version/jurisdiction of the Act (e.g., Factories Act Cap 514 in Kenya, replaced/updated by OSHA 2007). General principles include:</p>

                                 <li><strong>(i) Engineering (Assuming Engraving or Engine Turning):</strong>
                                    <br><strong>Engraving:</strong> The process of cutting grooves or patterns into a hard surface, usually metal, using a sharp tool (graver) or specialized machinery (laser, CNC). It's used for decoration, marking identification, or creating printing plates.
                                    <br><strong>Engine Turning (GuillochÃ©):</strong> A precision mechanical engraving technique that creates intricate, repetitive patterns (like intersecting circles or waves) on metal surfaces, often used on watch dials, jewelry, or high-quality metalwork for decorative effect. It uses a specialized lathe called a rose engine or straight line engine.
                                    <p class="key-point">The term "engineering" alone as a finishing process is ambiguous. Engraving or Engine Turning are plausible interpretations in this context.</p>

                                <li><strong>(ii) Etching:</strong> A process using strong acid or mordant (etching agent) to cut into the unprotected parts of a metal surface to create a design or pattern in intaglio (incised). The process involves:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Applying a protective, acid-resistant coating (resist) to the metal surface.</li>
                                        <li>Removing the resist from the areas intended to be etched, exposing the metal.</li>
                                        <li>Immersing the metal in the etching solution (acid bath), which selectively dissolves the exposed metal.</li>
                                        <li>Removing the metal from the bath and cleaning off the remaining resist. Used for decoration, creating printing plates (printmaking), or manufacturing printed circuit boards (PCBs).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                            <p><strong>(d) Outline of Electroplating Process:</strong></p>
                             <p>(Repeated from Q3b(i) of 2010 paper)</p>
                            <p>Electroplating uses electric current to deposit a thin layer of one metal onto another object (the substrate) primarily for protection, appearance, or improved surface properties.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> The object to be plated (substrate) is thoroughly cleaned to remove dirt, grease, and oxides. This is crucial for good adhesion.</li>
                                <li><strong>Setup:</strong> An electrolytic cell is set up. The cleaned object acts as the cathode (negative electrode). The anode (positive electrode) is often made of the metal being plated (e.g., copper anode for copper plating). Both electrodes are immersed in an electrolyte solution containing ions of the plating metal (e.g., copper sulfate solution for copper plating).</li>
                                <li><strong>Electrolysis:</strong> A DC power source is connected. Current flows, causing positive metal ions from the electrolyte to migrate to the cathode (the object).</li>
                                <li><strong>Deposition:</strong> At the cathode, the metal ions gain electrons (reduction) and are deposited as a thin, solid metal layer onto the object's surface. (e.g., Cu$^{2+}$ + 2e$^-$ $\rightarrow$ Cu(s)).</li>
                                <li><strong>Anode Reaction:</strong> If the anode is made of the plating metal, it dissolves (oxidizes), replenishing the metal ions in the electrolyte. (e.g., Cu(s) $\rightarrow$ Cu$^{2+}$ + 2e$^-$). If an inert anode is used, the electrolyte needs periodic replenishment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Completion:</strong> The process continues until the desired coating thickness is achieved. The object is then removed, rinsed, and dried.</li>
                            </ol>

                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-3">
                             <p class="answer-intro">This question focuses on terminology and practices related to precision measurement and marking out in a workshop setting.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Measurement Terms Definitions:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Limits:</strong> The maximum and minimum permissible sizes (dimensions) for a specific feature of a workpiece. They define the acceptable range within which the actual dimension must fall for the part to be functional and interchangeable. For example, a shaft diameter might be specified as 25.00 mm +0.02/-0.01, meaning the upper limit is 25.02 mm and the lower limit is 24.99 mm.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Tolerance:</strong> The total permissible variation in a dimension. It is the difference between the upper limit and the lower limit of size. In the example above, the tolerance is (25.02 - 24.99) = 0.03 mm. Tolerance represents the allowable inaccuracy in manufacturing.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Need for Marking Out and Tools:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Need for Marking Out:</strong> Marking out (or layout) is the process of transferring dimensions and shapes from a drawing onto a workpiece before machining or fabrication. It is necessary to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Guide the machinist or fabricator during cutting, drilling, filing, or shaping operations.</li>
                                        <li>Ensure the final component meets the required dimensions and specifications accurately.</li>
                                        <li>Minimize material wastage by ensuring operations are performed in the correct locations.</li>
                                        <li>Serve as a visual check before and during manufacturing.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Marking Out Tools (Any Two):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Scriber: Used to scratch fine lines onto metal surfaces.</li>
                                        <li>Engineer's Try Square: Used to mark lines perpendicular to an edge and check for squareness.</li>
                                        <li>Centre Punch / Dot Punch: Used to make small indentations to mark centres for drilling or to make layout lines more permanent.</li>
                                        <li>Dividers: Used to scribe circles and arcs, or transfer measurements.</li>
                                        <li>Odd-leg Calipers (Jenny Calipers): Used to scribe lines parallel to an edge or find the centre of round bars.</li>
                                        <li>Surface Plate: A flat, stable reference surface on which marking out is performed.</li>
                                        <li>Angle Plate: Used to hold workpieces square to the surface plate.</li>
                                        <li>Vee Block: Used to hold cylindrical workpieces securely for marking or drilling.</li>
                                        <li>Vernier Height Gauge / Scribing Block: Used with a surface plate to scribe accurate horizontal lines at specific heights.</li>
                                        <li>Marking Blue / Layout Dye: Applied to the surface to make scribed lines more visible.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Marking Out Techniques:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Scribing:</strong> The technique of using a sharp-pointed tool, called a scriber, to scratch thin, precise lines onto the surface of a workpiece (often coated with marking blue). These lines indicate where material should be cut, bent, or drilled. The scriber is typically guided along a straight edge (like a rule or square) or using instruments like dividers or a height gauge.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Centre Punching:</strong> The technique of using a centre punch (which has a conical point, typically 90Â°) and a hammer to create a small, conical indentation at a specific point on the workpiece surface. This indentation serves primarily as a starting point to accurately guide a drill bit and prevent it from wandering when starting a hole. A dot punch (typically 60Â° point) is used similarly but creates smaller indentations to make scribed lines more permanent or mark intersections without creating too large a hole for drilling.</li>
                            </ul>

                             <p><strong>(d) Instrument Drawings:</strong></p>
                             <p>These require actual technical drawings.</p>
                             <ul>

                                    <p class="key-point">Note: Exact SWG values can vary slightly depending on the standard reference.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Cylinder Construction Length:</strong>
                                    <p>Sheet metal SWG = 19 (Thickness = 1.0 mm, though thickness isn't needed for this calculation).</p>
                                    <p>Cylinder Outside Diameter (OD) = 150 mm.</p>
                                    <p>The question asks for the length of the *square* sheet metal required. This is highly ambiguous. It most likely means the length of the *rectangular* sheet metal piece needed to form the cylinder's curved surface (i.e., the circumference).</p>
                                    <p>Assuming the OD refers to the finished cylinder:</p>
                                    <p>The length required for the curved surface is the circumference based on the mean diameter or accounting for bending allowance. A simpler approach often used is to calculate the circumference based on the neutral axis, roughly the middle of the thickness.</p>
                                    <p>Mean Diameter = OD - Thickness = 150 mm - 1.0 mm = 149 mm.</p>
                                    <p>Circumference = $\pi \times \text{Mean Diameter} = \pi \times 149 \approx 468.1 \, \text{mm}$.</p>
                                    <p>If we ignore the thickness effect and use the OD: Circumference = $\pi \times OD = \pi \times 150 \approx 471.2 \, \text{mm}$.</p>
                                    <p>This circumference value would be the required length of the rectangular sheet metal piece (plus any overlap allowance for a seam, which isn't mentioned).</p>
                                    <p class="key-point">If the question genuinely means a *square* sheet, it's unanswerable without knowing the cylinder's height or how the square is used. Assuming it asks for the length dimension of the rectangle needed for the cylinder body (circumference), the length required is approximately 468-471 mm, depending on the calculation method (plus seam allowance).</p>

                            <p><strong>(b) Drilling Machine Parts Functions:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Pillar (or Column):</strong> The main vertical support structure of the drill press. It holds the head (containing the motor and spindle assembly) and the worktable, providing rigidity and alignment for the drilling operation.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Spindle:</strong> The rotating shaft that holds the drill chuck or directly mounts the drill bit. It transmits the rotational motion from the motor (via belts and pulleys or gears) to the cutting tool and also allows for vertical feed movement into the workpiece.</li>
                                <li><strong>(iii) Handwheel (or Feed Lever):</strong> The lever or wheel operated by the user to manually control the vertical downward movement (feed) of the rotating spindle and drill bit into the workpiece. Releasing it allows a spring mechanism to retract the spindle.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Metal Joining Methods Descriptions:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Oxy-acetylene Welding:</strong> A gas welding process that uses the combustion of oxygen and acetylene gases to produce a very high-temperature flame (approx. 3200Â°C). This flame melts the edges of the base metals to be joined. Often, a filler rod of similar composition is melted into the joint pool to add material and ensure a strong bond as the molten metal solidifies.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Arc Welding:</strong> A group of welding processes that use an electric arc formed between an electrode and the base metal to melt the metals at the joining point. The intense heat of the arc creates a molten weld pool. Examples include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW or Stick): Uses a consumable electrode coated in flux.</li>
                                        <li>Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW or MIG): Uses a continuously fed wire electrode and a shielding gas.</li>
                                        <li>Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW or TIG): Uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode, often a separate filler rod, and a shielding gas.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(d) Lathe Chucks Distinction:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Three-Jaw Self Centering Scroll Chuck:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Has three jaws that move simultaneously (radially inwards or outwards) when a single key (chuck key) is turned.</li>
                                        <li>Automatically centers cylindrical or hexagonal workpieces quickly and with reasonable accuracy.</li>
                                        <li>Cannot easily hold square, rectangular, or irregular shapes concentrically.</li>
                                        <li>Less gripping force compared to a four-jaw chuck for the same size.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Four-Jaw Independent Chuck:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Has four jaws, each of which can be moved independently of the others using separate adjusting screws (keys).</li>
                                        <li>Can hold square, rectangular, irregular, or cylindrical workpieces.</li>
                                        <li>Allows for precise centering of workpieces (using a dial indicator) or intentionally offsetting the workpiece for eccentric turning.</li>
                                        <li>Requires more time and skill to set up and center the workpiece accurately.</li>
                                        <li>Generally provides a stronger grip than a three-jaw chuck.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>The top view (Plan) is below the Front Elevation.</li>

                                <li>The Plan shows the top view shape, indicating widths and depths, possibly cutouts or angled surfaces.</li>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Orient the Axes:</strong> Determine the orientation of the isometric axes (typically vertical, 30Â° left, 30Â° right) so that corner N (identified from the Plan and Front Elevation) becomes the lowest point of the drawing. This means the Width, Depth, and Height axes will originate from point N.</li>
                                <li><strong>Overall Dimensions:</strong> Extract the overall Width, Depth, and Height from the Front Elevation and Plan views.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bounding Box (Optional but helpful):</strong> Draw a light isometric box representing these overall dimensions, starting from corner N.</li>
                                <li><strong>Transfer Features from Plan:</strong> Project the shape seen in the Plan view onto the base plane of the isometric drawing (the plane defined by the Width and Depth axes starting at N). Transfer key points and lines along the isometric axes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Transfer Features from Elevation:</strong> Project heights from the Front Elevation vertically upwards along the Height axis from the corresponding points established on the base plane.</li>
                                <li><strong>Connect Points:</strong> Connect the transferred points with lines parallel to the isometric axes to define the edges and surfaces of the object. Pay attention to visible and hidden lines (though isometric views often omit hidden lines unless specifically requested or necessary for clarity).</li>
                                <li><strong>Refine and Darken:</strong> Check the proportions and connections. Darken the visible object lines and erase construction lines.</li>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question involves working with the geometry of a truncated cone, requiring the construction of the plan view, the true shape of the cut surface, and the surface development of the remaining frustum.</p>
                            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Redraw the Elevation:</strong> Accurately copy the given Front Elevation of the truncated cone from Figure 3, including the base diameter, height (or apex position if shown/implied), and the cutting plane angle/position.</li>

                                <li><strong>(i) Construct the Plan View:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Project the base diameter vertically downwards from the Elevation to draw the circular base in the Plan view.</li>
                                        <li>The cutting plane intersects the cone, forming an ellipse in the Plan view (since the cut is oblique).</li>
                                        <li>Divide the base circle in the Plan into a number of equal parts (e.g., 12). Project these points up to the base line in the Elevation.</li>
                                        <li>Draw generator lines from the apex (or extended apex if only frustum is shown) through these base points in the Elevation, extending up to the cutting plane.</li>
                                        <li>Mark the points where these generators intersect the cutting plane in the Elevation.</li>
                                        <li>Project these intersection points vertically downwards to the corresponding radial lines (drawn from the centre to the division points on the base circle) in the Plan view.</li>
                                        <li>Draw a smooth curve through these projected points in the Plan to represent the elliptical cut surface.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>(ii) Construct the True Shape of the Cut Surface:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Draw projection lines perpendicular to the cutting plane line in the Elevation from the intersection points found earlier.</li>
                                        <li>Establish a datum line (X1-Y1) parallel to the cutting plane line in the Elevation.</li>
                                        <li>Measure the perpendicular distances (widths) of the points on the elliptical cut surface in the Plan view from a centre line (parallel to the projection lines).</li>
                                        <li>Transfer these widths onto the corresponding projection lines drawn from the Elevation, measuring outwards from the datum line X1-Y1.</li>
                                        <li>Draw a smooth curve through these plotted points to obtain the true shape (which will be an ellipse).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>(iii) Construct the Development of the Truncated Cone (Frustum):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Determine the true slant height (L) of the original (untruncated) cone. This is the length from the apex to the base along the cone surface, visible in the Elevation if the generator is parallel to the viewing plane, or needs calculation/projection otherwise. Let the apex be O, base radius R.</li>
                                        <li>Using the true slant height L as the radius, draw a large arc from a center point O'.</li>
                                        <li>Calculate the angle of the sector required for the full cone development: $\alpha = (R/L) \times 360^{\circ}$.</li>
                                        <li>Mark out this sector angle $\alpha$ on the large arc. The arc length of this sector should equal the base circumference ($2\pi R$). Divide this arc into the same number of equal parts (e.g., 12) as the Plan base circle. Draw radial lines from O' to these division points.</li>
                                        <li>Transfer the true lengths of the generators from the apex (O) to the cutting plane intersections in the Elevation onto the corresponding radial lines in the development, measuring from O'. (True lengths might need to be found by rotation if not directly visible).</li>
                                        <li>Draw a smooth curve connecting these points on the radial lines in the development.</li>
                                        <li>The area between the large base arc and this smooth curve represents the development of the lateral surface of the truncated cone (frustum).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>The side length (s) of a regular hexagon is related to the distance across flats (A/F) by $A/F = s \sqrt{3}$. So, $s = (A/F) / \sqrt{3} = 70 / \sqrt{3} \approx 40.4 \, \text{mm}$.</li>
                                <li>The distance across corners (A/C) is $A/C = 2s = 2 \times (70 / \sqrt{3}) \approx 80.8 \, \text{mm}$. The radius of the circumscribing circle is $R = s = 70 / \sqrt{3}$. The radius of the inscribing circle (tangent to flats) is $r = (A/F)/2 = 35 \, \text{mm}$.</li>
                                <li>Draw the inscribed circle with radius 35 mm centered on the intersection of the centre lines drawn in step 2.</li>
                                <li>Using a 60Â° set square (or compasses), draw tangent lines to this circle at 60Â° intervals, starting from the top or bottom flat line intersection. These tangent lines will form the hexagon. Draw tangents at 0Â°, 60Â°, 120Â°, 180Â°, 240Â°, 300Â° relative to the vertical center line, ensuring they touch the circle. The intersection points of these tangents form the vertices.</li>
                            </ol>
                             <p><strong>Method 2 (Direct Construction with 60Â°):</strong></p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li>Draw two parallel horizontal lines 70 mm apart.</li>
                                 <li>Draw a vertical centre line intersecting these lines at points A and B.</li>
                                 <li>Using a 60Â°/30Â° set square, draw lines from A at 60Â° to the horizontal (i.e., 30Â° to the vertical centre line) outwards in both directions.</li>
                                 <li>Similarly, draw lines from B at 60Â° to the horizontal outwards in both directions.</li>
                                 <li>The intersection of the lines from A with the bottom horizontal line, and the lines from B with the top horizontal line, define four vertices.</li>
                                 <li>The remaining two vertices lie on the horizontal centre line. Alternatively, the length of the side where the 60Â° line meets the parallel line can be used to mark other sides. The intersection points of the 60Â° lines form the hexagon outline. The points on the parallel lines are the midpoints of the sides.</li>
                                  <li>Connect the appropriate intersection points to form the hexagon. The sides should be parallel to the 60Â° construction lines or horizontal.</li>
