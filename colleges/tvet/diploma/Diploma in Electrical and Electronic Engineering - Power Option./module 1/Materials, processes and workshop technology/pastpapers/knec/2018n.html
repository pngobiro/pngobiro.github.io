                            <p><strong>(a) Soldering Bit and Flux:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) (I) Functions of a Soldering Bit (Tip):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Heat Transfer:</strong> Conducts heat efficiently from the soldering iron's heating element to the joint (workpiece and solder).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Solder Application/Manipulation:</strong> Holds a small amount of molten solder (via wetting/'tinning') and allows the user to transfer and flow the solder precisely into the joint.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Melting Solder:</strong> Provides the localized heat needed to melt the solder wire.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(i) (II) Factors Determining Soldering Bit Size/Shape:</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Size/Mass of the Joint:</strong> Larger joints require larger, more massive bits to store and transfer sufficient heat quickly without excessive cooling (thermal mass). Smaller bits are used for delicate electronic components.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Accessibility of the Joint:</strong> The shape of the bit (e.g., chisel, conical, bevelled, bent) is chosen based on the access needed to reach the joint area effectively.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Type of Work:</strong> Different shapes are suited for different tasks (e.g., chisel for wire/tag connections, conical for through-hole components, hoof for drag soldering).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Power Rating of the Iron:</strong> The bit size must be compatible with the heating capacity of the soldering iron.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Requirements of a Good Soldering Flux:</strong> (Repeated from July 2016 Q3a)
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Chemically removes oxides from base metals at soldering temperature.</li>
                                        <li>Prevents re-oxidation of surfaces during heating.</li>
                                        <li>Promotes wetting/flow of molten solder.</li>
                                        <li>Residue should be non-corrosive or easily removable.</li>
                                        <li>Activation temperature compatible with solder.</li>
                                    </ol>

                            <p><strong>(b) Oxy-Acetylene Welding:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Process Explanation:</strong> (Repeated from July 2014 Q4c) A gas welding process using a high-temperature flame produced by burning acetylene fuel gas with pure oxygen. The heat melts the edges of the base metals. Usually, a filler rod of similar metal is melted into the joint pool to add material and form the weld bead upon solidification. The flame characteristics (neutral, oxidizing, carburizing) can be adjusted by varying the gas mixture ratio.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Neutral Flame Sketch:</strong>
                                    <p>Requires a sketch of the flame shape.</p>

                             <ul>
                                 <li><strong>Forging:</strong> (Repeated from July 2017 Q1c) A process where metal is shaped by applying compressive forces (hammering/pressing), usually when the metal is heated to a plastic state (hot forging). The metal remains solid throughout. Results in a refined grain structure and improved mechanical properties (strength, toughness).</li>
                                 <li><strong>Casting (Foundry Work):</strong> (Repeated from July 2017 Q1c) A process where molten metal is poured into a mold cavity having the desired shape and allowed to cool and solidify. The resulting part (casting) takes the shape of the mold. Suitable for complex shapes but generally has different mechanical properties compared to forged parts due to solidification structure.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Distinction:</strong> Forging shapes solid metal using force (often heated); Casting shapes liquid metal by pouring it into a mold to solidify.</li>
                             </ul>

                            <p><strong>(d) Sketches of Locking Devices:</strong></p>

                                <li><strong>(i) The Stud:</strong> (Repeated from July 2015 Q3b) Sketch should show the stud (threaded at both ends) screwed into a tapped hole in one component (Part 1). The second component (Part 2) is placed over the protruding end, and a nut (and possibly washer) is tightened onto the stud to clamp Part 2 to Part 1.

                                <li><strong>(ii) Set Bolt (Setscrew):</strong> A set bolt (more commonly called a setscrew) is typically fully threaded and often headless (e.g., grub screw) or has a socket head. It's used to secure one part relative to another, often preventing rotation (like locking a pulley onto a shaft). It does this by screwing through a tapped hole in the outer part until its point presses firmly against (or into a small depression in) the inner part.
                                    <br><em>Sketching a common application:</em> Show a collar or hub (Outer Part) on a shaft (Inner Part). Sketch the setscrew passing through a tapped hole in the hub and its point pressing against the shaft surface.

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Toughness:</strong> (Repeated from July 2014 Q2a & July 2015 Q1c) A material's ability to absorb energy and deform plastically without fracturing, especially under impact or shock loading. It represents resistance to fracture initiation and propagation.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Conductivity:</strong> (Repeated from Nov 2015 Q2a) The ability of a material to conduct energy, usually referring to either electrical conductivity (ease of electric current flow) or thermal conductivity (ease of heat energy flow).</li>

                            <p><strong>(b) Cast Iron vs. Wrought Iron Distinction:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Cast Iron:</strong> An alloy of iron with a high carbon content (typically 2% - 4%) and significant silicon content (1% - 3%), along with other impurities.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Hard, brittle, relatively weak in tension, excellent compressive strength, good wear resistance, excellent castability (low melting point, fluid when molten), good damping capacity.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Carbon exists primarily as graphite flakes (grey cast iron) or iron carbide/cementite (white cast iron).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Production:</strong> Produced by re-melting pig iron (from blast furnace) with scrap iron/steel in a cupola furnace and casting into molds.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Wrought Iron:</strong> A form of commercial iron with very low carbon content (typically < 0.08%) and containing fibrous slag inclusions (iron silicate).
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Softer, more ductile, and tougher than cast iron; good tensile strength; easily welded and forged; resistant to corrosion and fatigue.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Consists mainly of ferrite (pure iron) with elongated slag fibers interspersed within it.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Production (Historical):</strong> Produced by refining pig iron in a puddling furnace, removing most carbon and incorporating slag. Largely obsolete now, replaced by mild steel.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Distinction:</strong> Key differences are carbon content (high in cast iron, very low in wrought iron), presence of slag fibers (wrought iron), and resulting properties (cast iron is hard/brittle/castable, wrought iron is soft/ductile/forgeable).</li>
                            </ul>

                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-3">
                            <p class="answer-intro">This question focuses on measurement scales, dividers, micrometer usage, and tool safety (scribers).</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Linear vs. Non-linear Scale:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Linear Scale:</strong> A scale where the divisions are spaced equally along its length, representing equal increments of the measured quantity. The relationship between the scale reading and the quantity is directly proportional. Examples: Standard ruler (mm/cm/inches), main scale of vernier calipers/micrometers, linear scale on an ammeter measuring current directly.</li>
                                <li><strong>Non-linear Scale:</strong> A scale where the divisions are not spaced equally. The distance between marks changes along the scale, representing unequal increments for equal changes in reading, or vice-versa. This occurs when the relationship between the measured quantity and the indicator's movement is non-linear. Examples: Ohmmeter scale on an analog multimeter (often cramped at high resistance end), logarithmic scales (like pH scale or decibel scale represented linearly), some pressure gauges.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Difference:</strong> Equal distances on a linear scale represent equal changes in value; on a non-linear scale, equal distances represent unequal changes in value (or vice-versa).</p>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question covers general workshop hazards, appropriate dress code, specific lathe operations, and identification of drilling machine components.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Workshop Hazards and Dress Code:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Workshop Hazards (Any Three):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Mechanical Hazards: Moving/rotating machinery parts (entanglement, impact, crushing), sharp tools, falling objects.</li>
                                        <li>Electrical Hazards: Electric shock, burns, fires from faulty wiring or equipment.</li>
                                        <li>Fire Hazards: Flammable materials (solvents, oils), sparks from grinding/welding, overloaded circuits.</li>
                                        <li>Chemical Hazards: Exposure to solvents, acids, cleaning agents, fumes, dust (skin contact, inhalation).</li>
                                        <li>Slips, Trips, and Falls: Wet floors, clutter, trailing cables, uneven surfaces.</li>
                                        <li>Noise Hazards: High noise levels from machinery causing hearing damage.</li>
                                        <li>Manual Handling Hazards: Lifting heavy objects improperly causing strains/sprains.</li>
                                        <li>Radiation Hazards: UV light from welding, laser hazards.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Workshop Dressing Code Explained:</strong> The dressing code aims to minimize risks associated with clothing and personal items interacting dangerously with the workshop environment, especially machinery. Key aspects include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Appropriate Clothing:</strong> Wear sturdy, close-fitting clothing (e.g., overalls, workshop coats). Avoid loose sleeves, baggy trousers, or anything that could easily get caught in moving parts.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Footwear:</strong> Wear strong, fully enclosed shoes, preferably safety boots with steel toe caps and non-slip soles. No sandals, open-toed shoes, or high heels.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Hair and Jewelry:</strong> Tie back long hair securely. Remove or secure necklaces, bracelets, rings, and watches, as they can get caught in machinery or conduct electricity.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):</strong> Wear mandatory PPE such as safety glasses/goggles at all times. Use additional PPE like gloves, ear defenders, respirators, or face shields as required by the specific task or machine.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Knurling:</strong> (Repeated from July 2016 Q4c) A forming process (not cutting) used to create a regular, patterned texture (diamond or straight lines) on a cylindrical surface. A knurling tool with hardened, patterned wheels is pressed against the rotating workpiece, displacing metal to form the raised pattern, typically to improve grip.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Facing:</strong> (Repeated from July 2016 Q4c) A machining operation to create a flat surface on the end of a workpiece, perpendicular to its axis of rotation. The cutting tool is fed radially across the end face while the workpiece rotates in the chuck.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Labelled Diagram of Bench Drilling Machine:</strong></p>

                                 <li>Corner P is identified, likely a front-bottom corner based on typical layout.</li>
                                 <li>Dimensions need to be extracted from the Front Elevation and Plan views.</li>

                                 <li><strong>Orient Axes:</strong> Set up isometric axes (vertical, 30° left, 30° right) originating from corner P as the lowest point. Determine Width, Depth, Height directions relative to P based on the views.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Overall Dimensions:</strong> Find the object's maximum Width, Height, and Depth from the views.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Construct Base/Framework:</strong> Start drawing from P, laying out the main features along the isometric axes using dimensions from the Plan (for width/depth) and Front Elevation (for height). An isometric bounding box can be helpful.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Transfer Details:</strong> Carefully transfer all steps, slots, curves, and other features shown in the orthographic views onto the isometric framework. Remember circles become ellipses. Draw lines parallel to the isometric axes.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Refine and Darken:</strong> Complete the outline, ensuring all lines connect correctly. Darken visible object lines and erase construction lines. Omit hidden lines unless needed for clarity.</li>
