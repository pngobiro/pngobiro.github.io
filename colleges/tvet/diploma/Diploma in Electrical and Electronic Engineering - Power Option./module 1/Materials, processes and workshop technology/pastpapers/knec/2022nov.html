                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-1">
                            <p class="answer-intro">This question deals with causes of workshop accidents, principles of workshop layout, and first aid for burns.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Contributions to Accidents:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Carelessness:</strong> Rushing work, not paying attention to the task, taking shortcuts, failing to use safety guards, or general lack of focus can lead to mistakes like mishandling tools, incorrect machine operation, or ignoring hazards, directly causing injury or damage. For example, not looking where one is walking can lead to tripping over an obstacle.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Ignorance:</strong> Lack of knowledge about the correct operating procedures for machinery, the properties of materials being handled, or the specific hazards involved in a process can lead to unintentional unsafe actions. For example, attempting to operate a complex machine without proper training might lead to incorrect setup and an accident.</li>
                                <li><strong>(iii) Unsuitable Clothing:</strong> Wearing loose clothing (baggy sleeves, ties), jewelry (rings, necklaces), or having long, untied hair can lead to entanglement in rotating machinery parts (like lathes, drills), pulling the person into the machine and causing severe injury. Inappropriate footwear (sandals, high heels) can lead to slips, trips, or foot injuries.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Workshop Layout:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Workshop Layout Explained:</strong> The physical arrangement and positioning of machinery, equipment, workstations, storage areas, aisles, offices, and service facilities within a workshop space. The goal is to optimize efficiency, safety, workflow, material handling, and supervision while considering space utilization and flexibility.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Factors in Workshop Layout (Four):</strong> (Repeated from Nov 2017 Q1a)
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Workflow/Process Sequence:</strong> Logical arrangement according to production steps.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Space Requirements:</strong> Adequate space for operation, maintenance, storage, movement.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Safety and Health:</strong> Hazard minimization, clear exits, lighting, ventilation.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Material Handling:</strong> Efficient movement of materials and components.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Flexibility/Future Expansion:</strong> Adaptability to changes.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Utilities Access:</strong> Power, air, water requirements.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Supervision and Communication:</strong> Visibility for supervisors, ease of communication.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Employee Comfort/Welfare:</strong> Rest areas, washrooms, ergonomics.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) First Aid for Burns and Scalds:</strong></p>
                            <p>(Repeated from Nov 2021 Q1c)</p>
                            <ol class="step-by-step">
                                <li class="step"><strong>Safety First:</strong> Ensure the cause of the burn is removed/neutralized (stop the burning).</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Cool Immediately:</strong> Apply cool (not ice-cold) running water for 10-20 minutes.</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Remove Constrictions:</strong> Gently remove tight clothing, rings, watches before swelling occurs (unless stuck to the burn).</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Cover Loosely:</strong> Use a sterile, non-fluffy dressing (e.g., gauze, cling film).</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Keep Warm:</strong> Prevent hypothermia by keeping the casualty warm (blanket), but don't put blankets on the burn.</li>
                                <li class="step"><strong>Seek Medical Help:</strong> Get professional medical advice for anything more than a minor superficial burn, or for burns in sensitive areas, electrical/chemical burns, large burns, or burns in infants/elderly.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p class="answer-conclusion">Understanding how carelessness, ignorance, and improper attire cause accidents is key to prevention. Effective workshop layout enhances safety and efficiency. Prompt and correct first aid for burns minimizes damage.</p>

                                          <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> Used primarily for symmetrical objects. Two cutting planes at right angles pass halfway through the object (meeting at the axis of symmetry). One quarter of the object is imagined removed. The view shows half as an external view and half as a section view, separated by a centre line.</li>
                                          <li><strong>Illustration:</strong> Draw the elevation. Show half (e.g., right side) as a normal external view (including hidden lines for the hole if needed). Show the other half (e.g., left side) as a section view (hatching the cut material). Use a centre line to divide the two halves.</li>

The cross-section is imagined to be revolved 90 degrees and drawn in place, often superimposed on the feature with a break around it.</li>
                                          <li><strong>Illustration:</strong> Draw the elevation (or plan). Imagine cutting through the square block perpendicular to its axis. Revolve this square cross-section (with the square hole) by 90 degrees and draw it directly on the view, perhaps centered on the axis line. Use thin lines for the section outline.</li>

Allows for clearer viewing and dimensioning of the section.</li>
                                          <li><strong>Illustration:</strong> Draw the elevation (or plan). Indicate a cutting plane line (e.g., B-B) where the section is taken. Draw the cross-sectional shape (square with square hole) separately nearby, labeling it "SECTION B-B". Hatch the solid material.</li>

                             <p><strong>Understanding Third Angle Projection:</strong></p>
                             <ul>
                                 <li>Plan (Top View) is ABOVE the Front Elevation.</li>
