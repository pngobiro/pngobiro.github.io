                            <p class="answer-intro">This question covers first aid, metal treatment processes (finishing, heat treatment, forming), and vernier scale reading.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) First Aid:</strong></p>
                            <ul>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Stop:</strong> Tell the person to stop immediately, not to run (running fans the flames).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Drop:</strong> Help the person drop to the ground quickly.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Roll:</strong> Instruct or help the person to roll over and over on the ground to smother the flames. If available, cover the person (except the face/airway) with a heavy blanket, rug, or fire blanket to help extinguish the flames.</li>
                                        <li>Once flames are out, cool burns with cool running water and seek immediate medical attention.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>

                            <p><strong>(b) Metal Finishes and Processes:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Pickling:</strong> A surface treatment process used to remove impurities, such as scale (oxides formed during hot working), rust, or stains, from the surface of metals, typically steel. It involves immersing the metal in an acid solution (the pickling liquor), commonly sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. This chemical cleaning prepares the surface for subsequent processes like coating, plating, or painting.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Annealing:</strong> A heat treatment process used to alter the physical and sometimes chemical properties of a material to increase its ductility, reduce its hardness, and make it more workable (easier to shape or machine). It involves heating the material to a specific temperature (above its recrystallization temperature), holding it at that temperature for a sufficient time, and then cooling it slowly (often within the furnace). This process relieves internal stresses, refines the grain structure, and improves uniformity.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(c) Metal Forming Processes:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Forging:</strong> A manufacturing process involving the shaping of metal using localized compressive forces delivered by hammering (manual or power hammers) or pressing. The metal is often heated (hot forging) to make it more plastic and easier to shape, although cold forging is also used. Forging refines the grain structure of the metal, generally leading to improved strength and toughness compared to casting or machining. Used to make parts like crankshafts, connecting rods, hand tools, and bolts.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Foundry Work (Casting):</strong> A manufacturing process where molten metal is poured into a mold cavity having the desired shape. The molten metal cools and solidifies within the mold, taking its shape. The solidified part (the casting) is then removed from the mold. Common casting methods include sand casting, die casting, and investment casting. It is used to create complex shapes that might be difficult or costly to produce by other methods.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(d) Vernier Scale Reading (10.02 cm = 100.2 mm):</strong></p>
                            <p>Requires drawing the scales to show this reading. Assume a standard metric vernier caliper with 0.02 mm least count.</p>
                             <ul>
                                 <li>Convert reading: $10.02 \, \text{cm} = 100.20 \, \text{mm}$.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Main Scale Reading:</strong> The largest whole millimeter mark visible to the left of the vernier zero will be 100 mm.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Vernier Scale Reading:</strong> We need to read the remaining 0.20 mm. Find the vernier scale division line that aligns perfectly with a main scale line. Since the least count is 0.02 mm, the aligning line will be $0.20 \, \text{mm} / 0.02 \, \text{mm/division} = 10$. The 10th division line on the vernier scale aligns with a main scale line.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Drawing:</strong> Sketch the main scale showing the 100 mm mark (e.g., '10' if marked in cm) visible just before the vernier zero. Draw the vernier scale positioned so its 10th division aligns exactly with a line on the main scale.</li>
                             </ul>

                                        <li><strong>Always Use a Handle:</strong> Never use a file without a securely fitted handle, as the sharp tang can cause serious hand injury.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Store Separately:</strong> Do not store files loose together where their teeth can damage each other. Use racks, rolls, or individual sleeves.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Keep Clean:</strong> Use a file card or wire brush frequently during use to remove pinned chips, which impair cutting and can scratch the work.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Apply Forward Pressure Only:</strong> Files cut only on the forward stroke; lift slightly or relieve pressure on the return stroke to avoid dulling the teeth.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Keep Dry:</strong> Protect files from moisture to prevent rusting.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Use for Intended Purpose:</strong> Do not use a file as a hammer, pry bar, or scraper.</li>

                                <li><strong>(i) Reaming:</strong> An operation used to slightly enlarge a previously drilled hole to a very precise diameter and improve its surface finish and roundness. A reamer (a multi-fluted cutting tool) is rotated slowly and fed into the hole, removing only a small amount of material.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Boring:</strong> An operation used to enlarge an existing hole (drilled or cast) to a precise diameter, ensuring it is concentric with the axis of rotation. Unlike reaming which follows the existing hole path, boring uses a single-point cutting tool mounted on a boring bar, allowing the hole to be straightened and accurately sized, even if the initial hole was slightly off-center or irregular. Can be done on a drill press (less common), lathe, or milling machine.</li>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Conductors:</strong> Materials that allow electric current to flow easily due to the presence of free electrons. They have low electrical resistivity. Examples: Copper, Aluminium, Silver, Gold, Steel.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Insulators (Dielectrics):</strong> Materials that strongly resist the flow of electric current because their electrons are tightly bound. They have high electrical resistivity. Examples: Rubber, Plastic (PVC, Polyethylene), Glass, Ceramics, Dry Air, Mica, Porcelain.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> Materials with electrical conductivity intermediate between conductors and insulators. Their conductivity can be significantly altered by temperature, light, or the addition of impurities (doping). Examples: Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs).</li>
                                        <li>(Sometimes Magnetic Materials are considered a separate electrical classification due to their interaction with magnetic fields, important in transformers, motors etc. Examples: Iron, Nickel, Cobalt, Ferrites).</li>
                                    </ol>

                            <p><strong>(b) Corrosion:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Corrosion Explained:</strong> The gradual destruction or degradation of a material, usually a metal, by chemical or electrochemical reaction with its environment. Common examples include the rusting of iron/steel (oxidation in the presence of oxygen and water) and the tarnishing of silver. It often results in the formation of oxides, sulfides, or other compounds on the metal surface.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Factors Determining Corrosion Rate (Any Three):</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Nature of the Metal:</strong> Some metals are inherently more reactive or noble than others (e.g., gold is very resistant, sodium is very reactive). Position in the electrochemical series matters.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Presence of Electrolyte:</strong> Corrosion, especially electrochemical corrosion, requires an electrolyte (like moisture containing dissolved salts or pollutants) to allow ion movement. Purity of water affects conductivity.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Presence of Oxygen (or other Oxidizing Agents):</strong> Oxygen is often required for the cathodic reaction in aqueous corrosion (like rusting).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Generally, higher temperatures increase the rate of chemical reactions, including corrosion.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Acidity/Alkalinity (pH):</strong> The pH of the environment can significantly affect the stability of passive films and the rate of corrosion reactions.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Flow Rate/Velocity (for fluids):</strong> High flow rates can accelerate erosion-corrosion by removing protective layers.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Presence of Impurities/Alloying Elements:</strong> Impurities in the metal or specific alloying elements can form local galvanic cells, accelerating corrosion, or form protective passive layers (like chromium in stainless steel).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Mechanical Stress:</strong> Stressed areas can be more susceptible to certain types of corrosion (stress corrosion cracking).</li>

                            <p><strong>(c) Extraction of Iron (Blast Furnace):</strong></p>
                            <p>Iron is extracted from its ore (commonly Hematite - Fe$_2$O$_3$, or Magnetite - Fe$_3$O$_4$) in a blast furnace.</p>
                             <p><strong>Process Description:</strong></p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>Charge Input:</strong> Iron ore, Coke (carbon source and fuel), and Limestone (CaCO$_3$ - flux) are loaded into the top of the tall, shaft-like furnace in alternating layers.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Hot Air Blast:</strong> Preheated air (around 1000-1200°C) is blown into the bottom of the furnace through nozzles called tuyeres.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Combustion:</strong> The coke burns in the hot air, producing carbon dioxide and intense heat: $C + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + \text{Heat}$.</li>
                                 <li><strong>CO Production:</strong> At the high temperatures in the lower furnace, carbon dioxide reacts with more hot coke to produce carbon monoxide, the main reducing agent: $CO_2 + C \rightarrow 2CO$.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Reduction of Iron Ore:</strong> Carbon monoxide moves up the furnace and reduces the iron oxides in the ore to iron metal. This occurs in stages at different temperatures:
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Upper part (lower temp): $3Fe_2O_3 + CO \rightarrow 2Fe_3O_4 + CO_2$</li>
                                         <li>Middle part: $Fe_3O_4 + CO \rightarrow 3FeO + CO_2$</li>
                                         <li>Lower part (higher temp): $FeO + CO \rightarrow Fe + CO_2$</li>
                                         <li>Direct reduction by carbon also occurs at very high temperatures: $FeO + C \rightarrow Fe + CO$.</li>
                                     </ul>
                                 </li>
                                  <li><strong>Flux Action:</strong> Limestone decomposes in the heat ($CaCO_3 \rightarrow CaO + CO_2$). The calcium oxide (CaO), a basic oxide, reacts with acidic impurities in the ore (like silica, SiO$_2$) to form molten calcium silicate, known as slag: $CaO + SiO_2 \rightarrow CaSiO_3(l)$.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Molten iron (called 'pig iron', containing about 4% carbon) and the lighter molten slag collect at the bottom (hearth) of the furnace in separate layers. They are periodically tapped off through separate tap holes.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Waste Gases:</strong> Hot waste gases (containing N$_2$ from air, CO, CO$_2$) exit from the top of the furnace and are often used to preheat the incoming air blast.</li>
                             </ol>

                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-5">
                             <p class="answer-intro">This question involves geometric constructions: plotting a cycloid locus, constructing tangent circles, and constructing a regular pentagon.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Locus of Point P (Cycloid Construction):</strong></p>
                            <p>The path traced by a point on the circumference of a circle as it rolls without slipping along a straight line is called a cycloid.</p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Draw the straight line path (baseline). Draw the rolling circle (diameter 40 mm, radius R=20 mm) tangent to the baseline at the starting position of point P.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Distance for One Revolution:</strong> The distance the circle's center travels along the baseline for one full revolution is equal to the circle's circumference: $C = \pi D = \pi \times 40 \approx 125.7 \, \text{mm}$. Mark this distance along the baseline from the start point.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Divide Circle and Path:</strong> Divide the rolling circle into a number of equal segments (e.g., 12 segments, 30° each). Label the points on the circumference P0 (start), P1, P2,... P12=P0. Divide the baseline distance (Circumference C) into the same number of equal segments. Mark the positions of the circle's center C0, C1, C2,... C12 as it rolls along these segments. The height of the center remains constant (Radius R) above the baseline.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Plot Points:</strong> For each position of the center (C1, C2, etc.), the original point P will have rotated by a corresponding angle (30°, 60°, etc.) relative to its starting position (usually bottom or top).
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>When the center is at C1 (1/12th revolution), point P has moved from the bottom to the position corresponding to 30° rotation. Locate P1 relative to C1 (radius R away from C1 at the 30° rotated position).</li>
                                         <li>When the center is at C2 (2/12th revolution), P has rotated 60°. Locate P2 relative to C2.</li>
                                         <li>Continue this for all 12 positions. For position Ci, locate point Pi by considering a rotation of $i \times 30^{\circ}$ around the center Ci, relative to the initial position of P.</li>
                                     </ul>
                                 </li>
                                  <li><strong>Draw Locus:</strong> Draw a smooth curve connecting the plotted points P0, P1, P2,... P12. This curve is the cycloid. It consists of a series of arches.</li>
                             </ol>

                            <p><strong>(b) Inscribing Tangent Circles:</strong></p>
                             <p class="key-point">This problem is ambiguous. "Inscribe" usually means inside, and "touch each other" usually implies external tangency between the inscribed circles, and internal tangency with the outer circle. Assuming this interpretation:</p>
                             <p>Given: Outer circle diameter 80 mm (Radius R = 40 mm). Inscribed circles radii r1 = 20 mm, r2 = 15 mm. Find positions where circles C1 (radius r1) and C2 (radius r2) are inside C (radius R), C1 and C2 touch each other externally, and both C1 and C2 touch C internally.</p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li>Draw the outer circle C with center O and radius R=40 mm.</li>
                                 <li>The center of C1 (O1) must be R - r1 = 40 - 20 = 20 mm away from O. O1 lies on a circle centered at O with radius 20 mm.</li>
                                 <li>The center of C2 (O2) must be R - r2 = 40 - 15 = 25 mm away from O. O2 lies on a circle centered at O with radius 25 mm.</li>
                                 <li>Since C1 and C2 touch externally, the distance between their centers O1 and O2 must be r1 + r2 = 20 + 15 = 35 mm.</li>
                                 <li>To find the positions:
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>Choose a point O1 on the circle of radius 20 mm (centered at O).</li>
                                         <li>Set compass radius to r1 + r2 = 35 mm. Place compass point at O1 and draw an arc.</li>
                                         <li>This arc must intersect the circle of radius 25 mm (centered at O). The intersection point(s) are the possible locations for O2.</li>
                                         <li>Geometric Check: Do these circles intersect? We have a triangle OO1O2 with sides OO1=20, OO2=25, O1O2=35. Check triangle inequality: 20+25 > 35 (45>35), 20+35 > 25 (55>25), 25+35 > 20 (60>20). Yes, a triangle can be formed, so intersection exists.</li>
                                     </ul>
                                 </li>
                                 <li>Construct the intersection: Draw circle radius 20 (for O1). Draw circle radius 25 (for O2). Pick a point O1 on the radius 20 circle. Draw an arc radius 35 centered at O1. Find intersection O2 with the radius 25 circle.</li>
                                 <li>Draw the three circles: Outer circle (R=40), Circle C1 (center O1, radius 20), Circle C2 (center O2, radius 15). They should touch as required.</li>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question requires constructing the plan view, true shape of the cut section, and the surface development of a truncated cylinder, given its front elevation.</p>
                            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Copy Elevation:</strong> Accurately redraw the given Front Elevation from Figure 4, noting the cylinder diameter, height, and the angle and position of the cutting plane X-X.</li>
                                <li><strong>(a) Construct Plan View:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Project the diameter downwards from the Elevation to draw the circular base in the Plan, centered below the Elevation.</li>
                                        <li>The cutting plane X-X is oblique. The plan view of this cut will be an ellipse.</li>
                                        <li>Divide the base circle (Plan) into 12 equal segments. Project these points (0-11) up to the base line in the Elevation.</li>
                                        <li>Draw vertical element/generator lines from these base points up the cylinder surface in the Elevation until they intersect the cutting plane line X-X. Mark these intersection points (0'-11').</li>
                                        <li>Project these intersection points (0'-11') vertically downwards to intersect the corresponding radial lines (0-11) in the Plan view.</li>
                                        <li>Draw a smooth ellipse through these plotted points in the Plan.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(b) Construct True Shape at Cutting Plane X-X:</strong>

                                         <li>Establish a datum line (e.g., parallel to X-X) for the true shape view.</li>
                                         <li>Measure the perpendicular widths of the ellipse in the Plan view corresponding to each element line (e.g., width across points 1 and 11, 2 and 10, etc., relative to the center line).</li>
                                         <li>Transfer these widths onto the corresponding projection lines in the true shape view, measuring perpendicularly from the datum line.</li>
                                         <li>Draw a smooth ellipse connecting these plotted points. This is the true shape of the cut surface.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(c) Construct Surface Development:</strong>

                                         <li>Draw a baseline equal to the circumference of the cylinder ($\pi \times D$).</li>
                                         <li>Divide this baseline into the same number of equal segments (12) as the plan base circle. Label these 0, 1, 2,... 11, 0.</li>
                                         <li>At each division point on the baseline, draw a vertical line perpendicular to it.</li>
                                         <li>The height of each vertical line corresponds to the true length of the generator at that position on the cylinder, measured from the base up to the cutting plane X-X in the Front Elevation.</li>
                                         <li>Transfer these heights accurately from the Front Elevation to the corresponding vertical lines (element lines) on the development layout.</li>
                                         <li>Draw a smooth curve connecting the top points of these vertical lines.</li>
                                         <li>The resulting shape (rectangle with one straight edge - the base, and one curved edge - the top cut) is the development of the lateral surface of the truncated cylinder.</li>

                                 <li><strong>Orient Axes:</strong> Set up isometric axes (vertical, 30° left, 30° right) originating from corner X, which will be the lowest point in the drawing. Determine the directions for Width, Depth, and Height based on the Front and Plan views relative to X.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Overall Dimensions:</strong> Extract overall Width, Height, and Depth from the orthographic views.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Construct Base:</strong> Starting from X, draw the base footprint along the isometric Width and Depth axes according to the Plan view.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Build Vertically:</strong> Use heights from the Front Elevation to construct the vertical features upwards from the base plane.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Transfer Features:</strong> Map all details (curves, holes, ribs, steps) from both the Front Elevation and Plan view onto the isometric framework. Remember circles in orthographic views become ellipses on isometric planes. Draw lines parallel to the isometric axes.</li>
                                 <li><strong>Connect & Refine:</strong> Complete the object outline. Darken visible edges. Erase construction lines. Omit hidden lines unless necessary for clarity.</li>
