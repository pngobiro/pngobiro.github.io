                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-4">
                             <p class="answer-intro">This question covers material properties definitions, soft soldering, sheet metal operations, arc welding equipment, and mechanical joining.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Material Properties Definitions and Examples:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Stiffness (Rigidity):</strong> A material's resistance to elastic deformation under an applied load. Quantified by the Modulus of Elasticity (Young's Modulus). A stiff material deforms very little under load.
                                    <br><em>Example:</em> Steel is stiffer than Aluminium; Ceramics are generally very stiff.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Ductility:</strong> (Repeated from Nov 2018 Q2a & others) A material's ability to deform plastically under tensile stress without fracturing; ability to be drawn into a wire.
                                    <br><em>Example:</em> Copper, Mild Steel, Gold, Aluminium.</li>
                                <li><strong>(iii) Tensile Strength (Ultimate Tensile Strength - UTS):</strong> The maximum stress a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled (tension) before necking (local reduction in cross-section) begins, which leads to fracture. It represents the material's maximum resistance to breaking under tension.
                                    <br><em>Example:</em> High-tensile steels have high UTS; Lead has low UTS.</li>
                                <li><strong>(iv) Semiconductor:</strong> (Repeated from July 2017 Q4a) A material with electrical conductivity intermediate between that of a conductor and an insulator. Its conductivity can be controlled by temperature or doping with impurities.
                                    <br><em>Example:</em> Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>(b) Soft Soldering and Sheet Metal Operations:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Soft Soldering Definition:</strong> (Repeated from July 2019 Q3b) A joining process using a filler metal (solder) with a melting point *below* 450°C to join base metals without melting them. Bonding occurs through wetting and capillary action.</li>
                                <li><strong>(ii) Sheet Metal Operations (Four):</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Cutting/Shearing:</strong> Using snips, shears, or guillotines.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Bending/Folding:</strong> Using brakes, folders, or stakes and mallets.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Forming/Shaping:</strong> Using hammers, mallets, stakes, rollers (e.g., rolling cylinders).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Joining:</strong> Using seams (grooved, knocked-up), riveting, soldering, welding.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Punching/Piercing:</strong> Creating holes.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Drawing/Stretching:</strong> Forming cup shapes or complex contours.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Hemming/Wiring Edges:</strong> Finishing edges for safety/stiffness.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>(iii) Procedure for Soft Soldering:</strong>
                                    <ol class="step-by-step">
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Cleaning:</strong> Thoroughly clean the surfaces to be joined (mechanically with abrasive, chemically if needed) to remove dirt, grease, and oxides.</li>

                                        <li class="step"><strong>Assembly & Support:</strong> Assemble the parts in the correct position and hold them steady (using clamps, vice, hands-free tool).</li>
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Heating:</strong> Heat the *joint* (the base metals) with the soldering iron until it reaches the melting temperature of the solder. Heat both parts evenly.</li>
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Applying Solder:</strong> Touch the solder wire to the heated joint (not directly to the iron tip). The heat of the joint should melt the solder, allowing it to flow via capillary action into the gap. Apply only enough solder to fill the joint.</li>
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Cooling:</strong> Remove the iron and allow the joint to cool undisturbed until the solder solidifies completely.</li>
                                        <li class="step"><strong>Cleaning (Post-solder):</strong> Clean off any corrosive flux residue using an appropriate solvent or method.</li>

                             <p class="answer-intro">This question involves drawing the intersection between a cylinder and a square prism, and developing the surface of the cylinder.</p>
                            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li><strong>(a) Draw Given Views:</strong> Accurately copy the provided Front Elevation and Plan (or End Elevation) views from Figure 2, showing the cylinder intersecting the square prism at right angles. Establish the projection method used (assume First or Third Angle).</li>
                                 <li><strong>(b) Construct Curve of Intersection:</strong>
                                     <ul>
                                         <li>The intersection curve appears where the cylindrical surface meets the flat faces of the square prism.</li>
                                         <li>Use element lines on the cylinder. Divide the cylinder's circular profile (in the end view or plan) into equal segments (e.g., 12).</li>
                                         <li>Draw these element lines along the cylinder's surface in both the Front Elevation and the other given view (Plan/End).</li>
                                         <li>In the view where the prism's faces are shown edge-on (likely the Plan or End view), find where each element line on the cylinder intersects the lines representing the prism faces.</li>
                                         <li>Project these intersection points onto the corresponding element lines in the Front Elevation.</li>
                                         <li>Connect the plotted points in the Front Elevation with smooth curves. Parts of the curve will be visible, parts hidden (dashed). The curve on the front face of the prism will differ from the curve on the side face.</li>
                                         <li>Project these points to the other view (Plan/End) to complete the intersection curve there as well.</li>
                                     </ul>
                                 </li>
                                  <li><strong>(c) Construct Development of Cylinder:</strong>
                                      <ul>
                                          <li>Draw a baseline equal to the cylinder circumference ($\pi \times D_{cylinder}$). Divide into the same number of equal segments (e.g., 12) used for element lines.</li>
                                          <li>Draw element lines perpendicular to the baseline at each division point.</li>
                                          <li>Measure the true length of each element line on the cylinder's surface from a reference end up to the point where it intersects the prism faces. These lengths are taken from the Front Elevation (assuming it shows true lengths along the cylinder axis).</li>
                                          <li>Plot these varying lengths on the corresponding element lines in the development layout. Note that lengths will change abruptly where the element moves from intersecting one prism face to intersecting the next.</li>
                                          <li>Connect the endpoints with lines representing the intersection with the flat prism faces (these will likely be sections of curves or straight lines depending on perspective, but true shape on development needs care). The resulting shape is the development of the cylinder's lateral surface, shaped to fit onto the square prism.</li>
                                      </ul>
                                 </li>

                            <p class="answer-intro">This question involves geometric constructions: a triangle from perimeter/ratio and its circumcircle, a regular heptagon from side length, and a cycloid locus.</p>

                            <p><strong>(a) Triangle and Heptagon Constructions:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>(i) Triangle (Perimeter=100mm, Ratio 3:4:5) and Circumcircle:</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Calculate Sides:</strong> Total parts = 3+4+5 = 12. Length/part = 100mm/12 = 8.33mm. Sides: a=3*8.33=25mm, b=4*8.33=33.3mm, c=5*8.33=41.7mm. (Check: 25+33.3=58.3>41.7 ok). This is approximately a 3-4-5 right-angled triangle scaled down.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Construct Triangle:</strong> Draw base c=41.7mm (PQ). Arc radius b=33.3mm from P. Arc radius a=25mm from Q. Intersection is R. Join PR, QR.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Circumscribe Circle:</strong> (Repeated from July 2021 Q8a) Construct perpendicular bisectors of two sides (e.g., PQ, PR). Intersection is Circumcenter O. Radius R=OP (or OQ, OR). Draw circle center O, radius R.</li>

                                         <li><strong>Find Interior Angle:</strong> Angle = $(n-2) \times 180 / n = (7-2) \times 180 / 7 = 5 \times 180 / 7 \approx 128.57^{\circ}$.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Approximate Construction:</strong>

                                                 <li>Draw base AB = 33 mm.</li>
                                                 <li>At A and B, construct lines making approx 128.6° outwards (or 180-128.6 = 51.4° inwards). This is difficult accurately with compass/ruler.</li>
                                                 <li>**Alternative (Using center):** Finding the center is hard. An approximation: Draw AB=33. Construct perpendicular bisector. The angle subtended by the side at the center is 360/7 $\approx$ 51.4°. Constructing this accurately is the challenge.</li>
                                                 <li>**Common Method:** Draw side AB=33. Construct perpendicular at B. Mark BP=AB. Draw line AP. Construct perpendicular bisector of AB, meeting AP at Q. Use Q as center, radius QA (or QB) draw circle. Step off AB=33 around circle? (This is often inexact). Need a reliable approximation method.</li>
