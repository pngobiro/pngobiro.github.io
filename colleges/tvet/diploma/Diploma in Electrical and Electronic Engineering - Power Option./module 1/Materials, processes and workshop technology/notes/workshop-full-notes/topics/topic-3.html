                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">d. Ferrous and non-ferrous metals.</h3>
                         <p>Ferrous metals contain iron and non-ferrous metals do not contain iron.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Which Metals Are Ferrous?</h4>
                         <p>Some common ferrous metals include alloy steel, carbon steel, cast iron and wrought iron. These metals are prized for their tensile strength and durability. Carbon Steel - also known as structure steel - is a staple in the construction industry and is used in the tallest skyscrapers and longest bridges. Ferrous metals are also used in shipping containers, industrial piping, automobiles, railroad tracks, and many commercial and domestic tools.</p>
                         <p>Ferrous metals have a high carbon content which generally makes them vulnerable to rust when exposed to moisture. There are two exceptions to this rule: wrought iron resists rust due to its purity and stainless steel is protected from rust by the presence of chromium.</p>
                         <p>Most ferrous metals are magnetic which makes them very useful for motor and electrical applications.</p>
                         <p><strong>Steel:</strong></p>
                         <p>Steel is made by adding iron to carbon which hardens the iron. Alloy steel becomes even tougher as other elements like chromium and nickel are introduced. Steel is made by heating and melting iron ore in furnaces. The steel can is tapped from the furnaces and poured into molds to form steel bars. Steel is widely used in the construction and manufacturing industries.</p>
                         <p><strong>Carbon Steel:</strong></p>
                         <p>Carbon steel has a higher carbon content in comparison to other types of steel making it exceptionally hard. It is commonly used in the manufacturing of machine tools, drills, blades, taps, and springs. It can keep a sharp cutting edge.</p>
                         <p><strong>Alloy Steel:</strong></p>
                         <p>Alloy steels incorporate elements such as chromium, nickel and titanium to impart greater strength and durability without increasing weight. Stainless steel is an important alloy steel made using chromium. Alloy steels are used in construction, machine tools, and electrical components.</p>
                         <p><strong>Cast Iron:</strong></p>
                         <p>Cast iron is an alloy made from iron, carbon, and silicon. Cast iron is brittle and hard and resistant to wear. It's used in water pipes, machine tools, automobile engines and stoves.</p>
                         <p><strong>Wrought Iron:</strong></p>
                         <p>Wrought iron is an alloy with so little carbon content it's almost pure iron. During the manufacturing process, some slag is added which gives wrought iron excellent resistance to corrosion and oxidation, however, it is low in hardness and fatigue strength. Wrought iron is used for fencing and railings, agricultural implements, nails, barbed wire, chains, and various ornaments.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Which Metals Are Non-Ferrous?</h4>
                         <p>Non-ferrous metals include aluminum, copper, lead, zinc, and tin, as well as precious metals like gold and silver. Their main advantage over ferrous materials is their malleability. They also have no iron content, giving them a higher resistance to rust and corrosion, and making them ideal for gutters, liquid pipes, roofing, and outdoor signs. Lastly, they are non-magnetic, which is important for many electronic and wiring applications.</p>
                         <p><strong>Aluminum:</strong></p>
                         <p>Aluminum is lightweight, soft, and low strength. Aluminum is easily cast, forged, machined, and welded. It's not suitable for high-temperature environments. Because aluminum is lightweight, it is a good choice for the manufacturing of aircraft and food cans. Aluminum is also used in castings, pistons, railways, cars, and kitchen utensils.</p>
                         <p><strong>Copper:</strong></p>
                         <p>Copper is red in color, highly ductile, malleable and has high conductivity for electricity and heat. Copper is principally used in the electrical industry in the form of wire and other conductors. It's also used in sheet roofing, cartridge cases, statutes, and bearings. Copper is also used to make brass, an alloy of copper and zinc.</p>
                         <p><strong>Lead:</strong></p>
                         <p>Lead is a soft, heavy, malleable metal with a low melting point and low tensile strength. It can withstand corrosion from moisture and many acids. Lead is widely used in electrical power cables, batteries, building construction and soldering.</p>
                         <p><strong>Zinc:</strong></p>
                         <p>Zinc is a medium to low strength metal with a very low melting point. It can be machined easily, but heating may be required to avoid cleavage of crystals. Zinc is most widely used in galvanizing, the process of applying a protective zinc coating to iron or steel to prevent rust.</p>
                         <p><strong>Tin:</strong></p>
                         <p>Tin is very soft and malleable, ductile with low tensile strength. It's often used to coat steel to prevent corrosion. Tinplate steel is used to make tin cans to hold food. In the late 19th century, tin foil was commonly used to wrap food products, but has since largely been replaced by aluminum foil. Tin can also be alloyed with copper to produce tin brass and bronze.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Physical properties are measurable. Those are things like density, melting point, conductivity, coefficient of expansion, etc. Mechanical properties are how the metal performs when different forces are applied to them. That includes things like strength, ductility, wear resistance, etc. The mechanical and physical properties of materials are determined by their chemical composition and their internal structure, like grain size or crystal structure.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">a. Conductivity:</h3>
                        <p>Thermal conductivity is a measure of the quantity of heat that flows through a material.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">b. Corrosion Resistance:</h3>
                        <p>Corrosion resistance describes a material's ability to prevent natural chemical or electrochemical attack by atmosphere, moisture or other agents.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">c. Density:</h3>
                        <p>Density, often expressed as pounds per cubic inch, or grams per cubic centimeter, etc., describes the mass of the alloy per unit volume. The density of the alloy will determine how much a component of a certain size will weigh.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">d. Ductility:</h3>
                        <p>Ductility is the ability of a material to deform plastically (that is, stretch) without fracturing and retain the new shape when the load is removed. Think of it as the ability to stretch a given metal into a wire. (Tensile stress)</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">e. Malleability:</h3>
                        <p>A physical property describes a metal's ability to be formed without breaking. Pressure, or compressive stress, is used to press or roll the material into thinner sheets. A material with high malleability will be able to withstand higher pressure without breaking. (Compressive stress)</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">f. Elasticity:</h3>
                        <p>Elasticity describes a material's tendency to return to its original size and shape when a distorting force is removed. As opposed to materials that exhibit plasticity (where the change in shape is not reversible), an elastic material will return to its previous configuration when the stress is removed.</p>
                        <p>The stiffness of a metal is the ability of an object to resist deformation in response to an applied force; rigidity; complementary to flexibility</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">g. Toughness:</h3>
                        <p>It is the ability of a material to absorb the energy and gets plastically deformed without fracturing.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">h. Hardness:</h3>
                        <p>Hardness is defined as a material's ability to resist permanent indentation (that is plastic deformation). Typically, the harder the material, the better it resists wear or deformation. The term hardness, thus, also refers to local surface stiffness of a material or its resistance to scratching, abrasion, or cutting.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">i. Plasticity:</h3>
                        <p>Plasticity, the converse of elasticity, describes the tendency of a certain solid material to hold its new shape when subjected to forming forces. It is the quality that allows materials to be bent or worked into a permanent new shape. Materials transition from elastic behavior to plastic at the yield point.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">j. Strength:</h3>
                        <p>It is the property of a material which opposes the deformation or breakdown of material in presence of external forces or load.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">k. Tensile Strength:</h3>
                        <p>Tensile strength refers to the amount of load a section of metal can withstand before it breaks.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">l. Toughness:</h3>
                        <p>Toughness represents a material's ability to absorb impact without fracturing at a given temperature.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">m. Wear Resistance:</h3>
                        <p>Wear resistance is a measure of a material's ability to withstand the effect of two materials rubbing against each other. This can take many forms including adhesion, abrasion, scratching, gouging, galling, and others.</p>
                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">n. Brittleness:</h3>
                        <p>Brittleness of a material indicates that how easily it gets fractured when it is subjected to a force or load. When a brittle material is subjected to a stress it observes very less energy and gets fractures without significant strain. Brittleness is converse to ductility of material. Brittleness of material is temperature dependent. Some metals which are ductile at normal temperature become brittle at low temperature.</p>

                         <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_12_4fceccab54fed4a01433g-022-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a blast furnace used for iron extraction" class="content-image">
                         <p>The blast furnace.</p>
                         <p>Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide, <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$</span>.</p>
                         <p>The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.</p>
                         <p>Carbon is more reactive than iron, so it can displace iron from iron(III) oxide. Here are the equations for the reaction:</p>
                         <p>Iron(III) oxide + carbon <span class="math-inline">$\rightarrow$</span> iron + carbon dioxide</p>
                         <div class="equation">$$2 \mathrm{Fe} 2 \mathrm{O} 3(\mathrm{~s})+3 \mathrm{C}(\mathrm{s}) \rightarrow 4 \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{l})+3 \mathrm{CO} 2(\mathrm{~g})$$</div>
                         <p>In this reaction, the iron(III) oxide is reduced to iron, and the carbon is oxidised to carbon dioxide. In the blast furnace, it is so hot that carbon monoxide can be used, in place of carbon, to reduce the iron(III) oxide:</p>
                         <p>iron(III) oxide + carbon monoxide <span class="math-inline">$\rightarrow$</span> iron + carbon dioxide</p>
                          <div class="equation">$$\mathrm{Fe} 2 \mathrm{O} 3(\mathrm{~s})+3 \mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{s}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{l})+3 \mathrm{CO} 2(\mathrm{~g})$$</div>
                         <p>The calcium carbonate in the limestone thermally decomposes to form calcium oxide.</p>
                         <p>calcium carbonate <span class="math-inline">$\rightarrow$</span> calcium oxide + carbon dioxide</p>
                         <div class="equation">$$\mathrm{CaCO} 3(\mathrm{~s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CaO}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{CO} 2(\mathrm{~g})$$</div>
                         <p>The calcium oxide then reacts with silica (sand) impurities in the haematite, to produce slag which is calcium silicate.</p>

                        <p>The blast furnace operates at <span class="math-inline">$1900^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</span> in order to smelt iron from iron ore. To attain that temperature, coke (and not coal) is used as fuel, and the fire inside the furnace is fanned with hot air at <span class="math-inline">$1200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</span> to <span class="math-inline">$1300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</span> degrees. Lime is added as an additional component; it binds contaminants. The blast furnace is fed from the top, so that alternating layers of coke and iron ore are formed. The highest temperature occurs in the lower part of the furnace. The liquid iron, on which the slag floats, collects at the base.</p>

                         <p>The basic raw material for steel manufacture is either the hot metal from the blast furnace, steel scrap or a mixture of both. The proportions of material used vary according to the process and the type of steel required. Steel can be described in general terms as iron with most of the carbon removed, to make it tougher and more ductile. There are many forms (grades) of steel, each with its own specific chemical composition and properties to meet the needs of the many different applications.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Electric arc furnace method of making steel:</h4>
                         <p>The electric arc furnace consists of a circular bath with a movable roof, through which three graphite electrodes can be raised or lowered. At the start of the process, the electrodes are withdrawn, and the roof swung clear. The steel scrap is then charged into the furnace from a large steel basket lowered from an overhead travelling crane. When charging is complete, the roof is swung back into position and the electrodes lowered into the furnace. A powerful electric current is passed through the charge, an arc is created, and the heat generated melts the scrap. Lime and fluorspar are added as fluxes and oxygen is blown into the melt. As a result, impurities in the metal combine to form a liquid slag.</p>

                         <p>The Die.</p>
                         <p>Dies can thread a cylindrical materials outside surface, such as a rod, to make a bolt or screw. There are two general types of dies: the solid die and the adjustable die. A solid die cuts a nominal thread with a consistent depth. The accuracy is dependent on die precision and wear. The compression and release of the adjustable die is possible to achieve different classes of thread fit. Turning integrated screws adjust the die.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">How to use a die?</h4>
                         <p>The process of threading with a die involves several steps that will be described below:</p>

                                <span class="item-text">Prepare the rod: The material diameter should be slightly smaller than the dies major diameter. The die has a chamfered side used as the entry side for the rod. The chamfer helps to center the die on the rod and reduces the start turning force when threading.</span>
