## Conversion Plan for Workshop Technology Notes

### Document Overview
- Source: workshop-full-notes.pdf
- MMD Generated: Yes
- MMD Review Status: Completed - No significant OCR errors found
- Content Type: Educational material on workshop technology

### Content Structure
Topics:
1. Occupational Safety
2. Materials and Processes
3. Metal Shop Tools and Measurement
4. Joining of Metals
5. Workshop Machines and Applications

### Chunking Strategy
Will divide content into the following logical chunks based on major topics:

1. index.html - Table of Contents
2. topics/occupational-safety.html - Topic 1
3. topics/materials-and-processes.html - Topic 2
4. topics/metal-shop-tools-part1.html - Topic 3 (Part 1: Basic Tools)
5. topics/metal-shop-tools-part2.html - Topic 3 (Part 2: Measurement Tools)
6. topics/joining-of-metals.html - Topic 4
7. topics/workshop-machines.html - Topic 5

Rationale for splitting Topic 3:
- Large content volume
- Natural break between basic tools and measurement tools
- More manageable chunk sizes for better user experience

### Implementation Steps
1. Create directory structure:
   - ./topics/
   - ./assets/images/
   - ./styles/
   - ./js/

2. Process images:
   - Extract image URLs from MMD
   - Download using correct naming convention
   - Place in assets/images/

3. Create HTML files:
   - Implement base HTML template
   - Convert content chunk by chunk
   - Ensure proper navigation between chunks
   - Add semantic HTML elements

4. Style implementation:
   - Create main.css using provided styles
   - Implement responsive design
   - Ensure accessibility features

5. Verification checklist for each chunk:
   - Content accuracy
   - Image references
   - Navigation links
   - Mathematical formulas
   - Tables and layouts
   - Accessibility features
