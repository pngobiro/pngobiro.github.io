                        <p>Almost everyone working in a factory has at some stage in his or her career suffered an injury requiring treatment or first aid. It may have been a cut finger or something more serious. The cause may have been carelessness by the victim or a colleague, defective safety equipment, not using the safety equipment provided or inadequate protective clothing. Whatever the explanation given for the accident, the true cause was most likely a failure to think ahead. You must learn to work safely. Your workplace will have its own safety rules so always obey them. Ask if you do not understand any instruction and do report anything which seems dangerous, damaged, or faulty.</p>

                         <p>Starting work equipment should only be possible by using a control and it should not be possible for it to be accidentally or inadvertently operated nor 'operate itself' (by vibration or failure of a spring mechanism).</p>
                         <p>-Stop controls should bring the equipment to a safe condition in a safe manner.</p>
                         <p>Emergency stop controls are intended to effect a rapid response to potentially dangerous situations and should be easily reached and activated. Common types are mushroom headed buttons, bars, levers, kick plates or pressure-sensitive cables.</p>
                         <p>-It should be possible to identify easily what each control does. Both the controls and their markings should be clearly visible and factors such as color, shape and position are important.</p>

                         <p>-To allow equipment to be made safe under particular circumstances, e.g., when maintenance is to be carried out or when an unsafe condition develops. Isolation may be achieved by simply removing a plug from an electrical socket or by operating an isolating switch or valve.</p>

                         <p>-There are many types of work equipment that might fall over, collapse or overturn unless they are fixed. Most machines used in a fixed position should be bolted down. Some types or work equipment such as mobile cranes may need counterbalance weights.</p>
                         <p>-Ladders should be at the correct angle (a slope of four units up to each one out from the base), correct height (at least 1 meter above the landing place) and tied at the top or secured at the foot.</p>

                         <p>There are many instances where marking of equipment is appropriate for health and safety reasons, e.g., start/stop controls, safe working load on cranes or types of fire extinguishers.</p>

                         <p>-Warning devices can be used which may be audible, e.g., reversing alarms on heavy vehicles, or visible, e.g., lights on a control panel. They may indicate imminent danger, development of a fault or the continued presence of a potential hazard.</p>
                         <p>-They must all be easy to see and understand, and they must be unambiguous.</p>

                        <p>The major hazards arising from the use of electrical equipment are:</p>
                        <p><strong>Electric shock:</strong> The body responds in several ways to electric current flowing through it, any one of which can be fatal. The chance of electric shock is increased in wet or damp conditions, or close to conductors such as working in a metal tank. Hot environments where sweat or humidity reduce the insulation protection offered by clothing increase the risk.</p>
                        <p><strong>Electric burn:</strong> This is due to the heating effect caused by electric current passing through body tissue, most often the skin at the point of contact giving rise to the electric shock.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fire:</strong> Caused by electricity in several ways including, overheating of cables and electrical equipment due to overloading; leakage currents due to poor or inadequate insulation; overheating of flammable materials placed too close to electrical equipment; ignition of flammable materials by sparking of electrical equipment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Arcing:</strong> Generates ultra-violet radiation causing a particular type of burn like severe sunburn. Molten metal resulting from arcing can penetrate, burn, and lodge in the flesh. Ultra-violet radiation can also cause damage to sensitive skin and to eyes, e.g., arc eye in metal arc welding.</p>
                        <p><strong>Explosion:</strong> These include the explosion of electrical equipment, e.g., switchgear or motors, or where electricity causes the ignition of flammable vapors, gases, liquids and dust by electric sparks or high temperature electrical equipment.</p>

                         <p>Where it is possible for electrical equipment to become dangerous if a fault should arise, then precautions must be taken to prevent injury. These precautions include:</p>
                         <p><strong>Double insulation:</strong> The principle is that the live conductors are covered by two discrete layers of insulation. Each layer would provide adequate insulation but together they ensure little likelihood of danger arising from insulation failure. This arrangement avoids the need for an earth wire. Double insulation is particularly suitable for portable equipment such as drills. However, safety depends on the insulation remaining in sound condition and the equipment must be properly constructed, used, and maintained.</p>
                         <p><strong>Earthing:</strong> In the Kenya, the electricity supply is connected to earth. It is this system that enables earth faults on electrical equipment to be detected and the electrical supply to be cut off automatically. This automatic cut-off is performed by fuses or automatic circuit breakers: if a fault occurs the fuse will blow and break the circuit. Although they do not eliminate the risk of electric shock, danger may be reduced using a residual current device (RCD) designed to operate rapidly at small leakage currents. RCDs should only be considered as providing a second line of defense. It is essential to regularly operate the test trip button to maintain their effectiveness.</p>
                         <p><strong>Use of safe voltages:</strong> Reduced voltage systems (110 volts) are particularly suitable for portable electrical equipment in construction work and in high conducting locations such as boilers, tunnels, and tanks; where the risk to equipment and trailing cables is high; and where the body may be damp.</p>

                        <p>If the human body accidentally meets an electrical conductor which is connected to the supply, a current may, depending on the conditions, flow through the body. This current will at least produce violent muscular spasms which may cause the body to be flung across the room or fall off a ladder. In extreme cases the heart will stop beating.</p>
                        <p>Burns are caused by the current acting on the body tissue and internal heating can also take place leading to partial blockage of blood flow through the blood vessels. In the event of someone suffering electric shock know what to do - it should form part of your training.</p>
