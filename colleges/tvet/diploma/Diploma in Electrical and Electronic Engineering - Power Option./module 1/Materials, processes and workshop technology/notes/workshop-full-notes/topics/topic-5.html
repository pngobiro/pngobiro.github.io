                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>Drilling machine is one of the most important machine tools in a workshop. It was designed to produce a cylindrical hole of required diameter and depth on metal workpieces. Though holes can be made by different machine tools in a shop, drilling machine is designed specifically to perform the operation of drilling and similar operations. Drilling can be done easily at a low cost in a shorter period in a drilling machine. Drilling can be called as the operation of producing a cylindrical hole of required diameter and depth by removing metal by the rotating edges of a drill. The cutting tool known as drill is fitted into the spindle of the drilling machine. A mark of indentation is made at the required location with a center punch. The rotating drill is pressed at the location and is fed into the work. The hole can be made up to a required depth.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Construction of a drilling machine:</h3>
                         <p>The basic parts of a drilling machine are a base, column, drill head and spindle. The base made of cast iron may rest on a bench, pedestal or floor depending upon the design. Larger and heavy-duty machines are grounded on the floor. The column is mounted vertically upon the base. It is accurately machined, and the table can be moved up and down on it. The drill spindle, an electric motor and the mechanism meant for driving the spindle at different speeds are mounted on the top of the column. Power is transmitted from the electric motor to the spindle through a flat belt or a 'V' belt.</p>

                         <p>Drilling Machine.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Drilling Operations.</h3>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. Drilling</h4>
                         <p>Drilling is the operation of producing a cylindrical hole by removing metal from the rotating edge of a cutting tool called the drill.</p>
                         <p>Drilling is one of the simplest methods of producing a hole. Before drilling the centre of the hole is located on the workpiece by drawing two lines at right angles to each other and then a centre punch is used to produce an indentation at the centre.</p>
                         <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_12_4fceccab54fed4a01433g-096-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing drilling operation" class="content-image">
                         <p>The drill point is pressed at this centre point to produce the required hole. Drilling does not produce an accurate hole in a workpiece and the hole location is not perfect.</p>
                         <p>The internal surface of the hole so generated by drilling becomes rough and the hole is always slightly oversize than the drill used due to the vibration of the spindle and the drill. A 12 mm drill may produce a hole as much as <span class="math-inline">$0-125 \mathrm{~mm}$</span> oversize and a 22 mm drill may produce one as much as <span class="math-inline">$0-5 \mathrm{~mm}$</span> oversize.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Reaming</h4>
                         <p>Reaming is an accurate way of sizing and finishing a hole which has been previously drilled. In order to finish a hole and to bring it to the accurate size, the hole is drilled slightly undersize.</p>
                         <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_12_4fceccab54fed4a01433g-096-2.jpg" alt="Diagram showing reaming operation" class="content-image">
                         <p>The speed of the spindle is made half that of drilling and automatic feed may be employed. The tool used for reaming is known as reamer which has multiple cutting edges.</p>
                         <p>Reamer cannot originate a hole. It simply follows the path which has been previously drilled and removes a very small amount of metal. For this reason, a reamer cannot correct a hole location. The material removed by this process is around <span class="math-inline">$0-375 \mathrm{~mm}$</span> and for accurate work, this should not exceed <span class="math-inline">$0-125 \mathrm{~mm}$</span>.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Boring</h4>
                         <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_12_4fceccab54fed4a01433g-097-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing boring operation" class="content-image">
                         <p>Boring is performed in a drilling machine for reasons stated below:</p>
                         <ul>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>

                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>

                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">

                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Used to correct out of roundness of the hole.</span>
                            </li>
                             <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">To correct the location of the hole as the boring tool follows an independent path with respect to the hole.</span>
                            </li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>The cutter is held in a boring bar which has a tapered shank to fit into the spindle socket. For perfect finishing a hole, the job is drilled slightly undersize. In precision machines, the accuracy is as high as <span class="math-inline">$+0.00125 \mathrm{~mm}$</span>. It is a slow process than reaming and requires several passes of the toll.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4. Counterboring</h4>
                         <p>Counterboring is the operation of enlarging the end of a hole cylindrically. The enlarged hole forms a square shoulder with the original hole. This is necessary in some cases to accommodate the heads of bolts, studs and pins.</p>
                         <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_12_4fceccab54fed4a01433g-098-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing counterboring operation" class="content-image">
                         <p>A tool used for counterboring is called a counterbore. The counterbores are made with a straight or tapered shank to fit in the drill spindle. The cutting edges may have straight or spiral teeth.</p>
                         <p>The tool is guided by a pilot which extends beyond the end of the cutting edges. The pilot fits into the small-diameter hole running clearance and maintains the alignment of the tool.</p>
                         <p>These pilots may be interchanged for enlarging different sizes of holes. Counterboring can give an accuracy of about <span class="math-inline">$+0.005 \mathrm{~mm}$</span>. The cutting speed for counterboring is <span class="math-inline">$25 \%$</span> less than that of drilling operations.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5. Countersinking</h4>
                         <p>Countersinking is the operation of making a cone-shaped enlargement of the end of a hole to provide a recess for a flat head screw or countersunk rivet fitted into the hole.</p>
                         <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_12_4fceccab54fed4a01433g-098-2.jpg" alt="Diagram showing countersinking operation" class="content-image">
                         <p>The tool used for countersinking is called a countersink. Standard countersinks have 60, 82 or 90 inclined angle and the cutting edges of the tool are formed at the conical surface. The cutting speed in countersinking is <span class="math-inline">$25 \%$</span> less than that of drilling.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">6. Spot facing</h4>
                         <p>Spot facing is the operation of smoothing and squaring the surface around a hole for the seat for a nut or the head of a screw. A counterbore or a special spot facing tool may be employed for this purpose.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">7. Tapping</h4>
                         <p>It is the operation of cutting internal threads by means of a cutting tool called a tap. Tapping in a drilling machine may be performed by hand or by machine.</p>
                         <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_12_4fceccab54fed4a01433g-099-1.jpg" alt="Diagram showing tapping operation" class="content-image">
                         <p>A tap may be considered as a bolt with accurate threads cut on it. The threads act as cutting edges which are hardened and ground. When the tap is screwed into the hole it removes metal and cuts internal threads which will fit into external threads of the same size.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">8. Lapping</h4>
                         <p>Lapping is the operation of sizing and finishing a small diameter hole already hardened by removing a very small amount of material by using a lap. There are many kinds of lapping tools.</p>
                         <p>The copper head laps are commonly used. The lap fits in the hole and is moved up and down while it revolves.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">9. Grinding</h4>
                         <p>Grinding operation may be performed in a drilling machine to finish a hardened hole. The grinding wheel is made to revolve with the spindle and is fed up and down.</p>
                         <p>A suitable grinding wheel may be selected for surface grinding operation. Grinding can also be done correctly out of roundness of the hole. The accuracy in grinding operation is quite high about <span class="math-inline">$+0.0025 \mathrm{~mm}$</span>.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">10. Trepanning</h4>
                         <p>Trepanning is the operation of producing a hole by removing metal along the circumference of a hollow cutting tool.</p>
                         <p>This operation is performed for producing large holes. Fewer chips are removed and much of the material is saved while the hole is produced.</p>
                         <p>The tool may be operated at higher speeds as the vibration in diameter of the tool is limited by the narrow cutting edge. The tool resembles a hollow tube having cutting edges at one end and a solid shank at the other to fit into the drill spindle. This is one of the efficient methods of producing a hole.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Safety Precautions When Using A Drill.</h3>
                         <p>It is necessary that no damage is done to the operator, the machine tool and the cutting tool. To ensure this, the following points are to be remembered.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>A hand drill is a manual tool that converts and amplifies circular motion of the crank into circular motion of a drill chuck. Though it has been replaced in most applications by power drills, the hand drill is used by many woodworkers.</p>
                         <p>The hand drill consists of a cranking handle that turns pinion gears on the main shaft. A chuck at the end of the shaft holds a drill bit. The opposite end of the shaft has a second handle that is held stationary while the chuck turns. The drill bit is selected to cut a hole of a specific width, such as <span class="math-inline">$3 / 8$</span> inch; the size typically is inscribed on the bit's shaft.</p>

                         <p>To safely use a hand drill, loosen the chuck and insert the appropriate drill bit, then tighten the chuck. Place the bit's tip where you want to cut a hole, making sure the bit is at the same angle as the desired hole. Turn the cranking handle to rotate the bit and drill the hole. With smaller drill bits, be careful not to apply excess pressure on the handle or the bit may bend or break.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Maintenance:</h3>
                         <p>Hand drills require little maintenance, but can be damaged by improper use, such as using the wrong drill bit or placing excess pressure on the tool. For optimum efficiency, periodically place a drop of light oil on the crank pinions and in the chuck gear.</p>

                         <p>A power drill is an electrical motor that rotates a replaceable drill bit to make a hole in wood, plastic, or metal. Alternately, a screwdriver tip can be installed to turn screws. The parts of a power drill include the handle, an on/off trigger with safety latch, a reversing switch for changing the rotation direction of the drill bit, a torque adjustment, and the chuck that holds the drill bit in place. Corded drills are powered by a 110-volt electrical cord inserted into an electrical receptacle; cordless drills are powered by a battery in the drill's handle.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>The center lathe or metal turning lathe is a machine used to turn metal or plastic bar into cylindrical shapes. In addition, there are my other operations that can be done on this type of lathe.</p>
                         <p>The work, which usually rotates towards the operator, can be griped securely in a chuck, bolted to a face plate or set up between two centers. The cutting tool mounted on a tool post on the top of the carriage can be moved along the bed or at right angles to it. The length ways movement (or traverse) of the cutting tool produces a circular surface on the workpiece and the cross transverse produces a flat surface.</p>
                         <p>In addition to these operations the center lathe is used in the school workshop for producing tapered work (with the compound slide), for drilling and boring holes, parting off, knurling and screw cutting.</p>
                         <p>The size of the lathe is specified by (a) the maximum distance between centers and (b) the height of the spindle center above the lathe bed.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Bed:</h3>
                         <p>The bed of the lathe is made from cast iron for strength and rigidity. Its surfaces are machined true and accurate to ensure smooth movement of the tailstock and carriage and perfect alignment of these components with each other with the headstock.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Headstock:</h3>
                         <p>The headstock is securely fixed onto the left-hand end of the bed and carries the drive gearing and main spindle. This spindle is hollow to take tapered centers and allow metal and plastic of suitable diameter to pass through. It is also screwed at the right-hand end to enable chucks and face plates to be easily attacked and removed. This spindle, known as the 'live' center because it rotates with the work, is driven by a series of gear wheels whose power is transmitted by means of v-belts from an electric motor.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Tailstock:</h3>
                         <p>The tailstock has a hollow spindle designed to take tailstock (or dead) centers and drill chucks. In use the tailstock center supports the 'free' end of the work being turned whilst the drill chuck is used when drilling or reaming work that is held in a chuck or face plate.</p>
                         <p>The tailstock can be in the desired position by sliding it smoothly along the bed and clamping securely with the tailstock bed clamp. Fine adjustment, to bring the 'dead' center up to the work, is made with the hand wheel. The outer surface of the spindle is graduated in millimeters to allow holes of an exact depth to be drilled. The spindle is clamped in position using the spindle clamp.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Carriage:</h3>
                         <p>The carriage unit consists of the saddle, cross slide, compound slide (or rest), tool post and apron.</p>
                         <p>The Saddle, or carriage base, spans the bed of the lathe and moves smoothly on the bed guides, when the apron hand wheel is turned or when automatic fed is engaged.</p>
                         <p>The Cross Slide, mounted on a dovetail shapes section on top of the saddle, can be moved at right angles to the bed length by using the cross-feed handle.</p>
                         <p>The Compound Slide, which carries the tool post and cutting tool, is fed by hand only. It is attached to the top of the cross slide by a swivel pin and can be pivoted and locked at any desired angle when turning short tapers, boring or screw cutting.</p>
                         <p>The Apron hangs down from the front edge of the saddle. The lead screw, or feed shaft, passes through the apron and when engaged by the appropriate gearing and controls cause the Whole carriage to move smoothly along the bed. The apron also contains the feed mechanism and control for the automatic movement of the cross slide.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                         <p>A shaping machine is used to machine surfaces. It can cut curves, angles and many other shapes. It is a popular machine in a workshop because its movement is very simple although it can produce a variety of work. Shaping machines come in a range of sizes but the most common size is seen below.</p>
                         <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_12_4fceccab54fed4a01433g-107-2.jpg" alt="Image of a shaping machine" class="content-image">
                         <p>The tool feed handle can be turned to slowly feed the cutting tool into the material as the 'ram' moves forwards and backwards. The strong machine vice holds the material securely. A small vice would not be suitable as the work could quite easily be pulled out of position and be damaged. The vice rests on a steel table which can be adjusted so that it ca be moved up and down and then locked in position. Pulling back on the clutch handle starts the 'ram' moving forwards and backwards.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Parts of a shaping machine.</h3>
                         <p><strong>Base:</strong></p>
                         <p>Just as other machine tools, base is designed to take the entire load of the shaping machine. It is bolted on the floor of workshops. Base are made of cast iron in order to resist vibration and to take the compressive load.</p>
                         <p><strong>Column:</strong></p>
                         <p>The column is a cast iron mounted on the base. It is provided with accurately machined guideways on the top on which the ram reciprocates. Some guideways are also provided on the front vertical face for the cross-rail movement. All ram driving mechanisms are enclosed in the column.</p>
                         <p><strong>Cross-rail:</strong></p>
                         <p>The shaping machine's part is mounted on the ground vertical to guideways of the column. It features two parallel guideways on its top, perpendicular to the ram axis, this is called a saddle. It helps to move the table in a crosswise direction by the help of a feed screw.</p>
                         <p>A cross-rail allows the table to be raised and lowered at a required size the workpiece will accommodate. This is done by the rotating the elevating screw that causes the crossrail to slide up and down on the vertical face of the column.</p>
                         <p><strong>Saddle:</strong></p>
                         <p>A saddle is mounted on the cross rail to hold the table firmly on its top. The crosswise movement of the saddle causes the table to also move in a crosswise direction if the cross-feed screw is rotated.</p>
                         <p><strong>Table:</strong></p>
                         <p>A table is mounted on the saddle, it moves crosswise by rotating the cross-feed rod and vertically by rotating the elevating screw. The table is made of cast iron, in the shape of a box with an accurate top and side surfaces. These surfaces features t -slots for holding the workpiece.</p>
                         <p>In a universal shaping machine, the table is designed to swivel on a horizontal axis and its upper part is tilted up or down.</p>
                         <p><strong>Ram:</strong></p>
                         <p>A ram is a reciprocating member that holds a shaping tool. It is in form of a semicylindrical and ribbed inside which make it more rigid. It holds the screwed shaft for altering the position of the ram with respect to the work.</p>
                         <p><strong>Tool head:</strong></p>
                         <p>The tool head is designed to firmly hold a cutting tool and offers both vertical and angular movement to the tool. This movement is done by a down feed screw handle. The tool head also allows the tool to have an automatic relief during the return stroke of the ram. The head tool consists of apron, clapper box and a clapper block; the apron contains the clapper box and tool post, clamped on the vertical slide by the screw. The apron is swiveled upon the apron swivel pin in a direction of right or left. The clapper box houses the clapper block using a hinge pin. A tool post is mounted on the clapper block.</p>

                         <p>A grinding machine is a machine tool equipped with an abrasive wheel used for producing fine finishes or making light cuts on metals and other materials. There are various types of grinding machines. Their wheels, which differ in size and grain, are made up of a variety of stones, diamonds, and other inorganic materials. These machines are useful for roughing and finishing operations on tools and other equipment.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">Construction:</h3>
                         <p>The grinding machine consists of a power-driven grinding wheel and a bed with a fixture to guide and hold the workpiece. The wheel is made to spin at the desired speed, based on the wheel's diameter and manufacturer's rating, usually by a formula. The grinding head can be controlled to travel across a fixed workpiece, or the workpiece can be moved whilst the grinding head stays in a fixed position. Very fine control of the grinding head or table position is feasible using a Vernier calibrated hand wheel or using the features of numerical control (NC) or computer numerical control (CNC).</p>
                         <p>Grinding machines remove material from the workpiece by abrasion, which can generate substantial amounts of heat. They therefore incorporate a coolant to cool the workpiece so that it does not overheat and exceed its tolerance range. The coolant also benefits the machinist, as the heat generated may cause burns in some cases.</p>
