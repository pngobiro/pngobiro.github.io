                    <div class="question-content">
                        <p>(a) Distinguish between the following:</p>
                        <p class="indented-1">(i) convection and radiation; (2 marks)</p>

Determine for the wave: (Note: Equation seems unusual, possibly $y=1.4 \sin(2\pi x + 6\pi t)$ or $y=1.4 \sin(2\pi(x+3t))$? Assuming $y=1.4 \sin(2\pi x + 6\pi t)$)</p>

                        <h4>Answer</h4>
                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-1">
                             <div class="answer-detail">
                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers heat transfer mechanisms, thermodynamic processes, calorimetry, simple pendulum energy changes, wave equation analysis, and vibration concepts.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Distinctions and Calorimetry:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Convection vs. Radiation:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Convection:</strong> Heat transfer through the bulk movement of fluids (liquids or gases). Warmer, less dense fluid rises, and cooler, denser fluid sinks, creating convection currents that distribute heat. Requires a medium.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Radiation:</strong> Heat transfer through electromagnetic waves (primarily infrared radiation for typical temperatures). Does not require a medium and can travel through a vacuum (e.g., heat from the sun). Energy is emitted by any object above absolute zero and absorbed by other objects.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Isothermal vs. Adiabatic Changes:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Isothermal Change:</strong> A process occurring in a thermodynamic system during which the temperature remains constant ($T = \text{constant}$, $\Delta T = 0$). For an ideal gas, this implies the internal energy remains constant ($\Delta U = 0$), and any heat added equals the work done by the gas ($Q = W$). Often occurs slowly, allowing heat exchange with surroundings. Obeys Boyle's Law ($PV = \text{constant}$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Adiabatic Change:</strong> A process occurring without any heat transfer into or out of the system ($Q = 0$). This usually happens rapidly or in a well-insulated system. According to the first law, $\Delta U = -W$. Work done by the gas comes from its internal energy, usually causing a temperature drop. Obeys $PV^\gamma = \text{constant}$, where $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Mixing Water Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Vessel perfectly lagged (no heat loss to surroundings).</p>
                                <p>Water 1: $V_1 = 20$ litres, $T_1 = 90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Mass $m_1 = 20$ kg (assuming density=1 kg/L).</p>
                                <p>Water 2: $V_2 = 5$ litres, $T_2 = 20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Mass $m_2 = 5$ kg.</p>
                                <p>Let final temperature be $T_f$. Let specific heat capacity of water be $c_w$.</p>
                                <p>Principle of Mixtures: Heat Lost by hot water = Heat Gained by cold water.</p>
                                <p>$m_1 c_w (T_1 - T_f) = m_2 c_w (T_f - T_2)$.</p>
                                <p>The $c_w$ terms cancel out.</p>
                                <p>$20 (90 - T_f) = 5 (T_f - 20)$.</p>
                                <p>$1800 - 20 T_f = 5 T_f - 100$.</p>
                                <p>$1800 + 100 = 5 T_f + 20 T_f$.</p>
                                <p>$1900 = 25 T_f$.</p>
                                <p>$T_f = 1900 / 25 = 76$.</p>
                                <p>The final temperature of the mixture is $76^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Simple Pendulum and Wave Analysis:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Energy Changes in Simple Pendulum:</strong></p>
                                <p>Assuming ideal conditions (no air resistance), the total mechanical energy (Sum of Potential Energy (PE) and Kinetic Energy (KE)) remains constant.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>At Extreme Positions:</strong> Height is maximum, velocity is zero. PE is maximum, KE is zero.</li>
                                    <li><strong>At Equilibrium (Mean) Position:</strong> Height is minimum (often taken as zero reference), velocity is maximum. PE is minimum (zero), KE is maximum.</li>
                                    <li><strong>During Swing:</strong> Energy continuously converts between PE and KE. As it swings down, PE converts to KE. As it swings up, KE converts to PE. Total Energy = PE + KE = Constant.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Wave Equation Analysis:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: $y=1.4 \sin (2\pi x + 6\pi t)$.</p>
                                <p>Standard form: $y = A \sin(kx + \omega t)$ (wave travelling in -x direction).</p>
                                <p>Comparing terms:</p>
                                <p><strong>(I) Amplitude (A):</strong> $A = 1.4$ m.</p>
                                <p><strong>(II) Period (T):</strong> Angular frequency $\omega = 6\pi$. Since $\omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi/T$.</p>
                                <p>$T = 2\pi / \omega = 2\pi / (6\pi) = 1/3$ s ($\approx 0.333$ s).</p>
                                <p><strong>(III) Velocity (v):</strong> Wave number $k = 2\pi$. Since $k = 2\pi/\lambda$, wavelength $\lambda = 2\pi/k = 2\pi/(2\pi) = 1$ m.</p>
                                <p>Frequency $f = 1/T = 1/(1/3) = 3$ Hz.</p>
                                <p>Velocity $v = f\lambda = 3 \text{ Hz} \times 1 \text{ m} = 3$ m/s.</p>
                                <p>(Alternatively $v = \omega/k = 6\pi / 2\pi = 3$ m/s).</p>
                                <p>The wave velocity is 3 m/s (in the negative x-direction).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Vibrations - Damping and Resonance:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Damping:</strong> Damping refers to the effect of resistive forces (like friction, air resistance) on an oscillating system. These forces oppose the motion and cause the system to lose energy, resulting in a gradual decrease in the amplitude of the oscillations over time. If damping is heavy enough (critical or overdamping), oscillations may be prevented altogether.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Resonance:</strong> Resonance is the phenomenon that occurs when a system capable of oscillating is driven by an external periodic force at a frequency equal or very close to its own natural frequency (or one of its natural frequencies). Under resonance conditions, the system oscillates with a maximum amplitude, as energy is transferred most efficiently from the driver to the oscillating system.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">The question covers thermodynamics, heat transfer, wave properties, and fundamental concepts of vibrations.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Empirical Formula Determination:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Mass C = 1.71 kg, Mass H = 0.287 kg.</p>
                                <p>RAM: C=12, H=1.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 1: Convert mass to moles.</strong></p>
                                <p>Moles C = Mass C / RAM C = $1.71 \text{ kg} / 12 \text{ kg/kmol}$ (or g / g/mol - units cancel). Let's use grams for simplicity: 1710 g C, 287 g H.</p>
                                <p>Moles C = $1710 / 12 = 142.5$ mol.</p>
                                <p>Moles H = $287 / 1 = 287$ mol.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 2: Find the simplest whole number ratio of moles.</strong></p>
                                <p>Ratio C : H = 142.5 : 287.</p>
                                <p>Divide by the smallest number (142.5):</p>
                                <p>C: $142.5 / 142.5 = 1$.</p>
                                <p>H: $287 / 142.5 \approx 2.014$. This is very close to 2.</p>
                                <p>The simplest whole number ratio is C : H = 1 : 2.</p>
                                <p>The empirical formula is **CH$_2$**.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Power, Work, Force:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Power Definition:</strong> Power is the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred or converted. Unit: Watt (W).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Height (h) = 160 m, Time (t) = 20 s, Energy expended (Work done, W) = 80 kJ = 80000 J.</p>
                                <p><strong>(I) Power (P):</strong></p>
                                <p>$P = \text{Work Done} / \text{Time} = 80000 \text{ J} / 20 \text{ s} = 4000 \text{ W}$ (or 4 kW).</p>
                                <p><strong>(II) Force (F):</strong></p>
                                <p>Assuming the energy expended is primarily work done against gravity by the lifting force F.</p>
                                <p>Work Done = Force $\times$ Distance (Height).</p>
                                <p>$W = F \times h$.</p>
                                <p>$80000 \text{ J} = F \times 160 \text{ m}$.</p>
                                <p>$F = 80000 / 160 = 500$ N.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Equilibrium and Forces:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Equilibrium of Coplanar Forces:</strong> A body is in static equilibrium under the action of a system of coplanar forces if it has no tendency to accelerate, either linearly or rotationally. This requires two conditions to be met:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>The vector sum of all forces acting on the body must be zero ($\sum \vec{F} = 0$, ensuring no linear acceleration).</li>
                                        <li>The algebraic sum of the moments of all forces about any point in the plane must be zero ($\sum M = 0$, ensuring no angular acceleration).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Determining Force F (Fig 1):</strong></p>
                                <p>Forces are in equilibrium, so $\sum F_x = 0$ and $\sum F_y = 0$.</p>
                                <p>Forces: $F_1=10$N @ 0°, $F_2=15$N @ 60°, $F_3=20$N @ 135°, $F_4=F$ @ 270° (downwards).</p>
                                <p>Resolve forces:</p>
                                <p>$F_{1x} = 10 \cos(0) = 10.0$</p>
                                <p>$F_{1y} = 10 \sin(0) = 0.0$</p>
                                <p>$F_{2x} = 15 \cos(60) = 15(0.5) = 7.5$</p>
                                <p>$F_{2y} = 15 \sin(60) = 15(\sqrt{3}/2) \approx 12.99$</p>
                                <p>$F_{3x} = 20 \cos(135) = 20(-\sqrt{2}/2) \approx -14.14$</p>
                                <p>$F_{3y} = 20 \sin(135) = 20(\sqrt{2}/2) \approx 14.14$</p>
                                <p>$F_{4x} = F \cos(270) = 0.0$</p>
                                <p>$F_{4y} = F \sin(270) = F(-1) = -F$</p>
                                <p>Apply equilibrium conditions:</p>
                                <p>$\sum F_x = 10.0 + 7.5 - 14.14 + 0 = 3.36$ N.</p>
                                <p>$\sum F_y = 0.0 + 12.99 + 14.14 - F = 27.13 - F$ N.</p>
                                <p>For equilibrium, both sums must be zero. However, $\sum F_x = 3.36 N \neq 0$. This indicates the system as described *cannot* be in equilibrium. There might be an error in the question statement or the diagram.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Assuming the question intended to ask for the value of F that *would* balance the vertical components only (ignoring the horizontal imbalance):</p>
                                <p>Set $\sum F_y = 0 \implies 27.13 - F = 0 \implies F = 27.13$ N.</p>
                                <p>If the question meant F was the *resultant* of the first three forces (but acting downwards?), then $R_x=3.36, R_y=27.13$. $R = \sqrt{3.36^2+27.13^2} \approx 27.3$ N. Direction $\theta = \arctan(27.13/3.36) \approx 82.9^\circ$. This doesn't match F at 270°. Due to the inconsistency, we assume the intended answer based on vertical equilibrium is $F \approx 27.1$ N.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers material properties (plasticity, elasticity), rotational kinematics, and the operation of centrifugal governors.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Material Properties:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Plasticity:</strong> Plasticity is the ability of a solid material to undergo permanent deformation (a non-reversible change in shape) in response to applied forces without fracturing. Once the applied stress exceeds the material's elastic limit (or yield strength), plastic deformation occurs, and the material does not return to its original shape when the load is removed.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Hooke's Law Curve (Stress-Strain Curve for Elastic Material):</strong></p>

 Origin O +----------------------------> Strain ($\epsilon$)

Labels:
- Origin (O)
- Proportional Limit (PL): Stress proportional to strain (end of linear region).
- Elastic Limit (EL): Max stress before permanent deformation occurs (often close to PL).
- Yield Point (YP): Stress at which significant plastic deformation begins with little increase in stress (may show upper/lower points).
- Elastic Region: Region from O up to EL where deformation is reversible.
                                    </pre>

                                </figure>
                                <p>The curve shows stress ($\sigma$) on the y-axis versus strain ($\epsilon$) on the x-axis. For an elastic material obeying Hooke's Law up to the proportional limit, the initial part of the curve is a straight line through the origin ($\sigma = E\epsilon$, where E is Young's Modulus). The elastic limit marks the point beyond which permanent deformation occurs. The yield point marks the onset of significant plastic flow.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Circular Motion and Rotational Kinematics:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Forces on Body in Uniform Circular Motion:</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Centripetal Force:</strong> The net inward force directed towards the center of the circle, required to maintain the circular motion ($F_c = mv^2/r$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Force Providing Centripetal Force:</strong> The actual physical force(s) that sum vectorially to provide the required centripetal force (e.g., tension in a string, gravitational force, friction, normal force component).</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Note: Tangential forces are zero if speed is constant.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Motor Shaft Acceleration:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Initial angular speed ($\omega_0$) = 0 rad/s.</p>
                                <p>Final angular speed (N) = 280 rev/min.</p>
                                <p>Time (t) = 4 seconds.</p>
                                <p><strong>(I) Final Angular Velocity ($\omega_f$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Convert N from rpm to rad/s.</p>
                                <p>$\omega_f = N \times \frac{2\pi}{60} = 280 \times \frac{2\pi}{60} = \frac{560\pi}{60} = \frac{28\pi}{3}$ rad/s.</p>
                                <p>$\omega_f \approx 29.32$ rad/s.</p>

                                <p><strong>(II) Angular Acceleration ($\alpha$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Assuming uniform acceleration: $\omega_f = \omega_0 + \alpha t$.</p>
                                <p>$\frac{28\pi}{3} = 0 + \alpha (4)$.</p>
                                <p>$\alpha = \frac{28\pi}{3 \times 4} = \frac{7\pi}{3}$ rad/s².</p>
                                <p>$\alpha \approx 7.33$ rad/s².</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Centrifugal Governor (Fig 2):</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Type of Governor:</strong> The diagram shows rotating flyballs on pivoted arms connected to a central sleeve. Without details like a central dead weight or springs, it most closely resembles a **Watt Governor** (the simplest type) or could be a generic representation of a centrifugal governor.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Parts Labelled A and B:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A: Flyball (or Governor Ball / Rotating Mass)</li>
                                    <li>B: Sleeve</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Control Action When Load Reduces:</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>If the load on the engine reduces, the engine momentarily tends to speed up.</li>
                                    <li>This increases the rotational speed ($\omega$) of the governor spindle and the flyballs (A).</li>
                                    <li>The increased speed causes a larger outward centrifugal force ($F_c = m\omega^2 r$) on the flyballs.</li>
                                    <li>This larger force overcomes the inward controlling force (gravity/spring), causing the flyballs (A) to move outwards and upwards to a larger radius of rotation.</li>
                                    <li>The upward movement of the arms lifts the sleeve (B) on the governor spindle.</li>
                                    <li>The upward movement of the sleeve is transmitted through linkages to the engine's throttle valve.</li>
                                    <li>The throttle valve moves towards the closed position, reducing the supply of fuel (or steam) to the engine.</li>
                                    <li>The reduced fuel supply decreases the engine's power output, causing its speed to decrease back towards the desired equilibrium speed.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(a) Electrical Quantity Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Potential Difference (Voltage):</strong> The potential difference (p.d.) between two points in an electric circuit is the work done per unit charge in moving charge between those two points. It represents the electrical 'pressure' driving the current. Unit: Volt (V).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Current (I):</strong> Electric current is the rate of flow of electric charge past a point in a circuit. $I = dQ/dt$. Unit: Ampere (A).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Light Bulb and Battery Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Bulb Power (P) = 18 W, Supply Voltage (V) = 12 V, Battery Capacity = 700 Ah.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Current flowing through the bulb (I):</strong></p>
                                <p>Using $P = VI$.</p>
                                <p>$18 W = 12 V \times I$.</p>
                                <p>$I = 18 / 12 = 1.5 A$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Resistance of the bulb element (R):</strong></p>
                                <p>Using Ohm's Law $V = IR$ or $P = V^2/R$ or $P = I^2R$.</p>
                                <p>$R = V / I = 12 V / 1.5 A = 8 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>(Check: $P = I^2R = (1.5)^2 \times 8 = 2.25 \times 8 = 18 W$. $P = V^2/R = 12^2 / 8 = 144 / 8 = 18 W$. Consistent).</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Supply Duration (Time, t):</strong></p>
                                <p>Battery Capacity = 700 Ah (Ampere-hours). This means the battery can supply a current of 700 A for 1 hour, or 1 A for 700 hours, or 1.5 A for t hours, etc., until discharged.</p>
                                <p>Capacity (Ah) = Current (A) $\times$ Time (h).</p>
                                <p>$700 \text{ Ah} = 1.5 \text{ A} \times t \text{ (hours)}$.</p>
                                <p>$t = 700 / 1.5 \approx 466.67$ hours.</p>
                                <p>The battery can supply the bulb for approximately 466.7 hours.</p>

                                    <li><strong>(I) Local Action:</strong> A defect occurring primarily in primary cells (like simple Zinc-Carbon cells) where impurities (like iron or carbon) within the zinc electrode form tiny local electrochemical cells with the zinc itself in the presence of the electrolyte. This causes the zinc electrode to be consumed (corroded) even when the cell is not supplying external current, reducing the cell's shelf life and capacity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Polarization:</strong> A defect occurring mainly in primary cells where reaction products accumulate at one or both electrodes during discharge, hindering the main cell reaction and increasing internal resistance. A common example is the formation of hydrogen gas bubbles at the positive (carbon) electrode in a simple cell, which insulates the electrode and reduces the cell's voltage. Depolarizers (like Manganese Dioxide in Leclanché cells) are added to react with these products and reduce polarization.</li>

                                <p><strong>(d) Parallel Cell Connection:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: 4 identical cells in parallel.</p>
                                <p>Each cell: EMF ($E_{cell}$) = 2.2 V, Internal resistance ($r_{cell}$) = 0.9 $\Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Load current ($I_L$) = 0.6 A.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Total Internal Resistance ($r_{total}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>For N identical cells in parallel, the total internal resistance is $r_{total} = r_{cell} / N$.</p>
                                <p>$r_{total} = 0.9 \Omega / 4 = 0.225 \Omega$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Voltage across the cells terminals ($V_T$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The total EMF of identical cells in parallel ($E_{total}$) is the same as the EMF of a single cell.</p>
                                <p>$E_{total} = E_{cell} = 2.2 V$.</p>
                                <p>The terminal voltage $V_T$ when supplying current $I_L$ is:</p>
                                <p>$V_T = E_{total} - I_L \times r_{total}$.</p>
                                <p>$V_T = 2.2 V - (0.6 A \times 0.225 \Omega)$.</p>
                                <p>$V_T = 2.2 - 0.135 = 2.065 V$.</p>
                                <p>The voltage across the battery terminals is 2.065 V.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Temperature Coefficient of Resistance:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Explanation:</strong> The temperature coefficient of resistance ($\alpha$) quantifies how much the resistance of a material changes for each degree Celsius (or Kelvin) change in temperature, relative to its resistance at a specific reference temperature (e.g., $0^{\circ}$C or $20^{\circ}$C). A positive $\alpha$ (most metals) means resistance increases with temperature, while a negative $\alpha$ (semiconductors) means resistance decreases.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Resistance Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Resistance at $T_1 = 50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($R_{50}$) = 30 $\Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Temperature coefficient at $T_0 = 0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($\alpha_0$) = $0.0038 /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</p>
                                <p>Find resistance at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($R_0$).</p>
                                <p>Use the formula $R_T = R_0 (1 + \alpha_0 T)$.</p>
                                <p>$R_{50} = R_0 (1 + \alpha_0 \times 50)$.</p>
                                <p>$30 = R_0 (1 + 0.0038 \times 50)$.</p>
                                <p>$30 = R_0 (1 + 0.19)$.</p>
                                <p>$30 = R_0 (1.19)$.</p>
                                <p>$R_0 = 30 / 1.19 \approx 25.21 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>The resistance at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is approximately 25.21 $\Omega$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Superposition Theorem (DC Circuits):</strong></p>
                                <p>In any linear DC network containing multiple independent voltage or current sources, the current flowing through (or the voltage across) any element is the algebraic sum of the currents (or voltages) produced by each independent source acting alone, with all other independent voltage sources replaced by short circuits and all other independent current sources replaced by open circuits.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Circuit Analysis using Superposition (Fig 4):</strong></p>
                                <p>Circuit: Left loop (12V, $R_1=4\Omega$, $R_c=8\Omega$), Right loop (6V, $R_2=6\Omega$, $R_c=8\Omega$). $R_c$ is common.</p>
                                <p>Find currents in branches: $I_{R1}$ (through 4$\Omega$), $I_{R2}$ (through 6$\Omega$), $I_{Rc}$ (through 8$\Omega$).</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Digital vs. Analog Instruments & Wattmeter Reading:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Advantages of Digital over Analog Instruments:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Higher Accuracy:</strong> Generally offer better accuracy and resolution.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Easier Readability:</strong> Digital display eliminates parallax error and reduces reading ambiguity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Higher Input Impedance:</strong> Digital voltmeters typically have very high input impedance, reducing loading effects on the circuit being measured.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> Less susceptible to damage from mechanical shock or vibration.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Output Capabilities:</strong> Can often provide digital output for recording or processing by computers.</li>
                                     <li>(State any three)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Wattmeter Reading Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Current coil resistance ($R_{cc}$) = $0.02 \Omega$, Load resistance ($R_L$) = $2 \Omega$, Current (I) = 12 A.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">The wattmeter reading depends on the voltage across its potential coil (PC) and the current through its current coil (CC), and the power factor. The connection of the PC is crucial. Assuming PC is connected across the $2\Omega$ load and the load is purely resistive (PF=1).</p>
                                <p>Voltage across load ($V_L$) = $I \times R_L = 12 A \times 2 \Omega = 24 V$.</p>
                                <p>Power measured by wattmeter (assuming PC across load) = Power in Load.</p>
                                <p>$P = V_L \times I \times PF = 24 V \times 12 A \times 1 = 288 W$.</p>
                                <p>Wattmeter reading is likely **288 W**. (If it included CC power loss, it would be $288 + (12^2 \times 0.02) = 288 + 2.88 = 290.88$ W, but this depends on connection).</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Faraday's Laws of Electromagnetic Induction:</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Whenever the magnetic flux linking a circuit changes, an EMF is induced in the circuit.</li>
                                    <li>The magnitude of the induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux linkage ($E \propto d(N\Phi)/dt$).</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Inductance and Induced EMF Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Flux ($\Phi$) = 30 mWb = $30 \times 10^{-3}$ Wb.</p>
                                <p>Number of turns (N) = 1600.</p>
                                <p>Initial Current ($I_1$) = 1.5 A.</p>
                                <p>Final Current ($I_2$) = 0 A.</p>
                                <p>Time interval ($\Delta t$) = 200 ms = $0.2$ s.</p>

                                <p><strong>(I) Inductance of the coil (L):</strong></p>
                                <p>Inductance relates flux linkage ($N\Phi$) to the current (I) producing it, assuming linearity.</p>
                                <p>$L = (N\Phi) / I$.</p>
                                <p>$L = (1600 \times 30 \times 10^{-3} \text{ Wb}) / 1.5 \text{ A}$.</p>

                                <p>Inductance = 32 H.</p>

                                <p><strong>(II) Average e.m.f induced ($E_{avg}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Induced EMF $E = -L (di/dt)$. For average EMF, use average rate of change of current.</p>
                                <p>Average rate of change of current = $\Delta I / \Delta t = (I_2 - I_1) / \Delta t = (0 - 1.5) / 0.2 = -1.5 / 0.2 = -7.5$ A/s.</p>
                                <p>$E_{avg} = -L \times (\Delta I / \Delta t) = -(32 H) \times (-7.5 A/s) = +240$ V.</p>
                                <p>Alternatively, use Faraday's Law: $E_{avg} = -N (\Delta\Phi / \Delta t)$.</p>
                                <p>Change in flux $\Delta\Phi = \Phi_{final} - \Phi_{initial}$. If current goes from 1.5A to 0, flux goes from 30mWb to 0.</p>
                                <p>$\Delta\Phi = 0 - (30 \times 10^{-3}) = -30 \times 10^{-3}$ Wb.</p>
                                <p>$E_{avg} = -N (\Delta\Phi / \Delta t) = -1600 \times (-30 \times 10^{-3} / 0.2)$.</p>
                                <p>$E_{avg} = -1600 \times (-0.15) = +240$ V.</p>
                                <p>Average induced EMF = 240 V.</p>

                                <p>Substitute $P_{out} = P_{in} - P_{losses}$ into the efficiency formula:</p>
                                <p>$\eta = \frac{P_{in} - P_{losses}}{P_{in}} = \frac{P_{in}}{P_{in}} - \frac{P_{losses}}{P_{in}} = 1 - \frac{P_{losses}}{P_{in}}$.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, Efficiency $= 1 - \frac{\text{losses}}{\text{input power}}$. (Shown)</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Capacitor Circuit Analysis (Fig 7):</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: $V_S = 100V$, $C_1 = 4\mu F$, $C_2 = 6\mu F$, $C_3 = 6\mu F$.</p>
                                <p>Configuration: $C_1$ in series with the parallel combination of $C_2$ and $C_3$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Equivalent Circuit Capacitance ($C_{eq}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Step 1: Find equivalent capacitance of parallel $C_2$ and $C_3$ ($C_{23}$).</p>
                                <p>$C_{23} = C_2 + C_3 = 6 \mu F + 6 \mu F = 12 \mu F$.</p>
                                <p>Step 2: Find equivalent capacitance of $C_1$ in series with $C_{23}$.</p>
                                <p>$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_{23}} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{12}$.</p>
                                <p>$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{3 + 1}{12} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}$.</p>
                                <p>$C_{eq} = 3 \mu F$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Voltage across each $6 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ capacitor ($V_2$ and $V_3$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The voltage across the parallel combination ($V_{23}$) is the same as the voltage across $C_2$ and $C_3$ ($V_2 = V_3 = V_{23}$).</p>
                                <p>First find the total charge ($Q_{total}$) drawn from the supply.</p>
                                <p>$Q_{total} = C_{eq} \times V_S = (3 \mu F) \times 100 V = 300 \mu C$.</p>
                                <p>In a series circuit, the charge on each series component is the same. So, the charge on $C_1$ is $Q_1 = 300 \mu C$, and the charge on the parallel combination $C_{23}$ is $Q_{23} = 300 \mu C$.</p>
                                <p>Now find the voltage across the parallel combination $C_{23}$:</p>
                                <p>$V_{23} = Q_{23} / C_{23} = (300 \mu C) / (12 \mu F) = 25 V$.</p>
                                <p>Since $C_2$ and $C_3$ are in parallel, the voltage across each is $V_{23}$.</p>
                                <p>$V_2 = V_3 = V_{23} = 25 V$.</p>
                                <p>The voltage across each $6 \mu F$ capacitor is 25 V.</p>
