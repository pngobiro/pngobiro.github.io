                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers nuclear physics (radioactive decay, nuclear stability) and wave properties (characteristics, wave equation analysis).</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Modes of Radioactive Decay:</strong></p>
                                <p>Radioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. The main modes are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Alpha (α) Decay:</strong> An unstable nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons (identical to a Helium-4 nucleus, ${ }_{2}^{4}He$). This decay typically occurs in heavy nuclei. The emission of an alpha particle reduces the mass number (A) by 4 and the atomic number (Z) by 2.
                                        <br>Example: ${ }_{92}^{238}U \longrightarrow { }_{90}^{234}Th + { }_{2}^{4}\alpha$</li>
                                    <li><strong>Beta (β) Decay:</strong> This involves the transformation of a nucleon within the nucleus.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Beta-minus (β⁻) Decay:</strong> A neutron transforms into a proton, emitting an electron (${ }_{-1}^{0}e$) and an electron antineutrino ($\bar{\nu}_e$). This typically occurs in nuclei with an excess of neutrons. The mass number (A) remains unchanged, and the atomic number (Z) increases by 1.
                                                <br>Example: ${ }_{6}^{14}C \longrightarrow { }_{7}^{14}N + { }_{-1}^{0}e + \bar{\nu}_e$</li>
                                            <li><strong>Beta-plus (β⁺) Decay (Positron Emission):</strong> A proton transforms into a neutron, emitting a positron (${ }_{+1}^{0}e$, the antiparticle of the electron) and an electron neutrino ($\nu_e$). This requires energy input or occurs in proton-rich nuclei. The mass number (A) remains unchanged, and the atomic number (Z) decreases by 1.
                                                <br>Example: ${ }_{11}^{22}Na \longrightarrow { }_{10}^{22}Ne + { }_{+1}^{0}e + \nu_e$</li>
                                            <li><strong>Electron Capture (EC):</strong> A proton-rich nucleus captures an inner atomic electron, transforming a proton into a neutron and emitting an electron neutrino ($\nu_e$). Similar effect to positron emission (A unchanged, Z decreases by 1).
                                                <br>Example: ${ }_{13}^{26}Al + { }_{-1}^{0}e \longrightarrow { }_{12}^{26}Mg + \nu_e$</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Gamma (γ) Decay:</strong> An excited nucleus (*) transitions to a lower energy state (often the ground state) by emitting a high-energy photon called a gamma ray. This usually follows alpha or beta decay, which leaves the daughter nucleus in an excited state. Gamma decay does not change the mass number (A) or the atomic number (Z).
                                        <br>Example: ${ }_{27}^{60}Co \xrightarrow{\beta^-} { }_{28}^{60}Ni^* \longrightarrow { }_{28}^{60}Ni + \gamma$</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(b) Neutron-Proton Ratio and Stability:</strong></p>
                                <p>The stability of an atomic nucleus depends significantly on the balance between the number of neutrons (N) and protons (Z), represented by the N/Z ratio.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Light Nuclei (Z < 20):</strong> Stable nuclei tend to have N ≈ Z, meaning the N/Z ratio is close to 1.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Heavy Nuclei (Z > 20):</strong> As the number of protons increases, the repulsive electrostatic forces between them become stronger and have a longer range than the attractive strong nuclear force (which is short-range). To maintain stability, more neutrons are needed to increase the strong force attraction and separate the protons slightly, overcoming the increasing repulsion. Therefore, stable heavy nuclei have N > Z, and the N/Z ratio increases, reaching about 1.5 for the heaviest stable nuclei.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Band of Stability:</strong> A plot of N versus Z for known isotopes shows that stable nuclei lie within a narrow region called the "band of stability."</li>
                                        <li><strong>Instability:</strong> Nuclei outside this band are unstable and undergo radioactive decay to move towards a more stable N/Z ratio.
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Nuclei *above* the band (neutron-rich, high N/Z) tend to undergo β⁻ decay (neutron → proton).</li>
                                                <li>Nuclei *below* the band (proton-rich, low N/Z) tend to undergo β⁺ decay or electron capture (proton → neutron).</li>
                                                <li>Very heavy nuclei (Z > 83) are generally unstable regardless of the N/Z ratio and tend to undergo α decay or fission to reduce their size.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Characteristics of Plane Progressive Waves:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Energy Transfer:</strong> They transfer energy from the source outwards without net transfer of the medium itself.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Waveform Propagation:</strong> The waveform (pattern of disturbance) travels through the medium or space at a definite speed (wave velocity).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Particle Oscillation:</strong> Particles of the medium (if applicable) oscillate about their mean positions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Phase:</strong> All particles oscillating in the same state (e.g., at maximum displacement) constitute a wavefront. The phase of oscillation varies continuously from point to point along the direction of propagation.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Constant Amplitude (Ideal):</strong> In the absence of damping, the amplitude of oscillation for particles is constant for a plane wave.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Defined Wavelength and Frequency:</strong> They have a specific wavelength ($\lambda$) and frequency ($f$) related by the wave velocity ($v = f\lambda$).</li>
                                     <li>(Any five valid characteristics)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(d) Wave Equation Analysis:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given wave equation: $y=0.03 \operatorname{Sin}(200 \pi t-0.5 \pi x)$</p>
                                <p>The standard form of a progressive wave equation is $y = A \sin(\omega t - kx)$, where:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A = Amplitude</li>
                                    <li>$\omega$ = Angular frequency ($2\pi f$)</li>
                                    <li>k = Wave number ($2\pi / \lambda$)</li>
                                    <li>t = time</li>
                                    <li>x = position</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Comparing the given equation with the standard form:</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Amplitude (A):</strong></p>
                                <p>$A = 0.03$ m.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Wavelength ($\lambda$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The wave number $k = 0.5 \pi$.</p>
                                <p>Since $k = 2\pi / \lambda$,</p>
                                <p>$0.5 \pi = 2\pi / \lambda$</p>
                                <p>$\lambda = 2\pi / (0.5 \pi) = 2 / 0.5 = 4$ m.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Velocity of the wave (v):</strong></p>
                                <p>The angular frequency $\omega = 200 \pi$.</p>
                                <p>Since $\omega = 2\pi f$, the frequency $f = \omega / (2\pi) = (200 \pi) / (2\pi) = 100$ Hz.</p>
                                <p>The wave velocity $v = f \lambda$.</p>
                                <p>$v = 100 \text{ Hz} \times 4 \text{ m} = 400 \text{ m/s}$.</p>
                                <p>Alternatively, $v = \omega / k = (200 \pi) / (0.5 \pi) = 200 / 0.5 = 400 \text{ m/s}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Newton's Law of Cooling:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Statement:</strong></p>
                                <p>The rate of loss of heat of a body by cooling is directly proportional to the excess temperature of the body above the temperature of its surroundings, provided the temperature difference is small and the nature of the radiating surface remains the same.</p>
                                <p>Mathematically: $\frac{dQ}{dt} = -k(\theta - \theta_0)$, where $\theta$ is the temperature of the body, $\theta_0$ is the temperature of the surroundings, and k is a positive constant. If heat loss is primarily by convection/radiation leading to a temperature drop, this can also be expressed in terms of rate of temperature change: $\frac{d\theta}{dt} = -K(\theta - \theta_0)$ (where K incorporates heat capacity).</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Cooling Time Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Using the approximate form $\frac{d\theta}{dt} = -K(\theta - \theta_0)$. Integrating gives $\ln(\theta - \theta_0) = -Kt + C$. Or, $\theta - \theta_0 = A e^{-Kt}$.</p>
                                <p>Given: $\theta_0 = 20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</p>
                                <p>Case 1: $\theta$ drops from 32°C to 27°C in $t_1 = 3$ hours.</p>
                                <p>At t=0, $\theta=32$. Excess temp = $32 - 20 = 12$. So, $12 = A e^0 \implies A = 12$.</p>
                                <p>$\theta - 20 = 12 e^{-Kt}$.</p>
                                <p>At t=3 hours, $\theta=27$. Excess temp = $27 - 20 = 7$.</p>
                                <p>$7 = 12 e^{-K(3)}$</p>
                                <p>$e^{-3K} = 7/12$</p>
                                <p>$-3K = \ln(7/12) \approx -0.539$</p>
                                <p>$K = 0.539 / 3 \approx 0.1797 \text{ hour}^{-1}$.</p>

                                <p>Case 2: Find time $t_2$ for $\theta$ to drop from 27°C to 23°C.</p>
                                <p>Starting point for this phase: $\theta = 27$ at $t = 3$ hours.</p>
                                <p>End point: $\theta = 23$.</p>
                                <p>We need the time interval $\Delta t = t_{final} - 3$.</p>
                                <p>At $\theta=23$, excess temp = $23 - 20 = 3$.</p>
                                <p>Using $\theta - 20 = 12 e^{-Kt_{final}}$:</p>
                                <p>$3 = 12 e^{-K t_{final}}$</p>
                                <p>$e^{-K t_{final}} = 3/12 = 1/4$</p>
                                <p>$-K t_{final} = \ln(1/4) = -\ln(4) \approx -1.3863$</p>
                                <p>$t_{final} = 1.3863 / K = 1.3863 / 0.1797 \approx 7.714$ hours.</p>
                                <p>The time interval required is $\Delta t = t_{final} - t_{start} = 7.714 - 3 = 4.714$ hours.</p>
                                <p>It takes approximately **4.71 hours** for the temperature to fall from 27°C to 23°C.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Damped vs. Forced Vibration:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Damped Vibration:</strong> This occurs when an oscillating system loses energy to its surroundings, usually due to frictional or resistive forces (like air resistance, internal friction). As a result, the amplitude of the oscillations gradually decreases over time until the motion stops. The frequency may also be slightly lower than the natural frequency.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Forced Vibration:</strong> This occurs when a system is subjected to an external periodic driving force. The system is forced to oscillate at the frequency of the external driver, not necessarily at its own natural frequency. The amplitude of the forced vibration depends on the driving frequency and the damping present, reaching a maximum when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency (resonance).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(d) SHM Period and Derivation:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Period Definition:</strong></p>
                                <p>The period (T) of a simple harmonic motion is the time taken for one complete oscillation or cycle of the motion. It is the time after which the motion repeats itself exactly. Unit: seconds (s).</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Derivation for Horizontal Mass-Spring System (Fig 1):</strong></p>
                                <p>Consider a mass $m$ attached to a horizontal spring of spring constant $k$, oscillating on a frictionless surface.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Let $x$ be the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.</li>
                                    <li>According to Hooke's Law, the restoring force exerted by the spring is $F = -kx$. The negative sign indicates the force is always directed opposite to the displacement, towards the equilibrium position.</li>
                                    <li>According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the net force equals mass times acceleration: $F = ma$.</li>
                                    <li>Equating these two expressions for force: $ma = -kx$.</li>
                                    <li>Rearranging gives the acceleration: $a = -(k/m)x$.</li>
                                    <li>This equation defines Simple Harmonic Motion, where the acceleration is proportional to the negative of the displacement. The constant of proportionality relates to the angular frequency ($\omega$) as $a = -\omega^2 x$.</li>
                                    <li>Comparing the two expressions for acceleration, we see that $\omega^2 = k/m$.</li>
                                    <li>Therefore, the angular frequency is $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$.</li>
                                    <li>The period (T) is related to the angular frequency by $T = 2\pi / \omega$.</li>
                                    <li>Substituting the expression for $\omega$:</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>$T = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{k/m}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$</p>
                                <p>This is the expression for the periodic time of a horizontal mass-spring system undergoing SHM.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers definitions of work, energy, power, energy conservation, energy conversion in an oscillating system, moment principles, and vector addition of forces.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Work:</strong> Work is done when a force causes a displacement of an object in the direction of the force. It is calculated as the product of the force component in the direction of displacement and the magnitude of the displacement ($W = F \cdot d \cos\theta$). Unit: Joule (J).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Energy:</strong> Energy is the capacity or ability to do work. It exists in various forms (kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, electrical, etc.) and can be converted from one form to another. Unit: Joule (J).</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Power:</strong> Power is the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred or converted. It is calculated as work done divided by the time taken ($P = W/t$) or energy transferred divided by time taken ($P = E/t$). Unit: Watt (W), which is equivalent to Joule per second (J/s).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Energy Conservation and Conversion:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Principle of Conservation of Energy:</strong> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system to another. The total energy in an isolated system remains constant.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Energy Conversion in Vertical Mass-Spring System:</strong></p>
                                <p>When a mass oscillates vertically on a helical spring, energy continuously converts between three forms (assuming no damping):</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Kinetic Energy (KE):</strong> Energy due to the motion of the mass ($KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$). It is maximum when the mass passes through the equilibrium position (maximum speed) and zero at the extreme upper and lower points of oscillation (momentarily at rest).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE):</strong> Energy due to the height of the mass relative to a reference level (e.g., the equilibrium position, $GPE = mgh$). It is maximum at the highest point and minimum at the lowest point of oscillation.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Elastic Potential Energy (EPE):</strong> Energy stored in the spring due to its extension or compression from its natural length ($EPE = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where x is the displacement from the equilibrium position of the *spring itself*, or related to displacement from system equilibrium). It is maximum when the spring is maximally stretched (lowest point) or maximally compressed (highest point relative to equilibrium extension) and minimum (but usually non-zero) at the equilibrium position of the *oscillating system*.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>As the mass oscillates:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Moving down from top extreme: GPE decreases, EPE increases, KE increases then decreases.</li>
                                        <li>Moving up from bottom extreme: GPE increases, EPE decreases, KE increases then decreases.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    The total mechanical energy (KE + GPE + EPE) remains constant throughout the oscillation (neglecting damping).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Moments vs. Couple:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Principle of Moments:</strong> For a body to be in rotational equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about *any* pivot point must be equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the same pivot point. ($\sum M_{cw} = \sum M_{acw}$). This applies to any system of coplanar forces acting on a body in equilibrium.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Moment of a Couple:</strong> A couple is a specific system of two equal and opposite parallel forces that produces a pure turning effect. The moment of a couple is the product of the magnitude of one of the forces and the perpendicular distance *between* the lines of action of the two forces. The moment of a couple is the same about *any* point in the plane. It represents the torque produced by the couple.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Distinction: The principle of moments applies to the equilibrium condition for *any* set of forces about *any* chosen point. The moment of a couple refers to the turning effect produced by a *specific* pair of forces, and its value is independent of the pivot point chosen.</p>

                                <p>Forces acting along sides:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Along AB (+x direction): +5 N</li>
                                        <li>Along BC (+y direction): +3 N</li>
                                        <li>Along CD (-x direction): -5 N</li>
                                        <li>Along DA (-y direction): -3 N</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) Circular Motion Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Angular Velocity ($\omega$):</strong> The rate of change of angular displacement ($\theta$) with respect to time ($t$).

                                <p><strong>(ii) Centripetal Force ($F_c$):</strong> The net inward force required to keep an object moving in a circular path at a constant speed. This force is always directed towards the center of the circle and is responsible for causing the centripetal acceleration ($a_c = v^2/r = \omega^2 r$). It is given by $F_c = ma_c = mv^2/r = m\omega^2 r$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Centrifugal Force:</strong> An apparent or fictitious outward force experienced by an observer in a rotating (non-inertial) frame of reference. It appears to act away from the center of rotation and is equal in magnitude to the centripetal force ($m\omega^2 r$). It arises due to inertia, not a real physical interaction.</p>

                                <p>Description:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>A U-shaped glass tube contains a suitable manometer liquid (e.g., water, mercury) of density $\rho$.</li>
                                    <li>One arm of the U-tube is connected to the vessel containing the gas whose pressure ($P_{gas}$) is to be measured.</li>
                                    <li>The other arm is left open to the atmosphere (atmospheric pressure $P_{atm}$).</li>
                                    <li>If $P_{gas} > P_{atm}$, the liquid level in the arm connected to the gas (Level A) will be lower than the level in the open arm (Level B).</li>
                                    <li>Consider a horizontal reference line at the level of the lower liquid surface (Level A).</li>
                                    <li>Pressure at Level A in the gas arm = $P_{gas}$.</li>
                                    <li>Pressure at Level C (same horizontal level as A) in the open arm = $P_{atm}$ + Pressure due to liquid column of height h (where $h = L_B - L_A$ is the difference in liquid levels).</li>
                                    <li>Pressure due to liquid column of height h = $h \rho g$.</li>
                                    <li>Since pressures at the same horizontal level in a continuous fluid at rest must be equal: $P_{gas} = P_{atm} + h \rho g$.</li>
                                    <li>The gauge pressure ($P_{gauge}$) is the difference between the gas pressure and atmospheric pressure: $P_{gauge} = P_{gas} - P_{atm} = h \rho g$.</li>
                                    <li>By measuring the height difference $h$ and knowing the liquid density $\rho$ and gravity $g$, the gauge pressure can be determined. (If $P_{gas} < P_{atm}$, the level in the gas arm will be higher, and $h$ will be measured accordingly, giving a negative gauge pressure).</li>

                                    <li><strong>Reversible:</strong> All processes within the cycle must be fully reversible, meaning they can be reversed without any net change in the system or surroundings (no dissipative effects like friction, no irreversible heat transfer across finite temperature differences).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Operating between Two Fixed Temperatures:</strong> Heat must be absorbed only at a constant high temperature ($T_h$) and rejected only at a constant low temperature ($T_l$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Consisting of Specific Processes:</strong> The cycle must consist of two isothermal processes (heat transfer at constant temperature) and two adiabatic processes (no heat transfer).</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Steam Plant Efficiency Calculation:</strong></p>

                                        <li>Calorific value of coal (CV) = 37 MJ/kg = $37 \times 10^6$ J/kg.</li>
                                        <li>Power output ($P_{out}$) = 120 MW = $120 \times 10^6$ W.</li>
                                        <li>Upper temperature ($T_h$) = $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C} = 400 + 273.15 = 673.15$ K.</li>

                                <p><strong>(I) Overall Efficiency ($\eta_{overall}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Rate of heat input from coal ($P_{in}$) = Coal consumption rate (kg/s) $\times$ CV (J/kg).</p>
                                <p>$P_{in} = 10.11 \text{ kg/s} \times 37 \times 10^6 \text{ J/kg} \approx 3.741 \times 10^8 \text{ J/s} = 374.1 \text{ MW}$.</p>
                                <p>Overall Efficiency = (Power Output) / (Rate of Heat Input)</p>
                                <p>$\eta_{overall} = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} = \frac{120 \times 10^6 \text{ W}}{3.741 \times 10^8 \text{ W}} \approx 0.3208$.</p>
                                <p>Overall Efficiency $\approx 32.1\%$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(II) Carnot Cycle Efficiency ($\eta_{Carnot}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The Carnot efficiency is the maximum possible theoretical efficiency for an engine operating between the given temperatures $T_h$ and $T_l$.</p>
                                <p>$\eta_{Carnot} = 1 - \frac{T_l}{T_h}$ (Temperatures must be in Kelvin).</p>

                                <p>Carnot Cycle Efficiency $\approx 55.0\%$.</p>

                                <p>From (5), $i_d = i_c + i_g$. Substitute into (7): $4i_c - 3(i_c + i_g) - 5i_g = 0 \implies i_c - 8i_g = 0 \implies i_c = 8i_g$.</p>
                                <p>Substitute $i_a$ and $i_c$ into (1): $(7i_g) + 4(8i_g) = 10 \implies 7i_g + 32i_g = 10 \implies 39i_g = 10 \implies i_g = 10/39 \approx 0.256 A$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Peak value of current ($I_m$):</strong></p>
                                <p>First, find the RMS current ($I_{rms}$): $I_{rms} = V_{rms} / R = 200 V / 10 \Omega = 20 A$.</p>
                                <p>For a sinusoidal waveform, $I_{rms} = I_m / \sqrt{2}$.</p>
                                <p>$I_m = I_{rms} \times \sqrt{2} = 20 A \times \sqrt{2} \approx 20 \times 1.414 = 28.28 A$.</p>

                                <p>Given: EMF ($E$) = 1.5 V, internal resistance ($r$) = 0.1 $\Omega$, external resistance ($R$) = 30 $\Omega$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Current with single cell:</strong></p>
                                <p>Total resistance ($R_{total}$) = $R + r = 30 + 0.1 = 30.1 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Current ($I$) = $E / R_{total} = 1.5 V / 30.1 \Omega \approx 0.0498 A$.</p>
                                <p>Current $\approx 49.8$ mA.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Current with twelve cells in parallel:</strong></p>
                                <p>When identical cells are connected in parallel:</p>

                                    <li>Total EMF remains the same as one cell: $E_{parallel} = E = 1.5 V$.</li>
                                    <li>Total internal resistance ($r_{parallel}$) = $r / N$, where N is the number of cells.</li>

                                <p>(Note: Connecting cells in parallel reduces the effective internal resistance, allowing slightly more current to flow, especially noticeable if the external resistance was much smaller).</p>

                                    <li>This no-load current $I_0$ has two components:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Magnetizing Component ($I_m$):</strong> This component is in quadrature (lags $V_p$ by 90°) and is responsible for setting up the alternating magnetic flux ($\Phi$) in the core. It overcomes the magnetic reluctance of the core.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Core Loss Component ($I_c$ or $I_w$):</strong> This component is in phase with $V_p$ and supplies the power required to cover the iron losses (hysteresis and eddy current losses) occurring in the core due to the alternating flux.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The no-load current $I_0$ is the phasor sum of $I_m$ and $I_c$ ($I_0 = \sqrt{I_m^2 + I_c^2}$). Since $I_m$ is usually much larger than $I_c$ in practical transformers, $I_0$ is small (typically 2-5% of full-load current) and lags $V_p$ by a large angle $\phi_0$ (close to 90°), resulting in a low no-load power factor ($\cos \phi_0$).</li>
                                    <li>The alternating flux $\Phi$ produced by $I_0$ links both primary and secondary windings, inducing the back EMF $E_p$ in the primary (nearly equal to $V_p$) and the no-load secondary EMF $E_s$ (which is the no-load secondary voltage $V_s$).</li>
                                    <li>The no-load power input ($P_0 = V_p I_0 \cos \phi_0$) is approximately equal to the iron losses in the core, as primary copper loss ($I_0^2 R_p$) is usually negligible due to the small $I_0$.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) Iron Losses (Core Losses) in Transformers:</strong></p>
                                <p>These losses occur in the iron core due to the alternating magnetic flux and are present whenever the transformer is energized (even on no-load). They consist of:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Hysteresis Loss:</strong> Energy is lost as heat due to the repeated magnetization and demagnetization of the core material during each cycle of the alternating flux. The molecules/magnetic domains within the core resist changes in their orientation, and energy is expended in overcoming this internal friction. This loss depends on the area of the material's hysteresis loop, the frequency, and the maximum flux density. It is minimized by using core materials with a narrow hysteresis loop (e.g., silicon steel).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Eddy Current Loss:</strong> The alternating magnetic flux induces circulating currents (eddy currents) within the body of the core material itself, according to Faraday's Law. These currents flow through the resistance of the core material, dissipating energy as heat ($I^2R$ loss). This loss depends on the frequency squared, the maximum flux density squared, and the conductivity of the core material, and is inversely proportional to the resistivity. It is minimized by using a laminated core (thin sheets insulated from each other) to increase the overall resistance to eddy current flow and break up their paths.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(a) Electric and Magnetic Circuit Analogy Completion:</strong></p>
                                <p>See completed table in the question section above.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Air-Cored Toroidal Coil Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Number of turns (N) = 3000</li>
                                        <li>Current (I) = 0.1 A</li>
                                        <li>Mean length of magnetic circuit ($l$) = 15 cm = 0.15 m</li>
                                        <li>Cross-sectional area (A) = 4 cm² = $4 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2$</li>
                                        <li>Core is air, so permeability $\mu = \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ H/m.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Magnetic Field Strength (H):</strong></p>
                                <p>For a toroid, the magnetic field strength is given by $H = \frac{NI}{l}$.</p>
                                <p>$H = \frac{3000 \times 0.1 \text{ A}}{0.15 \text{ m}} = \frac{300}{0.15} = 2000 \text{ A/m}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Total Flux in the coil ($\Phi$):</strong></p>
                                <p>First, find the magnetic flux density (B): $B = \mu H = \mu_0 H$ (since it's air-cored).</p>
                                <p>$B = (4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ H/m}) \times (2000 \text{ A/m}) = 8\pi \times 10^{-4} \text{ T} \approx 0.002513 \text{ T}$.</p>
                                <p>Total Flux ($\Phi$) = $B \times A$.</p>
                                <p>$\Phi = (8\pi \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}) \times (4 \times 10^{-4} \text{ m}^2) = 32\pi \times 10^{-8} \text{ Wb}$.</p>
                                <p>$\Phi \approx 1.005 \times 10^{-6} \text{ Wb}$ or $1.005 \mu Wb$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Dielectrics:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Properties of Dielectrics:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Electrical Insulation:</strong> They are poor conductors of electricity (high electrical resistivity).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Polarization:</strong> When placed in an electric field, the positive and negative charges within the atoms/molecules displace slightly, creating dipoles or aligning existing dipoles. This polarization reduces the net electric field within the dielectric.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Dielectric Strength:</strong> The maximum electric field strength a dielectric can withstand without breaking down (becoming conductive).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Dielectric Constant (Relative Permittivity, $\epsilon_r$):</strong> A measure of a dielectric's ability to store electrical energy compared to a vacuum. It's the factor by which capacitance increases when the dielectric replaces vacuum. $\epsilon_r > 1$.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Dielectric Loss:</strong> Energy dissipated as heat within the dielectric when subjected to an alternating electric field. Good dielectrics have low loss.</li>
                                </ul>
                                 (State any four properties).

                                <p><strong>(ii) Derivation of Parallel Plate Capacitance:</strong></p>
                                <p>Consider a parallel plate capacitor with:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Plate area = A</li>
                                    <li>Distance between plates = d</li>
                                    <li>Dielectric material with absolute permittivity $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r$</li>
                                    <li>Charge on plates = +Q and -Q</li>
                                    <li>Voltage between plates = V</li>
                                </ul>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Assume a uniform electric field (E) exists between the plates (neglecting fringing effects).</li>
                                    <li>From Gauss's Law, the electric field due to a large charged plate is $E_{plate} = \sigma / (2\epsilon)$, where $\sigma = Q/A$ is the surface charge density. The field between two oppositely charged plates is $E = \sigma/\epsilon = Q/(A\epsilon)$.</li>
                                    <li>The potential difference (V) between the plates is related to the electric field by $V = E \times d$ (for a uniform field).</li>
                                    <li>Substitute the expression for E: $V = \left(\frac{Q}{A\epsilon}\right) d$.</li>
                                    <li>Capacitance (C) is defined as the ratio of charge stored (Q) to the potential difference (V): $C = Q / V$.</li>
                                    <li>Substitute the expression for V: $C = \frac{Q}{\left(\frac{Qd}{A\epsilon}\right)}$.</li>
                                    <li>Simplify the expression: $C = Q \times \frac{A\epsilon}{Qd} = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}$.</li>
                                    <li>Substituting $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r$:</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>$C = \frac{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r A}{d}$</p>
                                <p>This is the expression for the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">The question tests the understanding of magnetic/electric circuit analogies, calculations for toroidal coils, and the fundamental properties and capacitance derivation for dielectrics and parallel plates.</p>
