                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers electrolysis of aqueous solutions, Faraday's laws calculations, and the preparation of ethene gas.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Electrolysis of Zinc Sulphate ($ZnSO_4(aq)$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Ions present: $Zn^{2+}(aq)$, $SO_4^{2-}(aq)$, $H^+(aq)$, $OH^-(aq)$ (from water ionization).</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Reaction at Electrode A (Anode - Positive):</strong></p>
                                <p>$SO_4^{2-}$ and $OH^-$ migrate to the anode. $OH^-$ ions are discharged preferentially over $SO_4^{2-}$ ions (unless the electrode is reactive, but platinum is inert).</p>
                                <p>Ionic Equation: $4OH^-(aq) \longrightarrow 2H_2O(l) + O_2(g) + 4e^-$</p>
                                <p>Observation: Bubbles of a colorless gas (oxygen) are produced.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Identity of Electrode B (Cathode - Negative):</strong></p>
                                <p>Electrode B is the Cathode.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Observation at Cathode B if Copper Plate Used:</strong></p>
                                <p>$Zn^{2+}$ and $H^+$ migrate to the cathode. Comparing standard reduction potentials: $Zn^{2+} + 2e^- \rightarrow Zn$ ($E^0 = -0.76V$), $2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2$ ($E^0 = 0.00V$). Hydrogen ions ($H^+$) are more easily reduced than Zinc ions ($Zn^{2+}$). Therefore, hydrogen gas will be produced, regardless of whether the cathode is platinum or copper (as copper is also less reactive than hydrogen).</p>
                                <p>Observation: Bubbles of a colorless gas (hydrogen) are produced. $2H^+(aq) + 2e^- \longrightarrow H_2(g)$</p>

                                <p><strong>(iv) Apparatus instead of Syringe:</strong></p>
                                <p>An inverted measuring cylinder or gas burette filled with water can be placed over electrode B to collect and measure the volume of hydrogen gas produced.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Electrolysis Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: mass $m=0.22$ g, current $I=0.06$ A, time $t=99$ minutes = $99 \times 60 = 5940$ s, Molar mass $M=184$ g/mol, Faraday constant $F=96500$ C/mol.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Moles of electrons passed:</strong></p>
                                <p>Quantity of charge $Q = I \times t = 0.06 \text{ A} \times 5940 \text{ s} = 356.4 \text{ C}$.</p>
                                <p>Moles of electrons = $Q / F = 356.4 \text{ C} / 96500 \text{ C/mol} \approx 0.00369 \text{ moles}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Moles of metal P deposited:</strong></p>
                                <p>Moles of P = mass / Molar mass = $0.22 \text{ g} / 184 \text{ g/mol} \approx 0.001196 \text{ moles}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Charge on the ion of metal P:</strong></p>
                                <p>Let the charge on the ion be $+z$. The deposition reaction is $P^{z+} + ze^- \longrightarrow P$.</p>
                                <p>From stoichiometry, $\frac{\text{moles of electrons}}{\text{moles of P deposited}} = \frac{z}{1}$.</p>
                                <p>$z = \frac{0.00369 \text{ moles}}{0.001196 \text{ moles}} \approx 3.085$</p>
                                <p>Since the charge must be an integer, the charge on the ion of metal P is +3.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Preparation of Ethene:</strong></p>
                                <p>This reaction involves the dehydration of ethanol ($C_2H_5OH$) to form ethene ($C_2H_4$).</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Reagent A and Functions:</strong></p>
                                <p>Reagent A is concentrated Sulphuric acid ($H_2SO_4$).</p>
                                <p>Functions:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Dehydrating agent: Removes a molecule of water from ethanol.</li>
                                        <li>Catalyst: Speeds up the dehydration reaction (typically heated to around 170°C).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Sand Granules:</strong></p>
                                <p>Sand granules (or porcelain chips) are added to ensure smooth boiling of the liquid mixture (ethanol and conc. acid) and prevent bumping, which can occur due to superheating.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Alkali in Flask K and Function:</strong></p>
                                <p>Alkali used: Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution or Potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution.</p>
                                <p>Function: To absorb (scrub) acidic impurities produced during the reaction, such as sulphur dioxide ($SO_2$) from the reduction of sulphuric acid or carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) from excessive oxidation/charring.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iv) Preference for Sand Bath:</strong></p>
                                <p>A sand bath provides more uniform and controlled heating compared to direct heating with a Bunsen burner. This helps maintain the reaction temperature within the optimal range (around 170°C for ethene production) and minimizes side reactions like the formation of diethyl ether (at lower temperatures, ~140°C) or charring (at excessively high temperatures).</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">The question covers key aspects of electrolysis and a standard organic preparation method.</p>

                                <p>A stationary wave (or standing wave) is formed by the superposition (interference) of two progressive waves of the same frequency, amplitude, and speed travelling in opposite directions.</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Fix a string or elastic cord at one end (P).</li>
                                        <li>Attach the other end (Q) to a vibrator (e.g., driven by a signal generator) which oscillates perpendicularly to the string.</li>
                                        <li>Adjust the frequency of the vibrator and/or the tension in the string.</li>
                                        <li>Waves travel from the vibrator (Q) towards the fixed end (P), reflect off P with a phase change of 180°, and travel back towards Q.</li>
                                        <li>The incident waves from Q and the reflected waves from P interfere.</li>
                                        <li>At specific frequencies (resonant frequencies), the interference results in a stable pattern of nodes (points of zero amplitude) and antinodes (points of maximum amplitude). This pattern is the stationary wave.</li>

                                <p><strong>(i) Definition:</strong></p>
                                <p>Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a specific type of periodic motion or oscillation where the restoring force (and hence acceleration) is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position and is always directed towards that equilibrium position.</p>
                                <p>Mathematically: $F = -kx$ or $a = -\omega^2 x$, where $k$ and $\omega^2$ are positive constants.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) General Conditions:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A stable equilibrium position must exist.</li>
                                    <li>There must be a restoring force acting on the object when it is displaced from equilibrium.</li>
                                    <li>The restoring force must be directly proportional to the displacement ($F \propto x$).</li>
                                    <li>The restoring force must always act in the opposite direction to the displacement (towards equilibrium).</li>
                                    <li>Effects of friction/damping are negligible for ideal SHM.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Terminology:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Amplitude (A):</strong> The maximum displacement of the oscillating object from its equilibrium position.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Periodic Time (T):</strong> The time taken for one complete oscillation or cycle.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Frequency (f):</strong> The number of complete oscillations or cycles that occur per unit time (usually per second). It is the reciprocal of the periodic time ($f = 1/T$). Unit: Hertz (Hz).</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) Energy Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Potential Energy (PE):</strong> Energy possessed by an object by virtue of its position or configuration. Examples include gravitational potential energy (due to height) and elastic potential energy (due to deformation).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Kinetic Energy (KE):</strong> Energy possessed by an object by virtue of its motion. For an object of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$, $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Law of Conservation of Energy:</strong> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another or transferred from one system to another. The total energy in an isolated system remains constant.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Pile Driver Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Mass of pile ($m_p$) = $\frac{3}{4}$ tonne = 750 kg</li>
                                        <li>Mass of hammer ($m_h$) = 2 tonne = 2000 kg</li>
                                        <li>Drop height (h) = 1.22 m</li>
                                        <li>Mass supported by pile = 40 tonne = 40000 kg</li>
                                        <li>Ground resistance (R) = Weight of 40 tonnes = $40000 \times g = 40000 \times 9.81 = 392400$ N</li>
                                        <li>Impact is inelastic (hammer does not rebound, they move together initially).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Step 1: Velocity of hammer just before impact ($u_h$).</strong></p>
                                <p>Using conservation of energy (PE to KE): $m_h g h = \frac{1}{2} m_h u_h^2$.</p>
                                <p>$u_h = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.81 \times 1.22} = \sqrt{23.9364} \approx 4.892 \text{ m/s}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 2: Velocity of hammer and pile immediately after impact ($v_{common}$).</strong></p>
                                <p>Using conservation of linear momentum for the inelastic collision:</p>
                                <p>$m_h u_h + m_p (0) = (m_h + m_p) v_{common}$</p>
                                <p>$2000 \times 4.892 = (2000 + 750) v_{common}$</p>
                                <p>$9784 = 2750 v_{common}$</p>
                                <p>$v_{common} = 9784 / 2750 \approx 3.558 \text{ m/s}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 3: Penetration (d).</strong></p>
                                <p>Use the work-energy principle during penetration. The initial kinetic energy of the combined hammer and pile is dissipated by the net work done against resistance and gravity.</p>
                                <p>Initial KE of system = $\frac{1}{2}(m_h + m_p) v_{common}^2 = \frac{1}{2}(2750)(3.558)^2 \approx 17394 \text{ J}$.</p>
                                <p>Work done by gravity during penetration = $(m_h + m_p) g d = (2750)(9.81)d \approx 26978 d$.</p>
                                <p>Work done against ground resistance = $R \times d = 392400 d$.</p>
                                <p>Net work done = Change in KE</p>
                                <p>Work done by gravity - Work done against resistance = $KE_{final} - KE_{initial}$</p>
                                <p>$26978 d - 392400 d = 0 - 17394$</p>
                                <p>$-365422 d = -17394$</p>
                                <p>$d = 17394 / 365422 \approx 0.0476 \text{ m}$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Penetration per blow $\approx 0.0476$ m or 4.76 cm.</strong></p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Energy lost per blow:</strong></p>
                                <p>This usually refers to the energy lost *during the impact* due to inelastic collision.</p>
                                <p>Initial KE of hammer = $\frac{1}{2} m_h u_h^2 = \frac{1}{2}(2000)(4.892)^2 \approx 23936 \text{ J}$.</p>
                                <p>Initial KE of pile = 0 J.</p>
                                <p>Total KE before impact = 23936 J.</p>
                                <p>Total KE immediately after impact = $\frac{1}{2}(m_h + m_p) v_{common}^2 \approx 17394 \text{ J}$.</p>
                                <p>Energy lost during impact = KE before - KE after = $23936 - 17394 = 6542 \text{ J}$.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Alternatively, if "energy lost per blow" means the total energy dissipated against ground resistance, it would be $W_{resistance} = R \times d = 392400 \times 0.0476 \approx 18678$ J. However, loss during impact is the standard interpretation.</p>
                                <p><strong>Energy lost per blow (during impact) $\approx 6542$ J.</strong></p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Efficiency of the operation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Efficiency ($\eta$) = (Useful work done) / (Energy input)</p>
                                <p>Energy input = Potential energy of the hammer before dropping = $m_h g h = 23936$ J.</p>
                                <p>Useful work done = Work done in penetrating the pile against the ground resistance = Energy available immediately after impact (which is dissipated during penetration) = $17394$ J.</p>
                                <p>Efficiency $\eta = \frac{17394}{23936} \approx 0.7267$</p>
                                <p><strong>Efficiency $\approx 72.7\%$.</strong></p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">The calculation involves applying principles of energy conservation, momentum conservation, and the work-energy theorem.</p>

                                <p><strong>Position of Resultant Force (Line of Action):</strong></p>
                                <p>We use Varignon's Theorem (Principle of Moments). Calculate the sum of moments of the original forces about the origin (Vertex 1) and equate it to the moment of the resultant about the origin.</p>

Perpendicular distance from origin: $d_2 = 0.1 \times \sin(120^{\circ}) = 0.1 \times \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.0866$ m. Moment $M_2 = F_2 \times d_2 = 3P \times 0.0866 \approx 0.2598 P$ (Anticlockwise = positive).</p>
                                <p>Moment of $F_3$ about origin = 0 (passes through origin).</p>
                                <p>Total Moment $M_{total} = 0.2598 P$.</p>
                                <p>Let the resultant force R act along a line whose perpendicular distance from the origin is $d$.</p>
                                <p>Moment of Resultant $M_R = R \times d = (P\sqrt{3}) \times d$.</p>
                                <p>$M_{total} = M_R \implies 0.2598 P = (P\sqrt{3}) d$.</p>
                                <p>$d = 0.2598 / \sqrt{3} = 0.2598 / 1.732 \approx 0.15$ m.</p>
                                <p>Direction of Resultant: The angle $\theta$ with the positive x-axis.</p>
                                <p>$\tan \phi = |R_y / R_x| = |-0.866P / -1.5P| = 0.5773$. $\phi = 30^{\circ}$.</p>
                                <p>Since both $R_x$ and $R_y$ are negative, the angle is in the third quadrant.</p>
                                <p>$\theta = 180^{\circ} + 30^{\circ} = 210^{\circ}$ (or $-150^{\circ}$).</p>
                                <p>The resultant is $P\sqrt{3}$ acting at $210^{\circ}$ to the direction of the 2P force, along a line passing 0.15 m perpendicularly from the origin.</p>

                                <p>$p_A + p_B = (m_A + m_B) v_{final}$</p>
                                <p>$72000 + 42000 = (4000 + 6000) v_{final}$</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Magnet and Lines of Force:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Magnet Definition:</strong> A magnet is an object or material that produces a magnetic field. This field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Properties of Magnetic Lines of Force:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>They form closed loops, emerging from the north pole and entering the south pole externally, and continuing from south to north internally within the magnet.</li>
                                    <li>They never intersect each other.</li>
                                    <li>The density of the lines (how close they are together) indicates the strength of the magnetic field; denser lines mean a stronger field.</li>
                                    <li>The tangent to a field line at any point gives the direction of the magnetic field (or the force on a hypothetical north pole) at that point.</li>
                                     <li>They tend to shorten their length (like stretched elastic bands) and repel each other sideways.</li>
                                     <li>(Any three valid properties)</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) Sources of Error in Electrical Instruments:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Systematic Errors:</strong> These are errors inherent in the instrument or the measurement system, causing readings to be consistently off in one direction.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><em>Instrumental Errors:</em> Due to defects in manufacturing, calibration issues, or wear and tear (e.g., incorrect zero setting, non-linear scale, faulty components).</li>
                                            <li><em>Loading Errors:</em> The act of connecting the instrument alters the circuit conditions, causing the measured value to differ from the true value (e.g., voltmeter drawing current, ammeter having resistance).</li>
                                            <li><em>Environmental Errors:</em> Changes in temperature, humidity, pressure, or external magnetic/electric fields affecting the instrument's performance.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Random Errors:</strong> Unpredictable fluctuations in readings due to various uncontrollable factors.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><em>Observational Errors:</em> Parallax error when reading analog scales, estimation errors between scale divisions.</li>
                                            <li><em>Noise:</em> Electrical noise from internal components or external interference affecting sensitive electronic instruments.</li>
                                            <li><em>Fluctuations:</em> Minor variations in supply voltage or component values during measurement.</li>

                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Gross Errors (Mistakes):</strong> Human errors in reading the instrument, recording data incorrectly, using the instrument improperly (e.g., wrong range selection), or calculation mistakes.</li>
                                </ul>
                                 <p>(Explain any three distinct sources).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Circuit Analysis (Fig 4):</strong></p>
                                <p>Battery details: 4 cells in series.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Total EMF ($E_{total}$) = $4 \times 2 \text{ V} = 8 \text{ V}$.</li>
                                        <li>Total internal resistance ($r_{total}$) = $4 \times 0.2 \Omega = 0.8 \Omega$.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>External circuit: Resistor A ($R_A = 10 \Omega$) in parallel with Resistor B ($R_B = 15 \Omega$).</p>
                                <p>Equivalent external resistance ($R_{ext}$):</p>
                                <p>$\frac{1}{R_{ext}} = \frac{1}{R_A} + \frac{1}{R_B} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{3 + 2}{30} = \frac{5}{30} = \frac{1}{6}$</p>
                                <p>$R_{ext} = 6 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Total circuit resistance ($R_{circuit}$) = $R_{ext} + r_{total} = 6 \Omega + 0.8 \Omega = 6.8 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Total current drawn from the battery ($I_{total}$):</p>
                                <p>$I_{total} = \frac{E_{total}}{R_{circuit}} = \frac{8 \text{ V}}{6.8 \Omega} \approx 1.1765 \text{ A}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) P.D. between battery terminals P Q ($V_{PQ}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The potential difference across the battery terminals (terminal voltage) is the total EMF minus the voltage drop across the internal resistance OR the voltage across the external circuit.</p>
                                <p>$V_{PQ} = E_{total} - I_{total} \times r_{total} = 8 - (1.1765 \times 0.8) = 8 - 0.9412 = 7.0588 \text{ V}$.</p>
                                <p>Alternatively: $V_{PQ} = I_{total} \times R_{ext} = 1.1765 \times 6 = 7.059 \text{ V}$.</p>
                                <p><strong>$V_{PQ} \approx 7.06 \text{ V}$.</strong></p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Current through each resistor:</strong></p>
                                <p>The voltage across the parallel combination (across both $R_A$ and $R_B$) is $V_{PQ}$.</p>
                                <p>Current through $R_A$ ($I_A$): $I_A = \frac{V_{PQ}}{R_A} = \frac{7.059}{10} \approx 0.706 \text{ A}$.</p>
                                <p>Current through $R_B$ ($I_B$): $I_B = \frac{V_{PQ}}{R_B} = \frac{7.059}{15} \approx 0.471 \text{ A}$.</p>
                                <p>(Check: $I_A + I_B \approx 0.706 + 0.471 = 1.177 \text{ A}$, which matches $I_{total}$).</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Total power dissipated in the resistors ($P_{ext}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>This is the power dissipated in the external parallel combination ($R_{ext}$).</p>
                                <p>Method 1: $P_{ext} = V_{PQ} \times I_{total} = 7.059 \times 1.1765 \approx 8.305 \text{ W}$.</p>
                                <p>Method 2: $P_{ext} = I_{total}^2 \times R_{ext} = (1.1765)^2 \times 6 \approx 1.384 \times 6 \approx 8.305 \text{ W}$.</p>
                                <p>Method 3: Sum of power in individual resistors:
                                    $P_A = I_A^2 R_A = (0.7059)^2 \times 10 \approx 0.4983 \times 10 \approx 4.983 \text{ W}$.
                                    $P_B = I_B^2 R_B = (0.4706)^2 \times 15 \approx 0.2215 \times 15 \approx 3.322 \text{ W}$.
                                    $P_{total} = P_A + P_B = 4.983 + 3.322 = 8.305 \text{ W}$.</p>
                                <p><strong>Total power dissipated $\approx 8.31 \text{ W}$.</strong></p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">The analysis involves combining series and parallel resistances, accounting for internal resistance, and applying Ohm's law and power formulas.</p>
