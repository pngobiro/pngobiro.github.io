                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Thermionic Emission:</strong> A filament (part of the cathode) is heated by a low voltage supply, causing it to emit electrons.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong> A high voltage (kV range) is applied between the cathode (-) and the anode (+), accelerating the electrons to high speeds across the vacuum inside the glass tube.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Collision & Deceleration:</strong> The high-speed electrons collide with a metal target (anode, typically tungsten).</li>
                                    <li><strong>X-ray Production:</strong> Upon collision, the electrons rapidly decelerate and lose kinetic energy. A small fraction (~1%) of this energy is converted into X-ray photons (via Bremsstrahlung and Characteristic emission), while the majority (~99%) becomes heat in the target.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cooling & Shielding:</strong> The anode requires efficient cooling (e.g., fins, oil, rotation) to dissipate heat. Lead shielding contains stray radiation.</li>
                                </ol>
                                </p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question deals with classification of waves, damped oscillations, wave properties calculations, and homologous series in organic chemistry.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Wave Classification:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Mechanical vs. Electromagnetic Waves:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Mechanical Waves:</strong> Require a physical medium (solid, liquid, or gas) for propagation. Energy is transferred through the oscillation of particles of the medium. Example: Sound waves, water waves, waves on a string.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Electromagnetic Waves:</strong> Do not require a medium; can travel through a vacuum. Consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. Travel at the speed of light in vacuum. Example: Light waves, radio waves, X-rays, microwaves.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Transverse vs. Longitudinal Waves:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Transverse Waves:</strong> Particle oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of wave energy propagation. Exhibit crests and troughs. Example: Light waves, waves on a rope shaken up and down.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Longitudinal Waves:</strong> Particle oscillations are parallel to the direction of wave energy propagation. Consist of compressions and rarefactions. Example: Sound waves in air.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Damping:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Damping Explanation:</strong> Damping is the process by which the amplitude of oscillations in a system gradually decreases over time due to energy dissipation caused by resistive forces, such as friction or air resistance.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Underdamped vs. Overdamped Sketches:</strong></p>

                                        <li><strong>Underdamped:</strong> The system oscillates, but the amplitude decreases exponentially with time. It overshoots the equilibrium position before settling.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Overdamped:</strong> The system returns slowly to equilibrium without oscillating or overshooting. Damping is very strong.</li>

                                <p>Visualisation: C (Boat1) ... C ... C ... T (Boat2)</p>
                                <p>The distance between consecutive crests is one wavelength ($\lambda$).</p>
                                <p>The distance between a crest and the next trough is $\lambda/2$.</p>
                                <p>Pattern: Crest - Trough ($\lambda/2$) - Crest ($\lambda/2$) - Trough ($\lambda/2$) - Crest ($\lambda/2$) ...</p>
                                <p>Distance from Crest 1 to Crest 2 = $\lambda$.</p>
                                <p>Distance from Crest 1 to Crest 3 = $2\lambda$.</p>
                                <p>Distance from Crest 1 to Trough after Crest 3 = $2\lambda + \lambda/2 = 2.5\lambda$.</p>
                                <p>The distance between Boat 1 (Crest) and Boat 2 (Trough), with 2 crests in between, covers 2 full wavelengths plus half a wavelength.</p>

                                <p>The wavelength is 96 m.</p>

                                <p>Boats move up and down 30 times per minute. This gives the frequency (f).</p>
                                <p>Frequency (f) = 30 cycles / 60 seconds = 0.5 Hz.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Speed of the wave (v):</strong></p>
                                <p>$v = f \lambda$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Definition:</strong> A homologous series is a series of organic compounds having the same functional group and similar chemical properties, in which successive members differ by a constant relative molecular mass, typically corresponding to a $CH_2$ group.</p>

                                <p>$v_v = 160000 / 4000 = 40$ m/s.</p>

                                <p>$KE'_f = \frac{1}{2}(4000)(40)^2 = 2000 \times 1600 = 3,200,000$ J = 3.2 MJ.</p>

                                <p>A negative loss means KE *increased*, which is impossible in this type of collision without external energy input (like an explosion). This scenario as interpreted violates energy principles or requires significant external work/force not accounted for. The question part (ii) is likely flawed.</p>
                                 <p class="key-point">Assuming the question meant "How much energy was dissipated *by the truck* as it came to rest?", the answer would be its initial KE = 1.6 MJ. But "loss of kinetic energy" usually refers to the system.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Engine Governor:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Function:</strong> An engine governor automatically controls the mean speed of an engine by regulating the supply of fuel (or working fluid) in response to changes in load, maintaining the speed within specified limits.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Archimedes' Principle and Hydraulic Coupling:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Archimedes' Principle:</strong> When a body is wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upward buoyant force (upthrust) equal in magnitude to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Hydraulic Coupling Components:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Shell (Casing):</strong> The sealed housing that contains the working fluid (usually oil) and encloses the impeller and turbine, preventing leakage and contamination.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Impeller (Pump):</strong> Connected to the input/driving shaft. Its vanes accelerate the working fluid outwards centrifugally as it rotates, imparting kinetic energy to the fluid.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(III) Turbine (Runner):</strong> Connected to the output/driven shaft. Its vanes receive the high-velocity fluid from the impeller. The impact and redirection of the fluid exerts a torque on the turbine, causing the output shaft to rotate.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li><strong>Isothermal Heat Addition (1-2):</strong> Saturated liquid water at pressure $P_1$ and high temperature $T_h$ absorbs heat ($Q_{in}$) from the high-temperature reservoir and vaporizes completely at constant temperature $T_h$ to become saturated steam (state 2). Entropy increases.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reversible Adiabatic (Isentropic) Expansion (2-3):</strong> The saturated steam expands adiabatically (e.g., in an ideal turbine) doing work. No heat is exchanged ($Q=0$), entropy remains constant ($S_3=S_2$). Temperature drops to the low temperature $T_l$. The steam becomes a wet mixture (state 3).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Isothermal Heat Rejection (3-4):</strong> The wet steam mixture has heat ($Q_{out}$) rejected from it to the low-temperature reservoir at constant temperature $T_l$ (e.g., in a condenser), partially condensing it to a wetter state (state 4). Entropy decreases.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reversible Adiabatic (Isentropic) Compression (4-1):</strong> The wet steam mixture (state 4) is compressed adiabatically (e.g., by an ideal pump) back to the initial pressure $P_1$. No heat is exchanged ($Q=0$), entropy remains constant ($S_1=S_4$). Temperature rises back to $T_h$, and the substance becomes saturated liquid (state 1), completing the cycle.</li>

                                <p>$\omega \approx 104.72$ rad/s.</p>
                                <p>Centrifugal Force ($F_c$) = $m \omega^2 r$.</p>

                                <p>Explanation: Magnetic fringing refers to the **bulging or spreading out** of magnetic flux lines as they cross an air gap in a magnetic circuit. Air has a much higher reluctance (lower permeability) than the ferromagnetic core material. Because flux lines tend to repel each other and prefer the path of least reluctance, they spread out into the area surrounding the gap instead of crossing straight across. This spreading means the effective cross-sectional area of the flux path in the gap is larger than the physical area of the core face, and the flux density within the gap is reduced compared to what it would be without fringing. Fringing effects are more pronounced for wider air gaps.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Operation of Permanent Magnet Moving Coil (PMMC) Instrument:</strong></p>
                                <p>Principle: Based on the motor effect - a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force.</p>
                                <p>Operation:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>A lightweight rectangular coil, wound on an aluminium former, is pivoted to rotate freely within the strong, radial magnetic field produced by a permanent magnet and soft iron pole pieces/core.</li>
                                    <li>The current to be measured (or a current proportional to the voltage) is passed through the coil via two spiral hairsprings.</li>
                                    <li>The current flowing through the coil sides interacts with the magnetic field, producing forces ($F=BIlN$) according to Fleming's Left-Hand Rule. These forces create a deflecting torque ($T_d$) that rotates the coil.</li>
                                    <li>Since the field is radial and uniform, the deflecting torque is directly proportional to the current ($T_d \propto I$).</li>
                                    <li>The hairsprings provide a controlling torque ($T_c$) that opposes the deflection and is proportional to the angle of rotation ($T_c \propto \theta$).</li>
                                    <li>The coil rotates until the deflecting torque equals the controlling torque ($T_d = T_c$), so $I \propto \theta$. The pointer attached to the coil thus moves over a uniformly calibrated (linear) scale.</li>
                                    <li>The aluminium former provides eddy current damping, making the pointer settle quickly. PMMC instruments respond only to DC.</li>
                                </ol>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Multi-Range Ammeter Conversion:</strong></p>
                                <p>A PMMC instrument (galvanometer) with FSD current $I_m$ and internal resistance $R_m$ can be converted into an ammeter by connecting a low-resistance **shunt resistor** ($R_{sh}$) in parallel with the meter movement. To create multiple ranges, several shunts can be selected using a switch.</p>

Connections:
- Range 1: Switch connects to Rsh1. Total Shunt = Rsh1. Measures highest current.
- Range 2: Switch connects between Rsh1 & Rsh2. Total Shunt = Rsh1+Rsh2. Measures medium current.
- Range 3: Switch connects between Rsh2 & Rsh3. Total Shunt = Rsh1+Rsh2+Rsh3. Measures lowest current.

                                    <li>A set of shunt resistors ($R_{sh1}, R_{sh2}, R_{sh3}$, etc.) are connected in series to form a shunt chain across the meter movement ($R_m$).</li>
                                    <li>A multi-position switch selects the point where the total input current (I) enters the shunt chain.</li>
                                    <li>When the switch is at a particular range setting, the total current I divides between the meter movement (carrying $I_m$) and the effective shunt path.</li>
                                    <li>For each range, the value of the effective shunt resistance ($R_{sh\_eff}$) is calculated such that when the total input current I corresponds to the desired full-scale range, the current through the meter movement is exactly $I_m$.</li>
                                    <li>The voltage across the meter ($V_m = I_m R_m$) must equal the voltage across the effective shunt ($V_{sh} = I_{sh} R_{sh\_eff}$), where $I_{sh} = I - I_m$.</li>
                                    <li>By selecting different tap points with the switch, different total currents (ranges) correspond to the same meter FSD current ($I_m$), allowing multiple ranges from a single meter movement and shunt chain. The Ayrton shunt provides make-before-break switching, protecting the meter.</li>

                                <p><strong>(a) Electrical Material Terms:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Resistivity ($\rho$):</strong> An intrinsic property of a material that measures how strongly it resists the flow of electric current. It is defined as the resistance (R) of a conductor of unit length (L) and unit cross-sectional area (A). $R = \rho L / A \implies \rho = RA/L$. Unit: Ohm-meter ($\Omega \cdot m$).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Temperature Coefficient of Resistance ($\alpha$):</strong> A measure of the fractional change in resistance of a material per degree Celsius (or Kelvin) change in temperature, relative to its resistance at a specified reference temperature. $\alpha = \frac{R_T - R_{ref}}{R_{ref}(T - T_{ref})}$. Unit: per degree Celsius (/$^{\circ}$C) or per Kelvin (/K).</p>

                                <p>Procedure:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The Low Voltage (LV) winding is short-circuited using a thick conductor or ammeter.</li>
                                    <li>A low, variable AC voltage (typically 5-10% of rated voltage) at rated frequency is applied to the High Voltage (HV) winding.</li>
                                    <li>Instruments are connected to the HV side: An Ammeter (A) in series, a Voltmeter (V) in parallel, and a Wattmeter (W) to measure input voltage ($V_{sc}$), current ($I_{sc}$), and power ($W_{sc}$ or $P_{sc}$).</li>
                                    <li>The applied voltage ($V_{sc}$) is gradually increased until the ammeter ($I_{sc}$) reads the rated full-load current for the HV winding.</li>
                                    <li>Readings of $V_{sc}$, $I_{sc}$, and $P_{sc}$ are taken at this rated current.</li>
                                </ol>
                                Explanation: Since the applied voltage is very low, the magnetic flux in the core is small, and the core losses (hysteresis and eddy current) are negligible ($P_i \approx 0$). Therefore, the wattmeter reading ($P_{sc}$) represents almost entirely the full-load copper losses ($P_{cu}$) in both windings (referred to the HV side).
                                Calculations:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Full Load Copper Loss $P_{cu} \approx P_{sc}$.</li>
                                    <li>Equivalent Impedance referred to HV side ($Z_{eq,HV}$) = $V_{sc} / I_{sc}$.</li>
                                    <li>Equivalent Resistance referred to HV side ($R_{eq,HV}$) = $P_{sc} / I_{sc}^2$.</li>
                                    <li>Equivalent Reactance referred to HV side ($X_{eq,HV}$) = $\sqrt{Z_{eq,HV}^2 - R_{eq,HV}^2}$.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Series Capacitor Circuit Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: $C_1 = 10 \mu F$, $C_2 = 100 \mu F$. Connected in series.</p>
                                <p>Supply voltage ($V_S$) = 110 V DC.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Note: For DC supply, capacitors act as open circuits once charged. Charge calculation assumes charging process.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Total Circuit Capacitance ($C_{eq}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{100}$ (working in $\mu F$).</p>
                                <p>$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{10 + 1}{100} = \frac{11}{100}$.</p>
                                <p>$C_{eq} = \frac{100}{11} \mu F \approx 9.09 \mu F$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Charge in the Circuit (Q):</strong></p>
                                <p>The total charge stored in the series combination after charging is complete.</p>
                                <p>$Q = C_{eq} \times V_S = (\frac{100}{11} \times 10^{-6} \text{ F}) \times 110 \text{ V}$.</p>
                                <p>$Q = \frac{100 \times 110}{11} \times 10^{-6} = 100 \times 10 \times 10^{-6} = 1000 \times 10^{-6}$ C = 1000 $\mu$C (or 1 mC).</p>
                                <p>The charge on each capacitor in series is the same: $Q_1 = Q_2 = Q = 1000 \mu C$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Energy stored by the $100 \mu \mathrm{F}$ capacitor ($E_2$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Energy $E = Q^2 / (2C)$.</p>
                                <p>$E_2 = Q_2^2 / (2 C_2) = (1000 \times 10^{-6} C)^2 / (2 \times 100 \times 10^{-6} F)$.</p>
                                <p>$E_2 = (10^{-3})^2 / (200 \times 10^{-6}) = 10^{-6} / (2 \times 10^{-4}) = 0.5 \times 10^{-2}$ J = 0.005 J (or 5 mJ).</p>
                                <p>(Alternatively, find $V_2 = Q_2/C_2 = (1000 \mu C) / (100 \mu F) = 10 V$. Then $E_2 = \frac{1}{2} C_2 V_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} (100 \times 10^{-6})(10)^2 = 50 \times 10^{-6} \times 100 = 5000 \times 10^{-6} = 0.005 J$).</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Electromotive Force (EMF):</strong></p>
                                <p>Definition: Electromotive force (EMF) is the energy provided by a source (like a battery or generator) per unit charge passing through it. It represents the total voltage or potential difference the source can produce when no current is flowing (open circuit voltage). It is the driving force that tends to cause current flow in a circuit.</p>

                                <p>First find the total impedance (Z) of the series circuit.</p>
                                <p>$Z = \sqrt{R^2 + X_C^2}$ (Magnitude).</p>
                                <p>$Z = \sqrt{40^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 900} = \sqrt{2500} = 50 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Supply Voltage (V) = Current (I) $\times$ Impedance (Z).</p>
                                <p>$V = 4.6 A \times 50 \Omega = 230 V$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Circuit Power Factor (PF):</strong></p>
                                <p>$PF = \cos \phi = R / Z$.</p>
                                <p>$PF = 40 \Omega / 50 \Omega = 0.8$.</p>

                                <p class="key-point">Cannot solve without the supply voltage (V). Assuming a value V allows demonstrating the method.</p>

                                <p>First find the equivalent resistance of the parallel part ($R_P$):</p>
                                <p>$R_P = (R_1 \times R_2) / (R_1 + R_2) = (6 \times 12) / (6 + 12) = 72 / 18 = 4 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Total resistance $R_{total} = R_X + R_P = R_X + 4$.</p>
                                <p>So, $R_X = R_{total} - 4$. (Requires $R_{total}$, which requires V).</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Power dissipated by the $6 \Omega$ resistor ($P_6$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Need the current through the $6 \Omega$ resistor ($I_6$). Use the current divider rule:</p>
                                <p>$I_6 = I_{total} \times \frac{R_{other}}{R_{other} + R_6} = 4.5 A \times \frac{12}{12 + 6} = 4.5 \times \frac{12}{18} = 4.5 \times \frac{2}{3} = 3 A$.</p>
                                <p>Power $P_6 = I_6^2 \times R_1 = (3 A)^2 \times 6 \Omega = 9 \times 6 = 54 W$.</p>
                                <p>(Note: Power calculation was possible without knowing V).</p>
