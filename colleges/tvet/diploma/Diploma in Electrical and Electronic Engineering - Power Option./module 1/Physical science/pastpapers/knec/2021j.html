                                <p><strong>(ii) Production of X-rays in an X-ray Tube:</strong></p>
                                <p>X-rays are produced in an evacuated glass tube containing a cathode and an anode.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Electron Emission:</strong> The cathode contains a filament (usually tungsten) which is heated by a low-voltage supply. This heating causes thermionic emission, releasing electrons.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Electron Acceleration:</strong> A very high potential difference (accelerating voltage, typically tens or hundreds of kilovolts) is applied between the cathode (-) and the anode (+).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Collision with Target:</strong> The high voltage accelerates the emitted electrons to very high speeds across the vacuum towards the anode, which contains a metal target (usually tungsten or molybdenum, embedded in a copper block for cooling).</li>
                                    <li><strong>X-ray Generation:</strong> When these high-energy electrons strike the metal target, they rapidly decelerate and interact with the target atoms. Most (~99%) of their kinetic energy is converted into heat, but a small fraction (~1%) is converted into X-ray photons through:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Bremsstrahlung (Braking Radiation):</strong> Electrons slowing down near the target nuclei emit a continuous spectrum of X-rays.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Characteristic Radiation:</strong> Incident electrons knock out inner-shell electrons of target atoms; when outer-shell electrons drop down to fill the vacancies, X-rays with specific energies (characteristic of the target material) are emitted.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Cooling:</strong> Due to the immense heat generated, the anode target requires efficient cooling (e.g., using circulating oil or water, or a rotating anode).</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(b) SHM Maximum Acceleration:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Amplitude (A) = 0.02 m, Frequency (f) = 20 Hz.</p>
                                <p>Angular frequency ($\omega$) = $2\pi f = 2\pi \times 20 = 40\pi$ rad/s.</p>
                                <p>Acceleration in SHM is given by $a = -\omega^2 x$, where x is displacement.</p>
                                <p>Maximum acceleration ($a_{max}$) occurs at the maximum displacement, i.e., when $x = \pm A$.</p>
                                <p>Magnitude of maximum acceleration $|a_{max}| = \omega^2 A$.</p>
                                <p>$a_{max} = (40\pi)^2 \times 0.02 = (1600 \pi^2) \times 0.02$.</p>
                                <p>$a_{max} = 32 \pi^2 \text{ m/s}^2$.</p>
                                <p>$a_{max} \approx 32 \times (9.8696) \approx 315.8 \text{ m/s}^2$.</p>
                                <p>Maximum acceleration $\approx 316 \text{ m/s}^2$.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers factors affecting the speed of sound, analysis of a wave equation, definitions in thermal physics, and concepts of absolute temperature, black body radiation, and reaction energetics.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Effect on Speed of Sound:</strong></p>
                                <p>The speed of sound ($v$) in a medium generally depends on its elasticity (Bulk Modulus, B, or Young's Modulus, E) and its density ($\rho$). For fluids: $v = \sqrt{B/\rho}$. For solids: $v = \sqrt{E/\rho}$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Density of the Medium ($\rho$):</strong> Generally, for media with similar elastic properties, the speed of sound is **inversely proportional to the square root of the density**. Higher density means slower sound speed ($v \propto 1/\sqrt{\rho}$), because denser materials have more inertia, making it harder for particles to oscillate and pass on the disturbance quickly.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Temperature of the Medium (T):</strong> For gases, the speed of sound is directly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature ($v \propto \sqrt{T}$). As temperature increases, gas molecules move faster, leading to quicker transmission of the sound disturbance. In solids and liquids, the effect is more complex as both elasticity and density can change with temperature, but generally, speed increases slightly with temperature in liquids and can increase or decrease in solids depending on the material.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Wave Equation Analysis:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: $y = 0.08 \sin(36t - 9x)$ metres.</p>
                                <p>Compare with standard form $y = A \sin(\omega t - kx)$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Amplitude (A):</strong> $A = 0.08$ m.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Wavelength ($\lambda$):</strong> Wave number $k = 9$. Since $k = 2\pi/\lambda$, then $\lambda = 2\pi/k = 2\pi/9$ metres ($\approx 0.698$ m).</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Frequency (f):</strong> Angular frequency $\omega = 36$. Since $\omega = 2\pi f$, then $f = \omega/(2\pi) = 36/(2\pi) = 18/\pi$ Hz ($\approx 5.73$ Hz).</p>
                                <p><strong>(iv) Speed of the wave (v):</strong> $v = f\lambda = (18/\pi) \times (2\pi/9) = (18 \times 2\pi) / (9\pi) = 36\pi / 9\pi = 4$ m/s.</p>
                                <p>(Alternatively, $v = \omega/k = 36 / 9 = 4$ m/s).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Thermal Physics Definitions and Concepts:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Heat Capacity (C):</strong> The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of an entire object or system by one degree Celsius (or Kelvin). Unit: J/K or J/°C.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Latent Heat (L):</strong> The heat energy absorbed or released during a phase change (like melting, freezing, boiling, condensation) of a substance at a constant temperature and pressure. Specific Latent Heat (per unit mass) unit: J/kg.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Explanations:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Absolute Scale (Kelvin Scale):</strong> A thermodynamic temperature scale where zero Kelvin (0 K) represents absolute zero, the theoretical temperature at which particles have minimum possible thermal energy (minimal vibration). Temperature intervals on the Kelvin scale are the same size as on the Celsius scale (1 K change = 1 °C change). $K = °C + 273.15$. It is called absolute because it's independent of the properties of any specific substance.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Black Body Radiation:</strong> A black body is an idealized object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. When in thermal equilibrium, it also emits radiation (called black body radiation) with a characteristic continuous spectrum and intensity that depends only on its absolute temperature. The spectrum follows Planck's law, and the total power radiated follows the Stefan-Boltzmann law ($P \propto T^4$). Real objects approximate black bodies to varying degrees.</li>

                                    <li>To react, the reactants must overcome an energy barrier called the Activation Energy ($E_a$), reaching a high-energy transition state (peak of the curve).</li>
                                    <li>In an **exothermic** reaction, the products are at a *lower* energy level ($H_{products}$) than the reactants.</li>
                                    <li>The difference in energy between products and reactants ($H_{products} - H_{reactants}$) is the enthalpy change of the reaction ($\Delta H$).</li>
                                    <li>For an exothermic reaction, $H_{products} < H_{reactants}$, so $\Delta H$ is **negative**, indicating that energy is released to the surroundings during the reaction.</li>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers power, work, force, static equilibrium of forces, Pitot tubes, and material testing.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Power, Work, Force:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Power Definition:</strong> Power is the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred or converted. Unit: Watt (W).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Height (h) = 160 m, Time (t) = 20 s, Energy expended (Work done, W) = 80 kJ = 80000 J.</p>
                                <p><strong>(I) Power (P):</strong></p>
                                <p>$P = \text{Work Done} / \text{Time} = 80000 \text{ J} / 20 \text{ s} = 4000 \text{ W}$ (or 4 kW).</p>
                                <p><strong>(II) Force (F):</strong></p>
                                <p>Assuming the energy expended is primarily work done against gravity by the lifting force F.</p>
                                <p>Work Done = Force $\times$ Distance (Height).</p>
                                <p>$W = F \times h$.</p>
                                <p>$80000 \text{ J} = F \times 160 \text{ m}$.</p>
                                <p>$F = 80000 / 160 = 500$ N.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Equilibrium and Forces:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Equilibrium of Coplanar Forces:</strong> A body is in static equilibrium under the action of a system of coplanar forces if it has no tendency to accelerate, either linearly or rotationally. This requires two conditions to be met:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>The vector sum of all forces acting on the body must be zero ($\sum \vec{F} = 0$, ensuring no linear acceleration).</li>
                                        <li>The algebraic sum of the moments of all forces about any point in the plane must be zero ($\sum M = 0$, ensuring no angular acceleration).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Determining Force F (Fig 1):</strong></p>
                                <p>Forces are in equilibrium, so $\sum F_x = 0$ and $\sum F_y = 0$.</p>
                                <p>Forces: $F_1=10$N @ 0°, $F_2=15$N @ 60°, $F_3=20$N @ 135°, $F_4=F$ @ 270° (downwards).</p>
                                <p>Resolve forces:</p>
                                <p>$F_{1x} = 10 \cos(0) = 10.0$</p>
                                <p>$F_{1y} = 10 \sin(0) = 0.0$</p>
                                <p>$F_{2x} = 15 \cos(60) = 15(0.5) = 7.5$</p>
                                <p>$F_{2y} = 15 \sin(60) = 15(\sqrt{3}/2) \approx 12.99$</p>
                                <p>$F_{3x} = 20 \cos(135) = 20(-\sqrt{2}/2) \approx -14.14$</p>
                                <p>$F_{3y} = 20 \sin(135) = 20(\sqrt{2}/2) \approx 14.14$</p>
                                <p>$F_{4x} = F \cos(270) = 0.0$</p>
                                <p>$F_{4y} = F \sin(270) = F(-1) = -F$</p>
                                <p>Apply equilibrium conditions:</p>
                                <p>$\sum F_x = 10.0 + 7.5 - 14.14 + 0 = 0$</p>
                                <p>$3.36 = 0$. This indicates an error in the problem statement or diagram, as the horizontal forces do not balance without F having a horizontal component. Assuming the forces *as drawn* are meant to be in equilibrium despite the diagram potentially being slightly inaccurate.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Let's proceed assuming equilibrium is intended. The calculation $3.36=0$ shows the system *cannot* be in equilibrium as drawn with F purely vertical. However, if we must find F for equilibrium based on vertical balance only:</p>
                                <p>$\sum F_y = 0.0 + 12.99 + 14.14 - F = 0$</p>
                                <p>$27.13 - F = 0 \implies F = 27.13$ N.</p>
                                <p>If F is required to balance the system, it needs both x and y components. Let the balancing force be $\vec{F}_{balance}$. $R_x = 3.36$, $R_y = 27.13$. $\vec{F}_{balance}$ must be equal and opposite to the resultant of the first three forces. $\vec{F}_{balance} = - (3.36 \hat{i} + 27.13 \hat{j})$. This does not match the force F shown at 270°. There is likely an error in the question setup.</p>
                                <p>Assuming the question intended F to be the vertical force required to balance the *vertical* components of the other forces: $F = 12.99 + 14.14 = 27.13$ N.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers material properties (plasticity, elasticity), rotational kinematics, and the operation of centrifugal governors.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Material Properties:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Plasticity:</strong> Plasticity is the ability of a solid material to undergo permanent deformation (a non-reversible change in shape) in response to applied forces without fracturing. Once the applied stress exceeds the material's elastic limit (or yield strength), plastic deformation occurs, and the material does not return to its original shape when the load is removed.</p>

 Origin O +----------------------------> Strain ($\epsilon$)

Labels:
- Origin (O)
- Proportional Limit (PL): Stress proportional to strain (end of linear region).
- Elastic Limit (EL): Max stress before permanent deformation occurs (often close to PL).
- Yield Point (YP): Stress at which significant plastic deformation begins with little increase in stress (may show upper/lower points).
- Elastic Region: Region from O up to EL where deformation is reversible.
                                    </pre>

                                <p>The curve shows stress ($\sigma$) on the y-axis versus strain ($\epsilon$) on the x-axis. For an elastic material obeying Hooke's Law up to the proportional limit, the initial part of the curve is a straight line through the origin ($\sigma = E\epsilon$, where E is Young's Modulus). The elastic limit marks the point beyond which permanent deformation occurs. The yield point marks the onset of significant plastic flow.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Circular Motion and Rotational Kinematics:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Forces on Body in Uniform Circular Motion:</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Centripetal Force:</strong> A net inward force acting towards the center of the circular path, responsible for changing the direction of the velocity vector and causing the circular motion ($F_c = mv^2/r$).</li>
                                    <li>**(Other Forces Balancing in Tangential/Vertical Direction):** While centripetal force is the net force radially, other forces might be acting. For example, if it's a car on a flat track, friction provides the centripetal force, while weight and normal force balance vertically. If it's a planet orbiting the sun, gravity provides the centripetal force. The question is slightly ambiguous, but the *required net force* is the centripetal force. If considering individual forces, it depends on the situation (e.g., tension, gravity, normal force, friction). Stating **Centripetal Force** and **Tangential Force (which is zero for constant speed)** is a possible interpretation. Or just **Centripetal Force** as the key resultant force.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Likely intended answers: 1. Centripetal force. 2. The force(s) providing the centripetal force (e.g., Tension, Friction, Gravity).</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Motor Shaft Acceleration:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Initial angular speed ($\omega_0$) = 0 rad/s.</p>
                                <p>Final angular speed (N) = 280 rev/min.</p>
                                <p>Time (t) = 4 seconds.</p>
                                <p><strong>(I) Final Angular Velocity ($\omega_f$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Convert N from rpm to rad/s.</p>
                                <p>$\omega_f = N \times \frac{2\pi}{60} = 280 \times \frac{2\pi}{60} = \frac{560\pi}{60} = \frac{28\pi}{3}$ rad/s.</p>
                                <p>$\omega_f \approx 29.32$ rad/s.</p>

                                <p><strong>(II) Angular Acceleration ($\alpha$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Assuming uniform acceleration: $\omega_f = \omega_0 + \alpha t$.</p>
                                <p>$\frac{28\pi}{3} = 0 + \alpha (4)$.</p>
                                <p>$\alpha = \frac{28\pi}{3 \times 4} = \frac{7\pi}{3}$ rad/s².</p>
                                <p>$\alpha \approx 7.33$ rad/s².</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Centrifugal Governor (Fig 2):</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Type of Governor:</strong> The diagram shows rotating flyballs on pivoted arms connected to a central sleeve. Without details like a central dead weight or springs, it most closely resembles a **Watt Governor** (the simplest type) or could be a generic representation of a centrifugal governor.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Parts Labelled A and B:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A: Flyball (or Governor Ball / Rotating Mass)</li>
                                    <li>B: Sleeve</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Control Action When Load Reduces:</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>If the load on the engine reduces, the engine momentarily tends to speed up.</li>
                                    <li>This increases the rotational speed ($\omega$) of the governor spindle and the flyballs (A).</li>
                                    <li>The increased speed causes a larger outward centrifugal force ($F_c = m\omega^2 r$) on the flyballs.</li>
                                    <li>This larger force overcomes the inward controlling force (gravity/spring), causing the flyballs (A) to move outwards and upwards to a larger radius of rotation.</li>
                                    <li>The upward movement of the arms lifts the sleeve (B) on the governor spindle.</li>
                                    <li>The upward movement of the sleeve is transmitted through linkages to the engine's throttle valve.</li>
                                    <li>The throttle valve moves towards the closed position, reducing the supply of fuel (or steam) to the engine.</li>
                                    <li>The reduced fuel supply decreases the engine's power output, causing its speed to decrease back towards the desired equilibrium speed.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(i) Current flowing through the bulb (I):</strong></p>
                                <p>Using $P = VI$.</p>
                                <p>$18 W = 12 V \times I$.</p>
                                <p>$I = 18 / 12 = 1.5 A$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Resistance of the bulb element (R):</strong></p>
                                <p>Using Ohm's Law $V = IR$ or $P = V^2/R$ or $P = I^2R$.</p>
                                <p>$R = V / I = 12 V / 1.5 A = 8 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>(Check: $P = I^2R = (1.5)^2 \times 8 = 2.25 \times 8 = 18 W$. $P = V^2/R = 12^2 / 8 = 144 / 8 = 18 W$. Consistent).</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Supply Duration (Time, t):</strong></p>
                                <p>Battery Capacity = 700 Ah (Ampere-hours). This means the battery can supply a current of 700 A for 1 hour, or 1 A for 700 hours, or 1.5 A for t hours, etc., until discharged.</p>
                                <p>Capacity (Ah) = Current (A) $\times$ Time (h).</p>
                                <p>$700 \text{ Ah} = 1.5 \text{ A} \times t \text{ (hours)}$.</p>
                                <p>$t = 700 / 1.5 \approx 466.67$ hours.</p>
                                <p>The battery can supply the bulb for approximately 466.7 hours.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Lead-Acid Cell and Defects:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Naming Parts (Fig 3):</strong></p>
                                <p>(Based on standard Lead-Acid cell construction):</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A: Positive Plate (typically Lead Dioxide, $PbO_2$, on a lead grid)</li>
                                    <li>B: Negative Plate (typically Spongy Lead, $Pb$, on a lead grid)</li>
                                    <li>C: Separator (porous insulating material)</li>
                                    <li>D: Electrolyte (dilute Sulphuric Acid, $H_2SO_4$)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Cell Defects Explanation:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Local Action:</strong> A defect occurring primarily in primary cells (like simple Zinc-Carbon cells) where impurities (like iron or carbon) within the zinc electrode form tiny local electrochemical cells with the zinc itself in the presence of the electrolyte. This causes the zinc electrode to be consumed (corroded) even when the cell is not supplying external current, reducing the cell's shelf life and capacity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Polarization:</strong> A defect occurring mainly in primary cells where reaction products accumulate at one or both electrodes during discharge, hindering the main cell reaction and increasing internal resistance. A common example is the formation of hydrogen gas bubbles at the positive (carbon) electrode in a simple cell, which insulates the electrode and reduces the cell's voltage. Depolarizers (like Manganese Dioxide in Leclanché cells) are added to react with these products and reduce polarization.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(d) Parallel Cell Connection:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: 4 identical cells in parallel.</p>
                                <p>Each cell: EMF ($E_{cell}$) = 2.2 V, Internal resistance ($r_{cell}$) = 0.9 $\Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Load current ($I_L$) = 0.6 A.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Total Internal Resistance ($r_{total}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>For N identical cells in parallel, the total internal resistance is $r_{total} = r_{cell} / N$.</p>
                                <p>$r_{total} = 0.9 \Omega / 4 = 0.225 \Omega$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Voltage across the cells terminals ($V_T$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The total EMF of identical cells in parallel ($E_{total}$) is the same as the EMF of a single cell.</p>
                                <p>$E_{total} = E_{cell} = 2.2 V$.</p>
                                <p>The terminal voltage $V_T$ when supplying current $I_L$ is:</p>
                                <p>$V_T = E_{total} - I_L \times r_{total}$.</p>
                                <p>$V_T = 2.2 V - (0.6 A \times 0.225 \Omega)$.</p>
                                <p>$V_T = 2.2 - 0.135 = 2.065 V$.</p>
                                <p>The voltage across the battery terminals is 2.065 V.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Temperature Coefficient of Resistance:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Explanation:</strong> The temperature coefficient of resistance ($\alpha$) quantifies how much the resistance of a material changes for each degree Celsius (or Kelvin) change in temperature, relative to its resistance at a specific reference temperature (e.g., $0^{\circ}$C or $20^{\circ}$C). A positive $\alpha$ (most metals) means resistance increases with temperature, while a negative $\alpha$ (semiconductors) means resistance decreases.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Resistance Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Resistance at $T_1 = 50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($R_{50}$) = 30 $\Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Temperature coefficient at $T_0 = 0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($\alpha_0$) = $0.0038 /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</p>
                                <p>Find resistance at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($R_0$).</p>
                                <p>Use the formula $R_T = R_0 (1 + \alpha_0 T)$.</p>
                                <p>$R_{50} = R_0 (1 + \alpha_0 \times 50)$.</p>
                                <p>$30 = R_0 (1 + 0.0038 \times 50)$.</p>
                                <p>$30 = R_0 (1 + 0.19)$.</p>
                                <p>$30 = R_0 (1.19)$.</p>
                                <p>$R_0 = 30 / 1.19 \approx 25.21 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>The resistance at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is approximately 25.21 $\Omega$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Superposition Theorem (DC Circuits):</strong></p>
                                <p>In any linear DC network containing multiple independent voltage or current sources, the current flowing through (or the voltage across) any element is the algebraic sum of the currents (or voltages) produced by each independent source acting alone, with all other independent voltage sources replaced by short circuits and all other independent current sources replaced by open circuits.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Circuit Analysis using Superposition (Fig 4):</strong></p>
                                <p>Circuit: Left loop (12V, $R_1=4\Omega$, $R_c=8\Omega$), Right loop (6V, $R_2=6\Omega$, $R_c=8\Omega$). $R_c$ is common.</p>
                                <p>Find currents in branches: $I_{R1}$ (through 4$\Omega$), $I_{R2}$ (through 6$\Omega$), $I_{Rc}$ (through 8$\Omega$).</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Digital vs. Analog Instruments & Wattmeter Reading:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Advantages of Digital over Analog Instruments:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Higher Accuracy:</strong> Generally offer better accuracy and resolution.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Easier Readability:</strong> Digital display eliminates parallax error and reduces reading ambiguity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Higher Input Impedance:</strong> Digital voltmeters typically have very high input impedance, reducing loading effects on the circuit being measured.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> Less susceptible to damage from mechanical shock or vibration.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Output Capabilities:</strong> Can often provide digital output for recording or processing by computers.</li>
                                     <li>(State any three)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Wattmeter Reading Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Current coil resistance ($R_{cc}$) = $0.02 \Omega$, Load resistance ($R_L$) = $2 \Omega$, Current (I) = 12 A.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">The wattmeter reading depends on the voltage across its potential coil (PC) and the current through its current coil (CC), and the power factor. The connection of the PC is crucial (either across load only, or across load + CC). Assuming PC is connected across the $2\Omega$ load and the load is purely resistive (PF=1).</p>
                                <p>Voltage across load ($V_L$) = $I \times R_L = 12 A \times 2 \Omega = 24 V$.</p>
                                <p>Power measured by wattmeter (assuming PC across load) = Power in Load.</p>
                                <p>$P = V_L \times I \times PF = 24 V \times 12 A \times 1 = 288 W$.</p>
                                <p>However, the wattmeter itself consumes some power. Power consumed by CC = $I^2 R_{cc} = (12)^2 \times 0.02 = 144 \times 0.02 = 2.88 W$. If the PC is connected *before* the CC (across supply side delivering to CC+Load), the wattmeter reads total power $P_L + P_{cc}$. If connected *after* the CC (across load only), it reads $P_L$. Assuming connection across load only, the reading is **288 W**. (The question is slightly ambiguous about what the 'reading' represents - power in load or total power measured by the meter configuration).</p>

                                         <li><strong>Leakage Flux ($\Phi_l$):</strong> A portion of the flux produced by the primary winding that does not link the secondary winding (or follow the main core path). It completes its path through the surrounding air, typically looping around the winding itself.</li>
                                         <li><strong>Fringing Flux ($\Phi_f$):</strong> At an air gap, the magnetic flux lines tend to bulge outwards into the surrounding air because air has much higher reluctance than the core material.

                                <p>Average rate of change of current = $\Delta I / \Delta t = (I_2 - I_1) / \Delta t = (0 - 1.5) / 0.2 = -1.5 / 0.2 = -7.5$ A/s.</p>

                                <p>Alternatively, use Faraday's Law: $E_{avg} = -N (\Delta\Phi / \Delta t)$.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Stator:</strong> The stationary part containing the armature winding where the output voltage is induced.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Rotor:</strong> The rotating part containing the field winding (or permanent magnets) which produces the magnetic field.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Field Winding:</strong> Coils on the rotor supplied with DC current (excitation) to create the magnetic poles.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Armature Winding:</strong> Coils in the stator slots where the EMF is induced by the rotating magnetic field cutting across them.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Slip Rings:</strong> Conductive rings mounted on the rotor shaft used to supply DC current to the rotating field winding (in most large alternators).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Brushes:</strong> Stationary contacts (usually carbon) that press against the slip rings to conduct DC current to the field winding.</li>
                                    <li>Shaft, Bearings, Frame/Housing, Cooling System.</li>
                                     <li>(List any two distinct parts)</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) AC Waveform Analysis (Fig 6):</strong></p>
                                <p>From the graph:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Peak Voltage ($V_m$) = 8 V.</li>
                                    <li>Time for one complete cycle (Period, T) = 20 ms.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>(i) Periodic Time (T):</strong> $T = 20 \text{ ms} = 20 \times 10^{-3}$ s = 0.02 s.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Frequency (f):</strong> $f = 1 / T = 1 / 0.02 \text{ s} = 50$ Hz.</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Average Value of Voltage ($V_{avg}$):</strong> (Over half cycle for sine wave)</p>
                                <p>$V_{avg} = \frac{2}{\pi} V_m = \frac{2}{\pi} \times 8 \approx 0.637 \times 8 \approx 5.096$ V.</p>
                                <p><strong>(iv) R.M.S. Value of Voltage ($V_{rms}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>$V_{rms} = V_m / \sqrt{2} = 8 / \sqrt{2} \approx 5.657$ V.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Transformer Losses and Efficiency:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Two Transformer Losses:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Copper Losses ($I^2R$ losses):</strong> Heat dissipated in the primary and secondary winding resistances due to current flow.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Iron Losses (Core Losses):</strong> Losses in the core due to alternating magnetic flux, comprising:
                                        <ul><li>Hysteresis Loss</li><li>Eddy Current Loss</li></ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Efficiency Derivation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Efficiency ($\eta$) of any device is defined as the ratio of useful power output ($P_{out}$) to the total power input ($P_{in}$).</p>
                                <p>$\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}$.</p>
                                <p>The total power input must supply both the useful output power and the power lost within the transformer ($P_{losses}$).</p>
                                <p>$P_{in} = P_{out} + P_{losses}$.</p>
                                <p>Substitute this into the efficiency formula:</p>
                                <p>$\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{out} + P_{losses}}$.</p>
                                <p>To express it in the desired form, divide both numerator and denominator by $P_{in}$:</p>
                                <p>$\eta = \frac{P_{out}/P_{in}}{P_{in}/P_{in}} = P_{out}/P_{in}$. (Doesn't help).</p>
                                <p>Let's rearrange the relationship $P_{in} = P_{out} + P_{losses}$ to $P_{out} = P_{in} - P_{losses}$.</p>
                                <p>Substitute this into the efficiency formula:</p>
                                <p>$\eta = \frac{P_{in} - P_{losses}}{P_{in}} = \frac{P_{in}}{P_{in}} - \frac{P_{losses}}{P_{in}} = 1 - \frac{P_{losses}}{P_{in}}$.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, Efficiency $= 1 - \frac{\text{losses}}{\text{input power}}$. (Shown)</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Capacitor Circuit Analysis (Fig 7):</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: $V_S = 100V$, $C_1 = 4\mu F$, $C_2 = 6\mu F$, $C_3 = 6\mu F$.</p>
                                <p>Configuration: $C_1$ in series with the parallel combination of $C_2$ and $C_3$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Equivalent Circuit Capacitance ($C_{eq}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Step 1: Find equivalent capacitance of parallel $C_2$ and $C_3$ ($C_{23}$).</p>
                                <p>$C_{23} = C_2 + C_3 = 6 \mu F + 6 \mu F = 12 \mu F$.</p>
                                <p>Step 2: Find equivalent capacitance of $C_1$ in series with $C_{23}$.</p>
                                <p>$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_{23}} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{12}$.</p>
                                <p>$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{3 + 1}{12} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}$.</p>
                                <p>$C_{eq} = 3 \mu F$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Voltage across each $6 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ capacitor ($V_2$ and $V_3$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The voltage across the parallel combination ($V_{23}$) is the same as the voltage across $C_2$ and $C_3$ ($V_2 = V_3 = V_{23}$).</p>
                                <p>First find the total charge ($Q_{total}$) drawn from the supply.</p>
                                <p>$Q_{total} = C_{eq} \times V_S = (3 \mu F) \times 100 V = 300 \mu C$.</p>
                                <p>In a series circuit, the charge on each series component is the same. So, the charge on $C_1$ is $Q_1 = 300 \mu C$, and the charge on the parallel combination $C_{23}$ is $Q_{23} = 300 \mu C$.</p>
                                <p>Now find the voltage across the parallel combination $C_{23}$:</p>
                                <p>$V_{23} = Q_{23} / C_{23} = (300 \mu C) / (12 \mu F) = 25 V$.</p>
                                <p>Since $C_2$ and $C_3$ are in parallel, the voltage across each is $V_{23}$.</p>
                                <p>$V_2 = V_3 = V_{23} = 25 V$.</p>
                                <p>The voltage across each $6 \mu F$ capacitor is 25 V.</p>
                                <p>(Check: Voltage across $C_1$, $V_1 = Q_1 / C_1 = 300 \mu C / 4 \mu F = 75 V$. $V_1 + V_{23} = 75 V + 25 V = 100 V = V_S$).</p>
