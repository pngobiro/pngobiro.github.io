                                <p><strong>(a) Background Radiation:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Definition:</strong> Background radiation refers to the ubiquitous ionizing radiation present in the environment from natural and artificial sources, to which living organisms are constantly exposed.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Sources:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Cosmic Rays:</strong> High-energy particles from outer space (sun and beyond).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Terrestrial Radiation:</strong> Radioactive isotopes in rocks, soil, building materials (e.g., Uranium, Thorium, Radon gas).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Internal Radiation:</strong> Naturally occurring radioactive isotopes within the body (e.g., Potassium-40, Carbon-14).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Artificial Sources:</strong> Medical procedures (X-rays, radiotherapy), nuclear fallout, nuclear power industry emissions, some consumer products (e.g., smoke detectors).</li>
                                     <li>(List any four)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Safety Measures with Radioactive Materials:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Minimize Time:</strong> Reduce the duration of exposure to the radioactive source.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Maximize Distance:</strong> Increase the distance from the source, as radiation intensity decreases with the square of the distance (Inverse Square Law).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Use Shielding:</strong> Place appropriate absorbing materials (e.g., lead for gamma, perspex for beta, paper for alpha) between the source and the person.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Containment:</strong> Use sealed sources and handle them in designated areas (e.g., fume hoods for volatile materials) to prevent ingestion, inhalation, or contamination.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Use radiation detection instruments (e.g., Geiger counter, dosimeter badges) to monitor exposure levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Proper Handling Tools:</strong> Use tongs or remote handling equipment instead of direct hand contact.</li>
                                     <li>(Outline any two)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Hydrocarbon Formula Determination:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: RMM = 84, Mass $CO_2 = 5.28$ g, Mass $H_2O = 2.16$ g.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 1: Find mass of C and H in the sample.</strong></p>
                                <p>Molar mass $CO_2 = 12 + 2(16) = 44$ g/mol.</p>
                                <p>Mass of C in $CO_2 = (12/44) \times 5.28 \text{ g} = 1.44$ g.</p>
                                <p>Molar mass $H_2O = 2(1) + 16 = 18$ g/mol.</p>
                                <p>Mass of H in $H_2O = (2/18) \times 2.16 \text{ g} = (1/9) \times 2.16 = 0.24$ g.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 2: Find moles of C and H.</strong></p>
                                <p>Moles C = Mass C / RAM C = $1.44 / 12 = 0.12$ mol.</p>
                                <p>Moles H = Mass H / RAM H = $0.24 / 1 = 0.24$ mol.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 3: Determine Empirical Formula (simplest whole number ratio).</strong></p>
                                <p>Ratio C : H = 0.12 : 0.24</p>
                                <p>Divide by the smallest number (0.12):</p>
                                <p>C: $0.12 / 0.12 = 1$</p>
                                <p>H: $0.24 / 0.12 = 2$</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Empirical Formula = $CH_2$.</strong></p>

                                <p><strong>Step 4: Determine Molecular Formula.</strong></p>
                                <p>Empirical Formula Mass (EFM) for $CH_2 = 12 + 2(1) = 14$.</p>
                                <p>Let the molecular formula be $(CH_2)_n$.</p>
                                <p>Molecular Mass = $n \times$ EFM.</p>
                                <p>$84 = n \times 14$.</p>
                                <p>$n = 84 / 14 = 6$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Molecular Formula = $(CH_2)_6 = C_6H_{12}$.</strong> (This could be hexene or cyclohexane).</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Resonance and LC Circuit:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Resonance:</strong> Resonance occurs in a system capable of oscillating when it is driven by an external periodic force at a frequency equal or very close to its own natural frequency of oscillation. At resonance, the system oscillates with a maximum (or very large) amplitude, resulting in efficient energy transfer from the driver to the system.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Energy Changes in LC Circuit (Fig 1):</strong></p>
                                <p>An ideal LC circuit (inductor L, capacitor C, negligible resistance) exhibits electrical oscillations where energy continuously transfers between the capacitor's electric field and the inductor's magnetic field.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Capacitor Fully Charged:</strong> Assume initially the capacitor is fully charged (max voltage $V_{max}$, max charge $Q_{max}$). All the energy is stored in the electric field of the capacitor ($E_E = \frac{1}{2}CV_{max}^2 = \frac{Q_{max}^2}{2C}$). Current (I) is zero. Magnetic field energy ($E_B$) is zero.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Capacitor Discharging:</strong> The capacitor begins to discharge through the inductor. Current starts to flow and increases. As charge leaves the capacitor, the electric field energy decreases. The increasing current builds up a magnetic field in the inductor, storing energy ($E_B = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Capacitor Fully Discharged:</strong> When the capacitor is fully discharged (Q=0, V=0), the electric field energy is zero. The current reaches its maximum value ($I_{max}$). All the energy is now stored in the magnetic field of the inductor ($E_B = \frac{1}{2}LI_{max}^2$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Capacitor Charging (Opposite Polarity):</strong> The magnetic field in the inductor starts to collapse as the current cannot change instantaneously. The collapsing field induces an EMF that keeps the current flowing (Lenz's law), charging the capacitor with the opposite polarity. Magnetic field energy decreases, and electric field energy increases.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Capacitor Fully Charged (Opposite Polarity):</strong> The current drops to zero when the capacitor is fully charged with opposite polarity (voltage $-V_{max}$, charge $-Q_{max}$). All energy is again stored in the capacitor's electric field ($E_E = \frac{1}{2}C(-V_{max})^2$). Magnetic energy is zero.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>The cycle then repeats in the reverse direction. Energy oscillates between being stored entirely in the capacitor's electric field and entirely in the inductor's magnetic field, with the total energy ($E_E + E_B$) remaining constant in an ideal (lossless) circuit.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Electrochemistry and Energetics:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Electrochemical Series Arrangement:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>(I) Metals (Reactivity Series - Ease of Oxidation): Zinc > Lead > Copper. (Based on standard electrode potentials: Zn ~ -0.76V, Pb ~ -0.13V, Cu ~ +0.34V). Order: **Zinc, Lead, Copper**.</li>
                                    <li>(II) Anions (Ease of Discharge at Anode): Hydroxide ($OH^-$) > Chloride ($Cl^-$) > Sulphate ($SO_4^{2-}$). (Hydroxide is generally discharged most easily from aqueous solution unless halide concentration is very high. Complex anions like sulphate are typically not discharged). Order: **Hydroxide, Chloride, Sulphate**.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Endothermic vs. Exothermic Reactions:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Endothermic Reaction:</strong> A chemical reaction that *absorbs* heat energy from its surroundings, causing the surroundings to become cooler. The enthalpy change ($\Delta H$) for the reaction is positive ($\Delta H > 0$). Example: Dissolving ammonium nitrate in water, photosynthesis ($6CO_2 + 6H_2O \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Exothermic Reaction:</strong> A chemical reaction that *releases* heat energy into its surroundings, causing the surroundings to become warmer. The enthalpy change ($\Delta H$) for the reaction is negative ($\Delta H < 0$). Example: Combustion of fuels (like methane burning in oxygen), neutralization of strong acid and base ($HCl + NaOH \rightarrow NaCl + H_2O$).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Relationship between Velocity, Frequency, and Wavelength:</strong></p>
                                <p>For any periodic wave, the wave velocity ($v$) is the speed at which the waveform propagates.</p>
                                <p>Frequency ($f$) is the number of cycles passing a point per second.</p>
                                <p>Wavelength ($\lambda$) is the distance covered by one complete cycle.</p>
                                <p>In one second, $f$ cycles pass a point. Each cycle has a length of $\lambda$.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, the total distance covered by the wave in one second (which is the velocity) is the number of cycles per second multiplied by the length of each cycle.</p>
                                <p>Relationship: **$v = f \lambda$**</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Ultrasound and Echo Sounding:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Ultrasound Definition:</strong> Ultrasound refers to sound waves having frequencies *above* the upper limit of the human hearing range, typically considered to be above 20,000 Hertz (20 kHz).</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Depth Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Time for echo (total time for sound to travel down and back up, $t_{total}$) = 1.2 s.</p>
                                <p>Speed of sound in water ($v$) = 1500 m/s.</p>
                                <p>Let the depth of the water be $d$.</p>
                                <p>The sound wave travels down distance $d$ and back up distance $d$. Total distance travelled = $2d$.</p>
                                <p>Using Distance = Speed $\times$ Time:</p>
                                <p>$2d = v \times t_{total}$</p>
                                <p>$2d = 1500 \text{ m/s} \times 1.2 \text{ s} = 1800 \text{ m}$.</p>
                                <p>$d = 1800 \text{ m} / 2 = 900 \text{ m}$.</p>
                                <p>The depth of the water in the dam is 900 m.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Heat Transfer and Temperature Scales:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Forms of Heat Transfer & Temperature Scales:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>(I) Forms of Heat Transfer: **Conduction, Convection, Radiation**. (State any two)</li>
                                    <li>(II) Temperature Scales: **Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), Kelvin (K)** (Absolute scale). (State any two)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Heat Lost During Cooling and Freezing:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Mass of water ($m$) = 3000 g = 3 kg.</p>
                                <p>Initial temperature ($T_1$) = $21^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</p>
                                <p>Final state: Ice at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</p>
                                <p>Specific heat capacity of water ($c_w$) = 4200 J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹.</p>
                                <p>Specific latent heat of fusion of ice ($L_f$) = 336 kJ/kg = $336 \times 10^3$ J/kg.</p>
                                <p>Heat loss occurs in two stages:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Cooling water from 21°C to 0°C: $Q_1 = m c_w \Delta T$
                                        $\Delta T = 21 - 0 = 21$ K.
                                        $Q_1 = 3 \text{ kg} \times 4200 \text{ J/kgK} \times 21 \text{ K} = 264600$ J.</li>
                                    <li>Freezing water at 0°C to ice at 0°C: $Q_2 = m L_f$
                                        $Q_2 = 3 \text{ kg} \times (336 \times 10^3 \text{ J/kg}) = 1008000$ J.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Total heat lost ($Q_{total}$) = $Q_1 + Q_2 = 264600 + 1008000 = 1272600$ J.</p>
                                <p>Total heat lost = 1,272,600 J or 1272.6 kJ.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Mechanical Energy and Power:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Forms of Mechanical Energy:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Kinetic Energy (KE):</strong> Energy due to motion ($KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Potential Energy (PE):</strong> Stored energy due to position or configuration (e.g., Gravitational PE = $mgh$, Elastic PE = $\frac{1}{2}kx^2$).</li>
                                </ul>
                                 (State these two).

                                <p><strong>(ii) Power Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Force (F) = 240 N, Distance (d) = 600 cm = 6 m, Time (t) = 2 minutes = 120 s.</p>
                                <p>Work done (W) = Force $\times$ Distance = $240 \text{ N} \times 6 \text{ m} = 1440 \text{ J}$.</p>
                                <p>Power (P) = Work done / Time taken = $1440 \text{ J} / 120 \text{ s} = 12 \text{ W}$.</p>
                                <p>Power = 12 Watts.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Couplings and Governors:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Types of Coupling Devices:</strong></p>

                                    <li>Rigid Couplings (e.g., Sleeve, Flange, Clamp)</li>

                                 (Name any four distinct types/examples).

                                <p><strong>(ii) Centrifugal Governor Speed Control:</strong></p>
                                <p>A centrifugal governor uses rotating masses (flyballs) driven by the engine. As engine speed changes, the centrifugal force on the flyballs changes ($F_c = mr\omega^2$). This force alters the position of the flyballs and a connected sleeve. The sleeve movement operates a throttle valve controlling the fuel/working fluid supply. If speed increases, flyballs move out, sleeve rises, throttle closes slightly, reducing fuel and speed. If speed decreases, flyballs move in, sleeve lowers, throttle opens, increasing fuel and speed, thus maintaining a relatively constant mean speed.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Equilibrium of Concurrent Forces (Fig 2):</strong></p>
                                <p>Forces acting at a point. Resultant is zero, so the vector sum of forces is zero ($\sum F_x = 0$ and $\sum F_y = 0$).</p>

                                <p>$\alpha = \arctan(0.598) \approx 30.87^{\circ}$.</p>
                                <p>Substitute $\alpha$ into Eq 1 to find F:</p>
                                <p>$F \cos(30.87^{\circ}) = 4$</p>
                                <p>$F \times 0.8583 \approx 4$</p>
                                <p>$F = 4 / 0.8583 \approx 4.660$ N.</p>

                                    <li><strong>(I) Phase:</strong> A quantity of matter that is homogeneous throughout in both chemical composition and physical structure. Examples: solid phase, liquid phase, gas phase.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Cycle:</strong> A thermodynamic cycle is a sequence of processes that starts and ends at the same thermodynamic state.

                                    <li><strong>Pure Substance:</strong> A substance that has a fixed chemical composition throughout. It can exist in more than one phase (e.g., water as ice, liquid water, steam), but the chemical composition remains $H_2O$. Air is often treated as a pure substance in thermodynamics, although it's a mixture.</li>

Examples: Steam in a steam engine, refrigerant in a refrigerator, air in a gas turbine.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Difference: 'Pure substance' refers to the chemical nature, while 'working substance' refers to the role the substance plays in a thermodynamic system.</p>

                                        <li>A **straight line with negative slope** indicates constant negative angular acceleration (deceleration or slowing down rotation).</li>
                                        <li>A **curved line** indicates non-uniform (changing) angular acceleration.</li>

                                <p><strong>(i) Change in Momentum ($\Delta p$):</strong></p>
                                <p>$\Delta p = \text{Final Momentum} - \text{Initial Momentum} = mv - mu$.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Fittings:** Bends, valves, elbows, T-junctions cause turbulence and local pressure losses (minor losses).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Changes in Elevation:** Pressure decreases if flow goes uphill ($P + \rho g h$ = constant term in Bernoulli).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Changes in Velocity:** Pressure decreases if velocity increases (e.g., in narrow sections) due to Bernoulli effect ($P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2$ = constant term).</li>

                                <p><strong>(c) Battery Charging:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Process of Charging a Secondary Cell:</strong> Charging involves supplying electrical energy to the cell from an external DC source (charger) with a voltage slightly higher than the cell's EMF. Current flows into the positive terminal and out of the negative terminal (opposite to discharge). This external energy drives the chemical reactions within the cell in the reverse direction compared to discharge, converting the discharged chemical products back into their original charged state (e.g., converting lead sulphate back to lead dioxide and spongy lead in a lead-acid cell).</p>

                                    <li><strong>Correct Polarity:</strong> Ensure the charger positive terminal is connected to the battery positive terminal, and negative to negative. Reversing polarity can damage both.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Correct Voltage/Current:</strong> Use a charger appropriate for the battery type and capacity. Avoid excessive charging voltage or current, which can cause overheating, gassing, or damage.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Charge in a well-ventilated area, especially for batteries that can produce flammable gases (like hydrogen from lead-acid cells) during charging.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Temperature Monitoring:</strong> Avoid charging at extreme temperatures (too hot or too cold) as it can affect efficiency and battery life/safety.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid Overcharging: Disconnect the charger once the battery is full (or use a smart charger that automatically stops/switches to trickle mode) to prevent damage.</li>

                                <p><strong>(d) Series-Parallel Cell Arrangement (Fig 4):</strong></p>
                                <p>Configuration: 3 parallel branches, each branch containing 2 cells in series.</p>
                                <p>Single cell: $E_{cell} = 1.25 V$, $r_{cell} = 0.1 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Load current ($I_L$) = 0.1 A.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 1: Analyze one branch.</strong></p>
                                <p>Two cells in series:</p>
                                <p>EMF of branch ($E_{branch}$) = $2 \times E_{cell} = 2 \times 1.25 = 2.5 V$.</p>
                                <p>Internal resistance of branch ($r_{branch}$) = $2 \times r_{cell} = 2 \times 0.1 = 0.2 \Omega$.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 2: Analyze parallel combination of 3 branches.</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) EMF and Internal Resistance of Battery:</strong></p>
                                <p>For identical branches in parallel:</p>
                                <p>Total EMF of battery ($E_{batt}$) = EMF of one branch = $E_{branch} = 2.5 V$.</p>
                                <p>Total internal resistance of battery ($r_{batt}$) = Resistance of one branch / Number of branches.</p>
                                <p>$r_{batt} = r_{branch} / 3 = 0.2 \Omega / 3 = 1/15 \Omega \approx 0.0667 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Battery EMF = 2.5 V, Battery Internal Resistance $\approx 0.067 \Omega$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Load Resistance ($R_L$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The battery (with $E_{batt}$ and $r_{batt}$) supplies current $I_L$ to the load $R_L$.</p>
                                <p>Using Ohm's Law for the whole circuit: $I_L = E_{batt} / (R_L + r_{batt})$.</p>
                                <p>$0.1 A = 2.5 V / (R_L + 0.0667 \Omega)$.</p>
                                <p>$R_L + 0.0667 = 2.5 / 0.1 = 25$.</p>
                                <p>$R_L = 25 - 0.0667 = 24.9333 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Load resistance $\approx 24.93 \Omega$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Linear vs. Non-Linear Scales:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Linear Scale:</strong> A scale where the divisions are equally spaced. The deflection of the pointer is directly proportional to the quantity being measured. Example: Permanent Magnet Moving Coil (PMMC) instruments typically have a linear scale because the deflecting torque is proportional to the current ($T_d \propto I$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Non-Linear Scale (Cramped Scale):</strong> A scale where the divisions are not equally spaced. The deflection is not directly proportional to the quantity being measured. Often, the scale is 'cramped' at the beginning and expands towards the higher end, or vice versa. Example: Moving Iron instruments typically have a non-linear scale because the deflecting torque is proportional to the square of the current ($T_d \propto I^2$). Ohmmeters also have non-linear scales.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Moving-Coil and Moving-Iron Instruments:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Principle of Operation of Moving-Coil (PMMC) Instrument:</strong> Based on the motor principle. A lightweight coil, wound on an aluminium former, is placed in the strong, uniform radial magnetic field of a permanent magnet. When the current to be measured passes through the coil, it experiences a force (Lorentz force, $F = BIlN$) which creates a deflecting torque ($T_d$). This torque causes the coil (and attached pointer) to rotate against the controlling torque provided by hairsprings. The deflection is directly proportional to the current ($T_d \propto I$), resulting in a linear scale. Used for DC measurements only.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Advantage of Moving-Iron over Moving-Coil:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Can measure both AC and DC quantities (because the deflection depends on $I^2$, which is always positive regardless of current direction).</li>
                                    <li>More robust/rugged construction.</li>
                                    <li>Generally cheaper to manufacture.</li>
                                     <li>(State any one)</li>

    |________| <- Field Coil (Carries current I)

Operation:
- Current I flows through the fixed Field Coil.
- This creates a magnetic field that magnetizes both the Fixed Iron Vane and the Moving Iron Vane with the same polarity (e.g., both become N poles on the side facing each other).
- Since like poles repel, a repulsive force acts between the fixed and moving vanes.
- This force creates a torque causing the Moving Iron Vane (and the attached pointer) to rotate.
- Rotation occurs against the controlling torque of a spring.
- The deflection is roughly proportional to I^2, leading to a non-linear scale.
- Damping is usually provided by an air damping chamber.

                                        <li>A fixed coil carries the current to be measured (or a current proportional to the voltage).</li>
                                        <li>Inside the coil, there are two pieces of soft iron placed parallel to each other along the axis. One iron piece (vane) is fixed to the coil former. The other iron piece (vane) is attached to the instrument spindle and is free to move.</li>
                                        <li>When current flows through the coil, it produces a magnetic field that magnetizes both iron vanes similarly (e.g., adjacent ends become North poles, or both become South poles).</li>
                                        <li>Due to repulsion between these like poles, the moving vane is pushed away from the fixed vane.</li>
                                        <li>This repulsive force creates a deflecting torque, causing the spindle (and the attached pointer) to rotate.</li>
                                        <li>The rotation continues until the deflecting torque is balanced by the controlling torque provided by hairsprings.</li>
                                        <li>The deflection is related to the square of the current ($T_d \propto I^2$), resulting in a non-linear scale, typically cramped at the lower end. Damping (usually air friction) is provided to make the pointer settle quickly.</li>

                                <p><strong>Step 1: Find equivalent resistance of parallel part ($R_P$).</strong></p>
                                <p>$R_P = \frac{2 \times 6}{2 + 6} = \frac{12}{8} = 1.5 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 2: Find total circuit resistance ($R_{total}$).</strong></p>
                                <p>$R_{total} = R_{S1} + R_P + R_{S2} = 1 + 1.5 + 4 = 6.5 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 3: Find total current from supply ($I_{total}$).</strong></p>
                                <p>$I_{total} = V_S / R_{total} = 12 V / 6.5 \Omega = 120 / 65 = 24 / 13 \approx 1.846 A$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(I) Current through $6 \Omega$ resistor ($I_{6\Omega}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The total current ($I_{total}$) splits between the $2\Omega$ and $6\Omega$ resistors. Use the current divider rule:</p>
                                <p>$I_{6\Omega} = I_{total} \times \frac{R_{other}}{R_{other} + R_{6\Omega}} = I_{total} \times \frac{2}{2 + 6}$</p>
                                <p>$I_{6\Omega} = (24/13) \times \frac{2}{8} = (24/13) \times (1/4) = 6/13 A$.</p>
                                <p>$I_{6\Omega} \approx 0.4615 A$.</p>

                                <p>The voltage across the parallel combination ($V_P$) is the same as the voltage across the $2\Omega$ resistor.</p>
                                <p>$V_P = I_{total} \times R_P = (24/13) A \times 1.5 \Omega = (24/13) \times (3/2) = 36/13 V$.</p>
                                <p>$V_{2\Omega} = V_P \approx 2.769 V$.</p>
                                <p>(Alternatively, find current through $2\Omega$: $I_{2\Omega} = I_{total} - I_{6\Omega} = (24/13) - (6/13) = 18/13$ A. Then $V_{2\Omega} = I_{2\Omega} \times R_{2\Omega} = (18/13) \times 2 = 36/13$ V).</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Capacitor Applications:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Ceramic Capacitor:</strong> Coupling/decoupling in high-frequency circuits, timing circuits, filters.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Energy Stored in Series Capacitors:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: $C_1 = 12 \mu F$, $C_2 = 12 \mu F$. Connected in series.</p>
                                <p>Total voltage ($V_{total}$) = 19.5 V.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 1: Find equivalent capacitance ($C_{eq}$).</strong></p>
                                <p>For series capacitors: $\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}$.</p>
                                <p>$C_{eq} = 6 \mu F$.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 2: Find total charge stored (Q).</strong></p>
                                <p>In a series circuit, the charge on each capacitor is the same as the total charge.</p>
                                <p>$Q = C_{eq} \times V_{total} = (6 \times 10^{-6} \text{ F}) \times 19.5 \text{ V} = 1.17 \times 10^{-4}$ C (or 117 $\mu$C).</p>
                                <p>So, $Q_1 = Q_2 = Q = 1.17 \times 10^{-4}$ C.</p>
                                <p><strong>Step 3: Find voltage across each capacitor ($V_1, V_2$).</strong></p>
                                <p>$V_1 = Q / C_1 = (1.17 \times 10^{-4}) / (12 \times 10^{-6}) = 117 / 12 = 9.75$ V.</p>

                                <p><strong>Step 4: Find energy stored in each capacitor ($E_1, E_2$).</strong></p>
                                <p>Energy $E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 = \frac{Q^2}{2C} = \frac{1}{2} Q V$.</p>
                                <p>$E_1 = \frac{1}{2} C_1 V_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} (12 \times 10^{-6}) (9.75)^2 = (6 \times 10^{-6}) (95.0625) \approx 5.704 \times 10^{-4}$ J.</p>
                                <p>$E_2 = \frac{1}{2} C_2 V_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} (12 \times 10^{-6}) (9.75)^2 = (6 \times 10^{-6}) (95.0625) \approx 5.704 \times 10^{-4}$ J.</p>
                                <p>Energy stored in each capacitor is approximately $5.70 \times 10^{-4}$ J (or 0.57 mJ).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Magnetic Hysteresis:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Explanation:</strong> Hysteresis, in magnetism, refers to the lagging effect where the magnetic flux density (B) in a ferromagnetic material does not return to its original value when the magnetizing field (H) is removed or reversed. The material retains some residual magnetism (remanence), and an opposing field (coercive force) is needed to bring the flux density back to zero. This lagging occurs because the magnetic domains within the material do not instantly reorient themselves with changes in the external field. This process involves energy loss, which appears as heat (hysteresis loss) when the material is subjected to cyclic magnetization.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Self and Mutual Inductance:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Self Inductance (L):</strong> This occurs within a single coil. When the current flowing through the coil changes, the magnetic flux produced by that current also changes. According to Faraday's Law, this changing flux induces an EMF *within the same coil*. This induced EMF (called self-induced EMF or back EMF) opposes the change in current that caused it (Lenz's Law). Self inductance (L) is the property of the coil that quantifies this effect; it is the ratio of the induced EMF to the rate of change of current ($E = -L \frac{di}{dt}$) or the ratio of the flux linkage ($\Psi$) to the current (I) producing it ($L = \Psi/I = N\Phi/I$).</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Mutual Inductance (M):</strong> This occurs between two (or more) magnetically coupled coils (coils whose magnetic fluxes link each other). When the current in one coil (e.g., coil 1) changes, its changing magnetic flux links the second coil (coil 2), inducing an EMF in the second coil ($E_2 = -M \frac{di_1}{dt}$). Similarly, a changing current in coil 2 induces an EMF in coil 1 ($E_1 = -M \frac{di_2}{dt}$). Mutual inductance (M) is the property that quantifies this interaction; it depends on the geometry, number of turns, and magnetic coupling between the coils ($M = k\sqrt{L_1 L_2}$, where k is the coefficient of coupling). It is the principle behind transformers.</p>

                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(i) Peak-to-Peak Voltage ($V_{p-p}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>$V_{p-p} = 2 \times V_m = 2 \times 239 = 478 V$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) RMS Voltage ($V_{rms}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>For a sine wave, $V_{rms} = V_m / \sqrt{2}$.</p>
                                <p>$V_{rms} = 239 / \sqrt{2} \approx 169.0 V$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Frequency (f):</strong></p>
                                <p>$\omega = 2\pi f \implies 100\pi = 2\pi f$.</p>
                                <p>$f = 100\pi / (2\pi) = 50 Hz$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iv) Phase Angle ($\phi$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The phase angle is $\phi = -0.25$ radians.</p>
                                <p>Convert to degrees: $\phi = -0.25 \times (180/\pi) \approx -14.32^{\circ}$.</p>
                                <p>The voltage lags a reference $\sin(100\pi t)$ wave by 0.25 radians or $14.32^{\circ}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Purpose of Laminating Transformer Core:</strong></p>
                                <p>The alternating magnetic flux in the transformer core induces electromotive forces (EMFs) within the core material itself (Faraday's Law). Since the core is conductive (iron), these induced EMFs drive circulating currents within the core, known as **eddy currents**. These currents flow through the resistance of the core material, dissipating energy as heat ($I^2R$ loss), which is known as eddy current loss. This loss reduces the transformer's efficiency and causes heating.</p>
                                <p>By constructing the core from thin sheets (laminations) insulated from each other (by varnish or oxide layers), the paths for eddy currents are restricted to within each thin lamination. This significantly increases the overall electrical resistance of the core to the flow of eddy currents across the core's cross-section, thereby substantially reducing the magnitude of the eddy currents and the associated energy loss.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Ideal Transformer Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Rating = 5 kVA = 5000 VA, Primary Voltage ($V_p$) = 11 kV = 11000 V, Frequency = 50 Hz.</p>
                                <p>Turns Ratio: Assume $N_p/N_s = 46/1$. (Ratio of primary turns to secondary turns is 46).</p>
                                <p>Neglect losses (ideal transformer).</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Secondary Voltage on Open Circuit ($V_s$):</strong></p>
                                <p>$\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}$.</p>
                                <p>$V_s = V_p \times \frac{N_s}{N_p} = 11000 V \times \frac{1}{46} \approx 239.13 V$.</p>
                                <p>Secondary voltage $\approx 239 V$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Full-Load Secondary Current ($I_s$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Full Load Apparent Power (S) = $V_s \times I_s$.</p>
                                <p>$5000 \text{ VA} = 239.13 V \times I_s$.</p>
                                <p>$I_s = 5000 / 239.13 \approx 20.91 A$.</p>
                                <p>Full-load secondary current $\approx 20.9 A$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Minimum Load Resistance ($R_L$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Minimum resistance corresponds to maximum current (full load kVA). Assuming a purely resistive load (power factor = 1) for minimum resistance to draw full apparent power:</p>
                                <p>Power = $V_s^2 / R_L$. If PF=1, Apparent Power = Real Power.</p>
                                <p>$S = V_s^2 / R_L$.</p>
                                <p>$5000 = (239.13)^2 / R_L$.</p>
                                <p>$R_L = (239.13)^2 / 5000 = 57183 / 5000 \approx 11.44 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>(Alternatively, $R_L = V_s / I_s = 239.13 V / 20.91 A \approx 11.44 \Omega$).</p>
                                <p>Minimum load resistance $\approx 11.4 \Omega$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iv) Full-Load Primary Current ($I_p$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Using Apparent Power: $S = V_p \times I_p$.</p>
                                <p>$5000 \text{ VA} = 11000 V \times I_p$.</p>
                                <p>$I_p = 5000 / 11000 = 5/11 A \approx 0.4545 A$.</p>
                                <p>(Alternatively, using current ratio: $\frac{I_p}{I_s} = \frac{N_s}{N_p} = \frac{1}{46}$. $I_p = I_s / 46 = 20.91 / 46 \approx 0.4545 A$).</p>
                                <p>Full-load primary current $\approx 0.45 A$.</p>
