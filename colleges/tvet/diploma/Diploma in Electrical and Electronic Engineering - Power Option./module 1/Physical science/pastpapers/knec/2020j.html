                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers radioactivity definitions and half-life calculation, vibration types, derivation of the period for a mass-spring system, and basic hydrocarbon properties.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Radioactivity Definitions and Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Background Radiation:</strong> The low-level ionizing radiation originating from natural and artificial sources in the environment, constantly present regardless of specific experimental sources.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Half-life ($T_{1/2}$):</strong> The time required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a given sample to undergo radioactive decay, or equivalently, the time taken for the activity (count rate) of a radioactive sample to decrease to half its initial value.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Half-life Determination:</strong></p>
                                <p>Background count rate = 6 Bq.</p>
                                <p>Initial observed count rate = 3854 Bq.</p>
                                <p>Initial corrected count rate ($A_0$) = Observed - Background = $3854 - 6 = 3848$ Bq.</p>
                                <p>Observed count rate after 27 hours = 487 Bq.</p>
                                <p>Corrected count rate after t = 27 hours ($A_t$) = $487 - 6 = 481$ Bq.</p>
                                <p>The decay formula is $A_t = A_0 e^{-\lambda t}$, where $\lambda$ is the decay constant.</p>
                                <p>$481 = 3848 e^{-\lambda (27)}$</p>
                                <p>$e^{-27\lambda} = 481 / 3848 \approx 0.125$</p>
                                <p>Take natural logarithm: $-27\lambda = \ln(0.125) \approx -2.0794$.</p>
                                <p>$\lambda = -2.0794 / -27 \approx 0.0770 \text{ hour}^{-1}$.</p>
                                <p>The relationship between decay constant and half-life is $T_{1/2} = \ln(2) / \lambda$.</p>
                                <p>$T_{1/2} = \ln(2) / 0.0770 \approx 0.6931 / 0.0770 \approx 8.999$ hours.</p>
                                <p>Alternatively, notice that $481 / 3848 = 1/8 = (1/2)^3$.</p>
                                <p>So, $A_t = A_0 (1/2)^n$, where n is the number of half-lives.</p>
                                <p>$(1/2)^3 = (1/2)^n \implies n = 3$.</p>
                                <p>Three half-lives have passed in 27 hours.</p>
                                <p>Number of half-lives (n) = Time elapsed (t) / Half-life ($T_{1/2}$).</p>
                                <p>$3 = 27 \text{ hours} / T_{1/2}$.</p>
                                <p>$T_{1/2} = 27 / 3 = 9$ hours.</p>
                                <p>The half-life of the radioactive substance is **9 hours**.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Damped vs. Forced Vibration:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Damped Vibration:</strong> Oscillation where the amplitude gradually decreases over time due to energy dissipation caused by resistive forces (like friction or air resistance). The system eventually comes to rest at equilibrium.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Forced Vibration:</strong> Oscillation that occurs when a system is driven by an external periodic force. The system oscillates at the frequency of the driving force, and its amplitude depends on the driving frequency relative to the system's natural frequency and the amount of damping.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Period of Vertical Mass-Spring System:</strong></p>
                                <p>Consider mass M hanging in equilibrium, extending the spring by $x_0$. At equilibrium, spring force $kx_0 = Mg$.</p>
                                <p>Now displace the mass by a further distance $x$ downwards from equilibrium.</p>
                                <p>Total extension of spring = $x_0 + x$.</p>
                                <p>Upward spring force = $k(x_0 + x)$.</p>
                                <p>Downward force = Weight $Mg$.</p>
                                <p>Net restoring force (upwards) $F_{net} = \text{Spring Force} - \text{Weight} = k(x_0 + x) - Mg$.</p>
                                <p>Since $kx_0 = Mg$, $F_{net} = kx_0 + kx - kx_0 = kx$.</p>
                                <p>The net force is directed towards the equilibrium position (opposite to displacement $x$), so $F_{net} = -kx$.</p>
                                <p>By Newton's Second Law, $F_{net} = Ma$, where $a$ is the acceleration.</p>
                                <p>$Ma = -kx \implies a = -(k/M)x$.</p>
                                <p>This is the equation for SHM ($a = -\omega^2 x$), where the angular frequency $\omega^2 = k/M$.</p>
                                <p>$\omega = \sqrt{k/M}$.</p>
                                <p>The periodic time T is related to $\omega$ by $T = 2\pi / \omega$.</p>
                                <p>Substituting for $\omega$: $T = \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{k/M}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{M}{k}}$. (Shown)</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Hydrocarbon C$_{6}$H$_{12}$:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Molecular Weight:</strong></p>
                                <p>Molecular Weight = $(6 \times \text{RAM of C}) + (12 \times \text{RAM of H})$.</p>
                                <p>Molecular Weight = $(6 \times 12) + (12 \times 1) = 72 + 12 = 84$.</p>
                                <p>The molecular weight is 84 g/mol.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Products of Complete Combustion:</strong></p>
                                <p>Complete combustion of any hydrocarbon (containing only C and H) in excess oxygen produces:</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Reflection and Wave Types:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Laws of Reflection of Light:</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Longitudinal Waves:</strong> The oscillations of the particles of the medium are parallel to the direction of energy propagation. They consist of compressions and rarefactions. Example: Sound waves in air.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Transverse Waves:</strong> The oscillations of the particles of the medium are perpendicular to the direction of energy propagation. They exhibit crests and troughs. Example: Light waves, waves on a stretched string.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Difference lies in the direction of particle oscillation relative to the direction of wave travel.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Temperature Conversion and Specific Heat Capacity:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Convert 113°F to Kelvin:</strong></p>
                                <p>Step 1: Convert Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C).</p>
                                <p>$^{\circ}C = \frac{5}{9} (°F - 32)$</p>
                                <p>$^{\circ}C = \frac{5}{9} (113 - 32) = \frac{5}{9} (81) = 5 \times 9 = 45^{\circ}C$.</p>
                                <p>Step 2: Convert Celsius (°C) to Kelvin (K).</p>
                                <p>$K = ^{\circ}C + 273.15$</p>
                                <p>$K = 45 + 273.15 = 318.15 K$.</p>
                                <p>$113^{\circ}F$ is equivalent to **318.15 K**.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Specific Heat Capacity Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Mass (m) = 20 kg, Heat absorbed (Q) = 310 kJ = $310 \times 10^3$ J.</p>
                                <p>Initial temperature ($T_1$) = 26°C.</p>
                                <p>Final temperature ($T_2$) = 160°C.</p>
                                <p>Temperature change ($\Delta T$) = $T_2 - T_1 = 160 - 26 = 134^{\circ}$C (or 134 K).</p>
                                <p>Using $Q = mc\Delta T$, where c is specific heat capacity.</p>
                                <p>$c = Q / (m\Delta T) = (310 \times 10^3 \text{ J}) / (20 \text{ kg} \times 134 \text{ K})$.</p>
                                <p>$c = 310000 / 2680 \approx 115.67 \text{ J kg}^{-1} \text{ K}^{-1}$.</p>
                                <p>Specific heat capacity $\approx 115.7 \text{ J kg}^{-1} \text{ K}^{-1}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Factors Affecting Thermal Conduction (Rate of Heat Flow):</strong></p>
                                <p>The rate of heat flow ($dQ/dt$) by conduction through a material is given by Fourier's Law: $\frac{dQ}{dt} = -kA \frac{dT}{dx}$, where k is thermal conductivity, A is cross-sectional area, and $dT/dx$ is the temperature gradient.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Temperature Gradient ($dT/dx$):</strong> The rate of heat flow is directly proportional to the temperature gradient (the change in temperature per unit distance along the direction of heat flow). A steeper gradient (larger temperature difference over a shorter distance) leads to a faster rate of heat transfer.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Thickness of the Material (related to $dx$):</strong> For a given temperature difference ($\Delta T$) across a material of thickness ($L$), the temperature gradient is $\Delta T / L$. Therefore, the rate of heat flow is inversely proportional to the thickness of the material ($\frac{dQ}{dt} \propto 1/L$). A thicker material offers more resistance to heat flow, resulting in a lower rate of heat transfer for the same temperature difference.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Bases and pH Determination:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Properties of Bases:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Bitter Taste.</li>
                                    <li>Slippery/Soapy Feel (due to reaction with fats on skin).</li>
                                    <li>Turn Red Litmus Blue.</li>
                                    <li>React with Acids (Neutralization) to form salt and water.</li>
                                    <li>Aqueous solutions conduct electricity (electrolytes).</li>
                                    <li>pH value greater than 7.</li>
                                     <li>(State any two)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Procedure for Determining pH of Basic Solution:</strong></p>
                                <p>Common methods:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Using pH Indicator Paper/Solution (e.g., Universal Indicator):</strong> Dip the indicator paper into the solution or add a few drops of the indicator solution. Compare the resulting color to a standard color chart provided with the indicator to estimate the pH value. Basic solutions typically give green/blue/violet colors with universal indicator.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Using a pH Meter:</strong> Calibrate the pH meter using standard buffer solutions. Rinse the meter's electrode with distilled water and gently immerse it in the basic solution. Allow the reading on the meter display to stabilize and record the pH value directly. This provides a more accurate measurement.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(a) Potential Energy and Power:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Elastic vs. Gravitational Potential Energy:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE):</strong> Energy stored by an object due to its position relative to a gravitational field (typically Earth's). It depends on the object's mass (m), height (h) above a reference level, and gravitational acceleration (g). $GPE = mgh$.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Elastic Potential Energy (EPE):</strong> Energy stored in an elastic object (like a spring or rubber band) when it is deformed (stretched or compressed) from its equilibrium shape. It depends on the object's stiffness (e.g., spring constant k) and the amount of deformation (x). $EPE = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Difference: GPE relates to position in a gravitational field, while EPE relates to the deformation state of an elastic object.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Tractive Power Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Constant velocity (v) = 2 m/s, Resisting force ($F_{resist}$) = 60 N.</p>
                                <p>To move at a constant velocity, the applied tractive force ($F_{tract}$) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the resisting force. So, $F_{tract} = 60$ N.</p>
                                <p>Power (P) = Force $\times$ Velocity (when force and velocity are in the same direction).</p>
                                <p>$P = F_{tract} \times v = 60 \text{ N} \times 2 \text{ m/s} = 120 \text{ W}$.</p>
                                <p>The necessary tractive power is 120 Watts.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Less Dense Fluid:</strong> Pressure is directly proportional to density ($P = h\rho g$). If the fluid is replaced with a less dense fluid ($\rho$ decreases) while depth $h$ remains the same, the pressure at that depth will **decrease**. Reason: The weight of the fluid column above the point is less.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Increased Fluid Level:</strong> Increasing the fluid level increases the depth ($h$) of the point below the surface. Since pressure is directly proportional to depth ($P = h\rho g$), increasing the depth $h$ will **increase** the pressure at that point. Reason: The weight of the fluid column above the point increases.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(a) Fluid Couplers:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Applications:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Automotive automatic transmissions (torque converters are a type of fluid coupling).</li>
                                    <li>Industrial drives: Conveyors, crushers, fans, pumps (allowing smooth start-up and overload protection).</li>

                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Operation:</strong></p>
                                <p>A fluid coupling (or hydraulic coupling) transmits rotating mechanical power between two shafts using a hydraulic fluid (usually oil) as the transmission medium. It consists of two main components housed within a sealed casing filled with fluid:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Impeller (Pump):</strong> Connected to the input (driving) shaft. It has radial vanes and acts like a centrifugal pump.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Runner (Turbine):</strong> Connected to the output (driven) shaft. It also has radial vanes and faces the impeller.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Operation:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>When the driving shaft rotates the impeller, the fluid within the impeller is thrown outwards by centrifugal force, gaining kinetic energy.</li>
                                        <li>This moving fluid flows across the gap and strikes the vanes of the runner (turbine).</li>
                                        <li>The impact of the fluid exerts a torque on the runner, causing the driven shaft to rotate.</li>
                                        <li>The fluid then flows inwards through the runner vanes and returns to the impeller to repeat the cycle.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                Power is transmitted by the momentum exchange of the fluid. There is always some slip (difference in speed between impeller and runner) necessary for torque transmission. This slip results in some energy loss as heat. Fluid couplings provide smooth power take-up, dampen torsional vibrations, and offer inherent overload protection (if the output shaft stalls, the input shaft can continue rotating without damage, though the fluid will heat up).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Tensile Test Calculations:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Gauge length ($L_0$) = 140 mm.</p>
                                <p>Cross-sectional area (A) = $200 \text{ mm}^2$.</p>
                                <p>Maximum load ($P_{max}$) = 100 kN = $100 \times 10^3$ N.</p>
                                <p>Gauge length at fracture ($L_f$) = 185 mm.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Tensile Strength (Ultimate Tensile Strength, UTS):</strong></p>
                                <p>UTS = Maximum Load / Original Cross-sectional Area.</p>
                                <p>UTS = $(100 \times 10^3 \text{ N}) / (200 \text{ mm}^2) = 500 \text{ N/mm}^2$ (or 500 MPa).</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Percentage Elongation (%El):</strong></p>
                                <p>%El = $\frac{\text{Increase in Length}}{\text{Original Length}} \times 100\% = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} \times 100\%$.</p>
                                <p>%El = $\frac{185 \text{ mm} - 140 \text{ mm}}{140 \text{ mm}} \times 100\% = \frac{45}{140} \times 100\%$.</p>
                                <p>%El $\approx 0.3214 \times 100\% = 32.14\%$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Governor Terminology:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Equilibrium Speed:</strong> The constant speed at which the governor flyballs are in equilibrium (i.e., remain at a fixed radius of rotation) for a specific configuration (sleeve position). At this speed, the outward centrifugal force on the balls exactly balances the inward controlling force.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Controlling Force:</strong> The net inward force acting on the rotating flyballs that opposes the outward centrifugal force. In simple Watt governors, it's primarily due to the weight of the balls and arms. In spring-loaded governors (like Hartnell), it's mainly provided by the compression of the central spring, possibly combined with the weight of the balls/arms.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Pulley and Belt Velocity:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Diameter (D) = 210 mm = 0.21 m.</p>
                                <p>Rotational Speed (N) = 172 rev/min.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Angular velocity ($\omega$):</strong></p>
                                <p>$\omega = \frac{2\pi N}{60}$ (where N is in rpm).</p>
                                <p>$\omega = \frac{2\pi \times 172}{60} = \frac{344\pi}{60} = \frac{86\pi}{15}$ rad/s.</p>
                                <p>$\omega \approx 18.01$ rad/s.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Linear velocity of the belt (v):</strong></p>
                                <p>Assuming the belt speed is the same as the tangential velocity at the pulley rim.</p>
                                <p>Radius (r) = D/2 = 0.21 m / 2 = 0.105 m.</p>
                                <p>$v = r \omega = 0.105 \text{ m} \times (\frac{86\pi}{15} \text{ rad/s})$.</p>
                                <p>$v \approx 0.105 \times 18.01 \approx 1.891$ m/s.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Battery Charging Methods:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Booster Charging:</strong> Charging a battery at a high current rate for a short period to quickly add a significant amount of charge, typically used for emergency recovery of a deeply discharged battery (e.g., car battery jump start followed by alternator charging). Requires caution to avoid overheating/damage.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Trickle Charging:</strong> Charging a battery at a very low, continuous current (typically just enough to offset the battery's self-discharge rate). Used to maintain a battery at full charge during storage or long periods of inactivity, preventing degradation like sulfation in lead-acid cells.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Electric Kettle Calculations:</strong></p>

                                <p>Time (t) = 2 hours.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Factors Affecting Resistance of Conductors:</strong></p>
                                <p>The resistance (R) of a conductor depends on $R = \rho L / A$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Change in Temperature:</strong> For most metallic conductors, resistance increases as temperature increases (positive temperature coefficient). This is because increased thermal vibration of the atoms impedes the flow of electrons. For semiconductors and insulators, resistance generally decreases as temperature increases (negative coefficient) due to increased charge carrier concentration.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Length of Conductor (L):</strong> Resistance is directly proportional to the length of the conductor. A longer conductor provides more obstacles to electron flow ($R \propto L$).</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Cross-section Area of Conductor (A):</strong> Resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the conductor. A larger area provides more paths for electrons to flow, reducing resistance ($R \propto 1/A$).</p>
                                <p>(Also depends on the material itself via resistivity, $\rho$).</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Resistance Change with Temperature:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Resistance at $T_1 = 20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($R_{20}$) = 200 $\Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Temperature coefficient at $T_1 = 20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($\alpha_{20}$) = $0.0043 /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</p>
                                <p>Final temperature ($T_2$) = $90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</p>
                                <p>We use the formula relating resistance to temperature change relative to a reference temperature ($T_1$):</p>
                                <p>$R_2 = R_1 [1 + \alpha_1 (T_2 - T_1)]$.</p>
                                <p>Here, $R_1 = R_{20}$, $\alpha_1 = \alpha_{20}$.</p>

                                <p>$R_{90} = 200 [1 + 0.0043 (70)]$</p>
                                <p>$R_{90} = 200 [1 + 0.301]$</p>

                                <p>Inductance $L = N\Phi / I = N(BA)/I = N(\mu H A)/I$. Also MMF = NI = $\Phi S = \Phi (l/\mu A)$, so $\Phi = NI \mu A / l$. Then $L = N(NI \mu A / l) / I = N^2 \mu A / l$. Ampere-turns = NI.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Air-cored vs. Iron-cored:</strong></p>
                                <p>Assuming same dimensions (A, l) and number of turns (N). Iron has a much higher relative permeability ($\mu_r >> 1$) than air ($\mu_r \approx 1$). Since $L \propto \mu = \mu_0 \mu_r$, the inductance of the **iron-cored inductor will be significantly higher** (typically hundreds or thousands of times higher) than the air-cored inductor for the same N, A, and l.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Short-Thick vs. Long-Thin Inductors:</strong></p>
                                <p class="key-point">Ambiguous. Let's assume "same number of turns (N) and same volume of wire (implying same wire length)".</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Short-Thick: Small length (l), Large area (A).</li>
                                    <li>Long-Thin: Large length (l), Small area (A).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Since $L = N^2 \mu A / l$.</p>
                                <p>For the **short-thick inductor**: Small $l$ and large $A$ both contribute to a **higher inductance** compared to the long-thin inductor where large $l$ and small $A$ both contribute to a lower inductance, assuming N and $\mu$ are the same.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Alternative interpretation: Same N, same A. Then $L \propto 1/l$. Short inductor has higher L. Another interpretation: Same N, same l. Then $L \propto A$. Thick inductor has higher L. The first interpretation seems most likely. Short-thick generally gives higher inductance than long-thin for same N.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Self-Inductance vs. Mutual Inductance:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Self-Inductance (L):</strong> The property of a single coil whereby a change in current flowing through it induces an opposing electromotive force (back EMF) within the *same* coil. It relates the induced EMF to the rate of change of current in that coil ($E = -L di/dt$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Mutual Inductance (M):</strong> The property relating two or more magnetically coupled coils, whereby a change in current in *one* coil induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the *other* coil(s) due to the linking of changing magnetic flux ($E_2 = -M di_1/dt$).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Energy Stored in Inductor:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Inductance (L) = 16 H, Current (I) = 13 A.</p>
                                <p>Energy stored in an inductor ($E_L$) = $\frac{1}{2} L I^2$.</p>
                                <p>$E_L = \frac{1}{2} \times (16 \text{ H}) \times (13 \text{ A})^2$.</p>
                                <p>$E_L = 8 \times 169 = 1352$ J.</p>
                                <p>Energy stored = 1352 Joules.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers AC waveform definitions, analysis of AC circuit phase angle from expressions, ideal transformer calculations, and transformer construction.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) AC Waveform Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Instantaneous Value:</strong> The value of an alternating quantity (like voltage or current) at a specific instant in time (t). Represented by lowercase letters, e.g., v(t), i(t).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Peak Value (Amplitude):</strong> The maximum instantaneous value reached by an alternating quantity during its cycle. Represented by $V_m$ or $I_m$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Frequency (f):</strong> The number of complete cycles of the alternating waveform that occur in one second. Unit: Hertz (Hz).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) AC Circuit Analysis (Fig 2):</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Voltage $V = 100 \sin(314t)$. Current $I = 5 \sin(314t - \pi/6)$.</p>
                                <p>General forms: $V = V_m \sin(\omega t + \phi_v)$, $I = I_m \sin(\omega t + \phi_i)$.</p>
                                <p>Here: $V_m=100V$, $I_m=5A$, $\omega=314$ rad/s, $\phi_v = 0$ (reference), $\phi_i = -\pi/6$ radians.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Phase Angle of the Circuit ($\phi$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The phase angle of the circuit is the phase difference between the voltage and the current, usually defined as $\phi = \phi_v - \phi_i$.</p>
                                <p>$\phi = 0 - (-\pi/6) = +\pi/6$ radians.</p>
                                <p>Convert to degrees: $\phi = (\pi/6) \times (180/\pi) = 30^{\circ}$.</p>
                                <p>The phase angle is $\pi/6$ radians or $30^{\circ}$. Since $\phi_i$ is negative relative to $\phi_v$, the **current lags the voltage** by $30^{\circ}$. (Therefore, the circuit is inductive).</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Phasor Diagram:</strong></p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Reason for Laminations:</strong></p>
                                <p>Transformer cores are laminated (made of thin sheets insulated from each other) primarily to **reduce eddy current losses**. The alternating magnetic flux induces circulating eddy currents within the conductive core material. Laminating the core restricts these currents to flow only within the thin individual sheets, significantly increasing the electrical resistance in their path and thus reducing the magnitude of the eddy currents and the associated $I^2R$ heat loss ($P_{eddy} \propto B^2 f^2 t^2 / \rho$, where t is lamination thickness). This improves the transformer's efficiency and prevents excessive heating of the core.</p>
