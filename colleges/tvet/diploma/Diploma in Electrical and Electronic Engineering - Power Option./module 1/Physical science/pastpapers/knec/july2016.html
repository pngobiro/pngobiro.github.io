                        <div class="answer-content" id="answer-1">
                            <div class="answer-detail">
                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers fundamental wave properties, the relationship between wavelength and frequency, types of waves, and simple harmonic motion.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Wavelength ($\lambda$):</strong> The wavelength of a periodic wave is the spatial period of the wave – the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. It is the distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same phase, such as two adjacent crests, troughs, or zero crossings. Unit: meter (m).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Frequency (f):</strong> The frequency of a periodic wave is the number of complete oscillations or cycles that occur per unit time. It is the reciprocal of the period (T). Unit: Hertz (Hz), which is equivalent to cycles per second (s⁻¹).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Radio Wave Frequency Range:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Velocity ($v$) = $299.8 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ (speed of light, c).
                                    Wavelength range: $\lambda_{min} = 100$ m, $\lambda_{max} = 1000$ m.</p>
                                <p>The relationship between velocity, frequency, and wavelength is $v = f \lambda$. Therefore, $f = v / \lambda$.</p>
                                <p>Maximum frequency ($f_{max}$) corresponds to minimum wavelength ($\lambda_{min}$):</p>
                                <p>$f_{max} = \frac{v}{\lambda_{min}} = \frac{299.8 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s}}{100 \text{ m}} = 2.998 \times 10^{6} \text{ Hz} = 2998 \text{ kHz} \approx 3.0 \text{ MHz}$.</p>
                                <p>Minimum frequency ($f_{min}$) corresponds to maximum wavelength ($\lambda_{max}$):</p>
                                <p>$f_{min} = \frac{v}{\lambda_{max}} = \frac{299.8 \times 10^{6} \text{ m/s}}{1000 \text{ m}} = 0.2998 \times 10^{6} \text{ Hz} = 299.8 \text{ kHz} \approx 300 \text{ kHz}$.</p>
                                <p>The corresponding frequency range is approximately **300 kHz to 3.0 MHz**.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Transverse vs. Longitudinal Waves:</strong></p>
                                 <p class="key-point">Addressing the likely intended question about general wave types:</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Distinction:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Transverse Waves:</strong> The oscillations or vibrations of the particles of the medium are perpendicular (at right angles) to the direction of energy transfer (wave propagation). These waves exhibit peaks and troughs.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Longitudinal Waves:</strong> The oscillations or vibrations of the particles of the medium are parallel to the direction of energy transfer (wave propagation). These waves consist of compressions (regions of high density/pressure) and rarefactions (regions of low density/pressure).</li>
                                </ul>
                                 <p>Note: Electromagnetic waves are always transverse; they do not require a medium and consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM):</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Explanation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a specific type of periodic motion where the restoring force acting on the object is directly proportional to the object's displacement from its equilibrium position and is always directed towards that equilibrium position. Mathematically, $F = -kx$, where F is the restoring force, x is the displacement, and k is a positive constant (the force constant). This leads to an acceleration that is also proportional to displacement and oppositely directed ($a = -(k/m)x = -\omega^2 x$).</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Period of Vertical Oscillation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Extension ($x$) = 10 cm = 0.1 m, Mass ($m$) = 50 g = 0.05 kg, $g = 10 \text{ m/s}^2$.</p>
                                <p>First, find the spring constant (k) using Hooke's Law for the static extension: $F = kx$.</p>
                                <p>The force applied is the weight of the mass: $F = mg = 0.05 \text{ kg} \times 10 \text{ m/s}^2 = 0.5 \text{ N}$.</p>
                                <p>$0.5 \text{ N} = k \times 0.1 \text{ m}$</p>
                                <p>$k = 0.5 / 0.1 = 5 \text{ N/m}$.</p>
                                <p>For SHM of a mass-spring system, the angular frequency ($\omega$) is given by $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$.</p>
                                <p>$\omega = \sqrt{5 \text{ N/m} / 0.05 \text{ kg}} = \sqrt{100} = 10 \text{ rad/s}$.</p>
                                <p>The period of oscillation (T) is related to angular frequency by $T = 2\pi / \omega$.</p>
                                <p>$T = 2\pi / 10 = \pi / 5 \text{ s}$.</p>
                                <p>$T \approx 3.14159 / 5 \approx 0.628 \text{ s}$.</p>
                                <p>The period of the vertical oscillations is $\pi/5$ seconds or approximately 0.628 s.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">The question covers basic wave definitions, calculations, wave types, and the dynamics of simple harmonic motion for a mass-spring system.</p>

It depends on the mass and the material of the object. Unit: Joules per Kelvin (J/K) or Joules per degree Celsius (J/°C).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Specific Heat Capacity (c):</strong> The specific heat capacity of a substance is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of unit mass (e.g., 1 kg) of that substance by one degree Celsius (or one Kelvin). It is an intrinsic property of the substance. Unit: Joules per kilogram per Kelvin (J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹) or Joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (J kg⁻¹ °C⁻¹).</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Measure Masses:</strong> Measure the mass of the solid ($m_s$) whose specific heat capacity ($c_s$) is to be determined. Measure the mass of the calorimeter ($m_{cal}$) and stirrer, and the mass of the water ($m_w$) placed in the calorimeter.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Heat the Solid:</strong> Heat the solid in boiling water or a steam chest to a known, constant high temperature ($T_s$, typically $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$). Measure the initial temperature of the water and calorimeter ($T_1$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Transfer and Mix:</strong> Quickly transfer the hot solid into the water in the calorimeter. Stir the mixture gently until a final steady maximum temperature ($T_2$) is reached. Record $T_2$.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Calculations:</strong> Apply the principle of conservation of energy (Heat lost by solid = Heat gained by water + Heat gained by calorimeter), assuming no heat loss to the surroundings.</li>
                                </ol>

                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>Heat lost by solid = $Q_{lost} = m_s \times c_s \times (T_s - T_2)$</p>

                                <p>$m_s c_s (T_s - T_2) = m_w c_w (T_2 - T_1) + C_{cal} (T_2 - T_1)$</p>
                                <p>$m_s c_s (T_s - T_2) = (m_w c_w + C_{cal})(T_2 - T_1)$</p>
                                <p>Rearranging to find $c_s$:</p>
                                <p>$c_s = \frac{(m_w c_w + C_{cal})(T_2 - T_1)}{m_s (T_s - T_2)}$</p>
                                <p>This is the expression for the specific heat capacity of the solid.</p>

                                    <li><strong>First Law:</strong> The mass (m) of a substance liberated or deposited at any electrode during electrolysis is directly proportional to the quantity of electric charge (Q) passed through the electrolyte.

                                    <li><strong>Second Law:</strong> When the same quantity of electric charge (Q) is passed through different electrolytes connected in series, the masses (m) of the different substances liberated or deposited at the electrodes are directly proportional to their chemical equivalent weights (E). Mathematically: $m \propto E$, or $\frac{m_1}{E_1} = \frac{m_2}{E_2} = \dots$ for the same Q. (Equivalent weight E = Molar Mass / Valency).</li>

                                <p>Quantity of charge passed (Q) = $I \times t = 3 \text{ A} \times 7200 \text{ s} = 21600 \text{ C}$.</p>
                                <p>Using Faraday's First Law: Mass deposited/liberated (m) = $z \times Q$.</p>
                                <p>Mass of Hydrogen ($m_H$) = $(0.01044 \times 10^{-6} \text{ kg/C}) \times 21600 \text{ C}$</p>
                                <p>$m_H = 0.0002255 \text{ kg}$</p>
                                <p>$m_H = 0.2255 \text{ g}$ or 225.5 mg.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Archimedes' Principle:</strong></p>
                                <p>When a body is wholly or partially immersed in a fluid (liquid or gas), it experiences an upward buoyant force (upthrust) equal in magnitude to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.</p>

                                </figure>
                                <p>Let the gas pressure be $P_{gas}$ and atmospheric pressure be $P_{atm}$. Let the density of the manometer liquid be $\rho$. Let Level A be the interface between the gas and the liquid in one arm, and Level B be the level of the liquid in the other arm open to the atmosphere. Consider a horizontal level C at the same height as Level A in the other arm.</p>
                                <p>Pressure at Level A = $P_{gas}$.</p>
                                <p>Pressure at Level C = $P_{atm}$ + Pressure due to liquid column of height h (where h is the difference between levels B and A/C).</p>
                                <p>Pressure due to a liquid column of height h and density $\rho$ is given by $P_{liquid} = h \rho g$, where g is the acceleration due to gravity.</p>
                                <p>Since points A and C are at the same horizontal level within the same continuous fluid at rest (or within the context of measuring static pressure differences), the pressures must be equal according to Pascal's principle (applied carefully).</p>
                                 <p>Alternatively, consider balancing pressures at the lower level (Level B in the diagram). Let the level in the gas arm be $h_1$ and the level in the atmospheric arm be $h_2$ relative to some datum. $P_{gas} + \rho g h_1 = P_{atm} + \rho g h_2$. $P_{gas} - P_{atm} = \rho g (h_2 - h_1) = \rho g h$.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, the gauge pressure ($P_{gas} - P_{atm}$) is directly proportional to the height difference (h) and the density ($\rho$) of the liquid column: $P_{gauge} = h \rho g$. This shows pressure depends on height and density.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Impulse:</strong> The change in momentum of an object when a force acts upon it for a certain time interval. It is equal to the product of the average force (F) and the time interval ($\Delta t$) over which the force acts. Impulse is also a vector quantity (Impulse = $F \Delta t = \Delta p$). Unit: Newton-second (N s), which is equivalent to kg m/s.</li>

                                <ul>

Examples: Bushed Pin type flange coupling, Universal coupling (Hooke's joint), Oldham coupling, Gear coupling, Grid coupling, Elastomeric couplings (e.g., Jaw, Tyre).</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) Centrifugal Governor Operation (Steam Engine):</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Operation:</strong></p>
                                <p>A centrifugal governor regulates the mean speed of a steam engine by controlling the steam supply.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The governor spindle is driven by the engine, rotating at a speed proportional to the engine speed.</li>
                                    <li>Rotating masses (flyballs) are attached to arms pivoted on the spindle. As the spindle rotates, centrifugal force ($F_c = mr\omega^2$) acts outwards on the flyballs.</li>
                                    <li>This outward force is balanced by a controlling force (gravity in Watt governors, spring force + gravity in Porter/Proell/Hartnell governors).</li>
                                    <li>If the engine load decreases, the speed increases. The increased centrifugal force overcomes the controlling force, causing the flyballs to move outwards and upwards.</li>
                                    <li>This movement lifts a sleeve on the spindle.</li>
                                    <li>The sleeve's movement is connected via linkages to a throttle valve in the steam supply pipe.</li>
                                    <li>The upward movement of the sleeve partially closes the throttle valve, reducing the steam flow to the engine cylinders.</li>
                                    <li>Reduced steam supply decreases the engine power, causing the speed to drop back towards the set point.</li>
                                    <li>Conversely, if the load increases, speed drops, flyballs move inwards, the sleeve lowers, the throttle valve opens further, increasing steam supply and restoring speed.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Merits of Centrifugal Governors:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Relatively simple construction (especially Watt type).</li>
                                    <li>Reliable operation.</li>
                                    <li>Effective in automatically controlling mean engine speed under varying loads.</li>
                                    <li>Different types available (Watt, Porter, Proell, Hartnell) offering varying sensitivity and power.</li>
                                     <li>(List any two valid merits)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Dynamics Terms:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Moment:</strong> The moment of a force about a point or axis is a measure of its tendency to cause rotation about that point or axis. It is calculated as the product of the magnitude of the force and the perpendicular distance from the point/axis to the line of action of the force. Unit: Newton-meter (N m).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Couple:</strong> A couple consists of two equal, parallel, and opposite forces whose lines of action do not coincide. A couple produces a pure turning effect (moment) without any net translational force. The moment of a couple is calculated as the product of the magnitude of one of the forces and the perpendicular distance between their lines of action. Unit: Newton-meter (N m).</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Derivation of Displacement Equation ($S = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Consider a body moving with uniform acceleration $a$.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Initial velocity = $u$</li>
                                        <li>Final velocity after time $t$ = $v$</li>
                                        <li>Time interval = $t$</li>
                                        <li>Displacement = $S$</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>From the definition of uniform acceleration, the velocity increases linearly with time:</p>
                                <p>$v = u + at \quad$ (Equation 1)</p>
                                <p>Since the acceleration is uniform, the average velocity ($v_{avg}$) during the time interval $t$ is:</p>
                                <p>$v_{avg} = \frac{\text{Initial Velocity + Final Velocity}}{2} = \frac{u + v}{2}$</p>
                                <p>The displacement $S$ is the product of the average velocity and the time interval:</p>
                                <p>$S = v_{avg} \times t = \left(\frac{u + v}{2}\right) t \quad$ (Equation 2)</p>
                                <p>Now, substitute the expression for $v$ from Equation 1 into Equation 2 to eliminate $v$:</p>
                                <p>$S = \left(\frac{u + (u + at)}{2}\right) t$</p>
                                <p>$S = \left(\frac{2u + at}{2}\right) t$</p>
                                <p>$S = \left(u + \frac{1}{2}at\right) t$</p>
                                <p>Distribute the $t$:</p>
                                <p>$S = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$</p>
                                <p>This expression gives the displacement $S$ in terms of initial velocity $u$, acceleration $a$, and time $t$.</p>

It determines the capacitance of a capacitor for a given geometry.

                                         <li>Let V=10V, C=10$\mu$F (example values needed for calculation).</li>

                                 </p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Operation:</strong>
                                When the switch connects the capacitor (C) and resistor (R) in series to the DC voltage source (V), the capacitor begins to charge. Current flows from the source through the resistor into the capacitor. The voltage across the capacitor increases exponentially towards V, and the charging current decreases exponentially towards zero, following the time constant $\tau = RC$. When the switch disconnects the source and connects the capacitor across the resistor, the capacitor discharges through the resistor. The capacitor voltage decreases exponentially towards zero, and the discharge current flows out of the capacitor through the resistor, also decreasing exponentially towards zero with the same time constant $\tau = RC$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Average Current and Power (with assumed values):</strong></p>
                                <p>Assume $V=10V$, $C=10\mu F = 10^{-5} F$.</p>
                                <p>Charge transferred during one full charge cycle: $Q = C \times V = (10^{-5} F) \times (10 V) = 10^{-4} C$.</p>
                                <p>Charge transferred during one full discharge cycle: $Q = 10^{-4} C$.</p>
                                <p>Total charge moved in one complete switching period ($T_{sw} = 0.01$ s) involves one charge and one discharge. If we consider the average current *from the source*, it only flows during charging. If the question means average magnitude of current in the loop, charge Q flows one way then the other.</p>
                                <p>Let's assume average current means the average rate of charge transfer through the switch/circuit.</p>
                                <p>(I) Average Current ($I_{avg}$): In one period $T_{sw}$, charge $Q$ flows during charging and charge $Q$ flows during discharging. If considering magnitude, total charge flow is $2Q$ per period. Average current might be interpreted as $Q/T_{sw}$ (charge per cycle period) or $Q/(T_{sw}/2)$ (charge per charge/discharge phase). A common definition for average current in such switching is total charge per period: $I_{avg} = Q / T_{sw}$.</p>
                                <p>$I_{avg} = \frac{10^{-4} C}{0.01 s} = 0.01 A = 10 mA$. (This represents the average current if the source only charged it 100 times/sec).</p>
                                <p class="key-point">This calculation is highly dependent on interpretation and missing values. The question is poorly formulated.</p>

                                <p>(II) Average Power Dissipated in R ($P_{avg}$): Energy is dissipated in R during both charging and discharging. Energy stored in C is $E_C = \frac{1}{2}CV^2$. This energy is supplied by the source (partially dissipated in R during charging) and then fully dissipated in R during discharging. The energy dissipated in R during one full charge is $\frac{1}{2}CV^2$. The energy dissipated in R during one full discharge is also $\frac{1}{2}CV^2$.</p>
                                <p>Total energy dissipated in R per cycle = $E_{diss, charge} + E_{diss, discharge}$. It can be shown that $E_{diss, charge} = \frac{1}{2}CV^2$. So, Total Energy Dissipated per cycle = $CV^2$.</p>
                                <p>Average Power = Total Energy per cycle / Period = $(CV^2) / T_{sw} = CV^2 f_{sw}$.</p>
                                <p>$P_{avg} = (10^{-5} F) \times (10 V)^2 \times (100 Hz) = (10^{-5}) \times 100 \times 100 = 0.1 W = 100 mW$.</p>
                                <p class="key-point">Again, this depends heavily on assumed values and the exact switching mechanism.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) AC Waveform Factors:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Mean Value (Average Value):</strong> The mean value of an alternating quantity (like voltage or current) over one complete cycle is its average value over that cycle. For a symmetrical waveform like a sine wave, the average value over a full cycle is zero. Therefore, the mean value is usually defined as the average of the instantaneous values taken over *half a cycle*. For a sine wave $i = I_m \sin(\theta)$, the mean value is $I_{avg} = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} I_m \sin(\theta) d\theta = \frac{2}{\pi} I_m \approx 0.637 I_m$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Form Factor and Peak Factor (for Sine Wave):</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>RMS Value ($I_{rms}$):</strong> The Root Mean Square value is the effective value of the AC waveform, equivalent to the DC value that would produce the same heating effect. For a sine wave, $I_{rms} = \frac{I_m}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707 I_m$.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Average Value ($I_{avg}$) (over half cycle):</strong> $I_{avg} = \frac{2}{\pi} I_m \approx 0.637 I_m$.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Peak Value ($I_m$):</strong> The maximum instantaneous value of the waveform.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Form Factor ($K_f$):</strong> The ratio of the RMS value to the average (mean) value.</p>
                                <p>$K_f = \frac{I_{rms}}{I_{avg}} = \frac{I_m / \sqrt{2}}{2I_m / \pi} = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{2}} \approx \frac{3.14159}{2 \times 1.4142} \approx 1.11$.</p>
                                <p><strong>Peak Factor ($K_p$) (or Crest Factor):</strong> The ratio of the peak value to the RMS value.</p>
                                <p>$K_p = \frac{I_m}{I_{rms}} = \frac{I_m}{I_m / \sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$.</p>
                                <p>For a sine wave, Form Factor $\approx 1.11$ and Peak Factor $\approx 1.414$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Faraday's Laws of Electromagnetic Induction:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>First Law:</strong> Whenever the magnetic flux linking a circuit (or coil) changes, an electromotive force (EMF) is induced in the circuit.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Second Law:</strong> The magnitude of the induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic flux linkage. Mathematically: $E \propto \frac{d\Psi}{dt}$ or $E = -N \frac{d\Phi}{dt}$, where $\Psi = N\Phi$ is the flux linkage (N=number of turns, $\Phi$=flux through each turn), and the negative sign (Lenz's Law) indicates the direction of the induced EMF opposes the change causing it.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Derivation of Inductance (L):</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Coil with N turns, carrying current I, on an iron ring with permeability $\mu$, mean length $l$, area $a$, and reluctance $S$.</p>
                                <p>1. Magnetomotive Force (MMF): $F = N \times I$.</p>
                                <p>2. Magnetic Flux ($\Phi$): From the magnetic circuit relationship $F = \Phi \times S$, we have $\Phi = F / S = (N I) / S$.</p>
                                <p>3. Flux Linkage ($\Psi$): Total flux linking the coil is $\Psi = N \times \Phi = N \times \frac{N I}{S} = \frac{N^2 I}{S}$.</p>
                                <p>4. Inductance (L): Inductance is defined as the flux linkage per unit current: $L = \Psi / I$.</p>
                                <p>$L = \frac{(N^2 I / S)}{I} = \frac{N^2}{S}$.</p>
                                <p>We also know that reluctance $S = \frac{l}{\mu a}$. Substituting this into the expression for L:</p>
                                <p>$L = \frac{N^2}{(l / \mu a)} = \frac{N^2 \mu a}{l}$.</p>
                                <p>So, the inductance L can be expressed as $L = N^2/S$ or $L = N^2 \mu a / l$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Series RLC Circuit Resonance:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: $R = 15 \Omega$, $L = 0.04 H$, $V = 240 V$, $f = 50 Hz$. Current and voltage are in phase.</p>
                                <p>Current and voltage being in phase means the circuit is at **resonance**. At resonance, the inductive reactance ($X_L$) equals the capacitive reactance ($X_C$), and the total impedance (Z) is purely resistive ($Z=R$).</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Value of Capacitance C:</strong></p>
                                <p>At resonance, $X_L = X_C$.</p>
                                <p>$X_L = 2 \pi f L = 2 \pi \times 50 \times 0.04 = 4 \pi \approx 12.566 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>$X_C = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}$.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, $12.566 = \frac{1}{2 \pi \times 50 \times C} = \frac{1}{100 \pi C}$.</p>
                                <p>$C = \frac{1}{100 \pi \times 12.566} = \frac{1}{100 \pi \times 4 \pi} = \frac{1}{400 \pi^2}$.</p>
                                <p>$C \approx \frac{1}{400 \times (3.14159)^2} \approx \frac{1}{400 \times 9.8696} \approx \frac{1}{3947.84} \approx 0.0002533 F$.</p>
                                <p>$C \approx 253.3 \times 10^{-6} F = 253.3 \mu F$.</p>

                                <p>At resonance, impedance $Z = R = 15 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>$I = V / Z = V / R = 240 V / 15 \Omega = 16 A$.</p>

                                <p>Power is only dissipated in the resistor.</p>
                                <p>$P = I^2 R = (16 A)^2 \times 15 \Omega = 256 \times 15 = 3840 W$.</p>
                                <p>Alternatively, at resonance, power factor = 1. $P = VI \cos \phi = 240 V \times 16 A \times 1 = 3840 W$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Derivation of Transformer Turns Ratio:</strong></p>
                                <p>Consider an ideal transformer (negligible losses, infinite core permeability, no leakage flux).</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>An alternating voltage $V_p$ applied to the primary winding of $N_p$ turns drives an alternating current, producing an alternating magnetic flux $\Phi$ in the core.</li>
                                    <li>According to Faraday's Law of Induction, this changing flux induces an EMF $E_p$ in the primary winding given by $E_p = -N_p \frac{d\Phi}{dt}$.</li>
                                    <li>For an ideal transformer, the resistance of the primary winding is negligible, so the applied voltage $V_p$ must be equal and opposite to the induced back EMF $E_p$. Therefore, $V_p = -E_p = N_p \frac{d\Phi}{dt}$. (Equation 1)</li>
                                    <li>The same changing flux $\Phi$ links the secondary winding of $N_s$ turns, inducing an EMF $E_s$ given by $E_s = -N_s \frac{d\Phi}{dt}$.</li>
                                    <li>If the secondary is on open circuit (or assuming negligible voltage drop under load for an ideal transformer), the secondary terminal voltage $V_s$ is equal to the induced EMF $E_s$. Therefore, $V_s = E_s = -N_s \frac{d\Phi}{dt}$. (Equation 2)</li>
                                    <li>Divide Equation 2 by Equation 1 (or their magnitudes):</li>
                                    $\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \frac{-N_s \frac{d\Phi}{dt}}{N_p \frac{d\Phi}{dt}} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}$ (Assuming $\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$ is non-zero).
                                    <li>The ratio of the secondary voltage to the primary voltage ($\frac{V_s}{V_p}$) is equal to the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary winding to the number of turns in the primary winding ($\frac{N_s}{N_p}$). This ratio is defined as the **turns ratio (n)** of the transformer.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Turns Ratio $n = \frac{N_s}{N_p} = \frac{V_s}{V_p}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Features of Full-Scale Deflection (FSD) Current ($I_{fsd}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The FSD current refers to the current required to flow through the basic movement (e.g., the coil in a PMMC instrument) to cause the pointer to deflect to the maximum position on the scale.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Sensitivity Indicator:</strong> A lower $I_{fsd}$ generally indicates a more sensitive instrument movement (it requires less current for a full deflection).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Design Parameter:</strong> It is a fundamental characteristic determined by the design of the instrument's moving coil, magnetic field strength, and control spring torque.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Basis for Range Extension:</strong> The value of $I_{fsd}$ (along with the movement's internal resistance $R_m$) is crucial for calculating the required values of shunt resistors (for ammeters) or multiplier resistors (for voltmeters) to extend the instrument's measurement range.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Maximum Current Limit:</strong> It represents the maximum current the basic movement can safely handle without damage.</li>

                                <p><strong>(i) Requirements of a Lead-Acid Cell Separator:</strong></p>
                                <p>The separator is placed between the positive and negative plates to prevent electrical short circuits while allowing the free passage of electrolyte ions.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>High Porosity:</strong> Must allow easy movement of electrolyte (sulphuric acid) and ions between the plates.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Good Electrical Insulation:</strong> Must prevent direct electrical contact between the positive and negative plates.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Chemical Stability:</strong> Must be resistant to attack by the concentrated sulphuric acid electrolyte and the oxidizing/reducing conditions within the cell.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Mechanical Strength:</strong> Must be strong enough to withstand handling during assembly and the vibrations/stresses during cell operation without tearing or puncturing.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Low Ionic Resistance:</strong> Should offer minimal resistance to the flow of ions to keep the cell's internal resistance low.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Prevent Dendrite Growth:</strong> Should inhibit the growth of lead dendrites from the negative plate that could bridge across to the positive plate causing a short circuit.</li>
                                </ul>
