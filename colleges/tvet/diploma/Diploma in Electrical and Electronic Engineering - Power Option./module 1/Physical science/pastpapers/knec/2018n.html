                                <ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Forces acting in the nucleus of an atom:</strong></p>
                                <p>The nucleus contains protons (positively charged) and neutrons (neutral). The primary forces are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Strong Nuclear Force:</strong> This is a very strong, short-range attractive force that acts between nucleons (protons and neutrons). It overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between protons and holds the nucleus together. Its range is typically limited to the size of the nucleus (about $10^{-15}$ m).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Electrostatic Force (Coulomb Force):</strong> This is a repulsive force acting between the positively charged protons. It is weaker than the strong nuclear force at short distances within the nucleus but has an infinite range. It tends to push the protons apart, destabilizing larger nuclei.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Weak Nuclear Force:</strong> This force is responsible for certain types of radioactive decay, such as beta decay, where a neutron can change into a proton (or vice versa). It is much weaker than the strong force and has an even shorter range.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gravitational Force:</strong> Although present between nucleons due to their mass, this force is extremely weak compared to the other nuclear forces and is generally negligible in nuclear physics calculations.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The stability of a nucleus depends on the balance between the attractive strong nuclear force and the repulsive electrostatic force.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Lattice Energy vs. Hydration Energy:</strong></p>
                                <p>When an ionic compound dissolves in a polar solvent like water, two main energy changes occur:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Lattice Energy:</strong> This is the energy *required* (endothermic process, energy absorbed) to completely separate one mole of a solid ionic compound into its gaseous constituent ions. It represents the strength of the ionic bonds holding the crystal lattice together. A high lattice energy means strong ionic bonds.
                                        <br>Example: $NaCl(s) \rightarrow Na^+(g) + Cl^-(g) \quad \Delta H_{lattice} > 0$</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hydration Energy:</strong> This is the energy *released* (exothermic process) when one mole of gaseous ions becomes hydrated (dissolved) in water. Polar water molecules surround the ions, forming ion-dipole interactions. The positive ends (H atoms) of water molecules surround anions, and the negative ends (O atom) surround cations. This process stabilizes the ions in solution.
                                        <br>Example: $Na^+(g) + Cl^-(g) \xrightarrow{H_2O} Na^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq) \quad \Delta H_{hydration} < 0$</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The overall enthalpy change of solution ($\Delta H_{solution}$) depends on the balance between these two: $\Delta H_{solution} = \Delta H_{lattice} + \Delta H_{hydration}$. If hydration energy released is greater than lattice energy absorbed, the dissolution is exothermic. If lattice energy is greater, it's endothermic.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) (i) Balanced chemical equation for complete combustion of methane gas:</strong></p>
                                <p>Methane ($CH_4$) reacts with oxygen ($O_2$) to produce carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and water ($H_2O$).</p>
                                <p>Balanced Equation: $CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(l)$ (or (g) if steam)</p>

                         <br>Let's assume the question implies the 200kg body *alone* is stopped in 3s *after* impacting the 120kg object. The "initial common velocity" might refer to the velocity of the 200kg body *just before* the 3s stopping period begins (which is 60 m/s) or the velocity immediately after collision if they moved together. The wording is ambiguous. Let's calculate the impulse/force based on the 200kg body stopping. (6 marks)

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Shaft Coupling:</strong></p>
                                <p>A shaft coupling is a mechanical device used to connect the ends of two shafts together for the purpose of transmitting power. Couplings allow for connection/disconnection for maintenance, accommodate some misalignment between shafts, and can sometimes provide overload protection or damp vibrations.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Amount of Torque/Power to be transmitted:</strong> The coupling must be strong enough.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Type and Amount of Misalignment:</strong> (Angular, parallel, axial) - Different couplings handle different misalignments (e.g., rigid, flexible, universal joints).</li>

                                    <li><strong>Operating Environment:</strong> Temperature, corrosion, space constraints.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Vibration Damping Requirements:</strong> Some couplings absorb shock/vibration.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Maintenance Requirements:</strong> Ease of installation/removal, lubrication needs.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cost and Availability.</strong></li>
                                    <li>(Any two valid factors)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Collision and Stopping:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Mass 1 ($m_1$) = 200 kg</li>
                                        <li>Initial velocity of $m_1$ ($u_1$) = 60 m/s</li>
                                        <li>Mass 2 ($m_2$) = 120 kg</li>
                                        <li>Initial velocity of $m_2$ ($u_2$) = 0 m/s (stationary)</li>
                                        <li>Stopping time for $m_1$ ($\Delta t$) = 3 s</li>
                                        <li>Final velocity of $m_1$ ($v_1$) = 0 m/s (after 3s)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p class="key-point">Addressing the ambiguity in (b)(i): If "initial common velocity" refers to an inelastic collision where they stick together, we'd use conservation of momentum: $m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v_{common}$. $200(60) + 120(0) = (200+120) v_{common} \implies 12000 = 320 v_{common} \implies v_{common} = 12000/320 = 37.5 \text{ m/s}$. However, this doesn't fit the stopping description well. Let's assume the question meant to ask for the force required to stop the 200kg body and skip the problematic "initial common velocity" interpretation.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) (i) Initial Velocity (Ambiguous):</strong></p>
                                <p>As noted, the term "initial common velocity" is problematic here. The initial velocity of the body being stopped (m1) just before the 3-second interval is 60 m/s. If an inelastic collision occurred first, the common velocity would be 37.5 m/s. Without clarification, this part cannot be answered definitively as intended.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) (ii) Average Impact Force (Stopping Force on $m_1$):</strong></p>
                                <p>We use the impulse-momentum theorem: Impulse = Change in Momentum</p>
                                <p>Average Force ($F_{avg}$) $\times$ time interval ($\Delta t$) = final momentum ($m_1 v_1$) - initial momentum ($m_1 u_1$)</p>
                                <p>$F_{avg} \times 3 = (200 \times 0) - (200 \times 60)$</p>
                                <p>$3 F_{avg} = -12000$</p>
                                <p>$F_{avg} = \frac{-12000}{3} = -4000 \text{ N}$</p>
                                <p>The magnitude of the average impact force required to stop the 200 kg body is 4000 N. The negative sign indicates the force opposes the initial motion.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) (i) Inertia vs. Centrifugal Governors:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Advantages of Inertia Governor over Centrifugal:</strong>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>More sensitive: Responds more quickly to changes in load because it utilizes both centrifugal force and the inertia force due to angular acceleration/deceleration.</li>
                                            <li>Can be designed to be isochronous (maintain constant speed regardless of load) more easily.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                     <li><strong>Disadvantage of Inertia Governor over Centrifugal:</strong>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>More complex construction and potentially less robust.</li>
                                            <li>Balancing can be more difficult.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                     </li>
                                </ul>


                                <p><strong>(c) (ii) Principle of Operation of Centrifugal Governors:</strong></p>
                                <p>A centrifugal governor uses rotating masses (flyballs) connected via arms to a central spindle driven by the engine. As the engine speed increases, the centrifugal force acting on the flyballs ($F_c = m \omega^2 r$) increases, causing them to move outwards and upwards. This movement is transmitted through linkages to a sleeve, which slides along the spindle. The sleeve's movement operates a throttle valve controlling the fuel/steam supply to the engine.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If engine speed increases (due to reduced load), flyballs move out, sleeve moves up, throttle closes slightly, reducing fuel supply and bringing speed down.</li>
                                        <li>If engine speed decreases (due to increased load), flyballs move in, sleeve moves down, throttle opens further, increasing fuel supply and bringing speed up.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                The governor thus attempts to maintain a near-constant engine speed despite load variations by regulating the fuel supply based on speed changes detected via centrifugal force.</p>

                                <p>Since speed is constant, the lifting force ($F_{lift}$) equals the weight of the car.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Parallelogram Law of Coplanar Forces:</strong></p>
                                <p>If two coplanar forces, acting at a point, are represented in magnitude and direction by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram drawn from that point, then their resultant is represented in magnitude and direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram passing through that same point.</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>The vector sum of all forces acting on the body must be zero. (This ensures no translational acceleration). Mathematically, $\sum \vec{F} = 0$, which implies $\sum F_x = 0$ and $\sum F_y = 0$ for components.</li>
                                    <li>The algebraic sum of the moments of all forces about any point in the plane must be zero. (This ensures no rotational acceleration). Mathematically, $\sum M = 0$.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) (i) Centrifugal vs. Centripetal Force:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Centripetal Force:</strong> This is the *real* force acting towards the center of the circular path, required to cause an object to move in a circle (i.e., to provide the centripetal acceleration). It's provided by an external agent (e.g., tension in a string, gravity, friction).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Centrifugal Force:</strong> This is an *apparent* or *fictitious* force experienced by an observer in a rotating (non-inertial) frame of reference. It appears to act outwards from the center of rotation. It's an inertial force, not a real force caused by interaction, but arises from the inertia of the object resisting the change in direction required by circular motion.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) (ii) Centrifuge Machine:</strong></p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Mass (m) = 20 kg (Note: this is mass of milk+cream, force acts on this)</li>
                                        <li>Radius (r) = 80 cm = 0.8 m</li>

                                </p>
                                <p><strong>(I) Angular velocity ($\omega$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Angular velocity $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$</p>
                                <p>$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2} \text{ rad/s}$</p>
                                <p>$\omega \approx 1.57 \text{ rad/s}$</p>

                                <p><strong>(II) Centrifugal force ($F_c$):</strong></p>

                                <p><strong>(i) First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation of Energy):</strong></p>
                                <p>Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. In a thermodynamic process, the change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system ($Q$) minus the work done by the system ($W$). Mathematically: $\Delta U = Q - W$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Second Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy and Direction of Processes):</strong></p>
                                <p>This law defines the direction of spontaneous processes and the concept of entropy. It can be stated in several ways:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>(Clausius Statement): Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body without external work being done.</li>
                                    <li>(Kelvin-Planck Statement): It is impossible to construct a device that operates in a cycle and produces no effect other than the transfer of heat from a single reservoir and the performance of an equivalent amount of work. (i.e., no heat engine can be 100% efficient).</li>
                                    <li>(Entropy Statement): The total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time, or remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state or undergoing a reversible process. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li><strong>Voltage Drop on Load:</strong> The terminal voltage drops significantly when supplying current, especially higher currents, due to relatively high internal resistance.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Not Rechargeable:</strong> It is a primary cell and cannot be reliably recharged once depleted.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Polarization:</strong> Accumulation of hydrogen gas at the carbon electrode increases internal resistance and reduces voltage (though manganese dioxide acts as a depolarizer, it's not perfectly efficient).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Limited Shelf Life:</strong> Chemical reactions continue slowly even when not in use, leading to self-discharge and potential leakage.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Leakage Risk:</strong> The zinc casing can corrode, especially after discharge, leading to leakage of corrosive electrolyte (ammonium chloride paste).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Poor Low-Temperature Performance:</strong> Efficiency decreases significantly at low temperatures.</li>

                                <p><strong>(b) Battery Charging Methods:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Booster Charging:</strong></p>
                                <p>This method involves charging a battery at a relatively high current for a short period. It is typically used to quickly recharge a significantly discharged battery (like a car battery) to a usable state, but not necessarily to full capacity. It often requires careful monitoring to avoid overheating or damaging the battery due to the high current.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Trickle Charging:</strong></p>
                                <p>This method involves charging a battery at a very low current, often just enough to counteract its natural self-discharge rate. It is used to maintain a fully charged battery at its optimal charge level over long periods of inactivity or storage. It helps prevent sulfation (in lead-acid batteries) and keeps the battery ready for use without overcharging.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Superposition Theorem Application:</strong></p>

                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question explores the relationship between resistance and temperature, and the practical considerations of voltmeter measurements (loading effect).</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Temperature Coefficient of Resistance ($\alpha$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The temperature coefficient of resistance of a conductor is defined as the fractional change in resistance per degree Celsius (or Kelvin) change in temperature, usually referred to a specific base temperature (often $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$). It quantifies how much the resistance of a material changes with temperature.</p>
                                <p>Mathematically: $\alpha_{T_0} = \frac{R_T - R_{T_0}}{R_{T_0}(T - T_0)}$, where $R_T$ is resistance at temp T, $R_{T_0}$ is resistance at base temp $T_0$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) (ii) Effect of Temperature Change on Conductivity:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Conductors (Metals):</strong> As temperature increases, the atoms/ions in the metallic lattice vibrate more vigorously. This increased thermal vibration impedes the flow of free electrons (charge carriers), increasing the frequency of collisions. Consequently, resistance increases, and electrical conductivity ($\sigma = 1/\rho$, where $\rho$ is resistivity) *decreases* with increasing temperature. They have a positive temperature coefficient of resistance.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Semiconductors and Insulators:</strong> As temperature increases, more electrons gain enough thermal energy to jump from the valence band to the conduction band (or break free from bonds), increasing the number of available charge carriers (electrons and holes). Although lattice vibrations also increase, the effect of increased carrier concentration usually dominates. Therefore, resistance *decreases*, and conductivity *increases* with increasing temperature. They generally have a negative temperature coefficient of resistance.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Resistance Calculation for Copper Coil:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Resistance at $T_1 = 20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($R_{20}$) = $200 \Omega$</li>
                                        <li>Temperature coefficient at $T_0 = 0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($\alpha_0$) = $0.0043 /{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</li>
                                        <li>Final temperature ($T_2$) = $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>We use the formula relating resistance at different temperatures based on $\alpha_0$: $R_T = R_0 (1 + \alpha_0 T)$</p>
                                <p>First, find the resistance at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($R_0$) using the resistance at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$:</p>
                                <p>$R_{20} = R_0 (1 + \alpha_0 \times 20)$</p>
                                <p>$200 = R_0 (1 + 0.0043 \times 20)$</p>
                                <p>$200 = R_0 (1 + 0.086)$</p>
                                <p>$200 = R_0 (1.086)$</p>
                                <p>$R_0 = \frac{200}{1.086} \approx 184.16 \Omega$</p>
                                <p>Now, find the resistance at $T_2 = 45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ($R_{45}$):</p>
                                <p>$R_{45} = R_0 (1 + \alpha_0 \times 45)$</p>
                                <p>$R_{45} = 184.16 (1 + 0.0043 \times 45)$</p>
                                <p>$R_{45} = 184.16 (1 + 0.1935)$</p>
                                <p>$R_{45} = 184.16 (1.1935) \approx 219.81 \Omega$</p>
                                <p>Alternatively, using the formula $R_2 = R_1 \frac{1 + \alpha_0 T_2}{1 + \alpha_0 T_1}$:</p>
                                <p>$R_{45} = R_{20} \frac{1 + \alpha_0 (45)}{1 + \alpha_0 (20)} = 200 \times \frac{1 + 0.0043 \times 45}{1 + 0.0043 \times 20}$</p>
                                <p>$R_{45} = 200 \times \frac{1 + 0.1935}{1 + 0.086} = 200 \times \frac{1.1935}{1.086} \approx 200 \times 1.099 \approx 219.8 \Omega$</p>
                                <p>The resistance at $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is approximately $219.8 \Omega$.</p>


                                <p><strong>(c) (i) Loading Effect of a Voltmeter:</strong></p>
                                <p>The loading effect occurs when connecting a voltmeter across a component in a circuit changes the circuit's conditions (specifically, the equivalent resistance across which the voltage is measured), causing the measured voltage to be different from the actual voltage present before the voltmeter was connected. This happens because a practical voltmeter has a finite internal resistance and draws some current from the circuit.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) (ii) Alteration and Minimization:</strong></p>
                                <p>(I) Alteration: The voltmeter, having finite resistance, provides an additional path for current when connected in parallel. This reduces the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination compared to the component's resistance alone. This change in resistance alters the voltage distribution in the circuit, typically causing the voltmeter to read a *lower* voltage than the actual voltage across the component when the meter is absent.</p>
                                <p>(II) Minimization: The loading effect can be minimized by using a voltmeter with a very high internal resistance compared to the resistance of the component across which the voltage is being measured. Ideally, an infinite internal resistance would eliminate the loading effect entirely. Digital voltmeters (DVMs) generally have much higher input resistance than analog voltmeters, thus minimizing loading.</p>

                         <p class="key-point">Note: The field strength of 750 A/m is likely the field strength in the *magnetic material*, not the air gap, as air gap field strength would be $B/\mu_0$. Assuming 750 A/m is $H_{material}$. Also, the diagram shows an air gap, but its length is not given. Assuming the 25cm is the *total* mean length including the gap, or just the iron path? Let's assume 25cm is the iron path length $l_m$, and we need the air gap length $l_g$ from the diagram. The diagram does not explicitly label the gap length. Let's assume the gap length is small, e.g., 1mm, based on typical proportions, or try to solve without it if possible. The question seems incomplete without $l_g$ or relative permeability $\mu_r$ of the material. Let's re-read: "Flux density *in the air gap* is 0.8T". "Field strength *is* 750 A/m" - this is ambiguous. Let's assume $H_{material}=750$ A/m and $B_{gap}=0.8$T. Since flux is continuous, $B_{material} \approx B_{gap}=0.8$T (neglecting fringing). We can find $\mu_r$ from $B = \mu_0 \mu_r H$. Still need $l_g$ for total reluctance/MMF. Let's assume the 25 cm is the iron path length and $l_g$ is needed but missing.

                                    <li><strong>Improved Voltage Regulation:</strong> Lower current reduces voltage drops in transmission and distribution lines, leading to better voltage stability at the load.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Increased System Capacity:</strong> Lower current frees up capacity in generators, transformers, and cables, allowing them to serve more real power load without being overloaded by reactive current.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lower Electricity Bills:</strong> Many utilities penalize industrial/commercial consumers for low power factors or offer incentives for high power factors due to the benefits listed above.</li>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers impedance matching using transformers, auto-transformer construction, and analysis of capacitor networks.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) (i) Resistance Matching (Impedance Matching):</strong></p>
                                <p>Resistance matching (more generally, impedance matching) is the practice of designing the input impedance of an electrical load or the output impedance of its corresponding signal source to maximize the power transfer or minimize signal reflection. For maximum power transfer between a source and a load, the load resistance (or impedance) should be equal to the complex conjugate of the source resistance (or impedance). In simpler DC or purely resistive AC circuits, this means making the load resistance equal to the source resistance.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) (ii) Transformer for Resistance Matching:</strong></p>
                                <p>A transformer can change the apparent impedance of a load as seen by the source. The impedance ratio of an ideal transformer is related to the square of its turns ratio ($n = N_s/N_p$). If a load resistance $R_L$ is connected to the secondary winding, the impedance seen looking into the primary winding ($Z_p$) is given by:</p>
                                <p>$Z_p = \left(\frac{N_p}{N_s}\right)^2 R_L = \left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2 R_L$</p>
                                <p>By choosing the appropriate turns ratio ($N_p/N_s$), the transformer can make the load impedance $R_L$ *appear* to the source as a different impedance $Z_p$. This allows matching the load to the source impedance for maximum power transfer. For example, matching a low-impedance speaker to a high-impedance amplifier output.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Auto-transformer Construction:</strong></p>

                                </figure>
                                <p>An auto-transformer consists of a single continuous winding wound on a laminated iron core. Unlike a conventional two-winding transformer, the primary and secondary circuits share a common part of the winding.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Winding:</strong> A single coil of insulated copper wire wound around the core.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Core:</strong> Made of laminated silicon steel to reduce eddy currents and hysteresis losses.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Terminals:</strong> There are at least three terminals. Two terminals (A and B) connect to the input supply (primary voltage $V_p$) across the entire winding ($N_p$ turns). One of these terminals (B) is common to both input and output. The third terminal (C) is a tap on the winding, and the output (secondary voltage $V_s$) is taken between the common terminal (B) and the tap (C) ($N_s$ turns).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Operation:</strong> Voltage is induced in the winding by the alternating primary current. The voltage per turn is approximately constant along the winding. By tapping the winding at different points, different output voltages can be obtained (either step-up or step-down relative to the input, depending on whether the output uses more or fewer turns than the input). Part of the power is transferred conductively (due to the shared winding) and part inductively.</li>

                                <p><strong>(c) Series-Parallel Capacitor Circuit:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Capacitors X, Y, Z are identical. Let their capacitance be C.</li>
                                        <li>Total equivalent capacitance ($C_{eq}$) = $2.4 \mu F$</li>
                                        <li>Supply Voltage ($V_S$) = 100 V</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>Circuit configuration: Y and Z are in parallel, and this combination is in series with X.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Value of capacitor X (which is C):</strong></p>
                                <p>Capacitance of the parallel combination of Y and Z ($C_{YZ}$):</p>
                                <p>$C_{YZ} = C_Y + C_Z = C + C = 2C$</p>
                                <p>This parallel combination ($C_{YZ}$) is in series with X ($C_X = C$).</p>
                                <p>The total equivalent capacitance ($C_{eq}$) is given by:</p>
                                <p>$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_X} + \frac{1}{C_{YZ}}$</p>
                                <p>$\frac{1}{2.4} = \frac{1}{C} + \frac{1}{2C}$</p>
                                <p>Find a common denominator for the right side:</p>
                                <p>$\frac{1}{2.4} = \frac{2}{2C} + \frac{1}{2C} = \frac{3}{2C}$</p>
                                <p>Now solve for C:</p>
                                <p>$2C = 3 \times 2.4$</p>
                                <p>$2C = 7.2$</p>
                                <p>$C = \frac{7.2}{2} = 3.6 \mu F$</p>
                                <p>Since X, Y, and Z are identical, the value of capacitor X is $C_X = C = 3.6 \mu F$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Voltage across capacitor Y ($V_Y$):</strong></p>
                                <p>First, find the total charge supplied by the source ($Q_{total}$).</p>
                                <p>$Q_{total} = C_{eq} \times V_S = 2.4 \mu F \times 100 V = 240 \mu C$</p>
                                <p>In a series circuit, the charge is the same on each series component. So, the charge on capacitor X ($Q_X$) is $240 \mu C$, and the charge on the parallel combination YZ ($Q_{YZ}$) is also $240 \mu C$.</p>
                                <p>The voltage across the parallel combination ($V_{YZ}$) is:</p>
                                <p>$V_{YZ} = \frac{Q_{YZ}}{C_{YZ}} = \frac{240 \mu C}{2C} = \frac{240 \mu C}{2 \times 3.6 \mu F} = \frac{240}{7.2} \approx 33.33 \text{ V}$</p>
                                <p>Since Y and Z are in parallel, the voltage across Y is the same as the voltage across Z, which is equal to the voltage across the parallel combination.</p>
                                <p>$V_Y = V_Z = V_{YZ} \approx 33.33 \text{ V}$</p>
                                <p>Alternatively, find voltage across X: $V_X = Q_X / C_X = 240 \mu C / 3.6 \mu F \approx 66.67$ V. Then $V_{YZ} = V_S - V_X = 100 - 66.67 = 33.33$ V. So $V_Y = 33.33$ V.</p>

                                <p class="answer-conclusion">Capacitor X has a value of 3.6 $\mu$F. The voltage across capacitor Y is approximately 33.33 V.</p>
