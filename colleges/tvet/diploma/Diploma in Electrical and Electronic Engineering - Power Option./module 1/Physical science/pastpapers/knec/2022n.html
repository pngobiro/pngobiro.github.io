                                <p><strong>(a) Radioactivity Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Half-life ($T_{1/2}$):</strong> The time taken for half of the radioactive nuclei in a given sample to undergo decay, or the time taken for the activity of the sample to reduce to half its initial value.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Nuclear Fission:</strong> The process by which a heavy, unstable atomic nucleus (like Uranium-235) splits into two or more smaller nuclei (fission fragments), typically releasing a large amount of energy, neutrons, and gamma rays.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Hess's Law, Acids, and Bonding:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Statements:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Hess's Law:</strong> The total enthalpy change for a chemical reaction is independent of the pathway taken, depending only on the initial and final states. (If a reaction can occur in multiple steps, the sum of the enthalpy changes for the individual steps equals the enthalpy change for the overall reaction).</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Properties of Acids:</strong>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Sour taste.</li>
                                            <li>Turn blue litmus red.</li>
                                            <li>React with bases to form salt and water (neutralization).</li>
                                            <li>React with active metals to produce hydrogen gas.</li>
                                            <li>React with carbonates/bicarbonates to produce carbon dioxide.</li>
                                            <li>Have a pH less than 7.</li>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Ionic vs. Covalent Bonding:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Ionic Bonding:</strong> Involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, formed by the complete *transfer* of one or more electrons from a metal atom (forming a positive cation) to a non-metal atom (forming a negative anion). Typically occurs between elements with large differences in electronegativity. Forms ionic lattices. Example: NaCl (Na⁺ Cl⁻).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Covalent Bonding:</strong> Involves the *sharing* of one or more pairs of electrons between two atoms (usually non-metals) to achieve stable electron configurations. The shared electron pair is attracted to both nuclei, holding the atoms together. Forms discrete molecules or covalent network structures. Example: H₂, Cl₂, H₂O, CH₄.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Simple Harmonic Motion Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>The velocity (v) in SHM is related to displacement (x), amplitude (A), and angular velocity ($\omega$) by: $v^2 = \omega^2 (A^2 - x^2)$.</p>
                                <p>Given two points:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>When $x_1 = 0.75$ m, $v_1 = 11$ m/s.</li>
                                    <li>When $x_2 = 2$ m, $v_2 = 3$ m/s.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Substitute into the equation:</p>
                                <p>$11^2 = \omega^2 (A^2 - 0.75^2) \implies 121 = \omega^2 (A^2 - 0.5625)$ (Eq 1)</p>
                                <p>$3^2 = \omega^2 (A^2 - 2^2) \implies 9 = \omega^2 (A^2 - 4)$ (Eq 2)</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Amplitude (A):</strong></p>
                                <p>Divide Eq 1 by Eq 2 to eliminate $\omega^2$:</p>
                                <p>$\frac{121}{9} = \frac{\omega^2 (A^2 - 0.5625)}{\omega^2 (A^2 - 4)} = \frac{A^2 - 0.5625}{A^2 - 4}$</p>
                                <p>$121 (A^2 - 4) = 9 (A^2 - 0.5625)$</p>
                                <p>$121 A^2 - 484 = 9 A^2 - 5.0625$</p>
                                <p>$121 A^2 - 9 A^2 = 484 - 5.0625$</p>
                                <p>$112 A^2 = 478.9375$</p>
                                <p>$A^2 = 478.9375 / 112 \approx 4.2762$</p>
                                <p>$A = \sqrt{4.2762} \approx 2.068$ m.</p>
                                <p>Amplitude $A \approx 2.07$ m.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Angular Velocity ($\omega$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Substitute $A^2$ back into Eq 2:</p>
                                <p>$9 = \omega^2 (4.2762 - 4)$</p>
                                <p>$9 = \omega^2 (0.2762)$</p>
                                <p>$\omega^2 = 9 / 0.2762 \approx 32.585$</p>
                                <p>$\omega = \sqrt{32.585} \approx 5.708$ rad/s.</p>
                                <p>Angular velocity $\omega \approx 5.71$ rad/s.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Periodic Time (T):</strong></p>
                                <p>$T = 2\pi / \omega = 2\pi / 5.708 \approx 1.101$ s.</p>
                                <p>Periodic Time $T \approx 1.10$ s.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Specific Heat Capacity and Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Definition:</strong> Specific heat capacity (c) of a substance is the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of unit mass (1 kg) of that substance by one degree Celsius (or one Kelvin). Unit: J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹ or J kg⁻¹ °C⁻¹.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Heat Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Mass of copper ($m_{Cu}$) = 500 g = 0.5 kg.</p>
                                <p>Volume of water = 1 litre $\implies$ Mass of water ($m_w$) = 1 kg.</p>
                                <p>Initial temperature ($T_1$) = 20°C.</p>
                                <p>Final temperature (boiling point, $T_2$) = 100°C.</p>
                                <p>Temperature change ($\Delta T$) = $T_2 - T_1 = 100 - 20 = 80$ °C (or 80 K).</p>

                                <p>Heat required = Heat absorbed by copper + Heat absorbed by water.</p>
                                <p>$Q_{total} = (m_{Cu} c_{Cu} \Delta T) + (m_w c_w \Delta T)$.</p>
                                <p>$Q_{total} = (0.5 \times 390 \times 80) + (1 \times 4200 \times 80)$.</p>
                                <p>$Q_{total} = (15600) + (336000) = 351600$ J.</p>
                                <p>Quantity of heat required = 351,600 J or 351.6 kJ.</p>

                                <p>Principle: Detection of ionizing radiation through gas ionization and subsequent avalanche discharge.</p>
                                <p>Operation:
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> A GM tube consists of a metal cylinder (cathode) filled with a low-pressure inert gas (like Argon or Neon) mixed with a small amount of quenching agent (e.g., halogen gas or organic vapor). A fine wire runs along the axis of the cylinder, acting as the anode. A high DC voltage (several hundred volts) is applied between the anode and cathode, creating a strong electric field near the anode wire. One end often has a thin window (e.g., mica) to allow radiation to enter.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ionization:</strong> When ionizing radiation (alpha, beta, or gamma) enters the tube through the window, it collides with gas atoms, knocking out electrons and creating ion pairs (positive ions and free electrons).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Electron Acceleration & Avalanche:</strong> The strong electric field accelerates the free electrons towards the central anode wire. As these electrons gain energy and move towards the anode, they collide with other gas atoms, causing further ionization. This creates more electrons, which are also accelerated and cause more ionization. This rapid multiplication of electrons is called a Townsend avalanche or gas multiplication.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Discharge and Pulse Formation:</strong> The avalanche results in a large number of electrons reaching the anode wire almost simultaneously, creating a short, sharp pulse of current. This current pulse flows through an external resistor (R), producing a detectable voltage pulse across it.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Positive Ion Movement & Quenching:</strong> The heavier positive ions drift more slowly towards the cathode cylinder. As they near the cathode, they could potentially cause secondary electron emission, leading to continuous discharge. The quenching agent (halogen or organic vapor) absorbs the energy of the positive ions or photons emitted during recombination, preventing secondary avalanches and ensuring the discharge stops after the initial pulse. This allows the tube to recover and detect the next incoming particle.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Counting:</strong> Each voltage pulse generated corresponds to one detected radiation particle/photon. These pulses are sent to an electronic counter (scaler or ratemeter) which records the number of events per unit time (count rate).</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(a) Rotational Motion:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Angular Velocity ($\omega$):</strong> The rate of change of angular displacement ($\theta$) with respect to time ($t$). It describes how fast an object is rotating or revolving. Unit: radians per second (rad/s).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Radius (r) = 20 m, Time interval ($\Delta t$) = 1 s, Angular displacement ($\Delta \theta$) = $36^{\circ}$.</p>
                                <p>Convert angular displacement to radians: $\Delta \theta = 36^{\circ} \times (\pi / 180^{\circ}) = \pi/5$ radians.</p>
                                <p><strong>(I) Average Angular Velocity ($\omega_{avg}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>$\omega_{avg} = \Delta \theta / \Delta t = (\pi/5 \text{ rad}) / (1 \text{ s}) = \pi/5$ rad/s.</p>
                                <p>$\omega_{avg} \approx 0.628$ rad/s.</p>

                                <p>Linear velocity (speed) is related to angular velocity by $v = r \omega$.</p>

                                <p>$v \approx 12.57$ m/s.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Laws and Impulse:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Statements:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Hooke's Law:</strong> Provided the elastic limit is not exceeded, the extension (or compression) of an elastic material is directly proportional to the applied force (load). $F = kx$, where k is the spring constant.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Newton's Second Law of Motion:</strong> The rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on it and takes place in the direction of the force ($F_{net} = d(mv)/dt$). If mass is constant, $F_{net} = ma$.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Average Impulse Force:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Mass (m) = 8 kg.</p>
                                <p>Velocity just before impact ($u$) = -10 m/s (assuming downwards is negative).</p>
                                <p>Velocity just after impact ($v$) = +6 m/s (bounces back upwards).</p>
                                <p>Contact time ($\Delta t$) = 40 milliseconds = $40 \times 10^{-3} = 0.040$ s.</p>
                                <p>Impulse (J) = Change in momentum ($\Delta p$) = $mv - mu$.</p>
                                <p>$\Delta p = (8 \text{ kg})(+6 \text{ m/s}) - (8 \text{ kg})(-10 \text{ m/s})$.</p>
                                <p>$\Delta p = 48 - (-80) = 48 + 80 = 128$ kg m/s (upwards).</p>
                                <p>Impulse (J) = Average Force ($F_{avg}$) $\times$ Time ($\Delta t$).</p>
                                <p>$F_{avg} = \Delta p / \Delta t = (128 \text{ kg m/s}) / (0.040 \text{ s}) = 3200$ N.</p>
                                <p>The average impulse force exerted *by the plane on the mass* is 3200 N (upwards).</p>
                                <p>(The average impulse force exerted *by the mass on the plane* would be equal and opposite: 3200 N downwards, by Newton's Third Law).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Thermodynamics:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) First Law of Thermodynamics:</strong> Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. In a thermodynamic process, the change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) of a system equals the heat added to the system ($Q$) minus the work done by the system ($W$). $\Delta U = Q - W$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Explanation of Terms:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Enthalpy (H):</strong> Enthalpy is a thermodynamic property of a system, defined as the sum of the system's internal energy (U) and the product of its pressure (P) and volume (V). $H = U + PV$. It represents the total heat content of the system at constant pressure. Changes in enthalpy ($\Delta H$) are particularly useful for analyzing processes occurring at constant pressure, as $\Delta H$ then equals the heat added or removed ($Q_p = \Delta H$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Entropy (S):</strong> Entropy is a measure of the randomness, disorder, or unavailability of energy within a system. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time or remain constant in ideal reversible processes; it never decreases. Entropy change ($\Delta S$) is related to reversible heat transfer (Q) and absolute temperature (T) by $dS = dQ_{rev}/T$. It indicates the direction of spontaneous processes (which proceed towards higher entropy) and the limit on the efficiency of converting heat into work.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Principle: Based on the tendency of a flattened, curved tube to straighten when subjected to internal pressure.</p>
                                <p>Operation:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The gauge consists of a C-shaped or coiled tube (Bourdon tube) made of metal (e.g., brass, steel) with a flattened or elliptical cross-section. One end of the tube is fixed to a socket connected to the pressure source. The other end is sealed and free to move.</li>
                                    <li>When fluid pressure is applied to the inlet, it fills the Bourdon tube.</li>
                                    <li>The pressure acting on the inner curved surface of the flattened tube tends to make the tube's cross-section more circular.</li>
                                    <li>This change in cross-section causes the curved tube to uncurl or straighten slightly.</li>
                                    <li>The movement of the free, sealed end of the tube is small but definite.</li>
                                    <li>This movement is mechanically amplified through a system of linkages (connecting link, sector gear) and a pinion gear.</li>
                                    <li>The pinion gear rotates a pointer over a calibrated dial scale, indicating the applied pressure.</li>
                                    <li>When the pressure is removed, the tube returns to its original shape due to its elasticity, and the pointer returns to zero.</li>
                                </ol>
                                Used commonly for measuring gauge pressure of liquids and gases.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Moment and Torque Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Moment:</strong> The turning effect of a force about a specific point or axis. It is calculated as the product of the force magnitude and the perpendicular distance from the point/axis to the line of action of the force. Unit: Nm.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Torque:</strong> Torque is essentially a moment that tends to cause rotation or torsion. It is often used specifically in the context of rotation about an axis (e.g., torque on a shaft) or the moment produced by a couple. The terms moment and torque are often used interchangeably, but torque emphasizes the rotational aspect. Unit: Nm.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Beam Reactions (Fig 1):</strong></p>
                                <p>Total length = 8 m. Supports at A and B.</p>
                                <p>Loads: 600N at 2m from A, 800N at 2+3=5m from A, 400N at 5+2=7m from A.</p>
                                <p>Let $R_A$ and $R_B$ be the upward reactions at A and B.</p>
                                <p>Vertical Equilibrium: $\sum F_y = 0$.</p>
                                <p>$R_A + R_B = 600 + 800 + 400 = 1800$ N. (Eq 1)</p>
                                <p>Rotational Equilibrium: Take moments about A ($\sum M_A = 0$). Assume clockwise is positive.</p>
                                <p>Moments due to loads (clockwise):</p>
                                <p>$(600 N \times 2 m) + (800 N \times 5 m) + (400 N \times 7 m)$</p>
                                <p>$= 1200 + 4000 + 2800 = 8000$ Nm.</p>
                                <p>Moment due to $R_B$ (anticlockwise):</p>
                                <p>$-(R_B \times 8 m)$.</p>
                                <p>Equating moments: $8000 - 8 R_B = 0$.</p>
                                <p>$8 R_B = 8000 \implies R_B = 1000$ N.</p>
                                <p>Substitute $R_B$ into Eq 1:</p>
                                <p>$R_A + 1000 = 1800 \implies R_A = 800$ N.</p>
                                <p>Reactions: $R_A = 800$ N, $R_B = 1000$ N.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Force System Distinctions:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Equilibrium vs. Equilibrant:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Equilibrium:</strong> A state where the net force and net moment acting on a body are both zero, resulting in no change in its linear or rotational motion (i.e., zero acceleration).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Equilibrant:</strong> A single force that, if added to a system of forces, produces equilibrium. The equilibrant is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the *resultant* of the original system of forces.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Coplanar vs. Concurrent:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Coplanar Forces:</strong> A system of forces whose lines of action all lie within the same two-dimensional plane.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Concurrent Forces:</strong> A system of forces whose lines of action all intersect at a single common point.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>(Forces can be coplanar and concurrent, coplanar but not concurrent, concurrent but not coplanar, or neither).</p>

Operation:
- Current I flows through the fixed Field Coil.
- This creates a magnetic field proportional to I.
- The magnetic field attracts the pivoted soft iron vane/disc towards the stronger field region inside the coil.
- This attraction creates a torque causing the vane (and pointer) to rotate.
- Rotation occurs against the controlling torque of a spring.
- Deflection depends on the strength of the field (proportional to I or I^2 depending on saturation), resulting in a non-linear scale.
- Damping (e.g., air damping) makes the pointer settle.

                                    <li>This attractive force creates a deflecting torque on the spindle, causing it (and the attached pointer) to rotate.</li>
                                    <li>The rotation continues until the deflecting torque is balanced by the controlling torque from hairsprings.</li>
                                    <li>The deflecting torque is approximately proportional to the square of the current ($T_d \propto B \propto I$, Force $\propto B^2 \propto I^2$ - complex relation, often $T_d \propto I^2$), resulting in a non-linear scale (cramped at the low end).

                                    <li><strong>Initial Magnetization (O to Saturation):</strong> Starting with unmagnetized ferromagnetic material (O), applying an increasing magnetizing field (H) causes the magnetic domains to align, increasing flux density (B) along the initial curve until saturation (+B_sat) is reached, where further increase in H produces little increase in B.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Decreasing H (Saturation to Remanence):</strong> As H is reduced to zero, B does not return to zero but retains a value $B_{rem}$ (Remanence or Retentivity). This lagging of B behind H is hysteresis. $B_{rem}$ represents the residual magnetism.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reversing H (Remanence to Coercivity):</strong> Applying H in the reverse (negative) direction is required to reduce B to zero. The value of H needed to achieve this is the Coercive Force ($-H_c$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Negative Saturation:</strong> Increasing H further in the negative direction leads to saturation in the opposite direction ($-B_{sat}$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Completing the Loop:</strong> Reducing the negative H back to zero leaves a negative remanence ($-B_{rem}$). Applying a positive field H brings B back to zero at $+H_c$ and then back to positive saturation, completing the loop.</li>
                                </ol>
                                The area enclosed by the hysteresis loop represents the energy lost as heat per unit volume of the material per cycle of magnetization. Materials for permanent magnets require high $B_{rem}$ and high $H_c$ (wide loop). Materials for transformer cores require low $B_{rem}$ and low $H_c$ (narrow loop) to minimize energy loss.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Magnetic Circuit Analysis (Fig 3):</strong></p>
                                 <p class="key-point">The diagram (Figure 3) is missing from the provided text. Calculations for reluctance, flux, and flux density require the geometric dimensions (lengths $l_1, l_2, l_3$, areas $A_1, A_2, A_3$) of the different paths and any air gap length ($l_g$), as well as the current (I) in the coil.</p>
                                <p><strong>General Process (if diagram was available):</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Identify all distinct magnetic paths (e.g., path 1, path 2, path 3, air gap).</li>
                                    <li>Calculate the reluctance (S) for each path using $S = l / (\mu_0 \mu_r A)$. Use $\mu_r = 750$ for cast steel paths and $\mu_r = 1$ for air gaps.</li>
                                    <li>Combine reluctances based on the circuit configuration (series/parallel) to find the total reluctance $S_{total}$. (Magnetic circuits often resemble parallel electric circuits).</li>
                                    <li>Calculate the total Magnetomotive Force (MMF) provided by the coil: $F = NI = 200 \times I$. (Need current I).</li>
                                    <li>Calculate the total flux using the magnetic equivalent of Ohm's law: $\Phi_{total} = F / S_{total}$.</li>
                                    <li>If paths are in parallel, use the MMF divider rule (analogous to current divider) or calculate MMF drop across parallel section and find flux in each branch ($\Phi = F_{branch} / S_{branch}$). Total flux usually refers to the flux in the path containing the coil.</li>
                                    <li>Calculate flux density in path 2 using $B_2 = \Phi_2 / A_2$, where $\Phi_2$ is the flux flowing through path 2 and $A_2$ is its cross-sectional area.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Without the diagram and current value, this part cannot be solved numerically.</p>

                                <p>Principle: **Mutual Induction**.</p>
                                <p>Operation:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>An alternating voltage ($V_p$) applied to the primary winding ($N_p$ turns) drives an alternating current ($I_p$) through it.</li>
                                    <li>This alternating primary current produces a time-varying magnetic flux ($\Phi$) that is concentrated and guided through the laminated iron core.</li>
                                    <li>According to Faraday's Law of Induction, this changing magnetic flux links the secondary winding ($N_s$ turns) and induces an alternating electromotive force (EMF, $E_s$) across it. ($E_s = -N_s d\Phi/dt$).</li>
                                    <li>The same changing flux also induces a back EMF ($E_p$) in the primary winding ($E_p = -N_p d\Phi/dt$), which opposes the applied voltage $V_p$.</li>
                                    <li>The ratio of the induced EMFs (and approximately the terminal voltages in an ideal transformer) is equal to the ratio of the number of turns: $E_s/E_p = V_s/V_p = N_s/N_p$. This allows voltage to be stepped up ($N_s > N_p$) or stepped down ($N_s < N_p$).</li>
                                    <li>When a load is connected to the secondary, the induced EMF $E_s$ drives a secondary current $I_s$. This current creates its own magnetic flux which opposes the primary flux. To maintain the flux, the primary draws an additional current from the supply such that power is transferred from primary to secondary ($V_p I_p \approx V_s I_s$ ideally).</li>
                                </ol>
                                Energy is transferred from the primary to the secondary circuit via the magnetic field, without a direct electrical connection.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Electric Flux Density (D):</strong></p>
                                <p>Electric flux density (or electric displacement field) is a vector field that represents the density of electric flux lines passing through a unit area perpendicular to the field. In a dielectric medium, it is related to the electric field intensity (E) and the permittivity of the medium ($\epsilon$) by $D = \epsilon E$. In free space, $D = \epsilon_0 E$. Its magnitude is equal to the charge per unit area on the plates of a capacitor (if the field is uniform).</p>
                                <p>Unit: Coulombs per square meter (C/m²).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Series Capacitor Circuit:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: $C_1 = 3 \mu F$, $C_2 = 6 \mu F$, $C_3 = 12 \mu F$. Connected in series.</p>
                                <p>Supply voltage ($V_S$) = 350 V.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Equivalent Circuit Capacitance ($C_{eq}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>For capacitors in series: $\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{1}{C_3}$.</p>
                                <p>$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{12}$ (working in $\mu F$).</p>
                                <p>Common denominator is 12: $\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{4}{12} + \frac{2}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{7}{12}$.</p>
                                <p>$C_{eq} = \frac{12}{7} \mu F \approx 1.714 \mu F$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Charge on the $12 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ capacitor ($Q_3$):</strong></p>
                                <p>In a series circuit, the charge stored on each capacitor is the same as the total charge ($Q_{total}$) drawn from the supply.</p>
                                <p>$Q_{total} = C_{eq} \times V_S = (\frac{12}{7} \times 10^{-6} \text{ F}) \times 350 \text{ V}$.</p>
                                <p>$Q_{total} = \frac{12 \times 350}{7} \times 10^{-6} = 12 \times 50 \times 10^{-6} = 600 \times 10^{-6}$ C = 600 $\mu$C.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, the charge on the $12 \mu F$ capacitor is $Q_3 = Q_{total} = 600 \mu C$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Potential difference across the $3 \mu \mathrm{~F}$ capacitor ($V_1$):</strong></p>
                                <p>$V_1 = Q_1 / C_1$. Since $Q_1 = Q_{total} = 600 \mu C$.</p>
                                <p>$V_1 = (600 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}) / (3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ F}) = 600 / 3 = 200$ V.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Series RLC Circuit:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: R = $5 \Omega$, L = 120 mH = 0.12 H, C = 100 $\mu$F = $100 \times 10^{-6}$ F.</p>
                                <p>Supply: V = 300 V, f = 50 Hz.</p>
                                <p>Calculate reactances:</p>
                                <p>Inductive Reactance ($X_L$) = $2\pi f L = 2\pi (50)(0.12) = 12\pi \approx 37.70 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Capacitive Reactance ($X_C$) = $\frac{1}{2\pi f C} = \frac{1}{2\pi (50)(100 \times 10^{-6})} = \frac{1}{0.01\pi} \approx \frac{1}{0.031416} \approx 31.83 \Omega$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Total Impedance (Z):</strong></p>
                                <p>Impedance $Z = \sqrt{R^2 + (X_L - X_C)^2}$.</p>
                                <p>$X_L - X_C = 37.70 - 31.83 = 5.87 \Omega$. (Circuit is inductive).</p>
                                <p>$Z = \sqrt{5^2 + (5.87)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 34.457} = \sqrt{59.457} \approx 7.71 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>Total impedance $\approx 7.71 \Omega$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Phase Angle ($\phi$):</strong></p>
                                <p>$\tan\phi = \frac{X_L - X_C}{R} = \frac{5.87}{5} = 1.174$.</p>
                                <p>$\phi = \arctan(1.174) \approx 49.57^{\circ}$.</p>
                                <p>Since $X_L > X_C$, the current lags the voltage. Phase angle $\approx 49.6^{\circ}$ lagging.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Derivation of Resonant Frequency ($f_r$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Resonance in a series RLC circuit occurs when the inductive reactance ($X_L$) equals the capacitive reactance ($X_C$). At this frequency, the impedance is minimum (Z=R), and the current is maximum. The circuit behaves purely resistively (phase angle $\phi=0$).</p>
                                <p>Condition for resonance: $X_L = X_C$.</p>
                                <p>Substitute the formulas for reactance: $2\pi f_r L = \frac{1}{2\pi f_r C}$.</p>
                                <p>Rearrange to solve for the resonant frequency $f_r$:</p>
                                <p>$(2\pi f_r L)(2\pi f_r C) = 1$.</p>
                                <p>$(2\pi f_r)^2 LC = 1$.</p>
                                <p>$(2\pi f_r)^2 = \frac{1}{LC}$.</p>
                                <p>Take the square root of both sides:</p>
                                <p>$2\pi f_r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$.</p>
                                <p>$f_r = \frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{LC}}$.</p>
                                <p>This is the expression for the resonant frequency in an ideal series RLC circuit.</p>
