                                <p class="answer-intro">This question tests understanding of periodic trends based on ionic configurations and radii, and concepts related to homologous series in organic chemistry.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Analysis of Elements from Table 1:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Atomic Numbers:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>P:</strong> Ion P$^{2+}$ has configuration 2.8.8 (18 electrons). Since it lost 2 electrons, the neutral atom P had $18 + 2 = 20$ electrons. Atomic Number of P = 20 (Calcium).</li>
                                    <li><strong>S:</strong> Ion S$^{3+}$ has configuration 2.8 (10 electrons). Since it lost 3 electrons, the neutral atom S had $10 + 3 = 13$ electrons. Atomic Number of S = 13 (Aluminium).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Most Reactive Metallic Element:</strong></p>
                                <p>Metallic reactivity increases down a group (easier to lose electrons) and decreases across a period. We look for elements that form positive ions easily, typically Group 1 or 2 metals with large atomic radii.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>R forms R$^{+}$ (Group 1) with configuration 2.8.8, meaning neutral R is 2.8.8.1 (Atomic number 19, Potassium). Atomic radius 0.231 mm.</li>
                                    <li>V forms V$^{+}$ (Group 1) with configuration 2.8, meaning neutral V is 2.8.1 (Atomic number 11, Sodium). Atomic radius 0.186 mm.</li>
                                    <li>W forms W$^{+}$ (Group 1) with configuration 2., meaning neutral W is 2.1 (Atomic number 3, Lithium). Atomic radius 0.156 mm.</li>
                                    <li>P forms P$^{2+}$ (Group 2) with configuration 2.8.8, meaning neutral P is 2.8.8.2 (Atomic number 20, Calcium). Atomic radius 0.197 mm.</li>
                                    <li>U forms U$^{2+}$ (Group 2) with configuration 2.8, meaning neutral U is 2.8.2 (Atomic number 12, Magnesium). Atomic radius 0.160 mm.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Comparing the Group 1 metals (R, V, W) and Group 2 metals (P, U), reactivity generally increases with atomic radius within a group. R (Potassium) has the largest atomic radius (0.231 mm) among these metals. Therefore, <strong>R</strong> is likely the most reactive metallic element.</p>
                                <p>Explanation: Element R has the largest atomic radius and readily loses its single valence electron to form a stable ion, indicating high metallic reactivity.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Elements Reacting with Cold Water:</strong></p>
                                <p>Highly reactive metals, particularly Group 1 metals (except Lithium sometimes reacts slowly) and some Group 2 metals (Calcium, Strontium, Barium), react with cold water.</p>
                                <p>From our analysis: R (Potassium), V (Sodium), and P (Calcium) would react with cold water. (W (Lithium) might react slowly).</p>
                                <p>Selected elements: <strong>R, V, P</strong>.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iv) Elements from the Same Group:</strong></p>
                                <p>Group 1: R (K), V (Na), W (Li). Select any three: <strong>R, V, W</strong>.</p>
                                <p>Group 2: P (Ca), U (Mg). Only two listed.</p>
                                <p>Group 17 (Halogens, forming X$^-$ ions): Q (likely F, 2.8 config for ion means 2.7 neutral, At No 9), X (likely Cl, 2.8.8 config for ion means 2.8.7 neutral, At No 17). Only two listed.</p>
                                <p>Group 13: S (Al). Only one.</p>
                                <p>Group containing T (Transition metal likely, Zn? At No 30 -> Zn$^{2+}$ 2.8.18). Only one.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, the only set of three is from Group 1: R, V, W.</p>

                                <p><strong>(v) Chemical Formulas:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>S and Oxygen:</strong> S forms S$^{3+}$ (Aluminium). Oxygen typically forms O$^{2-}$. Formula: $S_2O_3$ (Aluminium oxide).</li>
                                    <li><strong>V and X:</strong> V forms V$^{+}$ (Sodium). X forms X$^{-}$ (likely Chlorine). Formula: $VX$ (Sodium chloride - NaCl).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Homologous Series:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Definition:</strong></p>
                                <p>A homologous series is a series of organic compounds with a general formula, usually varying by a single parameter such as the length of a carbon chain. Successive members differ by a common structural unit (typically a $CH_2$ group).</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Characteristics:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>All members can be represented by a single general formula (e.g., $C_n H_{2n+2}$ for alkanes).</li>
                                    <li>Each successive member differs from the next by a $CH_2$ group.</li>
                                    <li>They show a gradual change in physical properties (like boiling point, density) as the molar mass increases.</li>
                                    <li>They have similar chemical properties due to the presence of the same functional group.</li>
                                    <li>They can be prepared by similar general methods.</li>
                                     <li>(Any three valid characteristics)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Variation in Physical State:</strong></p>
                                <p>The physical state (gas, liquid, solid) at room temperature depends primarily on the strength of intermolecular forces (Van der Waals forces) between molecules. As the number of carbon atoms (and molar mass) increases within a homologous series, the size and surface area of the molecules increase. This leads to stronger Van der Waals forces between molecules. Consequently, more energy is required to overcome these forces, resulting in higher melting and boiling points. Lower members with weaker forces are gases, intermediate members are liquids, and higher members with strong forces are solids at room temperature. The table shows this trend for alkanes ($C_1-C_4$ are gases, $C_5-C_6$ are liquids).</p>

                                <p><strong>(iv) Isomers of C$_{4}$H$_{10}$ (Butane):</strong></p>
                                <p>Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Butane (n-butane):</strong> Straight chain.

                                <p><strong>(a) Uses of X-rays in Medicine:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Diagnostic Imaging (Radiography):</strong> To view bones, detect fractures, locate foreign objects, diagnose conditions like pneumonia or blocked intestines.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Computed Tomography (CT Scan):</strong> Uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fluoroscopy:</strong> Real-time X-ray imaging used to observe movement within the body (e.g., during barium swallows or catheter placement).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Radiotherapy (Cancer Treatment):</strong> High-energy X-rays are used to destroy cancerous cells.</li>

                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) X-ray Tube Analysis (Fig 1):</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Naming Parts:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A: Filament (part of the Cathode assembly) - Source of electrons.</li>
                                    <li>B: Anode (Target) - Metal target struck by electrons.</li>
                                    <li>D: Lead Shielding - Absorbs stray X-rays for safety.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Material for Part C (Target Face within Anode):</strong></p>
                                <p>Part C is the specific target material embedded in the anode (B). It must have a high melting point (to withstand heat) and a high atomic number (for efficient X-ray production). Suitable material: **Tungsten** (or sometimes Molybdenum).</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) X-ray Production:</strong></p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The filament (A) is heated by a low voltage supply, causing thermionic emission of electrons.</li>
                                    <li>A high potential difference (accelerating voltage, typically tens of kV) is applied between the cathode (containing the filament) and the anode (B).</li>
                                    <li>Electrons are accelerated at high speed across the vacuum towards the anode target (C).</li>
                                    <li>When these high-energy electrons strike the target metal, they rapidly decelerate and lose kinetic energy. Most (~99%) of this energy is converted into heat, but a small fraction (~1%) is converted into X-ray photons through two main processes:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Bremsstrahlung (Braking Radiation):</strong> Electrons decelerate as they are deflected by the nuclei of the target atoms, emitting a continuous spectrum of X-rays.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Characteristic Radiation:</strong> Incident electrons knock out inner-shell electrons of target atoms. When outer-shell electrons drop down to fill these vacancies, specific energy (characteristic) X-rays are emitted, forming sharp peaks on the spectrum.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                <p><strong>(iv) Oil Cooling for Anode:</strong></p>
                                <p>The process of X-ray production is highly inefficient, with most of the kinetic energy of the incident electrons converted into heat at the anode target. Oil cooling (often circulating through the anode structure) is necessary to dissipate this large amount of heat and prevent the target from melting or being damaged.</p>

                                <p><strong>(v) Purpose of Part D (Lead Shielding):</strong></p>
                                <p>X-rays are produced in various directions from the target. The lead shielding absorbs stray X-rays, protecting operators and patients from unnecessary radiation exposure and ensuring that X-rays emerge only through a specific window towards the intended target.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Maximum Frequency of Emitted X-rays:</strong></p>
                                <p>The maximum energy of an emitted X-ray photon ($hf_{max}$) corresponds to the case where an incident electron loses all its kinetic energy in a single interaction. The kinetic energy gained by an electron accelerated through potential V is $E_k = eV$.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, $hf_{max} = eV$.</p>
                                <p>$f_{max} = \frac{eV}{h}$</p>
                                <p>Given: $V = 15 \text{ kV} = 15 \times 10^3 \text{ V}$, $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$, $h = 6.62 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}$.</p>
                                <p>$f_{max} = \frac{(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}) \times (15 \times 10^3 \text{ V})}{6.62 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}}$</p>
                                <p>$f_{max} = \frac{2.4 \times 10^{-15}}{6.62 \times 10^{-34}} \text{ Hz}$</p>
                                <p>$f_{max} \approx 3.625 \times 10^{18} \text{ Hz}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Nuclear Reactions and Half-Life:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Identifying Radiations:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>I ${ }_{6}^{12} \mathrm{C}^{*} \longrightarrow { }_{6}^{12} \mathrm{C}$ + radiation: The nucleus goes from an excited state (*) to a ground state without changing atomic or mass number. This releases energy as **Gamma (γ) radiation**.</li>
                                    <li>II ${ }_{88}^{226} \mathrm{Ra} \longrightarrow { }_{86}^{222} \mathrm{Rn}$ + radiation: Mass number decreases by 4, atomic number decreases by 2. This corresponds to the emission of an **Alpha (α) particle** (${ }_{2}^{4}He$).</li>
                                    <li>III ${ }_{6}^{14} \mathrm{C} \xrightarrow{\beta} { }_{7}^{14} \mathrm{N}$ + radiation: Mass number remains the same, atomic number increases by 1. This indicates **Beta-minus (β⁻) decay** (emission of an electron ${ }_{-1}^{0}e$ and an antineutrino). The "radiation" includes the beta particle.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Radioactive Decay Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Initial number of atoms ($N_0$) = $8.12 \times 10^{20}$, Half-life ($T_{1/2}$) = 21 minutes, Time elapsed ($t$) = 84 minutes.</p>
                                <p>Number of half-lives ($n$) = $t / T_{1/2} = 84 / 21 = 4$.</p>
                                <p>Number of atoms remaining ($N$) after $n$ half-lives is given by: $N = N_0 \times (\frac{1}{2})^n$.</p>
                                <p>$N = (8.12 \times 10^{20}) \times (\frac{1}{2})^4$</p>
                                <p>$N = (8.12 \times 10^{20}) \times (\frac{1}{16})$</p>
                                <p>$N = \frac{8.12}{16} \times 10^{20} = 0.5075 \times 10^{20}$</p>
                                <p>$N = 5.075 \times 10^{19}$ atoms.</p>
                                <p>The number of atoms remaining undecayed after 84 minutes is $5.075 \times 10^{19}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Specific Latent Heat of Vaporization ($L_v$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The specific latent heat of vaporization of a substance is the quantity of heat energy required to change a unit mass (e.g., 1 kg) of the substance from the liquid state to the gaseous state (vapor) at its boiling point without any change in temperature.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Domestic Refrigerator:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Reason for Using Volatile Liquid (Refrigerant):</strong></p>
                                <p>A volatile liquid is used because it evaporates easily at low temperatures and pressures (absorbing latent heat) and condenses back to liquid at higher temperatures and pressures (releasing latent heat). This property allows it to efficiently transfer heat from the cold interior to the warmer exterior.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Vaporization and Condensation:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Vaporization (in Evaporator/Cooling Compartment):</strong> The liquid refrigerant flows through a narrow capillary tube or expansion valve, causing a significant drop in pressure as it enters the wider tubes of the evaporator inside the cooling compartment. At this low pressure, the liquid boils and vaporizes even at low temperatures, absorbing its latent heat of vaporization from the surroundings (the inside of the fridge), thus cooling the compartment.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Condensation (in Condenser/Cooling Fins):</strong> The low-pressure vapor is drawn into the compressor, which increases its pressure and temperature significantly. This hot, high-pressure vapor then flows into the condenser coils (cooling fins) located outside the refrigerator, usually at the back. Here, the vapor is at a higher temperature than the surrounding air. As it loses heat to the air, it condenses back into a high-pressure liquid, releasing its latent heat of vaporization to the surroundings.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(iii) How Cooling Takes Place:</strong></p>
                                <p>Cooling occurs primarily in the evaporator section inside the refrigerator compartment. As the volatile refrigerant liquid turns into a gas (vaporizes) within the evaporator coils at low pressure, it absorbs the necessary latent heat of vaporization from the air and contents inside the fridge. This removal of heat lowers the temperature of the compartment.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iv) Purpose of Double Wall:</strong></p>
                                <p>The double wall, usually filled with insulating material (like foam), minimizes heat transfer by conduction and convection between the warmer outside environment and the cold interior of the refrigerator. This reduces the rate at which heat leaks into the fridge, improving efficiency and reducing the workload on the refrigeration cycle.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Governor Characteristics:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Sensitivity:</strong> The sensitivity of a governor is a measure of its responsiveness to a small change in speed. A governor is said to be sensitive if its sleeve moves significantly for a small fractional change in speed. It is often defined as the ratio of the range of speed to the mean equilibrium speed. A smaller range for a given sleeve lift means higher sensitivity.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Stability:</strong> A governor is stable if, for each speed within its operating range, there is a definite and unique configuration (i.e., sleeve position and flyball radius). If the speed increases, the flyballs should move to a new radius and remain there; they shouldn't oscillate indefinitely (hunt). Stability requires the controlling force to increase at a faster rate than the centrifugal force as the radius of rotation increases.</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Isochronous:</strong> An isochronous governor is one with infinite sensitivity. This means the equilibrium speed is constant for all radii of rotation of the flyballs within the working range (i.e., the speed does not change at all from no-load to full-load). While theoretically ideal for perfect speed control, purely isochronous governors tend to be unstable and hunt (oscillate between fully open and fully closed throttle positions).</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Tensile Test Calculations:</strong></p>

                                <p>Yield Stress ($\sigma_y$) = Load at Yield Point / Original Area</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers basic DC circuit definitions and calculations involving series circuits and Ohm's Law.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Ohmic Conductors:</strong> Conductors that obey Ohm's Law, meaning the current flowing through them is directly proportional to the voltage applied across them, provided physical conditions (like temperature) remain constant. Their resistance is constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. Examples include most metals at constant temperature.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Electric Power (P):</strong> The rate at which electrical energy is transferred or converted into another form (like heat, light, mechanical work). It is measured in Watts (W) or Joules per second (J/s). Formulas: $P = VI = I^2R = V^2/R$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Electrical Energy (E or W):</strong> The total work done or energy transferred by an electric current over a period of time. It is the product of power and time. Measured in Joules (J) or kilowatt-hours (kWh). Formulas: $E = P \times t = VIt = I^2Rt = (V^2/R)t$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Series Circuit Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Supply Voltage ($V_S$) = 24 V, Current (I) = 3 A, Resistor 1 ($R_1$) = 2 $\Omega$. Let the other resistor be $R_2$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Value of the other resistor ($R_2$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Total resistance ($R_{total}$) = $V_S / I = 24 \text{ V} / 3 \text{ A} = 8 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>In a series circuit, $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2$.</p>
                                <p>$8 \Omega = 2 \Omega + R_2$</p>
                                <p>$R_2 = 8 - 2 = 6 \Omega$.</p>
                                <p>The value of the other resistor is 6 $\Omega$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) P.D. across the 2 $\Omega$ resistor ($V_1$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Using Ohm's Law: $V_1 = I \times R_1 = 3 \text{ A} \times 2 \Omega = 6 \text{ V}$.</p>
                                <p>The p.d. across the 2 $\Omega$ resistor is 6 V.</p>

                                <p><strong>(iii) Energy consumed in 50 hours:</strong></p>
                                <p>Time (t) = 50 hours = $50 \times 3600 = 180000$ seconds.</p>
                                <p>Total power consumed by the circuit ($P_{total}$) = $V_S \times I = 24 \text{ V} \times 3 \text{ A} = 72 \text{ W}$.</p>
                                <p>Energy consumed (E) = $P_{total} \times t = 72 \text{ W} \times 180000 \text{ s} = 12,960,000 \text{ J}$.</p>
                                <p>Alternatively, in kWh: $P_{total} = 72 \text{ W} = 0.072 \text{ kW}$.</p>
                                <p>$E = 0.072 \text{ kW} \times 50 \text{ h} = 3.6 \text{ kWh}$.</p>
                                <p>Energy consumed is 12,960,000 J or 3.6 kWh.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Circuit Analysis (Fig 3):</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Total current ($I_{total}$) = 1.5 A. Resistors $R_1, R_2, R_3$ are in series.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Principle of Operation of a Single Phase Transformer:</strong></p>
                                <p>A single-phase transformer operates on the principle of **mutual induction** between two electrically isolated but magnetically coupled coils.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Primary Winding Excitation:</strong> An alternating voltage ($V_p$) is applied to the primary winding (a coil with $N_p$ turns wound on a laminated iron core).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Alternating Magnetic Flux Production:</strong> The alternating voltage drives an alternating current ($I_p$, primarily the magnetizing current $I_m$ on no-load) through the primary winding. According to Ampere's law, this alternating current produces an alternating magnetic flux ($\Phi$) within the iron core.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Flux Linkage:</strong> The laminated iron core provides a low reluctance path, concentrating and guiding almost all of this alternating magnetic flux so that it links with the secondary winding (a coil with $N_s$ turns wound on the same core).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Induced EMF in Secondary (Mutual Induction):</strong> According to Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, the changing magnetic flux ($\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$) linking the secondary winding induces an alternating electromotive force (EMF or voltage, $E_s$) across its terminals. The magnitude of this induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of flux and the number of turns in the secondary winding ($E_s = -N_s \frac{d\Phi}{dt}$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Induced EMF in Primary (Self-Induction):</strong> The same changing flux also links the primary winding itself, inducing a back EMF ($E_p$) according to Faraday's Law ($E_p = -N_p \frac{d\Phi}{dt}$). In an ideal transformer, this back EMF is equal and opposite to the applied primary voltage ($V_p \approx E_p$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Voltage Transformation Ratio:</strong> Since the flux ($\Phi$) and its rate of change ($\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$) are common to both windings (ideally), the ratio of the induced EMFs is equal to the ratio of the number of turns: $\frac{E_s}{E_p} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}$. For an ideal transformer, $E_s \approx V_s$ (secondary terminal voltage on no-load) and $E_p \approx V_p$. Therefore, $\frac{V_s}{V_p} \approx \frac{N_s}{N_p} = n$ (turns ratio). This allows the transformer to step voltage up ($N_s > N_p$) or step voltage down ($N_s < N_p$).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Power Transfer:</strong> When a load is connected to the secondary, a secondary current ($I_s$) flows. This current creates its own MMF, which tends to oppose the original flux. To maintain the flux (and thus the back EMF $E_p$ to balance $V_p$), the primary draws an additional load current ($I'_p$) from the supply such that the primary load MMF ($N_p I'_p$) counteracts the secondary MMF ($N_s I_s$). In an ideal transformer, input power equals output power ($V_p I_p \approx V_s I_s$), leading to the inverse current ratio: $\frac{I_p}{I_s} \approx \frac{N_s}{N_p}$.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Thus, a transformer transfers electrical energy from the primary circuit to the secondary circuit via a changing magnetic field, allowing voltage and current levels to be changed while (ideally) keeping the frequency constant.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Energy Loss When Connecting Charged Capacitors:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given:
                                    <ul>

                                <p><strong>Step 1: Calculate initial charges and energies.</strong></p>
