                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers properties of acids, nuclear energy advantages and reactor components, organic chemistry series and bonding types, and factors affecting ion discharge in electrolysis.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Properties of Acids:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Sour Taste:</strong> Acids typically have a sour taste (Note: Tasting chemicals in a lab is dangerous and should not be done).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Turn Litmus Red:</strong> Acids turn blue litmus paper red.</li>
                                    <li><strong>React with Bases (Neutralization):</strong> Acids react with bases or alkalis to form salt and water.</li>
                                    <li><strong>React with Active Metals:</strong> Acids react with metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series (e.g., zinc, magnesium, iron) to produce hydrogen gas and a salt.</li>
                                    <li><strong>React with Carbonates/Bicarbonates:</strong> Acids react with carbonates and bicarbonates to produce carbon dioxide gas, salt, and water.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Corrosive:</strong> Strong acids are corrosive and can damage skin, fabrics, and metals.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Conduct Electricity:</strong> Aqueous solutions of acids conduct electricity because they produce mobile ions (H$^+$ or H$_3$O$^+$ and anions).</li>
                                    <li><strong>pH Value:</strong> Have a pH value less than 7.</li>
                                     <li>(State any four)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(b) Nuclear Fuel vs. Fossil Fuel & Reactor Components:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Advantages of Nuclear Fuel over Fossil Fuel:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>High Energy Density:</strong> A very small amount of nuclear fuel (like Uranium) releases a vastly larger amount of energy compared to burning a chemically equivalent mass of fossil fuel (coal, oil, gas).</li>
                                    <li><strong>No Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Nuclear power generation does not produce carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) or other greenhouse gases directly, helping combat climate change.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reduced Air Pollution:</strong> Does not produce pollutants like sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$) or nitrogen oxides ($NO_x$) that cause acid rain and respiratory problems.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fuel Availability/Longevity:</strong> Although finite, known reserves of nuclear fuel can last for many decades or centuries, potentially longer than some fossil fuels depending on usage and technology (e.g., breeder reactors).</li>
                                     <li>(Outline any two)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Function of Nuclear Reactor Components:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Graphite Core (Moderator):</strong> In many reactor designs (especially older gas-cooled reactors or some research reactors), the graphite core acts as a **moderator**. Neutrons released during nuclear fission (e.g., of Uranium-235) are typically fast neutrons. To sustain a chain reaction efficiently, these neutrons need to be slowed down to thermal energies (become thermal neutrons) to increase the probability of causing further fission in other U-235 nuclei. Graphite, being composed of light carbon atoms, effectively slows down these fast neutrons through collisions without absorbing too many of them.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Control Rods:</strong> Control rods are made of materials that strongly absorb neutrons (e.g., Cadmium, Boron, Hafnium). Their function is to **control the rate of the nuclear chain reaction**. By inserting the control rods further into the reactor core, more neutrons are absorbed, reducing the number available to cause fission, thus slowing down the reaction rate and decreasing power output. Withdrawing the rods allows more neutrons to cause fission, increasing the reaction rate and power output. They are essential for starting up, shutting down, and maintaining the reactor at a desired power level safely.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(c) Hydrocarbons and Bonding:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Two Homologous Series for Hydrocarbons:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Alkanes:</strong> Saturated hydrocarbons with the general formula $C_n H_{2n+2}$ (e.g., methane, ethane, propane).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Alkenes:</strong> Unsaturated hydrocarbons containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond, general formula $C_n H_{2n}$ (e.g., ethene, propene, butene).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Alkynes:</strong> Unsaturated hydrocarbons containing at least one carbon-carbon triple bond, general formula $C_n H_{2n-2}$ (e.g., ethyne, propyne, butyne).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cycloalkanes:</strong> Saturated hydrocarbons with carbon atoms forming a ring structure, general formula $C_n H_{2n}$ (e.g., cyclopropane, cyclohexane).</li>
                                     <li>(Name any two)</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Covalent vs. Dative Bonds:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Covalent Bond:</strong> Formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. **Each atom typically contributes one electron** to form each shared pair. The shared pair is attracted by the nuclei of both atoms, holding them together. Example: The H-H bond in $H_2$, the C-H bonds in $CH_4$.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Dative Covalent Bond (Coordinate Bond):</strong> A special type of covalent bond where **both electrons in the shared pair are contributed by only one of the participating atoms**. This atom (the donor) must have a lone pair of electrons, and the other atom (the acceptor) must have a vacant orbital to accept the pair. Once formed, a dative bond is indistinguishable from a normal covalent bond in terms of properties like length and strength. Example: The bond formed between ammonia ($NH_3$, donor) and a proton ($H^+$, acceptor) to form the ammonium ion ($NH_4^+$); the bond between $NH_3$ and $BF_3$.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(d) Factors Determining Preferential Discharge of Ions:</strong></p>
                                <p>During electrolysis of aqueous solutions or molten salts containing multiple types of cations and anions, certain ions are discharged (oxidized at the anode, reduced at the cathode) in preference to others. The main factors are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Position in the Electrochemical Series (Reactivity Series / E° values):</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Cations (at Cathode):</strong> Cations of less reactive metals (lower in the electrochemical series, i.e., having *less negative* or *more positive* standard electrode potentials $E°$) are preferentially discharged (reduced). For example, $Cu^{2+}$ (E°=+0.34V) is discharged before $H^+$ (E°=0.00V) which is discharged before $Na^+$ (E°=-2.71V).</li>
                                            <li><strong>Anions (at Anode, using inert electrodes):</strong> Simpler anions or those lower in the discharge series are preferentially discharged (oxidized). The general order of ease of discharge is: $OH^- > Cl^- > Br^- > I^- >> SO_4^{2-}, NO_3^-$. Complex anions like sulphate and nitrate are very difficult to discharge from aqueous solution; usually $OH^-$ (producing $O_2$) is discharged instead.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Concentration of Ions:</strong> If an ion is present in significantly higher concentration than predicted by its position in the electrochemical series, it may be discharged preferentially. This is particularly important for halides (e.g., $Cl^-, Br^-, I^-$). In concentrated solutions of chlorides (like brine), $Cl^-$ is often discharged in preference to $OH^-$, even though $OH^-$ is typically easier to discharge based purely on E° values (due to overpotential effects and kinetics).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Nature of the Electrodes:</strong> If the electrodes are reactive (not inert like platinum or graphite), the electrode material itself might participate in the reaction. For example, if a copper anode is used during electrolysis of copper sulphate, the copper anode itself will dissolve ($Cu \rightarrow Cu^{2+} + 2e^-$) in preference to the discharge of $OH^-$ or $SO_4^{2-}$ anions. This is used in electrorefining.</li>
                                </ol>
                                 (Explain any two factors).

                                <p><strong>(ii) Energy of a Microwave Photon:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Wavelength ($\lambda$) = 20 cm = 0.20 m, Plank's constant ($h$) = $6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ Js, Speed of light ($c$) = $3.0 \times 10^{8}$ m/s.</p>
                                <p>Energy of a photon (E) is given by $E = hf$, where f is the frequency.</p>
                                <p>First, find the frequency: $c = f\lambda \implies f = c/\lambda$.</p>
                                <p>$f = (3.0 \times 10^{8} \text{ m/s}) / (0.20 \text{ m}) = 1.5 \times 10^{9}$ Hz (or 1.5 GHz).</p>
                                <p>Now calculate the energy:</p>
                                <p>$E = hf = (6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{ Js}) \times (1.5 \times 10^{9} \text{ s}^{-1})$</p>
                                <p>$E = 9.945 \times 10^{-25}$ J.</p>
                                <p>The energy possessed by *one* microwave photon at this wavelength is $9.945 \times 10^{-25}$ J.</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Displacement (y or x):</strong> The instantaneous distance of the oscillating object from its equilibrium (mean or center) position. It is a vector quantity, often measured along the line of motion.</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Amplitude (A):</strong> The maximum magnitude of the displacement of the oscillating object from its equilibrium position. It represents the extent of the oscillation.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Derivation of Velocity in SHM:</strong></p>
                                <p>The displacement ($y$) of an object undergoing SHM can be described by:</p>
                                <p>$y = A \sin(\omega t + \phi)$ (where $\phi$ is the initial phase angle, let's assume $\phi=0$ for simplicity, so $y = A \sin(\omega t)$).</p>
                                <p>Velocity ($V$) is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time:</p>
                                <p>$V = \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(A \sin(\omega t)) = A \frac{d}{dt}(\sin(\omega t))$</p>
                                <p>Using the chain rule: $V = A [\cos(\omega t) \times \omega] = A\omega \cos(\omega t)$. (Eq 1)</p>
                                <p>We want V in terms of y, A, and $\omega$. We need to eliminate t.</p>
                                <p>From the displacement equation, $\sin(\omega t) = y/A$.</p>
                                <p>Using the trigonometric identity $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$:</p>
                                <p>$\cos^2(\omega t) = 1 - \sin^2(\omega t) = 1 - (y/A)^2 = \frac{A^2 - y^2}{A^2}$.</p>
                                <p>Therefore, $\cos(\omega t) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{A^2 - y^2}{A^2}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{A^2 - y^2}}{A}$.</p>
                                <p>Substitute this expression for $\cos(\omega t)$ into Equation 1:</p>
                                <p>$V = A\omega \left( \pm \frac{\sqrt{A^2 - y^2}}{A} \right)$</p>
                                <p>$V = \pm \omega \sqrt{A^2 - y^2}$</p>
                                <p>This expression gives the velocity V at any displacement y in terms of amplitude A and angular speed $\omega$. The $\pm$ sign indicates the direction of velocity (positive or negative depending on which way the object is moving).</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers definitions of kinetic energy and impulse, impulse calculations (with ambiguity), applications of impulse, static equilibrium of a beam, Pascal's principle, and turbulent flow.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Definitions and Impulse Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Definitions:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>(I) Kinetic Energy (KE):</strong> The energy possessed by an object due to its motion. It depends on the object's mass (m) and speed (v), calculated as $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$.</li>
                                    <li><strong>(II) Impulse:</strong> The change in momentum of an object resulting from a force acting over a time interval. It is calculated as the product of the average force (F) and the time interval ($\Delta t$) during which it acts (Impulse = $F\Delta t$), or as the change in momentum ($\Delta p = mv - mu$).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Impulse Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Mass (m) = 12 kg, Height (h) = 8 m, $g = 9.8$ N/kg = 9.8 m/s².</p>
                                <p class="key-point">The question "impulse experienced by the object on hitting the ground" is ambiguous. It most likely refers to the impulse delivered *by the ground* to change the object's momentum (e.g., bring it to rest). However, the impact time is unknown. Calculating the momentum *just before impact* might be what's intended, as impulse equals the change in momentum required to stop it.</p>
                                <p>Velocity just before impact ($v$): Use conservation of energy ($mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$) or kinematics ($v^2 = u^2 + 2gh$, with $u=0$).</p>
                                <p>$v = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \times 9.8 \times 8} = \sqrt{156.8} \approx 12.52 \text{ m/s}$ (downwards).</p>
                                <p>Momentum just before impact ($p_{before}$) = $m \times v = 12 \text{ kg} \times (-12.52 \text{ m/s}) \approx -150.24 \text{ kg m/s}$ (assuming upward is positive).</p>
                                <p>If the object is brought to rest ($v_{after}=0$), the change in momentum is $\Delta p = p_{after} - p_{before} = 0 - (-150.24) = +150.24 \text{ kg m/s}$.</p>
                                <p>The impulse required to stop the object (exerted by the ground) is **+150.24 Ns** (upwards).</p>
                                <p>If the question meant the impulse *due to gravity* during the fall: Time to fall ($t$): $h = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \implies t = \sqrt{2h/g} = \sqrt{2(8)/9.8} \approx 1.278$ s. Impulse = Force $\times$ time = $(mg) \times t = (12 \times 9.8) \times 1.278 \approx 117.6 \times 1.278 \approx 150.3$ Ns (downwards). This matches the magnitude of the momentum change, as expected. Given the phrasing, the **change in momentum (150.2 Ns)** is the most likely intended answer for the impulse required to stop it.</p>


                                <p><strong>(b) Applications of Impulse:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Safety Features in Vehicles:</strong> Airbags and crumple zones increase the time ($\Delta t$) over which the force acts during a collision, reducing the peak force ($F = \Delta p / \Delta t$) experienced by occupants for the same change in momentum ($\Delta p$), thus reducing injury.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Sports:</strong> Hitting a ball (golf, baseball, tennis) involves applying a large force over a short time to produce a significant change in momentum (large impulse). Techniques often focus on maximizing contact time or force. Catching a ball involves increasing the time over which momentum is reduced to decrease the impact force on the hands ("giving" with the ball).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Pile Driving:</strong> A hammer delivers a large impulse to the pile over a short impact time, driving it into the ground.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Rocket Propulsion:</strong> Expelling mass (gas) at high velocity generates an impulse (thrust) on the rocket, changing its momentum according to Newton's third law.</li>

                                <p>Description: Turbulent flow occurs in fluids (liquids or gases) moving at higher velocities or in pipes with larger diameters, typically when the Reynolds number (Re) exceeds a critical value (around 2000-4000 for pipe flow). It is characterized by:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>**Chaotic Motion:** Fluid particles move in irregular, random paths with swirling eddies and vortices, rather than smooth layers (as in laminar flow).</li>
                                        <li>**Mixing:** There is significant mixing of fluid across the pipe section due to the eddies.</li>
                                        <li>**Velocity Profile:** The velocity profile across the pipe diameter is flatter near the center compared to the parabolic profile of laminar flow, with a steep drop near the walls due to the turbulent boundary layer.</li>
                                        <li>**High Energy Dissipation:** Turbulent flow involves greater frictional losses and requires more energy to maintain compared to laminar flow at the same average velocity.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                The diagram should show irregular, crossing streamlines and eddies within the pipe boundaries.</p>

                                 (Outline any three distinct differences).

                                <p><strong>(b) Speed Change using Drive Belt Coupling:</strong></p>
                                <p>Drive belts (like V-belts or flat belts) transmit power between two shafts using pulleys mounted on each shaft. The speed of the driven shaft can be changed relative to the driving shaft by using pulleys of different diameters.</p>
                                <p>The linear speed of the belt is approximately constant ($v_{belt}$). The relationship between linear speed and angular speed ($\omega$) of a pulley is $v_{belt} = r \omega = (D/2) \omega$, where r is radius and D is diameter.</p>
                                <p>Let driving pulley have diameter $D_1$ and angular speed $\omega_1$. Let driven pulley have diameter $D_2$ and angular speed $\omega_2$.</p>
                                <p>Since $v_{belt}$ is the same for both pulleys (neglecting slip):</p>
                                <p>$(D_1/2) \omega_1 = (D_2/2) \omega_2$</p>
                                <p>$D_1 \omega_1 = D_2 \omega_2$</p>
                                <p>The speed ratio is: $\frac{\omega_2}{\omega_1} = \frac{D_1}{D_2}$.</p>
                                <p>Therefore:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If $D_2 < D_1$ (driven pulley smaller), then $\omega_2 > \omega_1$ (speed increases).</li>
                                        <li>If $D_2 > D_1$ (driven pulley larger), then $\omega_2 < \omega_1$ (speed decreases).</li>
                                        <li>If $D_2 = D_1$, then $\omega_2 = \omega_1$ (speed remains the same).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                By selecting appropriate pulley diameters, a desired speed increase or reduction can be achieved for the driven shaft.</p>

                                <p><strong>(c) Angular Position-Time Graph (Fig 2):</strong></p>
                                <p>The graph shows Angular Position ($\theta$) in radians versus Time ($t$) in seconds. It is a straight line passing through the origin (0,0) and the point (4s, 6$\pi$ rad).</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Describe the velocity of motion:</strong></p>
                                <p>Angular velocity ($\omega$) is the slope (gradient) of the angular position-time graph ($\omega = d\theta/dt$). Since the graph is a straight line, the slope is constant.</p>
                                <p>Slope = $\frac{\text{Change in } \theta}{\text{Change in } t} = \frac{6\pi \text{ rad} - 0 \text{ rad}}{4 \text{ s} - 0 \text{ s}} = \frac{6\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{2}$ rad/s.</p>
                                <p>Description: The angular velocity is **constant** (uniform angular velocity) and equal to $3\pi/2$ rad/s.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Determine the period of motion:</strong></p>
                                <p>The period (T) is the time taken for one complete rotation (an angular displacement of $2\pi$ radians).</p>
                                <p>Using $\Delta\theta = \omega \times T$:</p>
                                <p>$2\pi \text{ rad} = (\frac{3\pi}{2} \text{ rad/s}) \times T$</p>
                                <p>$T = \frac{2\pi}{(3\pi/2)} = 2\pi \times \frac{2}{3\pi} = \frac{4}{3}$ seconds.</p>
                                <p>Period $T = 4/3 \text{ s} \approx 1.33$ seconds.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Cable Stress/Strain Calculation:</strong></p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Greatest tensile force ($F_{max}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Stress = Force / Area $\implies$ Force = Stress $\times$ Area.</p>
                                <p>$F_{max} = \sigma_{max} \times A = (290 \times 10^6 \text{ N/m}^2) \times (120 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^2)$.</p>
                                <p>$F_{max} = 290 \times 120 = 34800$ N (or 34.8 kN).</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) Maximum extension ($\Delta L_{max}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Young's Modulus $E = \text{Stress} / \text{Strain} = \sigma / \epsilon$.</p>
                                <p>Strain $\epsilon = \text{Stress} / E = \sigma_{max} / E$.</p>
                                <p>$\epsilon = (290 \times 10^6) / (70 \times 10^9) = 290 / 70000 \approx 0.004143$.</p>
                                <p>Also, Strain $\epsilon = \Delta L / L$.</p>
                                <p>$\Delta L_{max} = \epsilon \times L = 0.004143 \times 95 \text{ m} \approx 0.3936$ m.</p>
                                <p>Maximum extension $\approx 0.394$ m or 39.4 cm.</p>
                                <p>(Alternatively, using $\sigma = E \epsilon \implies F/A = E (\Delta L / L) \implies \Delta L = (F L) / (A E)$</p>

                                <p>For an indicating instrument (like an ammeter or voltmeter) to display a reading correctly, three forces/torques are typically required:</p>
                                <p><strong>(i) Deflecting Force/Torque ($T_d$):</strong> This is the force or torque produced by the electrical quantity being measured (current or voltage) acting on the instrument's moving system. It causes the pointer to move away from its zero position over the calibrated scale. The method of producing this torque depends on the instrument type (e.g., magnetic field interaction in PMMC, magnetic repulsion/attraction in moving iron, heating effect in hot wire).</p>
                                <p><strong>(ii) Damping Force/Torque ($T_{damp}$):</strong> This force opposes the motion of the moving system and only exists when the pointer is moving. Its purpose is to prevent oscillations and allow the pointer to settle quickly at its final deflected position. It should not affect the final steady reading. Common methods include air friction damping (vane in a chamber), eddy current damping (metal former moving in a magnetic field), and fluid friction damping (less common).</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Controlling Force/Torque ($T_c$):</strong> This force opposes the deflecting force and increases with the deflection of the pointer. It ensures that the deflection is finite and proportional (or related in a known way) to the quantity being measured. It also brings the pointer back to the zero position when the measured quantity is removed. This is usually provided by one or two spiral hairsprings or sometimes by gravity (in gravity-controlled instruments).</p>
                                <p>At the final steady position, Deflecting Torque = Controlling Torque ($T_d = T_c$).</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Peak vertical deflection from center = 2 divisions.</li>

                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>Step 1: Find Peak Voltage ($V_m$).</strong></p>
                                <p>$V_m = \text{Peak vertical deflection (cm)} \times \text{Sensitivity (V/cm)}$</p>
                                <p>$V_m = 2 \text{ cm} \times 2.5 \text{ V/cm} = 5.0 \text{ V}$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Mean Value of the Signal ($V_{avg}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The waveform is sinusoidal and symmetrical about the zero line. The mean value over a full cycle is zero.</p>
                                <p>The mean value is usually calculated over half a cycle for AC waveforms.</p>
                                <p>$V_{avg} = \frac{2}{\pi} V_m = \frac{2}{\pi} \times 5.0 \text{ V} \approx 0.637 \times 5.0 \approx 3.185 \text{ V}$.</p>
                                <p>Mean value (over half cycle) $\approx 3.19$ V.</p>

                                <p>First, find the Period (T) from the horizontal axis.</p>
                                <p>$T = \text{Horizontal length per cycle (cm)} \times \text{Time base (s/cm)}$</p>
                                <p>$T = 4 \text{ cm} \times (2.1 \text{ ms/cm}) = 4 \times (2.1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ s/cm}) = 8.4 \times 10^{-3}$ s.</p>
                                <p>Frequency ($f$) = $1 / T$.</p>
                                <p>$f = 1 / (8.4 \times 10^{-3} \text{ s}) \approx 119.05$ Hz.</p>
                                <p>Supply frequency $\approx 119$ Hz.</p>

                                <p><strong>(d) Constant-Voltage vs. Constant-Current Charging:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Constant-Voltage (CV) Charging:</strong> The charging voltage is kept constant throughout the charging process. The charging current starts high when the battery voltage is low (large difference between charger and battery voltage) and gradually decreases as the battery charges and its voltage rises, approaching zero when the battery is fully charged.
                                        <br><em>Advantage:</em> Simple, prevents over-voltage.
                                        <br><em>Disadvantage:</em> Initial high current can cause heating; charging time can be long as current tapers off.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Constant-Current (CC) Charging:</strong> The charging current is kept constant at a predetermined level throughout the main part of the charging process. The battery voltage gradually rises as it charges. Towards the end of the charge, the method might switch to constant voltage or terminate to avoid overcharging and excessive gassing/heating once a certain voltage threshold is reached.
                                        <br><em>Advantage:</em> Faster charging during the bulk phase; easier to estimate charging time ($Ah = I \times t$).
                                        <br><em>Disadvantage:</em> Requires more complex charger circuitry to regulate current; requires monitoring of voltage to prevent overcharging.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>(Often, practical charging uses a combination, like CC-CV charging).</p>

                                <p>Let's use Mesh Analysis.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Let $I_1$ be the clockwise current in the left loop (10V, 2$\Omega$, 5$\Omega$).</li>

                                <p>$10 - 7I_1 + 5I_2 = 0 \implies 7I_1 - 5I_2 = 10$ (Eq 1)</p>
                                <p>Apply KVL to Loop 2:</p>
                                <p>Starting from the 5V source, moving clockwise:</p>
                                <p>$-5\Omega \times (I_2 - I_1) - 1\Omega \times I_2 - 5V = 0$</p>

                                <p>Now solve Eq 1 and Eq 2 simultaneously.</p>
                                <p>From Eq 2: $5I_1 = 5 + 6I_2 \implies I_1 = (5 + 6I_2) / 5 = 1 + 1.2 I_2$.</p>

                                <p class="answer-intro">This question covers dielectric properties, capacitor calculations, electromagnetism field patterns, and induced EMF.</p>

                                <p><strong>(a) Dielectric Strength:</strong></p>
                                <p>The dielectric strength of an insulating material is the maximum electric field intensity (voltage gradient) that the material can withstand without undergoing electrical breakdown (becoming conductive, often accompanied by physical damage or arcing). It is typically expressed in Volts per unit thickness (e.g., V/m or kV/mm).</p>

                                <p><strong>(b) Mica Capacitor Calculation:</strong></p>
                                <p>Given: Dielectric Strength ($E_{max}$) = $50 \times 10^6$ V/m.</p>
                                <p>Area (A) = 940 cm² = $940 \times 10^{-4}$ m².</p>
                                <p>Thickness (d) = 0.025 mm = $0.025 \times 10^{-3}$ m.</p>
                                <p>Relative permittivity ($\epsilon_r$) = 5.</p>
                                <p>$\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12}$ F/m.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Rated Terminal Voltage ($V_{max}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>The maximum voltage the capacitor can withstand is determined by the dielectric strength and thickness.</p>
                                <p>$V_{max} = E_{max} \times d = (50 \times 10^6 \text{ V/m}) \times (0.025 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m})$.</p>
                                <p>$V_{max} = 50 \times 0.025 \times 10^3 = 1.25 \times 10^3 = 1250$ V.</p>
                                <p>Rated terminal voltage = 1250 V (or 1.25 kV).</p>

                                <p>$C = \frac{4.1595 \times 10^{-13}}{2.5 \times 10^{-5}} = 1.6638 \times 10^{-8}$ F.</p>

                                <p>Energy stored $E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2$. Maximum energy is stored at the maximum voltage.</p>

                                <p>Formula for EMF induced in a conductor moving through a magnetic field: $E = B l v \sin\theta$.</p>
                                <p>Given: Length (l) = 6 cm = 0.06 m, Flux Density (B) = 0.85 T, Velocity (v) = 62 m/s.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) At Maximum Flux Linkage/Cutting ($\theta = 90^{\circ}$):</strong></p>
                                <p>Maximum EMF occurs when the conductor moves perpendicular to the field lines ($\theta = 90^{\circ}$, $\sin 90^{\circ} = 1$).</p>
                                <p>$E_{max} = B l v \sin(90^{\circ}) = (0.85 \text{ T}) \times (0.06 \text{ m}) \times (62 \text{ m/s}) \times 1$.</p>
                                <p>$E_{max} = 3.162$ V.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) When conductor cuts flux at $\theta = 60^{\circ}$:</strong></p>
                                <p>Here, $\theta$ is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector.</p>
                                <p>$E = B l v \sin(60^{\circ}) = (0.85) \times (0.06) \times (62) \times (\sqrt{3}/2)$.</p>

                                <p><strong>(ii) RMS value ($V_{rms}$):</strong> $V_{rms} = V_m / \sqrt{2} = 110 / \sqrt{2} \approx 77.78$ V.</p>
                                <p><strong>(iii) Phase angle ($\phi$):</strong> $\phi = +0.2\pi$ radians. (This is the phase shift relative to $\sin(100\pi t)$). Convert to degrees: $\phi = 0.2\pi \times (180/\pi) = 0.2 \times 180 = 36^{\circ}$.</p>
                                <p><strong>(iv) Supply frequency (f):</strong> Angular frequency $\omega = 100\pi$. Since $\omega = 2\pi f$, then $f = \omega / (2\pi) = 100\pi / (2\pi) = 50$ Hz.</p>

                                <p><strong>(i) Simplified Equivalent Circuit (Referred to Primary, neglecting magnetizing branch):</strong></p>
                                <p>The magnetizing branch (Rc || Xm) draws the no-load current, which is often small compared to the load current. For approximate analysis under load, this branch is sometimes neglected or omitted.</p>
                                <p>The secondary impedance ($R_2 + jX_2$) is referred to the primary side by multiplying by $(N_p/N_s)^2 = (1/n)^2$, where $n = N_s/N_p$ is the turns ratio. Let $R'_2$ and $X'_2$ be the referred secondary resistance and reactance.</p>
                                <p>The simplified circuit consists of the primary resistance $R_1$ and leakage reactance $X_1$ in series with the referred secondary resistance $R'_2$ and referred leakage reactance $X'_2$.</p>
