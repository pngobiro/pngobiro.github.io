                        <p>Sound waves are typically characterized by the motion/vibration of particles in the medium and hence known as Waves</p>
                        <p>Sound waves fall into three categories: longitudinal waves, mechanical waves, and pressure waves. Keep reading to find out what qualifies them as such.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">a) Longitudinal Sound Waves</h3>
                        <p>A longitudinal wave is a wave in which the motion of the medium's particles is parallel to the direction of the energy transport. Sound waves in air and fluids are longitudinal waves, because the particles that transport the sound vibrate parallel to the direction of the sound wave's travel. If you push a slinky back and forth, the coils move in a parallel fashion (back and forth). Similarly, when a tuning fork is struck, the direction of the sound wave is parallel to the motion of the air particles.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">b) Mechanical Sound Waves</h3>
                        <p>A mechanical wave is a wave that depends on the oscillation of matter, meaning that it transfers energy through a medium to propagate. These waves require an initial energy input that then travels through the medium until the initial energy is effectively<br>
                        transferred. Examples of mechanical waves in nature include water waves, sound waves, seismic waves and internal water waves, which occur due to density differences in a body of water. There are three types of mechanical waves: transverse waves, longitudinal waves, and surface waves.</p>
                        <p>Why is sound a mechanical wave? Sound waves move through air by displacing air particles in a chain reaction. As one particle is displaced from its equilibrium position, it pushes or pulls on neighboring molecules, causing them to be displaced from their equilibrium. As particles continue to displace one another with mechanical vibrations, the disturbance is transported throughout the medium.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">LONGITUDINAL WAVES</h3>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-034-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating a longitudinal wave with areas of compression and rarefaction, showing particle motion parallel to wave direction." class="content-image">

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TRANSVERSE WAVES</h3>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-034-2.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating a transverse wave, showing particle motion perpendicular to wave direction, with crests and troughs." class="content-image">

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">c) Pressure Sound Waves</h3>
                        <p>A pressure wave, or compression wave, has a regular pattern of high- and low-pressure regions. Because sound waves consist of compressions and rarefactions, their regions fluctuate between low and high-pressure patterns. For this reason, sound waves are considered to be pressure waves. For example, as the human ear receives sound waves<br>
                        from the surrounding environment, it detects rarefactions as low-pressure periods and compressions as high-pressure periods.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">d) Transverse Waves</h3>
                        <p>Transverse waves move with oscillations that are perpendicular to the direction of the wave. Sound waves are not transverse waves because their oscillations are parallel to the direction of the energy transport; however sound waves can become transverse waves under very specific circumstances. Transverse waves, or shear waves, travel at slower speeds than longitudinal waves, and transverse sound waves can only be created in solids.</p>
