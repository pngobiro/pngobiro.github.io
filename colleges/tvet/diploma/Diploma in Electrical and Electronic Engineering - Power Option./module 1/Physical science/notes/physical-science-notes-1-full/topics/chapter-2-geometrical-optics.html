                         <p>The Fig.bellow shows a simplified version of a compound microscope and the ray diagram of image formation. It consists of two converging lenses set coaxially. The one that faces the object is called the objective, and the one that is close to the eye is called the eyepiece or ocular. The objective has a smaller aperture and smaller focal length than the eyepiece.

This image becomes the object for the eyepiece. For normal adjustment, the position of the eyepiece is adjusted such that the image formed by the objective falls in the focal plane of the eyepiece. Then, the final image is formed at infinity. It is erect with respect to the first image and, hence, inverted with respect to the object. The eye is least strained in this<br>
                        adjustment as it has to focus the parallel rays coming toward it. The position of the eyepiece can also be adjusted in such a way that the final virtual image is formed at the near point. The angular magnification is increased in this case. The ray diagram in the Fig. 16.98 refers to this case.</p>
                        <p>The eyepiece acts as a simple microscope effectively used to view the first image. Thus, the magnification by a compound microscope is a two-step process.
