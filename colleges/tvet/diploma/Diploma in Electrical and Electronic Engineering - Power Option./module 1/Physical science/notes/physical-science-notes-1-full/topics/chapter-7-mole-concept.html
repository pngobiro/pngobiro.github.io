                        <p>The relative atomic mass (RAM) of an atom is the number of times an atom is heavier than one twelfth of a carbon-12 atom. It is calculated by adding together the number of protons and neutrons in an atom.</p>
                        <p>The atomic mass is usually a whole number unless where an element occurs in a number of isotopes. Here the atomic mass is the average atomic weight of the isotopes in the ratio of their existence.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Example 1: Reaction Between Hydrogen and Fluorine</h4>
                        <p>In the reaction between hydrogen and fluorine, the hydrogen is oxidized, whereas the fluorine is reduced. The reaction can be written as follows.</p>
                        <div class="equation">
                           <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{H}_{2}+\mathbf{F}_{2} \rightarrow \mathbf{2 H F}$</span>
                        </div>
                        <p>The oxidation half-reaction is: <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{\rightarrow} \mathbf{2} \mathbf{H}^{+} \mathbf{+} \mathbf{2 e}^{-}$</span></p>
                        <p>The reduction half-reaction is: <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{F}_{2}+\mathbf{2e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathbf{2F}^{-}$</span></p>
                        <p>The hydrogen and fluorine ions go on to combine in order to form hydrogen fluoride.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Example 2: Reaction Between Zinc and Copper</h4>
                        <p>This is a type of metal displacement reaction in which copper metal is obtained when zinc displaces the <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$</span> ion in the copper sulfate solution as shown in the reaction below.<br>

                        <p>Thus, copper is displaced from the copper sulfate solution by zinc in a redox reaction.<br>
                        Example 3: Reaction between Iron and Hydrogen Peroxide<br>
                        <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$</span> is oxidized to <span class="math-inline">$\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$</span> by hydrogen peroxide when an acid is present. This reaction is provided below.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Oxidation half-reaction: <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{F e}^{\mathbf{2+}} \rightarrow \mathbf{F e}^{\mathbf{3+}}+\mathbf{e}^{-}$</span><br>
                        Reduction half-reaction: <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{+2} \mathbf{e}^{-} \mathbf{\rightarrow 2} \mathbf{O H}^{-}$</span></p>
                        <p>Thus, the hydroxide ion formed from the reduction of hydrogen peroxide combines with the proton donated by the acidic medium to form water.</p>

                        <p>Redox reactions have numerous industrial and everyday applications. A few of these applications of redox reactions are listed below.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.4.1 Redox Reaction in Electrochemistry</h3>
                        <p>The battery used for generating DC current uses a redox reaction to produce electrical energy.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-075-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of a simple electrochemical cell showing an anode, cathode, electrolyte, and electron flow via an external circuit." class="content-image">
                        <p>Batteries or electrochemical cells used in our day-to-day life are also based on redox reactions. For example, storage cells are used in vehicles to supply all the electrical needs of the vehicles.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.4.2 Redox Reaction in Combustion</h3>
                        <p>An explosion is a fast form of combustion; hence explosion can be treated as a redox reaction. Even the space shuttle uses redox reactions. The combination of ammonium perchlorate and powdered aluminium inside the rocket boosters gives rise to an oxidation-reduction reaction.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.4.3 Quantitative Analysis:</h3>
                        <p>The redox reactions form the basic principle of the redox titrations carried out for the quantitative analysis of various substances. Redox titrations are carried out to find the concentration of any electrically charged species present in the sample solution. These are done by titrating the unknown substance against a standardized titrant whose concentration is already known to us. In this type of titration, the solution containing the unknown substance is kept in the bottom flask and the solution of the known titrant is filled in the burette. The solution from the burette is allowed to fall drop-wise in the bottom flask (containing the unknown substance and an indicator) till the indicator<br>
                        changes the colour of the solution in the flask, indicating that the end point of the titration has reached. At the endpoint, the volume of the standardized titrant is noted down. This volume is equal to the volume of unknown substances required to neutralize the standardized titrant. The volume remaining in the sample solution is back-calculated by the total amount of the sample taken and thereby we can calculate the concentration of the unknown substance present in that solution. These reactions are quite useful in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

Metals usually exist in an oxidized state in nature (due to their long-term exposure to the oxygen present in the air surrounding them). Hence, they need to be reduced in order to extract the required metal out of them. This is done in the industry on a large scale with the help of a suitable reducing agent, depending on the metal or ore which is to be refined. For example, iron is extracted from the oxidized ore<br>
                                of ferric oxide in a large blast furnace in the iron extracting and refining industries using coke as a reducing agent. The reaction takes of iron metal extraction from its oxidized natural ore takes place as follows:</span>
