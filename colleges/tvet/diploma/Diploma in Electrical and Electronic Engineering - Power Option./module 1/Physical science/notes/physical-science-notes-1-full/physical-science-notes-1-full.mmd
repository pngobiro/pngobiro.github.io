\section*{MECHANICS}

\subsection*{1.1 Introduction}

Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the study of the motion of bodies subjected to forces. Mechanics is divided into statics, which deals with sets of forces in equilibrium and kinematics, which deals with dynamic forces acting on objects.

\subsection*{1.2 A force}

A force is defined as pull or push in on a body, it is a vector quantity it is measured in Newton. A Newton is the force that gives a mass of 1 kg an acceleration of $1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} 2$

\subsection*{1.3 Types of forces}

There are two main load types of forces that are most common when determining deflection of a support brace i.e
a) Point Load (PL)
b) Uniform Distributed Load (UDL).
c) Uniformly varying load

The examples following will be based on supports with one fixed end (cantilever beams).

\section*{a) Point Load (concentrated load)}

A point load is a force that is applied to a concentrated point on the support. An example would be a person standing at the free end of a diving board. Concentrated loads are more likely to cause bending. Below are images of a real life experiment of both load types mentioned as well as load placement, showing how those factors affect deflection
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-004.jpg?height=510&width=1497&top_left_y=252&top_left_x=292)

\section*{b) Uniformly distributed load}

A uniform distributed load is a force that is applied evenly over the distance of a support. For the least amount of deflection possible, this load is distributed over the entire length of the support. An example would be a shipping crate on a forklift. In construction, UDLs are preferable over point loads. Under an evenly distributed load the possibility of a support bending and/or failing are significantly reduced when compared to a point load situation..
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-004.jpg?height=174&width=570&top_left_y=1577&top_left_x=249)

For example, the ground reaction forces on the tires of a car can be considered as concentrated loads to forces (Fig. 3.32). Another example is the load of a person walking on a tightrope.

A uniform distributed load is a force that is applied evenly over the distance of a support. For the least amount of deflection possible, this load is distributed over the entire length of the support. An example would be a shipping crate on a forklift. In con..struction, UDLs are preferable over point loads.
c) uniformly varying load.

A uniformly varying load is also called the triangular load which starts with zero intensity at one end of the beam and varies linearly to the other end of the beam. This variation of load comes under the nonuniform distribution of loads over the beam. In such conditions, the reaction on each support will be different, having lower values at the end that consist of zero intensity of loading.

\subsection*{1.4 Resolution of forces}

A force is a vector quantity which can be expressed in x and y on rectangular coordinates.

Consider a force F pulling a load along a surface at an angle $\theta$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-005.jpg?height=356&width=1405&top_left_y=1004&top_left_x=284)

The horizontal component of the force is $\mathrm{F} \operatorname{Cos} \theta$ while the vertical component is F Sin $\theta$. Also consider a load sliding along an inclined plane at a constant acceleration
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-005.jpg?height=351&width=1264&top_left_y=1570&top_left_x=271)

\section*{Example}

The horizontal component of the force is $\mathrm{F} \operatorname{Cos} \theta$ while the vertical component is F Sin $\theta$. Also consider a load sliding along an inclined plane at a constant acceleration. Find the tension in each cord if the weight of suspended object is 490 N .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-006.jpg?height=370&width=711&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=271)

\section*{Solution}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-006.jpg?height=497&width=1345&top_left_y=733&top_left_x=284)
$\sum F_{y}=0$
$T_{3}-490=0$
$\sum F_{x}=0$
$T_{2} \operatorname{Cos} 40^{\circ}-T_{1} \operatorname{Cos} 60^{\circ}=0$
$T_{2}=0.653 T_{1}$
$\sum F_{y}=0, T_{2} \sin 40^{\circ}+T_{1} \sin 60^{\circ}-490 N=0$
$0.653 T_{1} \sin 40^{\circ}+T_{1} \sin 60^{\circ}=490 \mathrm{~N}$
$T_{1}=381 N$
$T_{2}=0.653(381 N)$
$T_{2}=249 N$

\section*{Friction force}

Friction force is a force that opposes relative motion between two surfaces.
For a body resting on a rough surface, when external force ( $F$ ) is applied on it that force has to overcome friction (Fr) before the body moves. The body is moved by a net force (F net) i.e.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-007.jpg?height=576&width=1557&top_left_y=826&top_left_x=292)
$$\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{net}}=\mathrm{F}-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{r}}$$

Frictional force Fr depends on the normal reaction ( $\mathrm{R}=\mathrm{mg}$ )
$F \propto R$
$\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{r}}=\mu R$
Where $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction, $\mu$ depends on the nature of two surfaces that are in relative motion.

\section*{Examples}

A block of wood of mass 20 kg requires a horizontal force of 50 N to pull it with a uniform velocity along a horizontal surface. Calculate the coefficient of friction between the block and the surface.

Solution
$$\begin{aligned}
& R=m g=20 \times 10=200 \mathrm{~N} \\
\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{r}} & =\mu R
\end{aligned}$$
$\mu=\frac{50}{200}$
$\mu=0.25$

\section*{Example 2}

A mass of 5 kg is placed on a plane inclined at an angle of 300 to the horizontal. Calculate the force required to pull the mass up the plane at uniform velocity if $\mu=0.5$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-008.jpg?height=662&width=976&top_left_y=783&top_left_x=317)
$R=m g \operatorname{Cos} 30^{\circ}=50 \cos 30^{\circ}=43.3 \mathrm{~N}$
$F_{r}=\mu R=\mu m g \operatorname{Cos} \theta=0.5 \times 50 \operatorname{Cos} 30^{\circ}=21.65 \mathrm{~N}$
There are two forces opposing motion, Fr and mgSin $\theta$
$\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{net}}=\mathrm{F}-\left(\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{r}}+\mathrm{mg} \operatorname{Sin} \theta\right)$
We have uniform motions, net force is zero
$F=F_{r}+m g \operatorname{Sin} \theta$
$F=21.65+50 \operatorname{Sin} 30^{\circ}=46.65 \mathrm{~N}$

\section*{Factors affecting friction}
i. Nature of the surface.
ii. Applied force is directly proportional to the normal reaction, R.
iii. Resistance

\subsection*{1.5 Moment of force}

The Moment of a force is a measure of its tendency to cause a body to rotate about a specific point or axis.

\subsection*{1.5.1 Clockwise and anti-clockwise moments}

If the moment of a force turns or rotates the body in clockwise direction, then it is called as clock- wise moment. Whereas if the moment of a force turns or rotates the body in anti-clockwise direction, then it is called anti-clockwise moment
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-009.jpg?height=226&width=556&top_left_y=1215&top_left_x=725)

Clockwise moment $=\mathrm{m}_{2} \times \mathrm{d}_{2}$
Anti-clockwise moment $=\mathrm{m}_{1} \times \mathrm{d}_{1}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-009.jpg?height=516&width=1567&top_left_y=1702&top_left_x=241)

According to the principle of moments,
Sum of anti-clockwise moments = sum of clockwise moments
From figure,
$$\mathrm{m}_{1} \mathrm{~d}_{1}+\mathrm{m}_{2} \mathrm{~d}_{2}=\mathrm{m}_{3} \mathrm{~d}_{3}+\mathrm{m}_{4} \mathrm{~d}_{4}$$

\section*{Example}

Study the diagram below and determine the value of X and hence the length of the bar.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-010.jpg?height=299&width=982&top_left_y=601&top_left_x=317)

Clockwise moments $=15 X N+5(X+20) N$
Anti-Clockwise moments $=20 X 10+(60 X 10)$
$=800 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~cm}$
Clockwise moments =Anti-Clockwise moments
$$800 N=20 X+(100)$$
$X=35 \mathrm{~cm}(0.35 \mathrm{~m})$

\section*{Example 2}

A uniform rod 1.0 m long weighs 5 N . It is supported horizontally at one end by a spring and the other end rests on a table as shown below. A mass of 2 kg is hung from the rod as shown; determine, (10 marks)
a) Reading of the spring balance
b) Reaction force, F, from the table.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-011.jpg?height=576&width=1085&top_left_y=262&top_left_x=292)

\section*{Solution}
a) The 2 kg mass and the weight of the rod ( 5 N ) gives clockwise moment while the spring balance provides anticlockwise moments.

Clockwise moments $=(2 \times 10) \times 0.4+(5 \times 0.5)=10.5 \mathrm{Nm}$.
Anticlockwise moments $=\mathrm{S} \times 1$ (reading of the spring balance),
$1 \mathrm{~S}=10.5$, hence $\mathrm{S}=10.5 \mathrm{~N}$.
b) Upward forces = downward forces

Downward forces $=(2 \times 10)+5=25 \mathrm{~N}$
Therefore F+ $10.5=25$, hence F $=14.5 \mathrm{~N}$.

\section*{1.6 circular motion}

This is the study of motions of bodies moving in a circular path.
When the motion of the body in the circular path is with uniform velocity it is called uniform circular motion. When it is in uniform velocity, the direction of motion at any point is along the tangent to the circle at that point. If the body is set free, it would move in the direction of the tangent at that point.

\subsection*{1.6.1 Angular velocity}

Consider a body (or particle) moving along a circular path. If $\theta$ is the angle turned by the radius vector in $t$ second, then
$\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}$
The angle covered or swept or turned by the radius vector in one second is known as angular velocity. SI Unit of angular velocity is radian / second (rad s-1). Radian is the angle made at the centre of the circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle.

\subsection*{1.6.2 Relation between angular velocity and linear velocity}

Consider a particle moving along a circular path of radius r . Initially the particle is at a point $A$. After $t$ second the particle reaches the point $B$. Let $\theta$ be the angle swept by the radius vector in t -second.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-012.jpg?height=380&width=910&top_left_y=1111&top_left_x=284)

Angular velocity
$\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}$
If $\theta$ is very small, the distance AB will be considered as a straight line. Let v be the linear velocity of the particle.

Linear velocity, $\mathrm{v}=\frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{t}}$, In $\triangle \mathrm{OAB}, \sin \theta=\frac{s}{r}$
If $\theta$ is very small, $\sin \theta=\theta$ in radian
$\therefore \theta=\frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{r}}$ (or) $\mathrm{s}=\mathrm{r} w$
Linear velocity, $v=\frac{r \theta}{r}=r \omega$
$\mathrm{v}=\frac{\mathrm{r} \theta}{\mathrm{r}}=\mathrm{r} \omega$
$\therefore \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{r} \omega$
Relation between period T and angular velocity w
Angle turned by the radius vector in T second $=2 \pi$
$\therefore$ Angle turned by the radius vector in one second $=\frac{2 \pi}{T}$
i.e., Angular velocity, $\omega=\frac{2 \pi}{\mathrm{~T}}$ or $\mathrm{T}=\frac{2 \pi}{\omega}$

\section*{Centripetal force and Centrifugal force}

Centripetal force is defined as the force which acts towards the Centre along the radius of the circular path on which the particle is moving with uniform velocity.

Example is a stone tied to one end of a string and whirled in a horizontal plane with constant speed. The stone is subjected to a force directed towards the Centre of the circle.

\section*{Examples for centripetal force}

A body tied to one end of a string is being rotated in a circle; the centripetal force is supplied by the tension of the string.

The moon revolving around the earth, the centripetal force is the gravitational pull of the earth on the moon.

A person riding a cycle along a circular path, the necessary centripetal force is supplied by a sidewise pressure exerted by the road on the tires.
3.4.1 Centrifugal force on the other hand is defined as the force acting along the radius of the circle, away from the centre, to balance the centripetal force.

A stone tied to one end of a string is being rotated in a circle, the stone itself exerts an equal and opposite force on the hand. It is due to the centrifugal force.

A centrifugal pump is used to pump well water on the basis of centrifugal force.

\section*{Expressions for Normal acceleration and Centripetal force}
$\therefore$ Normal acceleration, $\mathrm{a}=\frac{\mathrm{v} \theta}{\mathrm{t}}$

Normal acceleration, $\mathrm{a}=\frac{\mathrm{v}^{2}}{\mathrm{r}}$ or $\mathrm{a}=\mathrm{r} \omega^{2}$

\subsection*{3.4.2 Centripetal force}
$\mathrm{a}=\frac{\mathrm{v}}{\mathrm{r}}$
Centripetal force, $F=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}$ or $F=m r \omega^{2}$

\section*{EXAMPLE}

One end of a string of length 0.64 m is attached to a bucket containing water and the bucket is rotated about the other end in a vertical circle. Find the minimum speed with which it can be rotated without spilling the water at the highest point. How many revolutions per minute it is making?

\section*{Banking of curved paths}

Curved track is to be considered as a part of the circular path. Consider a motor car moving along a curved road. Now two forces are acting on the car, one is the weight of the car acting downward and second is the normal reaction acting upward. In addition to these two forces, a horizontal centripetal force should act on the car for safe negotiation of curved motion. This force is supplied by the pressure exerted by the road on the tyres of the car towards inner side. According to Newton's third law of motion, the tyres exert an equal and opposite pressure on the road towards the outer side. Hence there must be a frictional force between the road and the tyres.

\section*{Angle of Banking}

It is the angle between the normal horizontal path and the curved banked path. The angle of banking of a curved path is defined as the angle through which the outer edge of the road is raised over the inner edge. The angle of banking of curved railway tracks is defined as the angle through which the outer rail is raised over the inner rail.

\section*{SOLVED PROBLEMS.}

A cyclist is riding at a speed of $22 \mathrm{~ms}-1$ takes a turn on a curved circular road of radius 44 m . What is his inclination to the vertical?

Given
$$\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{V}=22 \mathrm{~ms}-1, \mathrm{r}=44 \mathrm{~m}, \mathrm{~g}=9.8 \mathrm{~ms}-2 \\
& \qquad \begin{aligned}
& \tan \theta=\frac{\mathrm{v}^{2}}{\mathrm{rg}} \\
& \tan \theta=\frac{22^{2}}{44 \times 9.8} \\
&=\frac{484}{431.2} \\
& \begin{aligned}
\theta=\tan -1 & (1.122)=48^{\circ} 18^{\prime} \\
& =\tan ^{-1} 1.22 \\
& =48^{\circ} 18^{\prime}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}$$

$r=120, g=98 m s^{-1}$
$$\begin{gathered}
\tan \theta=\frac{\mathrm{v}^{2}}{\mathrm{rg}}=\tan \theta=\frac{10^{2}}{120 \times 9.8} \\
\tan \theta=0.0850 \\
\theta=\tan (1.122)=5^{\circ} 51^{\prime}
\end{gathered}$$

& \mathrm{v}^{2} \quad=r g \times \tan \theta=18 \times 9.8 \times 7^{\circ} \\
& \quad v=4.65 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{CHAPTER 2 GEOMETRICAL OPTICS}

\subsection*{2.1 INTRODUCTION}

Light is a form of radiant energy; energy emitted by the excited atoms or molecules that can cause the sensation of vision by a normal human eye.

The branch of physics that deals with the phenomena of light is called optics. There are two branches of optics
(a) Physical optics and (b) Geometrical w optics.

\subsection*{2.2 SOME DEFINITIONS}
(a) Ray: The 'path' along which the light travels is called a ray. The rays are represented by straight lines with arrows directed towards the direction of travel of light.
(b) Beam: A bundle of rays is called a beam. A beam is parallel when its rays are parallel, it is divergent when its rays spread out from a point, and it is convergent when its rays meet at a point.
(c) Object and image

If the rays from a point on an object actually diverge from it and fall on the mirror, then the object is the real object of the mirror. If the rays incident on the mirror does not start from a point but appear to converge at a point, then that point is the virtual object of the mirror.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-017.jpg?height=602&width=1386&top_left_y=241&top_left_x=288)

If
the rays converge at a point after an interaction with a surface, then a real image will be formed, and if the rays diverge after an interaction with a surface, a virtual image will be formed.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-017.jpg?height=302&width=1110&top_left_y=1242&top_left_x=337)

\section*{Real object, real image, , virtual object virtual image:}

In Fig. 1.2 (a), the object is real, while the image is virtual. In Fig. 1.2 (b), the object is virtual, while the image is real.

\subsection*{2.3 REFLECTION OF LIGHT}

\section*{Definition}

When the light falling on a surface turns back into the same medium, it means it is reflected. The angle made by the incident ray with the normal to the reflecting or refracting surface is called the angle of incidence, and the angle made by the reflected or refracted ray with normal is called the angle of reflection or refraction.

\section*{- Laws of Reflection}
a) When the incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence all lie on the same plane. It is called the plane of incidence.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-018.jpg?height=199&width=476&top_left_y=502&top_left_x=264)
b) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection

\section*{$\angle \mathrm{i}=\angle \mathrm{r}$.}

The deviation is defined as the angle between the directions of the incident ray and the reflected ray (or the emergent ray). It is generally denoted by $\delta$.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-018.jpg?height=291&width=891&top_left_y=1193&top_left_x=303)

\subsection*{2.4 Types of mirrors}
a) Plane mirror
b) Spherical mirrors

\section*{i. Concave mirrors}
ii. Convex mirrors.

\section*{- Reflection from a plane surface (or plane mirror)}

Almost everybody is familiar with the image formed by a plane mirror. If the object is real, the image formed by a plane mirror is virtual, erect, of same size of the original object and in the same distance from the mirror.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-019.jpg?height=362&width=1045&top_left_y=269&top_left_x=330)

If an object is placed in front of a mirror as shown in Fig. 1.6, we get its image in the mirror due to the reflection of light.

\section*{Characteristic of image formed by plane mirror.}
(a) The distance between the object and the mirror = the distance between the image and the mirror.
(b) The line joining the object point with its image is normal to the reflecting surface.
(c) The image is laterally inverted (left-right inversion).
(d) The size of the image is same as that of the object.
(e) For a real object, the image is virtual, and for a virtual object, the image is real.
(f) For a fixed incident light ray, if the mirror is rotated by an angle $\theta$, the reflected ray turns through an angle $2 \theta$. If plane mirror is rotated through about an axis perpendicular to plane of mirror, then the reflected ray image spot does not rotate.
- Spherical mirrors

A spherical mirror is a smooth reflecting surface that forms a part of a spherical surface. If reflection takes place from the inner reflecting surface, then the mirror is called a concave mirror. If the reflection takes place from the outer surface, it is called a convex mirror. The reflection of a light from a concave and a convex mirror is shown in the Fig. 1.21.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-020.jpg?height=361&width=627&top_left_y=253&top_left_x=342)

Concave Mirror
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-020.jpg?height=413&width=667&top_left_y=233&top_left_x=1084)
- Parameters Associated with the Spherical Mirror
a) A pole (P) or vertex is the geometrical center of a reflecting surface.
b) Center of curvature C is the center of the sphere, of which the mirror is a part. Radius of curvature R is equal to the distance between P and C of the mirror and is the radius of the sphere, of which the mirror is a part.
c) The principal axis is the line CP that passes through P and C. If a ray of light is emitted from an object at infinity so that the beam of light is parallel to the principal axis, an image is formed at principal focus F after reflection.
d) Focal length, f , is the distance between P and F along the principal axis. When a beam of light is incident parallel to the principal axis, the reflected rays converge on $F$ in a concave mirror and diverge from $F$ in a convex mirror after reflection.
e) Aperture of a spherical mirror is the effective diameter MM' of the light-reflecting area in the mirror. When the aperture of a mirror is small, the focal length is equal to half the radius of curvature.

\subsection*{2.5 Rules for Image Formation}

The following rules are used for locating the image of an object by considering the reflection of three types of rays
based on laws of reflection:
a) A ray incident parallel to the principal axis will pass through the principal focus after reflection in the case of
b) a concave mirror and will appear to originate from the focus in the case of a convex mirror.
c) A ray that passes through the principal focus of a concave mirror, or that passes toward the principal focus of
d) a convex mirror, travels parallel to the principal axis after reflection.
e) A ray that passes through the center of curvature of a concave mirror or toward the center of curvature of a
f) convex mirror is reflected from the mirror along the same path.

\subsection*{2.6 Image Formation by a Convex Mirror}

An image is formed between the pole and the focus for all thepositions of the real object except when the objects are at infinity in which case the image is formed at F in the focal plane. The image formed is virtual, erect and diminished. The ray diagram for the formation of image I of object 0 after reflection from a convex mirror is shown in the Fig. 1.29

\section*{Mirror Formula}

If an object is placed at a distance $u$ from the pole of a mirror, its image is formed at a distance v from the pole, and its focal length f is given by
$$1 / u+1 / v=1 / f$$
where $\mathrm{f}=\mathrm{R} / 2$ (only for paraxial rays). According to the sign conventions, f and R are negative for a concave mirror and are positive for a convex mirror. The power of a mirror, P , measured in units of dioptres is given by $p=-{ }_{\vec{f}}^{1}$ Where $f$ is in metres $p=-\frac{{ }^{100}}{f}$ Where $f$ is in centimetres.

Example 5: A convex mirror has a radius of curvature of 20 cm . Find the position of the image of an object placed at a distance of 12 cm from the mirror.

Sol: The position of the image is found using formula
$$\begin{gathered}
\frac{1}{u}+\frac{1}{v}=\frac{2}{R} \\
\frac{1}{v}=\frac{2}{20}-\frac{1}{-12} \\
\frac{1}{v}=\frac{11}{60} \\
V=\frac{60}{11} \mathrm{~cm}
\end{gathered}$$

The positive sign of v shows that the image is formed on the right side of the mirror and is a virtual image

\subsection*{2.7 Refraction of light and laws of refraction}
(a) The deviation or bending of light rays from their original path while travelling from one medium to another is called refraction.
(b) If the refracted ray bends away from the normal, then the second medium is said to be RARER as compared to the first medium, and the speed increases.

\subsection*{2.7.1 Refraction through a Transparent Sheet}

Let the ray is incident at face $A B$. Apply the Snell's law at faces $A B$ and $C D$.
$$\begin{gathered}
\mu_{1} \sin i_{1}=\mu_{2} \sin i_{2} \\
\mu_{2} \sin i_{2}=\mu_{3} \sin i_{3} \\
\frac{\mu_{1}}{\mu_{2}}=\frac{\sin i_{2}}{\sin i_{1}}
\end{gathered}$$

The incident ray and emerging ray are parallel. It shows that the deviation of ray is not affected by the refractive
index of the sheet; it depends by $\mu_{1}$ and $\mu_{3}$. $\mu_{2}$ only causes lateral displacement which is given by
$$x=\frac{t \sin \left(i_{1}-i_{2}\right)}{\cos i_{2}}$$

\section*{Example}

The refractive index of glass with respect to water is (9/8) and the refractive index of glass with respect to air is $(3 / 2)$. Find the refractive index of water with respect to air.

Sol: The refractive index of medium one with respect to medium two is given by . $\mu_{2}=$

To find the refractive index of water with respect to air, we need to obtain the ratio between
$${ }_{w} \mu_{g} \text { and and }{ }_{a} \mu_{g}$$

Given $\quad w \mu_{g}=9 / 8$ and $a \mu_{g}=3 / 2$.
$$\begin{gathered}
A s \quad a \mu_{g} \times{ }_{g} \mu_{w} \times{ }_{w} \mu_{a}=1 \\
\therefore \frac{1}{w \mu_{a}}={ }_{, a} \mu_{w}={ }_{, a} \mu_{g} \times{ }_{g} \mu_{w}=\frac{{ }_{a} \mu_{g}}{w \mu_{g}} \\
\ldots \mathrm{a} \mu_{w}=\frac{3 / 2}{9 / 8}=\frac{4}{3}
\end{gathered}$$

\subsection*{2.7.2 Total internal reflection}

The angle of incidence for which angle of reflection is 90 .

Example : A point source of light is placed at the bottom of a tank filled with water up to the level of 80 cm . Find the area of the surface of water through which light from the source emerges out. Assume that the refractive index is equal to 1.33 .

Sol: When light travels from a denser medium (water) to the rarer medium (air) for angle of incidence i greater than critical angle, than by Snell's law we get $1 \operatorname{Sin} C=\frac{1}{n}$

Let the light emerges out of a circular area of radius $r$ as shown in the figure.

O (Source of light)

Step 1 Using $\operatorname{Sin} C=\frac{1}{n}$
$$\begin{gathered}
\operatorname{Sin} C=\frac{1}{1.33} \\

C=\sin ^{-1}(0.7519)=48.75^{\circ}
\end{gathered}$$

Step 2. From $\triangle \mathrm{POR}$,
$$\begin{gathered}
\operatorname{Tan} C=\frac{P R}{O P}=\frac{r}{80} \\
r=80 \tan C=80 \tan C\left(48.75^{\circ}\right)=80 \times 1.14=26116.76 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \\
=26116.76 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
=2.6 \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{gathered}$$

\section*{Power of an Optical Instrument}

By the optical power of an instrument (whether it is a lens, mirror or a refractive surface), we measure the ability of the instrument to deviate the path of rays passing through it. If
the instrument converges the rays parallel to the principal axis, its power is positive, and if it diverges the rays, it is a negative power.
$P$ (in dioptre)
$$P(\text { in dioptre })=\frac{1}{f(\text { metre })}$$

\subsection*{2.8 Dispersion of light}

When a beam of white light that consists of spectrum of various wavelengths D B C R O Y G B I V Figure 16.90 ranging from long wavelengths in red color to short wavelengths in violet color passes through a prism, it is split into its constituent colors. This phenomenon is called dispersion. The dispersion of light takes place because the refractive.

index $\mu$ of a medium depends upon the wavelength $\lambda$ of light according to the

\subsection*{2.8.1 Dispersive Powers}

The ratio of the angle of dispersion to the angle of deviation of the mean yellow color, $\delta$, of the ray produced by any prism is called the dispersive power $\omega$ of the material of the prism.
$$\text { Also; }=\omega=\frac{\mu_{v}-\mu_{R}}{\mu-1}$$
where $v \mu, R \mu$ and $\mu$ are the refractive indices of violet, red and mean yellow colors respectively.

\subsection*{2.9 OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS}

Optical instruments are used to assist the eye in viewing an object. Let us first discuss about the human eye and the mechanism through which we see

\section*{1. The Eye}

The eye has a nearly spherical shape of diameter 1 inch each. Following are some of the terms related to the eye.
(a) Cornea - The front portion of the eye is more sharply curved and is covered by a transparent protective membrane called the cornea.
(b) Aqueous humor - Behind the cornea, there is a space filled with a liquid called aqueous humor.
(c) Crystalline lens - The part just behind aqueous humor is called crystalline lens.
(d) Iris - It is the muscular diaphragm between theaqueous humor and lens and is the colored part that we see in the eye.
(e) Pupil - The small hole in the iris is called the pupil.Varying aperture of the pupil controls the amount of
light entering into the eye with the help of iris.
(f) Retina - This is a screen-like structure on which the eye forms an image. The retina contains rods and cones that receive light signal.
(g) Accommodation - When the eye is focused on a distant object, the ciliary muscles are relaxed so that the focal length of the eye lens has its maximum value that is equal to its distance from the retina. The parallel rays that enter into the eyes are focused on the retina, and we see the object clearly. When the eye is focused on a closer object, the ciliary muscles are strained and the focal length of the eye lens decreases. The ciliary muscles adjust the focal length in such a way that the image is again formed on the retina and we see the object clearly. This process of adjusting focal length is called accommodation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-029.jpg?height=448&width=798&top_left_y=275&top_left_x=260)

\section*{2. COMPOUND MICROSCOPE}

The Fig.bellow shows a simplified version of a compound microscope and the ray diagram of image formation. It consists of two converging lenses set coaxially. The one that faces the object is called the objective, and the one that is close to the eye is called the eyepiece or ocular. The objective has a smaller aperture and smaller focal length than the eyepiece. The distance between the objective and the eyepiece can be varied by appropriate screws fixed on the panel of the microscope
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-029.jpg?height=524&width=936&top_left_y=1353&top_left_x=318)

The object is placed at a distance $u_{0}$ from the objective which is slightly greater than its focal length 0 . A real
image and an inverted image are formed at a distance $v_{0}$ on the other side of the objective. This image becomes the object for the eyepiece. For normal adjustment, the position of the eyepiece is adjusted such that the image formed by the objective falls in the focal plane of the eyepiece. Then, the final image is formed at infinity. It is erect with respect to the first image and, hence, inverted with respect to the object. The eye is least strained in this
adjustment as it has to focus the parallel rays coming toward it. The position of the eyepiece can also be adjusted in such a way that the final virtual image is formed at the near point. The angular magnification is increased in this case. The ray diagram in the Fig. 16.98 refers to this case.

The eyepiece acts as a simple microscope effectively used to view the first image. Thus, the magnification by a compound microscope is a two-step process. In the first step, the objective produces a magnified image of the given object. In the second step, the eyepiece produces an angular magnification. The overall angular magnification

\section*{3. TELESCOPES}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-030.jpg?height=545&width=1123&top_left_y=958&top_left_x=252)

The Fig. above shows the construction and working principle of a simplified version of an astronomical telescope.

The telescope consists of two converging lenses placed coaxially. The one that faces the distant object is called the objective, and it has larger aperture and focal length. The other is called the eyepiece, as it is placed closer to the eye and has smaller aperture and focal length. The lenses are fixed in tubes. The eyepiece tube can slide within the objective tube so that the distance between the objective and the eyepiece can be changed

\subsection*{2.10 Defects of vision}

As described earlier, the ciliary muscles control the curvature of the lens in the eye and hence can change the effective focal length of the system. When the muscles are fully relaxed, the focal length is maximum.
muscles are strained, the curvature of the lens increases and the focal length decreases. For clear vision, the image must be formed on the retina. The image distance is, therefore, fixed for clear vision, and it equals the distance of the retina from the eye lens. It is about 2.5 cm for a grown-up person. If we apply the lens formula to the eye, the magnitudes of the object distance, the image distance and the effective focal length satisfy
$$\frac{1}{\mathrm{v}_{0}}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{u}_{0}}=\frac{1}{f} \text { or } \frac{1}{\mathrm{u}_{0}}=\frac{1}{f}-\frac{1}{\mathrm{v}_{0}}$$

Here, $v_{0}$ is fixed, and hence by changing $\square$, the eye is focused on the objects placed at different values of $u_{0}$. We see from Eq. (i) that when $\square$ increases, $u_{0}$ increases, and when $\square$ decreases, $\mathrm{u}_{0}$ decreases. The maximum distance one can see is
$$\frac{1}{\mathrm{u}_{0}}=\frac{1}{f}-\frac{1}{\mathrm{v}_{0}}$$

The common defects of vision are as follows:
a) Myopia or short sightedness: The distant objects are not clearly visible in this defect. The image of a distant object is formed before the retina. The defect can be remedied by using a concave lens
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-031.jpg?height=294&width=654&top_left_y=1566&top_left_x=242)
(A) Defective-eye

(B) Defective-eye

\section*{Example}

A nearsighted man can clearly see the objects up to a distance of 1.5 m . Calculate the power of the lens of the spectacles necessary for the remedy of this defect.

Sol: As the man has near sighted vision, he need to wear concave lens which can form virtual and erect images

The lens should form a virtual image of a distant object at 1.5 m from the lens. Thus, it should be a divergent lens, and its focal length should be -1.5 m . Hence,
$$f=-1.5 \mathrm{~m} \Rightarrow \mathrm{P}=\frac{1}{f}=-\frac{1}{1.5} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}=-0.67 \mathrm{D}$$
b) Hypermetropia or far sightedness: The near objects are not clearly visible in this defect. The image of a near object is formed behind the retina.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-032.jpg?height=377&width=1411&top_left_y=771&top_left_x=262)

This defect is remedied by using a convex lens.
c) Presbyopia: In this defect, both near and far objects are not clearly visible. This is remedied either by using two separate lenses or by using a single spectacle having bifocal lenses.
d) Astigmatism: In this defect, the eye cannot see objects in two orthogonal (perpendicular) directions clearly simultaneously. This defect is remedied by using a cylindrical lens.

\section*{SOUND}

\subsection*{3.1 Introduction}
- Sound is a form of energy, which produces a sensation when we hear it in our ears
- Sound can be produce in number of ways, such as, by plucking, scratching, rubbing, blowing or shaking different objects
- Sound sources are broadly divided into two types namely, natural and man-made.
- Depending on the amount of human intervention, the sound is broadly categorized into these two categories.
- Acoustic instruments :(Guitar, Sitar, Veena), wind (Flute, Shehnai) or percussive (Drums) instruments.
- Electrical instruments use electricity to produce sound.
- Man made voices and voices made by man-made products also produce sound.
- The sound of the human voice is produced because of the vibrations in the vocal cords.

Sound waves are typically characterized by the motion/vibration of particles in the medium and hence known as Waves

Sound waves fall into three categories: longitudinal waves, mechanical waves, and pressure waves. Keep reading to find out what qualifies them as such.

\section*{a) Longitudinal Sound Waves}

A longitudinal wave is a wave in which the motion of the medium's particles is parallel to the direction of the energy transport. Sound waves in air and fluids are longitudinal waves, because the particles that transport the sound vibrate parallel to the direction of the sound wave's travel. If you push a slinky back and forth, the coils move in a parallel fashion (back and forth). Similarly, when a tuning fork is struck, the direction of the sound wave is parallel to the motion of the air particles.

\section*{b) Mechanical Sound Waves}

A mechanical wave is a wave that depends on the oscillation of matter, meaning that it transfers energy through a medium to propagate. These waves require an initial energy input that then travels through the medium until the initial energy is effectively
transferred. Examples of mechanical waves in nature include water waves, sound waves, seismic waves and internal water waves, which occur due to density differences in a body of water. There are three types of mechanical waves: transverse waves, longitudinal waves, and surface waves.

Why is sound a mechanical wave? Sound waves move through air by displacing air particles in a chain reaction. As one particle is displaced from its equilibrium position, it pushes or pulls on neighboring molecules, causing them to be displaced from their equilibrium. As particles continue to displace one another with mechanical vibrations, the disturbance is transported throughout the medium.

\section*{LONGITUDINAL WAVES}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-034.jpg?height=340&width=1516&top_left_y=1071&top_left_x=261)

\section*{TRANSVERSE WAVES}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-034.jpg?height=394&width=1559&top_left_y=1624&top_left_x=245)

\section*{c) Pressure Sound Waves}

A pressure wave, or compression wave, has a regular pattern of high- and low-pressure regions. Because sound waves consist of compressions and rarefactions, their regions fluctuate between low and high-pressure patterns. For this reason, sound waves are considered to be pressure waves. For example, as the human ear receives sound waves
from the surrounding environment, it detects rarefactions as low-pressure periods and compressions as high-pressure periods.

\section*{d) Transverse Waves}

Transverse waves move with oscillations that are perpendicular to the direction of the wave. Sound waves are not transverse waves because their oscillations are parallel to the direction of the energy transport; however sound waves can become transverse waves under very specific circumstances. Transverse waves, or shear waves, travel at slower speeds than longitudinal waves, and transverse sound waves can only be created in solids.

\subsection*{3.2 Characteristics of sound wave}
(a) Wavelength
(b) Amplitude
(c) Time-period
(d) Frequency
(e) Velocity (or Speed)

\section*{a) Wavelength}
- Wavelength is the minimum distance in which a sound wave repeats itself.
- The SI unit for measuring wavelength is metre (m).

\section*{b) Amplitude (a)}

Amplitude of the wave is the magnitude of the maximum disturbance in the medium on either side of the mean value
c) Time-period (t)
- The time required to produce one complete wave (or cycle) is called time-period of the wave.
- The time taken for one complete oscillation is called the time period of the sound wave.
- Its SI unit is second (s).

\section*{d) Frequency}
- The number of complete waves (or cycles) produced in one second is called frequency of the wave.
- The number of such oscillations per unit time is the frequency of the sound wave.
- The SI unit of frequency is hertz (which is written Hz ).
- The frequency of a wave is the reciprocal of its time-period.

Frequency = 1Time period
$\mathrm{F}=1 \mathrm{~T}$
- The faster an object vibrates, i.e. the higher the frequency, the higher the pitch of the sound.

\section*{$3.3 \quad$ Speed of sound}

Speed of sound depends on THREE FACTORS
- Nature of Material/ Medium
- Temperature
- Humidity of Air
a) Nature of material/medium:
- .The speed of sound depends on the nature of material (or medium) through which it travels.
- Sound travels faster in liquids than in gases and faster in solids than in liquids
- Sound travels about 5 times faster in water than in air.
- Speed of Sound in Air: The speed of sound when travelling through air at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is $343.2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ which is equal to $1,236 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$.
- Speed of Sound in Gases:
- The speed of sound in gases is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature (measured in Kelvin)
- The speed of sound is independent of the frequency of the sound wave or the pressure and the density of the medium.
- However, the properties slightly change because none of the gases we find in real life are ideal gases.
b) Temperature:
i. The speed of sound increases with the rise in temperature.
ii. The speed of sound in air room temperature is 344 metres per second (which is written as $344 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ ). This means that sound travels a distance of 344 metres in 1 second through air at the room temperature.

\section*{c) Humidity of the air:}
- Speed of sound increases with the rise in humidity.
- The substance or object through which sound is transmitted is known as medium.
- Sound moves through a medium from the point of the generation to the listener; the sound medium could be solid, liquid, or gas.
- However, sound cannot travel through a vacuum medium.
- The particles of gas, liquid, or solid of gas, liquid, or solid do not travel all the way from the vibrating object to the ear, but rather when the object vibrates, it sets the particles of the medium around it vibrating and so on and so forth
- In other words, the particles of the medium do not travel/move forward, but rather the disturbance is carried forward through one vibrating particle to another.
- When vibrating particles move forward, they push and compress the air in front of it and create a region of high pressure known as compression see the image given below
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-037.jpg?height=768&width=1712&top_left_y=1652&top_left_x=250)
- Further, when the vibrating particles move backwards, it creates a region of low pressure known as rarefaction RR see the image given above
- As the particles move back and forth rapidly, a series of compressions high pressure zone high pressure zone and rarefactions low pressure zone low pressure zone is created in the air; likewise, the sound wave propagates through the medium.
- As shown in the image given above, the lower portion valley of the curve is known as trough and the upper portion peak is known as crest.
- The distance between two consecutive compressions or two consecutive rarefactions is known as the wavelength.
- Wavelength is usually represented by the Greek letter lambda ( $\lambda$ ) and its SI unit is meter mm .
- The number of the compressions or rarefactions that counted per unit time is known as frequency of the sound wave.
- Frequency of the sound wave is commonly represented by v Greek letter, nu Greek letter, nu.
- The SI unit of frequency of the sound wave is hertz Hz.
- The sensation of a frequency that we sense/listen is usually referred as the pitch of a sound.
- The faster the vibration of the sound source, the higher is the frequency and so the higher is the pitch see the image given below
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-038.jpg?height=424&width=1226&top_left_y=1902&top_left_x=290)

Wave shape for a high pitched sound
- Likewise, a high pitch sound has more number of compressions and rarefactions passing the fixed point per unit time.
- The lower the vibration of the sound source, the lesser is the frequency and so the lesser is the pitch see the image given below

\section*{Wave Disturbance}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-039.jpg?height=384&width=1134&top_left_y=632&top_left_x=360)
- Likewise, a lower pitch sound has less number of compressions and rarefactions passing the fixed point per unit time.
- The magnitude of the maximum disturbance in the given medium on either side of the mean value is known as the amplitude of the sound wave.
- Amplitude is commonly represented by the letter A.
- The softness or loudness of a sound is fundamentally determined by its amplitude.
- A sound of single frequency is known as tone.
- The sound, which is created by mixing of several harmonious frequencies, is known as note.
- Note is pleasant in listening.

\section*{Example}

A student standing between two walls shouts once. He hears the first echo after 3 seconds and the next after 5 seconds. Calculate the distance between the walls.

\section*{Solution}

It took $t_{1}=1.5 \mathrm{~s}$ for the sound to reach the 1 st wall and at the same time time, the same sound took $t_{2}=2.5 \mathrm{~s}$ to reach the 2 nd wall. Assuming that the sound travels at $343 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, then let $x_{1}$ be the distance of the person to the 1 st wall and $x_{2}$ be the distance to the 2 nd wall. So the distance between the walls X is
$X=x_{1}+x_{2}=v_{s} t_{1}+v_{s} t_{2}=v_{s}\left(t_{1}+t_{2}\right)$
$=(343 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})(4.0 \mathrm{~s})=1372 \mathrm{~m}$

\section*{Example 2}

A mine-worker stands between two vertical cliffs 400 m from the nearest cliff. The cliffs are x distance apart. Every time he strikes the rock once, he hears two echoes; the first one after 2.5 seconds, while the second follows 2 seconds later. From this information, calculate
a. The speed of the sound in air.
b. The value of x .

\section*{Solution}
1. s
$$=\underline{2 \mathrm{~d}}$$
t
$$=\underline{2} \quad \mathrm{x} \quad 400$$
2. 2(x 400) =
(2.5 +2)s $\mathrm{x}=1120 \mathrm{~m}$

\subsection*{3.4 Controlling Noise in construction sites}
a) Eliminate Noise During Design. One of the best ways to reduce noise exposure is to consider noise in the project design phase. This can be done by choosing equipment that reduces the noise level and by eliminating design flaws that can amplify noise
b) Add Noise Barriers. They block the direct path of sound waves from the source of noise, protecting workers and the community from noise exposure.
c) Use Sound-Absorbing Materials. Sound-absorbing materials can be helpful in reducing construction noise. Materials such as metal, wood and concrete are sound-reflective materials that sound waves bounce off.
d) Choose Less Noisy Equipment. There's no getting around the fact that construction equipment can be loud, but there are ways to choose equipment that is quieter.
e) Optimize Your Current Equipment. If you're looking for ways to reduce the noise levels of your current equipment, there are a few modifications to consider. A popular option is to use acoustical silencers in intake and exhaust systems, such as internal combustion exhaust systems or air conditioning systems.
f) Ensure Proper Saw Cutter Practices. One of the louder pieces of equipment on a construction site is often the concrete saw. You can reduce noise caused by a concrete saw by choosing a blade with the largest number of teeth and a smell width between teeth and choosing a blade with the smallest possible gullets.
g) Offer Personal Hearing Protection for Workers. Protect your workers from the effects of excessive noise by offering them hearing protection devices. There are several methods to determine the noise level on a job site.

\section*{CHAPTER 4 POLYMERS}

\subsection*{4.1 Introduction}

Polymer- are very large molecules made when 100s of monomers join together to form a long chain. It comes from the Greeks poly means many and mers meaning parts.

Monomer: a single type of molecule or atom that has the ability to chemically bond with other molecules in a long chain.

Polymerisation. Any process in which relatively small molecules, called monomers, combine chemically to produce a very large chainlike or network molecule, called a polymer. All plastics are polymers but not all polymers are plastics.

\section*{g) Biodegradable polymers}

They degrade into biomass, water and carbon dioxide as a result of the action of enzymes or living organisms. Under favourable conditions, they can be degraded in a few weeks.Like the previous options, these compounds can be synthetic or natural. The biodegradable polymers properties come from the following sources:
- Renewables of plant origin, such as cellulose, corn and sugarcane;
- Synthesized by bacteria;
- Fossil sources, such as oil,
- Derived from an animal source, such as proteins, chitin and chitosan.

The application of these compounds is made in the production of bags, food packaging, consumer products and options for agriculture. Because of the biodegradation process, these polymers help prevent the accumulation of garbage and, consequently, pollution.

\subsection*{4.5 Disposal of Polymers}

Plastics are widely used but they are difficult to dispose: they either are nonbiodegradable or if they are, they take very long to break down.

There are different ways of getting rid of plastics:
- Landfills - Plastics which are difficult to sort or recycle or that aren't plentiful enough to separate, are usually buried in a landfill.
- Incineration - Waste plastics are burnt in an incinerator.
- Recycling - After sorting, plastics can be recycled in different ways. Plastics can be melted and used to make new objects by remolding. Alternatively, cracking can be used to split plastics into their monomers, from which other plastics or chemicals can be made.

\section*{CHAPTER 5 POLYMERS}

\subsection*{5.1 Introduction}

Polymer- are very large molecules made when 100s of monomers join together to form a long chain. It comes from the Greeks poly means many and mers meaning parts.

Monomer: a single type of molecule or atom that has the ability to chemically bond with other molecules in a long chain.

Polymerisation. Any process in which relatively small molecules, called monomers, combine chemically to produce a very large chainlike or network molecule, called a polymer. All plastics are polymers but not all polymers are plastics.

\section*{CHAPTER 6}

\section*{RADIOACTIVITY}

\subsection*{6.1 Introduction}

Radioactivity or radioactive decay is the spontaneous disintegration of unstable nuclides to form stable ones with the emission of radiation. Unstable nuclides continue to disintegrate until a stable atom is formed.

Alpha ( $\alpha$ ) and beta ( $\beta$ ) particles are emitted and the gamma rays ( $\gamma$ ) accompany the ejection of both alpha and beta particles.The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons.

They are surrounded by negatively charged ions known as electrons.The number of protons is equal to the number of electrons. Both protons and neutrons have the same mass.The weight of an electron is relatively small compared to neutrons and protons. The number of protons in an atom is referred to as the proton number (atomic number) and denoted by the symbol Z.The number of neutrons is denoted by the symbol N . Protons and neutrons are called nucleons since they form the nucleus of an atom.The sum of both the protons and neutrons is called the mass number A or nucleon number. Therefore;
$\mathbf{A}=\mathrm{Z}+\mathrm{N}$ and $\mathrm{N}=\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{Z}$.
The masses of atoms are conveniently given in terms of atomic mass units (U) where (U) is $1 / 12$ th the mass of one atom of carbon- 12 and has a value of $1.660 \times 10-27 \mathrm{~kg}$. Hence the mass of one proton is equal to $1.67 \times 10-27$ and is equal to 1 u . Isotopes are elements with different mass numbers but with equal atomic numbers i.e. uranium with mass numbers 235 and 238.

\subsection*{6.2 Properties of radioactive emissions}

\section*{a) Alpha ( $\alpha$ ) particles}

They are represented as , hence with a nucleus number 4 and a charge of +2 . Properties
1. Their speeds are $1.67 \times 107 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, which is $10 \%$ the speed of light.
2. They are positively charged with a magnitude of a charge double that of an electron.
3. They cause intense ionization hence loosing energy rapidly hence they have a very short range of about 8 cm in air.
4. They can be stopped by a thin sheet of paper, when stopped they capture two electrons and become helium gas atoms.
5. They can be affected by photographic plates and produce flashes when incident on a fluorescent screen and produce heating effect in matter.
6. They are slightly deflected by a magnetic field indicating that they have comparatively large masses.
$${ }_{Z}^{A} X \rightarrow{ }_{Z-1}^{A-4} Y+{ }_{2}^{4} \mathrm{He}$$

\section*{b) Beta (B) particles}

They are represented by meaning that they have no mass but a charge of -1 .

\section*{Properties}
1. Their speeds are as high as $99.9 \%$ or more the speed of light
2. They are deflected by electric and magnetic fields but in a direction opposite to that of alpha particles.
3. Due to their high speed they have a higher penetrative rate than alpha particles (about 100 times more)
4. They can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminium
1. Their ionization power is much less intense about $1 / 100$ th that of alpha particles.

\section*{c) Gamma ( $\boldsymbol{\Upsilon}$ ) particles}

They have very short wavelengths in the order of 10-10 m and below.
$${ }_{Z}^{A} X \rightarrow{ }_{Z-1}^{A} Y+e^{-}+\overline{v_{e}}$$

\section*{Properties}
1. They travel at the speed of light.
2. They have less ionization power than that of both alpha and beta particles
3. They accompany the emission of alpha and beta particles
4. They carry no electric charge hence they are not deflected by both electric and magnetic fields.
5. They have more penetrating power than X-rays

\section*{Example}

\subsection*{6.3 The half-life of a radioactive element}

It is the time taken for a half the number of nuclides initially present in a radioactive sampe to decay.

The number of nuclides remaining undecayed $\mathrm{i}(\mathrm{N})$ is given by:
$$N=N_{O}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{T / t)}$$

Where $N_{O}$ is the original number of the nuclide and $t$ is the half life.
Examples refer to notes.

\section*{Example}

The half-life of $F$ is 11.0 s. If a sample initially contains 5.00 g of $F$, how much $F$ remains after 44.0 s?

\section*{Solution}

If we compare the time that has passed to the isotope's half-life, we note that 44.0 s is exactly 4 half-lives, so we can use Equation with $\mathrm{n}=4$. Substituting and solving results in the following:
$$\begin{gathered}
\text { Amount remaining }=5.00 \mathrm{~g} \times(12)^{4} \\
=5.00 \mathrm{~g} \times 116 \\
=0.313 \mathrm{~g}
\end{gathered}$$

\subsection*{6.4 Applications of radioactivity}
1. Carbon dating - through the identification of carbon-14 and carbon-12 absorbed by dead plants and animals. Scientists can be able to estimate the age of a dead organism. Since carbon is a radioactive element with a half-life of 5,600 years archeologists can be able to estimate the ages of early life through carbon dating.
2. Medicine - radiation is used in the treatment of cancer, by using a radioactive cobalt60 to kill the malignant tissue. Radiations are used in taking x-ray photographs using cobalt-60. Radiations are used to sterilize surgical instruments in hospitals.
Radioactive elements can also be used as tracers in medicine where they determine the efficiency of organisms such as kidneys and thyroid glands.

\section*{3. Biology and agriculture}
- radioactive sources are used to generate different species of plants with new characteristics that can withstand diseases and drought. Insects are sterilized through radiation to prevent the spread of pests and diseases. Potatoes exposed to radiation can be stored for a long time without perishing.
4. Industry - thickness of metal sheets is measured accurately using radiation from radioactive sources. Recently the manufacture of industrial diamonds is undertaken through transmutation.
5. Energy source - in N. America, Europe and Russia nuclear reactors are used to generate electricity.

The amount of fuel used is quite small hence an economical way of generating electricity energy as compared to H.E.P generation.

Nuclear fission; this is the splitting of unstable nuclide when bombarded when hit with a nother stable nuclide.

Nuclear fusion: this is the fusing together of nuclei to form a heavy nucleus.

\section*{CHAPTER 7}

\section*{MOLE CONCEPT}

A mole is a substance which has a vogadros number ( $6 \times 10^{23}$ )

\subsection*{7.1 Definitions of terms.}

\subsection*{7.1.1 The relative atomic mass (RAM)}

The relative atomic mass (RAM) of an atom is the number of times an atom is heavier than one twelfth of a carbon-12 atom. It is calculated by adding together the number of protons and neutrons in an atom.

The atomic mass is usually a whole number unless where an element occurs in a number of isotopes. Here the atomic mass is the average atomic weight of the isotopes in the ratio of their existence.

Example 1. Chlorine exist in two isotopic forms; ${ }^{35} \mathrm{Cl}$ and ${ }^{37} \mathrm{Cl}$ by percentage compositions of $75 \%$ and $25 \%$ respectively. Calculate the relative atomic mass of chlorine.

Every 100 atoms of chlorine there is 75 atoms of ${ }^{35} \mathbf{C l}$ and 25 atoms of ${ }^{37} \mathrm{Cl}$. Total mass of 100 atoms
of chlorine
$$\begin{aligned}
& =75 \times 35+25 \times 37 \\
& =3550
\end{aligned}$$

Average atomic mass
$$\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{3550}{100} \\
& =35.5
\end{aligned}$$

\subsection*{7.1.2 Relative formula mass of a compound (R.F.M):}

To calculate the mass of one mole of a compound, the number of each type of atom in the compound is multiplied by that atoms relative atomic mass and all those numbers added together

This value is called the relative formula mass (or relative molecular mass or molar mass) of a compound

Examples of formula/molecular mass calculations:

\section*{Example 1:}

The compound calcium hydroxide $\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ (ionic)
Relative atomic masses are $\mathrm{Ca}=40, \mathrm{H}=1$ and $\mathrm{O}=16$
$\mathrm{Mr}=40+2 \times(16+1)=74$

\subsection*{7.1.3 Mass}
a) Mass from amount:

The key mathematical equation needed here is -
mass $(\mathrm{g})=$ relative formula mass $(\mathrm{g}$ mol -1$) \times$ amount $(\mathrm{mol})$
Using the the amount multiplied by the relative formula mass gives the mass

\section*{Example}
(i) What is the mass of 0.25 mol of NaCl ?
0.25 mol of $\mathrm{NaCl}=58.5 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}-1 \times 0.25 \mathrm{~mol}$
$=14.63 \mathrm{~g}$

\section*{b) Amount from mass :}

Amount (mol) = mass (g) / relative formula mass (g mol-1.

Using the triangular relationship from above if the amount section is covered over then the mass divided by the relative formula mass gives the amount -

Example 1.

What amount is 117 g of NaCl ?
117 g of $\mathrm{NaCl}=117 \mathrm{~g} / 58$
$5 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}-1=2 \mathrm{~mol}$

Example 2.
What amount is $68.4 \mathrm{~g}^{2}$ of $\mathrm{Al}_{2}(\mathrm{SO} 4)_{2}$ ?

4 g of $\mathrm{Al}_{2}(\mathrm{SO} 4)_{3}=68.4 \mathrm{~g} / 342 \mathrm{~g}$ mol $-1=0.2 \mathrm{~mol}$

\subsection*{7.1.4 Molar mass}

Molar Mass is the mass in grams of 1 mole of a substance. It is numerically equal to its relative atomic mass or its relative formula mass. e.g., One mole of carbon weighs 12 g , 1 mole of oxygen molecule weighs 32 g , and 1 mole of ammonium sulphate weighs 132 g.

\subsection*{7.1.5 Relative formula mass of a compound (R.F.M)}

To calculate the mass of one mole of a compound, the number of each type of atom in the compound is multiplied by that atoms relative atomic mass and all those numbers added together. This value is called the relative formula mass (or relative molecular mass or molar mass) of a compound. Notice that r.m.m, or Mr have no units because they are ratios

The molar mass is obtained from r.f.m, r.m.m, or Mr by simply adding g (grams).
The diatomic molecules of the element's hydrogen $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and chlorine $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ relative atomic masses, $\mathrm{Ar}: \mathrm{H}=1, \mathrm{Cl}=35.5$

Formula masses, Mr , are $\mathrm{H}_{2}=2 \times 1=2, \mathrm{Cl}_{2}=2 \times 35.5=71$ respectively

\section*{Percentage Composition in a Compound:}
1. Calculating \% Composition (from masses of each element) Divide the mass of each element by the total mass of the compound and multiply by 100
2. Calculating \% Composition (from formula)

\subsection*{7.1.6 Molecular formula of a compound:}

The molecular formula for a compound is simply the empirical formulae multiplied by some whole number (1, 2, 3, etc)

Knowing the molar mass of the compound enables the molecular formula of it to be found

Finding Molecular Formulas (when molar mass is known)
Calculate the empirical formula
use the equation : (empirical formula mass) $\times n=$ molar mass
Find value for n : $\mathrm{n}=$ molar mass/empirical formula mass

\subsection*{7.1.7 Formulae: Empirical and molecular}

The empirical formula (E.F) of a compound is the simplest formula which expresses its composition by mass. It does not give the exact number of various atoms present in one formula unit of molecule of a compound.

\section*{Example 16.}

Determine the formula of a lead compound, given that 4.14 g of lead combines with 0.64 g of sulphur and 1.28 g of oxygen. We shall use the 'mole' concept to find the formula of the compound. Proceed as shown in the table below:

Calculations involving Concentration of Solution.
}

\section*{Definitions}
1. The concentration of a substance is the number of moles or the mass of a solute dissolved or contained in a known volume of solution. Usually the concentration of a solution is expressed in either number of grams or number of moles of solute per litre of solution.
2. A standard substance/primary standard is a pure substance whose mass can easily be weighed accurately and is used to standardize others.

\section*{Properties of primary standard}
- Should have high molecular mass to be weighed accurately with little errors
- Should form stable solutions
- It should be stable in air, i.e., it shouldn't be hygroscopic, deliquescent, react with air, easily lose its water of crystallization and/or it should not be volatile.
3. A Standard solution is a solution whose concentration is known, usually expressed in terms of molarity, mole/litre, moles/dm3, or grams/litre.
4. The Molarity is the number of moles of the solute contained in 1 litre, 1000 ml or 1000 cm 3 of Solution.

Example . Calculate the molarities of (a) 7 g of potassium hydroxide KOH , in 250 cm 3
Solution
$$\begin{gathered}
\text { Molarity }=\frac{\text { mass of solute dissolved in one litre }}{\text { molar ( formula ) mass }} \\

\section*{Chemical equations}

A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction in which the reactants and products are denoted by their respective chemical formulae. The reactant side is the part of the chemical equation to the left of the ' $\rightarrow$ ' symbol whereas the product side is the part to the right of the arrow symbol.

Example. 25.0 cm 3 of a solution containing a mixture of sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate require 15.0 cm 3 of 0.5 M HCl using phenolphthalein indicator. Another 25.0 cm 3 of the same mixture required 34.5 cm 3 of the acid using methyl orange indicator. Calculate the concentration of the mixture with respect to: (i) sodium carbonate (ii) sodium hydrogen carbonate per dm3 of solution.

\subsection*{7.2 Redox Reactions}
- Redox reactions are oxidation-reduction chemical reactions in which the reactants undergo a change in their oxidation states. The term 'redox' is a short form of reduction-oxidation. All the redox reactions can be broken down into two different processes - a reduction process and an oxidation process.
- oxidation. This is the loss of electrons and the corresponding increase in the oxidation state of a given reactants.
- Reduction. This is the gain of electrons and the corresponding decrease in the oxidation state of a reactant.
- The oxidation and reduction reactions always occur simultaneously in redox or Oxidation-Reduction reactions.
- oxidizing agents are Electron-accepting species which tend to undergo a reduction in redox reactions. The substance getting reduced in a chemical reaction is known as the oxidizing agent, while a substance that is getting oxidized is known as the reducing agent.
- Reducing agent are electron-donating species which tends to hand over electrons.

Summary of Terms Used in Describing Oxidation-reduction
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Term & Electron change & Oxidation number change \\
\hline Oxidation & Loss of electrons & Increases \\
\hline Reduction & Gain of electrons & Decreases \\
\hline Oxidising agent & Receives electons & Decreases \\

\section*{Illustration detailing the electron transfer between two reactants in a redox reaction Types of Redox Reactions}

The different types of redox reactions are:
i. Decomposition Reaction
ii. Combination Reaction
iii. Displacement Reaction
iv. Disproportionation Reactions

\subsection*{7.2.1 Decomposition Reaction}

This kind of reaction involves the breakdown of a compound into different compounds.
Examples of these types of reactions are:
- $2 \mathrm{NaH} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{H} 2$
- $2 \mathrm{H} 2 \mathrm{O} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H} 2+\mathrm{O} 2$
- $\mathrm{Na} 2 \mathrm{CO} 3 \rightarrow \mathrm{Na} 2 \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO} 2$

All the above reactions result in the breakdown of smaller chemical compounds in the form of $\mathrm{AB} \rightarrow \mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B}$

But, there is a special case that confirms that all the decomposition reactions are not redox reactions.

For example, $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{CaO}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}$

\subsection*{7.2.2 Combination Reaction}

These reactions are the opposite of decomposition reactions and hence involve the combination of two compounds to form a single compound in the form of $\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B} \rightarrow$ $A B$. For example:
- $\mathrm{H}_{2}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HClC}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}$
- $4 \mathrm{Fe}+3 \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$

\subsection*{7.2.3 Displacement Reaction}

In this kind of reaction, an atom or an ion in a compound is replaced by an atom or an ion of another element. It can be represented in the form of $\mathrm{X}+\mathrm{YZ} \rightarrow \mathrm{XZ}+\mathrm{Y}$.

Further displacement reactions can be categorized into

\section*{For example}
$\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}+\mathrm{Zn} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}+\mathrm{ZnSO}_{4}$

\section*{Non-Metal Displacement}

In this type of reaction, we can find a hydrogen displacement and sometimes rarely occurring reactions involving oxygen displacement.

\subsection*{7.2.4 Disproportionation Reactions}

Disproportionation reactions are known as reactions in which a single reactant is oxidized and reduced.

For example: $\mathrm{P}_{4}+3 \mathrm{NaOH}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{NaH}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{2}+\mathrm{PH}_{3}$

Examples of Redox Reactions
A few examples of redox reactions, along with their oxidation and reduction halfreactions, are provided in this subsection.

Example 1: Reaction Between Hydrogen and Fluorine

In the reaction between hydrogen and fluorine, the hydrogen is oxidized, whereas the fluorine is reduced. The reaction can be written as follows.
$$\mathbf{H}_{2}+\mathbf{F}_{2} \rightarrow \mathbf{2 H F}$$

The oxidation half-reaction is: $\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{\rightarrow} \mathbf{2} \mathbf{H}^{+} \mathbf{+} \mathbf{2 e}^{-}$

The reduction half-reaction is: $\mathbf{F}_{2}+\mathbf{2 e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathbf{2 F}^{-}$

The hydrogen and fluorine ions go on to combine in order to form hydrogen fluoride.

\section*{Example 2: Reaction Between Zinc and Copper}

This is a type of metal displacement reaction in which copper metal is obtained when zinc displaces the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ion in the copper sulfate solution as shown in the reaction below.
$\mathrm{Zn}(\mathrm{s})+\mathrm{CuSO}_{4}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{ZnSO}_{4}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{s})$
The oxidation half-reaction can be written as: $\mathbf{Z n} \rightarrow \mathbf{Z n}^{\mathbf{2 +}}+\mathbf{2 e}^{\mathbf{-}}$

The reduction half-reaction can be written as: $\mathbf{C u}^{\mathbf{2 +}}+\mathbf{2} \mathbf{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathbf{C u}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-073.jpg?height=605&width=1429&top_left_y=321&top_left_x=310)

Thus, copper is displaced from the copper sulfate solution by zinc in a redox reaction.
Example 3: Reaction between Iron and Hydrogen Peroxide
$\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ is oxidized to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ by hydrogen peroxide when an acid is present. This reaction is provided below.
$\mathbf{2 F e ^ { 2 + }} \boldsymbol{+} \mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{2}} \boldsymbol{+} \mathbf{2} \mathbf{H}^{+} \boldsymbol{\rightarrow} \mathbf{2 F e ^ { 3 + }} \boldsymbol{+} \mathbf{2} \mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}$
Oxidation half-reaction: $\mathbf{F e}^{\mathbf{2 +}} \rightarrow \mathbf{F e}^{\mathbf{3 +}}+\mathbf{e}^{-}$
Reduction half-reaction: $\mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{+ 2} \mathbf{e}^{-} \mathbf{\rightarrow 2} \mathbf{O H}^{-}$
Thus, the hydroxide ion formed from the reduction of hydrogen peroxide combines with the proton donated by the acidic medium to form water.

\subsection*{7.3 Oxidizing and Reducing Agents}
a) Important Oxidizing Agents
- Molecules are made up of electronegative elements. Eg: $\mathbf{O}_{2}, \mathbf{O}_{3}$, and $\mathrm{X}_{2}$ (halogens)
- Compounds containing an element that is in the higher oxidized state. Eg: $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}, \mathrm{~K}_{2} \mathrm{Cv}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}, \mathrm{HNO}_{3}, \mathrm{KClo}_{3}$
- Oxides of metals and non-metals. $\mathbf{E g}: \mathbf{M g O}, \mathbf{C u O}, \mathbf{C r O}_{\mathbf{3}}, \mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{4}} \mathbf{O}_{\mathbf{1 0}}$
- Fluorine is the strongest oxidizing agent.

\section*{b) Important Reducing Agents}
- All metals, for example $\mathrm{Na}, \mathrm{Zn}, \mathrm{Fe}, \mathrm{Al}$
- A few non-metals such as C, Hydrogen, S, P
- Hydracids, for example $\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{HBr}, \mathrm{HI}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$
- Few compounds contain an element in the lower oxidation state. Examples include: $\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}, \mathrm{FeSo}_{4}, \mathrm{SnCl}_{2}, \mathrm{Hg}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}$
- Metallic hydrides including $\mathrm{NaH}, \mathrm{LiH}, \mathrm{CaH}_{2}$, etc.
- Organic compounds like HCOOH

Lithium is the strongest reducing agent in the solution, and Cesium is the strongest reducing agent in the absence of water. The substances which act as oxidizing as well as reducing agents are $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{SO}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{3}, \mathrm{HNO}_{2}, \mathrm{NaNO}_{2}$

Examples of the reduction potentials of some species are +2.866 V for $\mathrm{F}_{2}$ and -0.763 V for $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$.

\subsection*{7.4 Applications of Redox Reaction}

Redox reactions have numerous industrial and everyday applications. A few of these applications of redox reactions are listed below.

\subsection*{7.4.1 Redox Reaction in Electrochemistry}

The battery used for generating DC current uses a redox reaction to produce electrical energy.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-075.jpg?height=717&width=1169&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=332)

Batteries or electrochemical cells used in our day-to-day life are also based on redox reactions. For example, storage cells are used in vehicles to supply all the electrical needs of the vehicles.

\subsection*{7.4.2 Redox Reaction in Combustion}

An explosion is a fast form of combustion; hence explosion can be treated as a redox reaction. Even the space shuttle uses redox reactions. The combination of ammonium perchlorate and powdered aluminium inside the rocket boosters gives rise to an oxidation-reduction reaction.

\subsection*{7.4.3 Quantitative Analysis:}

The redox reactions form the basic principle of the redox titrations carried out for the quantitative analysis of various substances. Redox titrations are carried out to find the concentration of any electrically charged species present in the sample solution. These are done by titrating the unknown substance against a standardized titrant whose concentration is already known to us. In this type of titration, the solution containing the unknown substance is kept in the bottom flask and the solution of the known titrant is filled in the burette. The solution from the burette is allowed to fall drop-wise in the bottom flask (containing the unknown substance and an indicator) till the indicator
changes the colour of the solution in the flask, indicating that the end point of the titration has reached. At the endpoint, the volume of the standardized titrant is noted down. This volume is equal to the volume of unknown substances required to neutralize the standardized titrant. The volume remaining in the sample solution is back-calculated by the total amount of the sample taken and thereby we can calculate the concentration of the unknown substance present in that solution. These reactions are quite useful in the pharmaceutical industry.

\subsection*{7.4.4 Real-Life Uses of Redox Reaction}
- Production of some important chemicals is also based on electrolysis which in turn is based on redox reactions. Many chemicals like caustic soda, chlorine, etc., are produced using redox reactions.
- Oxidation-Reduction reactions also find their application in sanitizing water and bleaching materials.
- The surfaces of many metals can be protected from corrosion by connecting them to sacrificial anodes, which undergo corrosion instead. A common example of this technique is the galvanization of steel.
- The industrial production of cleaning products involves the oxidation process.
- Electroplating is a process that uses redox reactions to apply a thin coating of a material on an object. Electroplating is used in the production of gold-plated jewellery.
- Extraction of Metals: The redox reactions find a great deal of application in the extraction industry to extract metals or minerals from the natural ores. Metals usually exist in an oxidized state in nature (due to their long-term exposure to the oxygen present in the air surrounding them). Hence, they need to be reduced in order to extract the required metal out of them. This is done in the industry on a large scale with the help of a suitable reducing agent, depending on the metal or ore which is to be refined. For example, iron is extracted from the oxidized ore
of ferric oxide in a large blast furnace in the iron extracting and refining industries using coke as a reducing agent. The reaction takes of iron metal extraction from its oxidized natural ore takes place as follows:
- Reduction
$$\mathrm{Fe} 2 \mathrm{O}_{3}+3 \mathrm{C} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Fe}+3 \mathrm{CO}$$
- Oxidation
- Similarly, Aluminium is extracted from its ore, aluminium oxide $\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{OH}) 3$
- by means of reduction. Other metals extracted in the same manner include magnesium, sodium, calcium, potassium, lithium, and many others.

- Energy Levels and Electron Arrangements

\section*{Energy Levels}
- Are definite orbits in an atom that the electrons occupy.
- The energy levels are numbered $1,2,3$ starting with the one closest to the nucleus.
- Electrons occupying the same energy level have approximately the same amount of energy.
- Each energy level can only accommodate a given maximum number of electrons.
- Maximum number of electrons per energy level
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Energy level & Maximum number of electrons \\
\hline $1^{\text {st }}$ & 2 \\
\hline $2^{\text {nd }}$ & 8 \\
\hline $3^{\text {rd }}$ & 8 (only for the first 20 elements) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Hydrogen}
- It has only one electron and thus this electron occupies the first energy level.
- Since the first energy level is not yet full, hydrogen does not have the second energy level;
- The electron arrangement of hydrogen is thus 1.

\section*{Helium}
- Helium is atomic number 2 and has only two electrons, which occupy the first energy level.
- The first energy level is thus completely full, but since there are no other electrons lithium also has only one energy level;
- The electron arrangement is thus 2 .

\section*{Chlorine}
- Chlorine has atomic number 17 and thus has 17 electrons;
- The first two electrons occupy the fist energy level which is thus completely filled up;
- The remaining 15 electrons occupy the second energy level, which can however accommodate only 8 to be completely filled up;
- Thus the remaining 7 electrons move to the third energy level; which needs 8 to be completely filled up;
- Since the third energy level is not yet full chlorine does not have a fourth energy level;
- The electron arrangement is thus 2.8.7.

\subsection*{8.3 Electron Arrangement.}
- Refers to the distribution of electrons in the energy levels of an atom.

- It is in order of their relative atomic masses.

\section*{Design of the Modern Periodic Table}

It has vertical columns called groups and horizontal rows called periods.

\subsection*{8.5 Groups:}
- Are the vertical columns of a periodic table.
- Are eight in number; and numbered in capital Roman numerals I all through to VIII.
- Note: group VIII is also called group zero because the elements have little tendency to gain or lose electrons during chemical reactions
- Between group 2 and group 3 is a group of elements called the transition metals;

\subsection*{8.6 Bonding:}

A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ion

\subsection*{8.6.1 Ionic chemical bonding}

Ionic bonding is a type of chemical bonding that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, or between two atoms with sharply different electronegativities

Consider a specific case of ionic bonding between real elements, such as sodium and chlorine.
(a) Before an electron is transferred.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-087.jpg?height=334&width=895&top_left_y=725&top_left_x=832)
(b) After electron transfer.

Figure 1: Ionic bonding in sodium chloride (NaCl) -.
- Because of the attraction of the oppositely charged $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions they attract and form a bond called ionic or electrovalent bond.

\section*{a) Structure of sodium chloride}
- The structure of sodium chloride contains numerous sodium and chloride ions in equal proportions.
- The electrical attraction electrostatic attraction resulting from their opposite charges constitutes the ionic bond.
- The ions arrange themselves into a rigid solid shape called a crystal.
b) Properties of ionic compounds
1. Ionic compounds are electrolytes (solutions that conduct electric current) when they are in solution or molten form.
2. They have high melting points non-volatile.
3. They are generally soluble in water.
4. Ionic compounds are insoluble in organic liquids like benzene or propanone.
5. They are usually crystalline solids.

\section*{Shows the centre of a sodium ion, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$}
Shows the centre of a chloride ion, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$
- Sodium and chloride ions crystallise in a pattern (crystal lattice) forming a cube.
- In an end face of the cube a $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion occupies the centre, with six $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions, spaced equally between them.
- The ions form a giant ionic structure.
- The attraction forces between the ions are strong and therefore the ions are not free to move but they vibrate within a given space.
- Consequently the melting point of sodium chloride is high. In solid form, it is a nonconductor of electricity.
- when sodium chloride is melted sodium ions and chloride ions separate and thus their forces of attraction are greatly reduced.
- When an electric current is applied the ions in molten sodium chloride are free to move thereby conducting electricity.
- The positive ions formed as a result of loss of one or more electrons are called cations, and their positive charges are equal to the number of electrons lost.
- Likewise, the negative ions formed as a result of gain of one or more electrons are called anions and their negative charges are equal to the number of electrons gained.
- The number of electrons lost from, or added to, the outermost energy level of the atom of an element during ionic bonding is equal to the combining power (valency) of that element.
- Only the outermost energy level electrons are involved in ionic bonding.
- The number of ions involved must balance the valency requirements of elements as shown in the following examples.

\subsection*{8.6.2 Covalent chemical bonding}
- Sharing a pair of electrons forms a covalent bond.

\section*{Examples}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-089.jpg?height=405&width=564&top_left_y=1641&top_left_x=336)

\section*{Figure 6: Hydrogen molecule}
- The shared pair is the covalent bond. It is attracted by the proton of each H atom.
- Sometimes the shared pair is represented by a short line $(-) \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{H}$.

\section*{a) Chlorine molecule}

A molecule of chlorine, $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$, contains two chlorine atoms linked by a covalent bond.
- These two chlorine atoms have each an electronic arrangement of 2.8.7 with 17 protons.
- If no other element is available from which electrons may be obtained to make these two atoms have a noble gas electronic structure such as argon (2.8.8), a shared pair of electrons is formed.
- Each chlorine atom contributes, one electron to the shared pair.
- This idea of sharing can be shown in a diagram

\section*{c) Properties of covalent compounds}
1. They are non-electrolytes (don't conduct electric current) when in molten or solution form.
2. They have usually low melting and boiling points.
3. They are often insoluble in water.
4. They are usually soluble in organic solvents like benzene and propanone.
5. Most of them are gaseous at room temperature or volatile liquids.

\subsection*{8.6.3 Co-ordinate (Dative) bonding}
- A co-ordinate bond also called a dative bond is a covalent bond (a shared pair of electrons) in which both electrons come from only one atom.
- One of the atoms possesses a lone pair of electrons, i.e. a pair of electrons not bonded to any atom.
- This lone pair is shared with an atom or an ion that needs them to build up, or complete an electron octet or duplet and therefore attain stability.
- For example ammonia molecule which possesses such a lone pair of electrons is shown in Figure 9.
- This lone pair can be donated to hydrogen ion $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$from an acid to form the ammonium ion, $\mathrm{NH}^{+} 4$.
- The nitrogen atom is said to be a "donor" and the hydrogen ion is said to be an acceptor.

Structures of covalent compounds

\section*{a) Giant atomic structures}

\section*{i. Diamond}
- In diamond, the carbon atoms are bonded to each other by covalent bonds in interlacing tetrahedrons throughout the structure.
- This produces a crystal which is a giant atomic structure.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-092.jpg?height=410&width=741&top_left_y=1627&top_left_x=340)

\section*{ii. Graphite}
- In graphite, the carbon atoms are covalently bonded to each other in hexagonal rings arranged in parallel planes, one on top of the other, with the layers joined by weak van der Waals forces.
- The layers are able to slip over each other and this makes graphite soft and slippery
(See Figure 11 below).
- The layers form a giant atomic structure.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_10_75c6aa8c5b1c76d0d29fg-093.jpg?height=657&width=1150&top_left_y=414&top_left_x=268)

\section*{Figure 11: Graphite structure}
- In the parallel atomic layers (plates) of carbon atoms in graphite, only three valency electrons per atom are used in bond formation.
- Therefore, some electrons in graphite are free delocalised and allow it to conduct electricity.

\section*{iii. Silicon (IV) oxide}
- Silicon is another good example involving atom to atom covalent bonding to form a giant atomic structure.
- Silicon(IV) oxide is insoluble in water and does not conduct electricity.
- The bonds between the oxygen - silicon atoms are strong and therefore silicon(IV) oxide has a high melting point.

\section*{iv. Simple molecular structures}
- Substances such as iodine, hydrogen, chlorine, nitrogen and carbon(IV) oxide exist as molecules.
- The atoms in the molecule are held by strong covalent bonds.
- However, the molecules are held together by weak van der Waals forces.
- Therefore when heated they easily vaporise or melt.
- An example is iodine structure.
- On heating iodine, it sublimes because the weak van der Waals forces are easily broken.

Note: Molecules have discrete units with a definite number of atoms which are covalently bonded.
- Molecular structures (involving atoms or molecules) have very large indefinite number of atoms in them.

\section*{v. Metallic bonding}
- The outermost energy level electrons in metals are relatively few.
- When the atoms of metals are closely packed, each metal atom loses its outer electron(s) which form a sea of free electrons (delocalised mobile electrons).
- The resulting metal positive ions are embedded in the sea of electrons.
- There is attraction between the ions and electrons.
- This upsets the regularity within the crystal and interferes with the ease of movements of electrons within the crystal.
- It is just like comparing soldiers matching on parade and others matching through a city crowd.

\subsection*{8.6.4 Hydrogen bonding}
- For example in a water molecule( $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ), oxygen atom attracts electrons more than hydrogen.
- Therefore the water molecule is represented like this: $\mathrm{H}^{\delta+}-\mathrm{O}^{\delta-}-\mathrm{H}^{\delta+}$ The water molecules can combine together using the polar ends.
- The attraction between the polar end of the hydrogen ( $\delta+$ ) and the polar end of the oxygen ( $\delta-$ ) is called hydrogen bond.
- Therefore water has hydrogen bonds between molecules.
- Had it not been the presence of hydrogen bonds, water would be in gaseous state at room temperature and pressure.

\subsection*{8.6.5 Types of bonds across period three}

\section*{a) Oxides of elements in period three}
- Oxides of sodium, magnesium and aluminium form giant ionic structures.
- They have therefore high melting points. Sodium oxide is soluble in water, while magnesium oxide is only slightly soluble.
- When these two oxides dissolve they form basic solutions. They are therefore basic oxides.
- Sodium oxide reacts explosively with dilute mineral acids while magnesium oxide reacts at a reasonable rate to form salt and water only.
- Aluminium oxide is insoluble in water. It however reacts with both dilute mineral acid explosively and dilute alkalis to form salts.
- This oxide is said to be amphoteric, that is, it has both acidic and basic properties.
- Silicon(IV) oxide forms giant atomic structure, while phosphorus(V) oxide, sulphur(IV) oxide, chlorine(VII) oxide $\left(\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{7}\right)$ form molecular structures.
- The oxides of phosphorus and sulphur react with water to form phosphoric(V) acid and sulphurous acid respectively.
- They are therefore acidic oxides. Silicon(IV) oxide does not react with water or dilute alkali; but it reacts with concentrated alkalis to form salt and water only.
- Therefore it is regarded as an acidic oxide.
- The oxides of silicon, phosphorus, sulphur and chlorine have no effect on acids.

\section*{b) Chloride of elements in period three}
- Chlorides of sodium and magnesium form giant ionic structures which have high melting and boiling points.
- These two chlorides are soluble in water.
- The chlorides of aluminium, silicon, phosphorus and sulphur are simple molecular structures.
- These four chlorides react with water with evolution of heat to form acidic solutions and also give off fumes of hydrogen chloride gas.
- Some of the hydrogen chloride gas dissolves in water to form hydrochloric acid.

\subsection*{8.7 Applications}

\section*{Diamond}
(i) Jewellery, it has a shiny lustre when polished.
(ii) Glass cutter and drilling because it is very hard.

\section*{Graphite}
(i) As a lubricant, because it is soft.
(ii) Reinforcement of metals and broken bones.
(iii) As electrodes because it conducts electricity.

\section*{Aluminium}
(i) Overhead electrical cables.
(ii) In making of cooking utensils.
(iii) Wrapping material.
(iv) Silvering of mirrors and different types of reflectors.
(v) Aluminium paint.

For example, let us consider aluminium:
(i) It is a conductor of electricity. It is lighter than copper.
(ii) It is a good conductor of heat. It resists corrosion and has a low density.
(iii) It is soft and malleable.
(iv) It does not tarnish and is a very good reflector of light.
(v) It is a light metal.
(vi) The paint of aluminium is normally applied on iron or steel to prevent corrosion or rusting.

Bond Force determines the elastic modulus (or Young's modulus) of a material (how stiff a material is).

Similarly, stronger bonds will enable a material to withstand higher temperatures before the bonds break and the material melts or softens. Alternatively, at room temperature, solids are formed for materials with large bonding energies, gases are favoured for materials with low bonding energies, and liquids for materials with intermediate energies

\section*{CHAPTER 9}

\section*{WATER HARDNESS.}

\subsection*{9.1 Introduction}

Water which form lather easily with soap is said to be soft while water which do not form lather easily with soap is said to be hard. Hardness of water is caused by the presence of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ions.Ca2+ and $\mathrm{Mg} 2+$ ions react with soap to form an insoluble grey /white suspension/precipitate called Scum/curd. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ions in water come from the water sources passing through rocks containing soluble salts of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ e.g. Limestone or gypsum.

\subsection*{9.2 Types of water hardness.}

Temporary hardness of water
Permanent hardness of water

\subsection*{9.3 Temporary hardness of water}

Temporary hardness of water is caused by the presence of dissolved calcium hydrogen carbonate $/ \mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2}$ and magnesium hydrogen carbonate $/ \mathrm{Mg}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2}$.

When rain water dissolve carbon(IV) oxide from the air it forms weak carbonic(IV) acid i.e. $\mathrm{CO}_{2(\mathrm{~g})}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(\mathrm{l})} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3(\mathrm{aq})}$

When carbonic (IV) acid passes through limestone/dolomite rocks it reacts to form soluble salts i.e.

In limestone areas; $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{CaCO}_{3(\mathrm{~s})} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2}(\mathrm{aq})$
In dolomite areas; $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{MgCO}_{3(\mathrm{~s})} \rightarrow \mathrm{Mg}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2}$ (aq)
(b) Permanent hardness of water

Permanent hardness of water is caused by the presence of dissolved calcium sulphate(VI)/CaSO ${ }_{4}$ and magnesium sulphate(VI)/MgSO ${ }_{4}$ Permanent hardness of water is caused by water dissolving $\mathbf{C a S O}_{\mathbf{4}}$ and $\mathbf{M g S O}_{\mathbf{4}}$ from ground rocks.

Hardness of water can be removed by the following methods

\subsection*{9.3.1 Removing temporary hardness of water}
(i) Boiling/heating.

Boiling decomposes insoluble calcium hydrogen carbonate/ $\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right) 2$ and magnesium hydrogen carbonate $/ \mathrm{Mg}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right) 2$ to insoluble $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{MgCO}_{3}$ that precipitate away. i.e

\section*{Chemical equation}
$\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right) 2_{(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{CaCO}_{3(\mathrm{~s})}+\mathrm{CO}_{2(\mathrm{~g})}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(\mathrm{l})}$
$\mathrm{Mg}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right) 2_{(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{MgCO}_{3(\mathrm{~s})}+\mathrm{CO}_{2(\mathrm{~g})}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(\mathrm{l})}$
(ii) Adding sodium carbonate (IV) /Washing soda.

Since boiling is expensive on a large scale , a calculated amount of sodium carbonate decahydrate / $\mathbf{N a}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{C O}_{\mathbf{3}} . \mathbf{1 0} \mathbf{H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{O}$ precipitates insoluble $\mathrm{Ca} 2+_{(\mathrm{aq})}$ and $\mathrm{Mg} 2+_{(\mathrm{aq})}$ ions as carbonates to remove both temporary and permanent hardness of water . This a double decomposition reaction where two soluble salts form an insoluble and soluble salt. i.e.
(i) With temporary hard water

\section*{Chemical equation}
$\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}(\mathrm{aq})+\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})$
$\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{Mg}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{MgCO}_{3}{ }_{(\mathrm{s})}$

\section*{Ionic equation}
$\mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }^{2-}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}{ }_{(\mathrm{s})}$
$\mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }^{2-}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{MgCO}_{3}{ }_{(\mathrm{s})}$
(ii) With permanent hard water

\section*{Chemical equation}
$\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{MgSO}_{4}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{MgCO}_{3}{ }_{(\mathrm{s})}$
$\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{CaSO}_{4(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{MgCO}_{3(\mathrm{~s})}$

\section*{Ionic equation}
$\mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }^{2-}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{CaCO}_{3}{ }_{(\mathrm{s})}$
$\mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }^{2-}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{MgCO}_{3}{ }_{(\mathrm{s})}$

\section*{(iii) Adding calcium (II)hydroxide/Lime water}
- Lime water/calcium hydroxide removes only temporary hardness of water from by precipitating insoluble calcium carbonate (IV).

\section*{Chemical equation}
$\mathrm{Ca}(\mathrm{OH})_{2(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(\mathrm{l})}+2 \mathrm{CaCO}_{3(\mathrm{~s})}$
- Excess of Lime water/calcium hydroxide should not be used because it dissolves again to form soluble calcium hydrogen carbonate(IV) causing the hardness again.
(iv) Adding aqueous ammonia
- Aqueous ammonia removes temporary hardness of water by precipitating insoluble calcium carbonate (IV) and magnesium carbonate (IV)

\section*{Chemical equation}
$2 \mathrm{NH}_{3(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{32(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})\right.$
$2 \mathrm{NH}_{3(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{Mg}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right)_{2(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{MgCO}_{3}(\mathrm{~s})$
(v) Use of ion-exchange permutit
- This method involves packing a chamber with a resin made of insoluble complex of sodium salt called sodium permutit.
- The sodium permutit releases sodium ions that are exchanged with $\mathrm{Mg} 2+$ and $\mathrm{Ca} 2+$ ions in hard water making the water to be soft. i.e.
$\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{X}_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}^{+}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{CaX}_{(\mathrm{s})}$
$\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{X}_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}^{+}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{MgX}_{(\mathrm{s})}$
- Hard water containing Mg and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
- $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions replace $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to make the water soft.
- When all the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions in the resin is fully exchanged with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Ng}^{2+}$ ions in the permutit column, it is said to be exhausted.
- Brine /concentrated sodium chloride solution is passed through the permutit column to regenerated/recharge the column again.

\section*{(vi) Deionization /demineralization}
- This is an advanced ion exchange method of producing deionized water.
- Deionized water is extremely pure water made only of hydrogen and oxygen only without any dissolved substances.
- Deionization involve using the resins that remove all the cations by using:
- A cation exchanger which remove /absorb all the cations present in water and leave only $\mathbf{H}^{+}$ions.
- An anion exchanger which remove /absorb all the anions present in water and leave only $\mathbf{O H}^{-}$ions.
The $\mathrm{H}^{+}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}$ neutralize each other to form pure water.

\section*{Chemical equation}
$\mathrm{H}^{+}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{(\mathrm{l})}$
When exhausted the cation exchanger is regenerated by adding $\mathrm{H}^{+}{ }_{\text {(aq) }}$ from sulphuric (VI)acid/hydrochloric acid.

When exhausted the anion exchanger is regenerated by adding $\mathrm{OH}^{-}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}$ from sodium hydroxide.

\subsection*{9.3.2 Advantages of hard water}

Hard water has the following advantages:
- $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}{ }_{(\mathrm{aq})}$ in hard water are useful in bone and teeth formation.
- Is good for brewing beer.
- Contains minerals that cause it to have better /sweet taste.
- Animals like snails and coral polyps use calcium to make their shells and coral reefs respectively.
- Processing mineral water.

\subsection*{9.3.3 Disadvantages of hard water}
- Waste a lot of soap during washing before lather is formed.
- Causes stains/blemishes/marks on clothes/garments.
- Causes fur on electric appliances like kettle ,boilers and pipes form decomposition of carbonates on heating. This reduces their efficiency hence more/higher cost of power/electricity.
