                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">a) Point Load (concentrated load)</h3>
                        <p>A point load is a force that is applied to a concentrated point on the support. An example would be a person standing at the free end of a diving board. Concentrated loads are more likely to cause bending. Below are images of a real life experiment of both load types mentioned as well as load placement, showing how those factors affect deflection</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">b) Uniformly distributed load</h3>
                        <p>A uniform distributed load is a force that is applied evenly over the distance of a support. For the least amount of deflection possible, this load is distributed over the entire length of the support. An example would be a shipping crate on a forklift. In construction, UDLs are preferable over point loads. Under an evenly distributed load the possibility of a support bending and/or failing are significantly reduced when compared to a point load situation..</p>

                        <p>For example, the ground reaction forces on the tires of a car can be considered as concentrated loads to forces (Fig. 3.32). Another example is the load of a person walking on a tightrope.</p>

For the least amount of deflection possible, this load is distributed over the entire length of the support. An example would be a shipping crate on a forklift.

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">c) uniformly varying load.</h3>
                        <p>A uniformly varying load is also called the triangular load which starts with zero intensity at one end of the beam and varies linearly to the other end of the beam. This variation of load comes under the nonuniform distribution of loads over the beam. In such conditions, the reaction on each support will be different, having lower values at the end that consist of zero intensity of loading.</p>

                        <p>This is the study of motions of bodies moving in a circular path.<br>
                        When the motion of the body in the circular path is with uniform velocity it is called uniform circular motion. When it is in uniform velocity, the direction of motion at any point is along the tangent to the circle at that point. If the body is set free, it would move in the direction of the tangent at that point.</p>

                        The angle covered or swept or turned by the radius vector in one second is known as angular velocity. SI Unit of angular velocity is radian / second (rad s-1).

                        <p>Curved track is to be considered as a part of the circular path. Consider a motor car moving along a curved road. Now two forces are acting on the car, one is the weight of the car acting downward and second is the normal reaction acting upward. In addition to these two forces, a horizontal centripetal force should act on the car for safe negotiation of curved motion. This force is supplied by the pressure exerted by the road on the tyres of the car towards inner side. According to Newton's third law of motion, the tyres exert an equal and opposite pressure on the road towards the outer side. Hence there must be a frictional force between the road and the tyres.</p>
